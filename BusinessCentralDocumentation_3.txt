# Calculate Dates for purchases

If you want to have items in inventory on a certain date, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can automatically calculate the date on which you must order them. 

The result is the date on which you can pick the items that you ordered.  

If you specify a requested receipt date on a purchase order line, the calculated order date is the date on which you must place the order. The date on which the items will be available for picking displays in the **Expected Receipt Date** field.  

If you don't specify a requested receipt date, the date you expect to receive the items is based on order date on the line. 

The receipt date is also the date when the items will be available for picking.  

> [!TIP]
> By default, many of the date fields this article mentions are hidden on purchase order lines. If a field isn't available, you can add it by personalizing the page. For more information, see [Personalize Your Workspace](ui-personalization-user.md).

## Calculating with a requested receipt date

If there's a requested receipt date on the purchase order line, that date is the basis for the following calculations:  

- requested receipt date - lead time calculation = order date  
- requested receipt date + inbound whse. handling time + safety lead time = expected receipt date  

If you specify a requested receipt date on a purchase order line, that date is assigned to new lines as you create them. You can change or remove the date on the lines.  

> [!NOTE]
> If your process is based on backward calculation, for example, if you use the requested receipt date to get the order date, we recommend that you use date formulas that have fixed durations, such as "5D" for five days or "1W" for one week. Date formulas without fixed durations, such as "CW" for current week or CM for current month, can result in incorrect date calculations. For more information about date formulas, see [Work with Calendar Dates and Times](ui-enter-date-ranges.md).

## Calculating without a requested receipt date

If you enter a purchase order line without a requested receipt date, the **Order Date** field on the line shows the date in the **Order Date** field on the purchase order header. This date is either the date you entered or the work date. The dates are then calculated for the purchase order line, with the order date as the starting point, as follows:  

- order date + lead time calculation = planned receipt date  
- planned receipt date + inbound whse. handling time + safety lead time = expected receipt date  

If you change the order date on the line, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] recalculates the other dates.  

## Default values for lead time calculation

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses the date formula in the **Lead Time Calculation** field on the purchase order line to calculate the order and expected receipt dates.  

You can manually specify the date formula on lines. Otherwise, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will use the formulas that are defined on the following pages in this order of priority:

1. Item/Vendor Catalog
2. Item Card
3. Stockkeeping Unit Card
4. Vendor Card

# Add Comments to Cards and Documents

You can add extra information to G/L accounts, customers cards, or sales orders to communicate exceptions or special agreements to other users.
Practically all cards and document have a **Comments** action, which opens the **Comment Sheet** page where you can write or read comments. On documents, you can also add comments to individual lines.

Comments on ongoing documents are transferred to the related posted document. For example, a comment on a sales order is transferred to a resulting posted sales shipment.

In addition, you can specify if you want comments to be transferred from one type of document to another resulting type of document, such as from a sales order to a sales invoice. You do this in the **Sales & Receivables** and the **Purchases & Payables** pages respectively.

> [!NOTE]
> Comments are not printed or output to reports or externally-facing documents.

The following describes how to add a comment to an item card. The steps are similar for all other cards and documents, except on document lines, the **Comments** action is placed on a lines action menu.

## To add a comments to an item card

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the relevant item card.
3. Choose the **Comments** action.
4. On the **Comment Sheet** page, enter any text, and then choose the **OK** button.

# Restructure Warehouses
You may want to restructure your warehouse with new bin codes and new bin characteristics. You will not undertake this kind of activity very often, but situations can occur where a reclassification is necessary to achieve or maintain a more efficient operation. For example:  

- You might want to switch to bin codes that support the use of automatic data capture, for example, with hand-held devices.  
- The warehouse may have purchased a new rack system that gives new possibilities in item storage.  
- The company may have altered its item assortment and moved the warehouse to a new physical location to accommodate this change.  

If your warehouse is set up to use bins but not directed put-away and pick, restructure your warehouse by creating the new bins that you want to use in the future.  

## To restructure a basic warehouse that uses bins only  
1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Locations**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  On the **Warehouse** FastTab, set the **Default Bin Selection** field to **Last-Used Bin**.  
3.  Move all the contents of your current bins to the new bins that you have just created.  

    1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Item Reclassification Journal**, and then choose the related link.  
    2.  Select a journal line, and then choose the **Get Bin Content** action.  
    3.  On the **Bin Content** FastTab, set filters in the **Location Code**, **Bin Code**, and **Item No.** fields to specify the content that you want to move.  
    4.  Choose the **OK** button to fill a journal line.  
    5.  In the **New Bin Code** field, select the bin to which the items should be moved.  
    6.  Repeat steps b through e for all bin content that you want to move.  
    7.  Choose the **Post** action.  

You have now emptied the bins where the items used to be. The default bins for your items have now been changed to the new bins.  

## To restructure an advanced warehouse that uses directed put-away and pick  

1.  Create the new bins that you want to use in the future. For more information, see [Create Bins](warehouse-how-to-create-individual-bins.md).  
2.  Move all the contents of your current bins to the new bins that you just created.  

    1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Warehouse Reclassification Journal**, and then choose the related link.  
    2.  For the bins where no real movement of items is involved, create a line for each of your current bins in the **Warehouse Reclassification Journal** with the old bin code, **From Bin Code**, and the new bin code, **To Bin Code**.  
    3.  If some of the movements involve actual physical movements that you want employees to perform, use **Movement Worksheets** to prepare movement instructions instead of using the warehouse reclassification journal. For more information, see [Move Items in Advanced Warehouse Configurations](warehouse-how-to-move-items-in-advanced-warehousing.md).  

3.  When the old bins are emptied, reclassify them as **QC** type bins to ensure that they are not included in item flows.  

    1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Locations**, and then choose the related link.  
    2.  Select the line with the location, and then choose the **Bins** action.  
    3.  On the **Bins** page, in the **Bin Type Code** field, enter **QC** for each of the old bins that you emptied in step 3 in the previous procedure.  

You have now removed the bins from the warehouse flow, and reclassified them as QC bins. QC bins have none of the activity fields on the **Bin Types** page selected and are therefore not considered by the item flow. For more information, see [Set Up Bin Types](warehouse-how-to-set-up-bin-types.md).  

## To delete a bin  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Locations**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Select the location where you want to delete bins. Choose the **Bins** action.  
3.  Select the lines for the bins that you want to delete.  
4.  Choose the **Delete** action.  

If you choose the **Yes** button, the bin is deleted for use in the future, but the bin code in all warehouse entries remains the same.  

If you want to rename a bin so that all records associated with the bin are also renamed, including bin contents, warehouse activity lines, registered warehouse activity lines, warehouse worksheet lines, warehouse receipt lines, posted warehouse receipt lines, warehouse shipment lines, posted warehouse shipment lines, and warehouse entries, you can do so on the **Bins** page.  

## To rename a bin and change the bin code in all records  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Locations**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Select the location where you want to rename a bin or change the bin code, and then choose the **Bins** action.  
3.  Select the bin that you want to change and enter a new bin code in the **Code** field.  
4.  Choose the **Yes** button.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  If you choose **Yes** and there are many entries concerning this bin, for example, because you have not deleted warehouse documents for some time, it may take some time to rename all the records. Therefore, if you use this method, consider running the batch job **Delete Registered Whse. Documents** before you start the renaming process. Also note that the only documents that are deleted in this batch job are put-aways, picks, and movements.  
>   
>  If you are renaming a receiving bin or a shipping bin, all the posted receipts or shipments that refer to the bin in question are renamed.

# About Finished Production Order Costs

Finishing the production order is an important task in completing the costing lifecycle of the item that is being produced. Final costs, including variances in a standard cost environment, actuals in a FIFO, Average, or LIFO cost environment, are calculated using the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job, which allows for financial reconciliation of the costs of item production. For a production order to be considered for cost adjustment, the status must be **Finished**. It is therefore critical that upon completion, the status of a production order is changed to **Finished**.  

## Example

In a standard cost environment, when you consume material to produce an item, stated simply, the cost of the item plus labor and overhead go into WIP. When the item is produced, WIP is reduced by the amount of the standard cost of the item. Typically, these costs do not net to zero. So that these costs can net to zero, you must run the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job, noting that only production orders with the status of **Finished** will be considered for adjustment.

# View Test Reports Before Posting
When you are ready to post a document, such as an order, invoice, or a credit memo, you can test the document to ensure that no issues exist that will block the posting.

> [!NOTE]  
>   The following procedure is about testing before posting a purchase document. The functionality works in the same way for sales documents.

## To print a test report before posting a purchase invoice
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Invoices**, and then select the related link.
2. Open the purchase invoice that you want to test.
3. Choose the **Test Report** action.  

All parts of the purchase invoice are tested, and the result is presented in a report. If the report indicates any errors or missing information, then you must correct the problem before posting the purchase invoice.

# Get started creating report layouts

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes many built-in layouts that you can use on your reports. Other layouts might be added as part of extensions. In addition, you can create your own report layouts, either from scratch or based on an existing layout.

> [!NOTE]
> You can also use report layouts to add content to email messages. Report layouts can help save time and ensure consistency by reusing the same content when you communicate with your customers. Only custom report layouts of the **Word** type can be used with email. You can't use layouts of the **RDLC** with email. Learn more in [Set up reusable email texts and layouts](admin-how-setup-email.md#set-up-reusable-email-texts-and-layouts).

## Overview of report layouts

It can be helpful to think of a report layout as a file that is imported and assigned to a report. You manage all layouts in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in basically the same way, regardless of the layout type. Usually, you work from the **Report Layouts** page. The layouts differ mainly in the way that you design them. Each layout is designed by using the software that the layout is built on, such Word, Excel, or SQL Server Report Builder.

The process of setting up a layout for a report involves three or four basic tasks.

1. Choose the layout type.
2. Export a copy of an existing layout so that you can use it as a starting point.
3. Make changes to the layout file in the appropriate application.
4. Add the new layout file to the report.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You can modify or replace only user-defined layouts. You can't modify or replace *extension layouts*, which are layouts that originate from an extension. On the **Report Layouts** page, you can tell whether a layout is a user-defined layout or an extension layout by looking in the **Extension** column. For an extension layout, the **Extension** column shows information about the source extension. For a user-defined layout, the **Extension** column is blank.
>
> Learn more about the difference between extension layouts and user-defined layouts in [Layout sources](ui-manage-report-layouts.md#layout-sources).

## Get started

Depending on your situation, the actual tasks vary. Use the following table to get started.

| What do you want to do? | Learn more |
|---|---|
| Figure out the best layout type to use for my situation. | [Decide what type of layout you want](#decide) |
| Create a new layout for a report, either from scratch or based on a copy of an existing layout. | [Create a new layout](#create) |
| Make changes to the layout that a report uses. | [Modify a layout](#modify) |
| Replace the current layout file that a report uses with a new version of the layout file. | [Replace a layout](#replace) |
| Change the current layout that a report uses to another layout. | [Set the layout used by a report](ui-set-report-layout.md) |

| Validate a layout. | [Validate a layout](#validate) |
| View information about a layout. | [Get information about a layout](#get-information-about-a-layout) |
| Delete a user-defined layout. | [Delete a layout](#delete) |

## <a name="decide"></a>Decide what type of layout you want

The first task when you create a layout is to decide which [layout type](ui-manage-report-layouts.md#layout-types) you want. You can choose among the **Word**, **Excel**, and **RDLC** layout types. Your choice depends on how you want the generated report to look. It also depends on your knowledge of the software that is used to create the layout, such as Word, Excel, and SQL Server Report Builder.

* **Excel** layouts are generally the easiest to create and modify because summarizing data, adding graphics, and styling are common Excel features. However, not all reports have datasets optimized for Excel layouts. Aggregations and complex calculations work best with **RDLC** or **Word** layouts. The same applies to documents.
* If you're making only style changes, such as changes to the font type, size, and colors, a **Word** layout is a good choice.
* The capabilities for adding and rearranging data fields are more advanced in **Word** and **RDLC** layouts than in **Excel** layouts.
* **Word** and **RDLC** layouts are good choices for printable reports.
* The design concepts for **Word** and **RDLC** layouts are similar, but each has specific features that affect the report's appearance in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The same report might look different depending on whether a **Word** or **RDLC** layout is used.

## <a name="create"></a>Create a new layout

There are different methods for creating a new layout. The easiest methods involve using a copy of an existing layout. For these methods, you can either save the existing layout directly as a copy, or export it and then import it into a new layout. Another, more advanced method is to create a layout from scratch by using a blank layout.

### [Copy a layout](#tab/copy)

Copying an existing layout lets you quickly create a new, identical layout that you can customize.

1. [!INCLUDE[open-report-layouts-page](includes/open-report-layouts-page.md)]

   The **Report Layouts** page lists all layouts for all reports.
1. Select the layout that you want to copy for the new layout, and then select the **Edit Info** action.

    If you select an extension layout, you're asked whether you want to edit a copy of it. Select **Yes**.

    > [!TIP]
    > To find the layout that you want, use the search field, the filter pane, and column sorting.

1. In the **Layout Name** field, enter a new name.
1. Turn on the **Save Changes to Copy** toggle, if it isn't already on.
1. Select **OK**.

    The new layout appears on the **Report Layouts** page.

If needed, you can change the settings in your new layout. To learn more, go to [Modify a layout](#modify).

    [!INCLUDE[file-upload](includes/file-upload.md)]

    The selected file is uploaded to the layout, and you're returned to the **Report Layouts** page.

To view how the report looks with the new layout, select the layout in the list, and then select **Run Report**.

### [Create from blank](#tab/blank)

When you create a new layout from a blank layout, you must design it completely. The layout file provides all the report fields that you can add and arrange as you require.

1. [!INCLUDE[open-report-layouts-page](includes/open-report-layouts-page.md)]
1. Select any layout that is for the same report that you want use the new layout for.
1. Select **New**.
1. In the **Add New Layout for a Report** dialog box, set the following fields.

    | Field | Description | Mandatory |
    |---|---|---|
    | Report ID | Enter the ID that is assigned to the report. | Yes |

# Create new companies in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the container for business data that belongs to a business unit or legal entity is referred to as a *company*. When you sign up for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you're given a demonstration company and an empty company, *My Company*. Switching between the companies is easy: just go to **My Settings** and move to the other company. But you can also create new companies in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] depending on your business needs.  

> [!NOTE]
> To create a new company, you must be assigned to the **Super** permission set.

When you create a new company, an assisted setup guide helps you get the basics in place. Then, you can import data from your legacy system or another company in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

[!INCLUDE [about-ui-learn](includes/about-ui-learn.md)]

## Choose the right template

If you decide to add a company to your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can use the **Create New Company** assisted setup guide to get started. The setup guide is available from the **Companies** page and from the lookup in the **Company** field on the **My Settings** page.  

The setup guide offers three templates and a blank option:

- **Evaluation - Sample Data**  
    Create a company that's similar to the demonstration company with sample data and setup data. This type of company is available to you without switching to a 30-day trial period, which the other types do.  
- **Advanced Evaluation - Complete Sample Data**
    Create a company with the Advanced functionality scope, which has everything you need to evaluate the product for companies with advanced processes. This type of company is available to you without switching to a 30-day trial period, which the other types do.
- **Production - Setup Data Only**  
    Create a company that's similar to **My Company**, with setup data such as a chart of accounts, payment methods, and financial report definitions, but without sample data. You can use this company for a 30-day trial period.
- **Create New - No Data**  
    Create a blank company without setup data. You can use this company for a 30-day trial period.  

If you want to get started easily with a new company, choose **Production - Setup Data Only** and then import your own business data, such as customers, items, and vendors. Choose the **New** template if you want to set up everything from scratch. In that case, you can use the **Company Setup** assisted setup guide to help you get started with essential setup data.  

> [!NOTE]  
> When you create a new company, it takes a few minutes before you can access it in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The setup status on the **Companies** page shows when the new company is ready for you. Then, you can switch to the new company by using **My Settings**.  

During your 30 day trial, you can create any number of new companies, but they're only available during your trial. For more information, contact your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] partner. See also the [Dynamics 365 Business Central trial FAQ](trial-faq.md) article.  

Your administrator can learn more about trials and subscriptions [here](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/trials-subscriptions).  

## Copy a company

On the **Companies** page, you can use the **Copy** action to create a second company based on the contents of an existing company. Copying a company is useful, for example, when you want to test a company without disrupting production data.

> [!Important]
> Don't use the Copy action to take a backup of a company. To take a backup, start by exporting the database as a .bacpac file. For more information, see [Exporting Databases](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/tenant-admin-center-database-export) in the development and administration help.

[!INCLUDE [email-copy-company](includes/email-copy-company.md)]

[!INCLUDE [dataverse-copy-company](includes/dataverse-copy-company.md)]

## Set up the company

When you sign in to a new company, the **Company Setup** assisted setup guide helps you get started. The guide asks for information about your business, such as the address, bank details, and inventory costing method. This information forms the basis for many areas in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] so you don't have to set them up manually.  

For example, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes your company address in invoices and other documents and your bank information in payments. The costing method is used to calculate prices and inventory valuation.  

After the basics are in place, you can set up the remaining core areas. Then, you're ready to add business data, such as customers and vendors. For more information, see [Set Up [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]](setup.md).  

## Companies and environments

[!INCLUDE [company_environment](includes/company_environment.md)]

For more information, see [Switching to Another Company or Environment](ui-organization-switch.md). For more information about environments, see [Understanding the Infrastructure of Business Central Online](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/tenant-environment-topology) (in English only).  

## Changing a company's name

After you create a company, you can't change its name. You can, however, change its **Display Name**, which is text that shows for the company throughout the application.  

> [!TIP]
> You can rename a company if you're using [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises.

## Add Contoso Coffee

The Contoso Coffee app provides demonstration data to help you explore the advanced capabilities of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Find the app in AppSource, and install it in an empty company, for example a company in a sandbox environment. For more information, see [Introduction to Contoso Coffee Demo Data](contoso-coffee/contoso-coffee-intro.md).

# Process sales return orders  

If you need more control of the sales return process, such as warehouse documents for the item handling, or a better overview when receiving items from multiple sales documents with one sales return, then you can create sales return orders. A sales return order automatically issues the related sales credit memo and other return-related documents, such as a replacement sales order, if needed.

In addition to the original posted sales invoice, you can apply the sales credit memo or sales return order to other sales documents, for example another posted sales invoice because the customer is also returning items delivered with that invoice.

## Create a sales return order based on one or more posted sales documents  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Return Orders**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. Fill in the fields on the **General** FastTab as necessary.
4. On the **Lines** FastTab, fill the lines manually, or copy information from other documents to fill the lines automatically:

    - Use the **Get Posted Document Lines to Reverse** function to copy one or more posted document lines from one or more posted documents. This function always exactly reverses the costs from the posted document line. This function is described in the following steps.    
    - Use the **Copy from Document** function to copy an existing document to the return order. Use this function to copy the entire document. It can be either a posted document or a document that isn't yet posted. This function only enables exact cost reversing when the **Exact Cost Reversing Mandatory** check box is selected on the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page.  

5. Choose the **Process** action, then choose the **Get Posted Document Lines to Reverse** action.
6. At the top of the **Posted Sales Document Lines** page, select the **Show Reversible Lines Only** check box if you want to see only lines that have quantities that haven't yet been returned. For example, if a posted sales invoice quantity has already been returned, you might not want to return that quantity on a new sales return document.

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  This field only works for posted shipments and posted invoice lines, not for posted return or posted credit memo lines.

    At the left side of the page, the different document types are listed, and the number in brackets shows the number of documents available of each document type.

7. In the **Document Type Filter** field, select the type of posted document lines you would like to use.  
8. Select the lines that you would like to copy to the new document.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  If you use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd> to select all lines, all lines within the filter you have set are copied, but the **Show Reversible Quantity Only** filter is ignored. For example, suppose you have filtered the lines to a particular document number with two lines, one of which has already been returned. Even if the **Show Reversible Quantity Only** field is selected, if you select <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd> to copy all lines, both lines are copied, instead of only the one that has not yet been reversed.  

9. Choose the **OK** button to copy the lines to the new document.  

    The following processes occur:  

    -   For posted document lines of the type **Item**, a new document line is created that is a copy of the posted document line, with the quantity that hasn't yet been reversed. The **Appl.-from Item Entry** field is filled in as appropriate with the number of the item ledger entry of the posted document line.  

    -   For posted document lines that aren't of the type **Item**, such as item charges, a new document line is created that is a copy of the original posted document line.  

    -   Calculates the **Unit Cost (LCY)** field on the new line from the costs on the corresponding item ledger entries.  

    -   If the copied document is a posted shipment, posted receipt, posted return receipt, or posted return shipment, the unit price is calculated automatically from the item card.  

    -   If the copied document is a posted invoice or credit memo, the unit price, invoice discounts, and line discounts from the posted document line are copied.  

    -   If the posted document line contains item tracking lines, the **Appl.-from Item Entry** field on the item tracking lines is filled with the appropriate item ledger entry numbers from the posted item tracking lines.  

     When you copy from a posted invoice or posted credit memo, application copies any relevant invoice discounts and line discounts as valid at the time of posting that document from the posted document line to the new document line. Be aware, however, that if the **Calc. Inv. Discount** option is activated on the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page, then the invoice discount will be newly calculated when you post the new document line. The line amount for the new line might therefore be different than the line amount for the posted document line, depending on the new calculation of the invoice discount.  

     > [!NOTE]  
     >  If part of the quantity of the posted document line has already been reversed or sold or consumed, a line is created for only the quantity that remains in inventory or that has not been returned. If the full quantity of the posted document line has already been reversed, a new document line is not created.  
     >   
     >  If the flow of goods in the posted document is the same as the flow of goods in the new document, a copy of the original posted document line in the new document is created. The **Appl.-from Item Entry** field is not filled in because, in this case, exact cost reversing is not possible. For example, if you use the **Get Posted Document Lines to Reverse** function to get a posted sales credit memo line for a new sales credit memo, only the original posted credit memo line is copied to the new credit memo.  

10. On the **Sales Return Order** page, in the **Return Reason Code** field on each line, select the reason for the return.
11. Choose the **post** action.

## To create a replacement sales order from a sales return order
You might decide to compensate a customer for an item that you have sold them by replacing the item. You can make a replacement with the same item or a different item. This situation could occur if you mistakenly shipped the wrong item to the customer, for example.  

1. On the **Sales Return Order** page for an active return process, on an empty line, make a negative entry for the replacement item by inserting a negative amount in the **Quantity** field.  
2. Choose the **Move Negative Lines** action.
3. On the **Move Negative Sales Lines** page, fill in the fields as necessary.
4. Choose the **OK** button. The negative line for the replacement item is deleted from the sales return order and inserted in a new **Sales Order** page. For more information, see [Sell Products](sales-how-sell-products.md).

## To create return-related documents from a sales return order
You can have replacement sales orders, purchase return orders, and replacement purchase orders created automatically during the sales return process. This is useful, for example, in situations where you want to handle items with warranties provided by vendors.

1. On the **Sales Return Order** page for an active return process, choose the **Create Return-Related Documents** action.
2. In the **Vendor No.** field, enter the number of a vendor if you want to create vendor documents automatically.
3. If a returned item must be returned to the vendor, select the **Create Purch. Ret. Order** check box.
4. If a returned item must be ordered from the vendor, select the **Create Purchase Order** check box.
5. If a replacement sales order must be created, select the **Create Sales Order** check box.

## To create a restock charge
You might decide to charge your customer a restock fee to cover the physical handling costs of returning an item. This could occur if the customer mistakenly ordered the wrong item or changed their mind after receiving the item you sold them, for example.

You can post this increased cost as an item charge in a credit memo or a return order and assign it to the posted shipment. The following describes this for a sales return order, but the same steps apply to a sales credit memo.

1. Open the **Sales Return Order** page for an active return process.
2. On a new line, in the **Type** field, select **Charge (Item)**.  
3. Fill in the fields as for any item charge line. For more information, see [Use Item Charges to Account for Additional Trade Costs](payables-how-assign-item-charges.md).  

When you post the sales return order, the restock charge is added to the relevant sales entry amount. In this way, you can maintain accurate inventory valuation.

# Setup Best Practices: Supply Planning
Supply planning is a critical business area. When set up and used correctly, supply planning helps a company avoid stock out and reduce both ordering costs and inventory costs.  

 It is not possible to prescribe one optimal setup of all planning fields as this varies from company to company because of business variables, such as market situation and business strategy. However, there are best practices for selecting options in items cards and global setup fields to help get the company started with timely and cost-effective inventory flows.  

 The following topics provide best-practice information about how to set up selected planning fields that are key to inventory and supply planning.

# Design Details: Item Tracking and Reservations

Simultaneous use of reservation and specific item tracking is uncommon, because they both create a coupling between supply and demand. Except for situations where a customer or production planner requests a specific lot, it rarely makes sense to reserve inventory items that already carry item tracking numbers for specific application. Although it is possible to reserve items that require specific item tracking, special functionality is needed to avoid availability conflicts between order processors that request the same item-tracked items.  
  
The concept of Late Binding ensures that a nonspecific reservation of a serial number or a lot number remains loosely coupled until posting. At posting time, the reservation system can reshuffle nonspecific reservations to ensure that fixed application is possible against the serial or lot number that is actually picked. Meanwhile, the serial or lot number is made available for specific reservation in other documents that request that particular serial or lot number.  
  
A nonspecific reservation is one in which the user does not care which specific item is picked, and a specific reservation is one in which the user does care.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
> The Late Binding functionality relates only to items that are set up with specific item tracking, and it applies only to reservations against inventory, not against inbound supply orders.  
  
Reservation of item tracking numbers falls into two categories, as shown in the following table.  
  
|Reservation|Description|  
|-----------------|---------------------------------------|  
|Specific|You select a specific serial or lot number when you reserve the inventory item from a demand, such as a sales order.<br /><br /> This is a regular reservation. It is a rigid link between supply and demand that both carry serial or lot numbers. **Note:**  The demand carries serial or lot numbers. <br /><br /> For example, you want to reserve a can of blue paint from Lot A, because the customer requests it. A can of blue paint from Lot A is shipped to the customer.|  
|Nonspecific|You do not select a specific serial or lot number when you reserve the inventory item from a demand, such as a sales order.<br /><br /> This is a state that is imposed on a reservation entry for serial or lot numbers that are not selected specifically. **Note:**  The demand does not carry serial or lot numbers. <br /><br /> For example, you want to reserve a can of blue paint from any lot for your sales order. A can of blue paint from a random serial or lot number is shipped to the customer.|  
  
The main difference between specific and nonspecific reservation is defined by the existence of serial or lot numbers on the demand side, as shown in the following table.  

| Type            | Supply                | Demand                   |
|-----------------|-----------------------|--------------------------|
| **Specific**    | Serial or lot number. | Serial or lot number.    |
| **Nonspecific** | Serial or lot number. | No serial or lot number. |
  
When you reserve inventory quantities from an outbound document line for an item that has item tracking numbers assigned and is set up for specific item tracking, the **Reservation** page leads you through different workflows depending on your need for the serial or lot numbers.  
  
## Specific Reservation  
When you choose **Reserve** from the outbound document line, a dialog box appears that asks you if you want to reserve specific serial or lot numbers. If you choose **Yes**, then a list is displayed with all the serial or lot numbers that are assigned to the document line. The **Reservation** page opens after you select one of the serial or lot numbers, and you can then reserve among the selected serial or lot numbers in a typical fashion.  
  
If some of the specific item tracking numbers that you are trying to reserve are held in nonspecific reservations, then a message at the bottom of the **Reservation** page informs you how many of the total reserved quantity are held in nonspecific reservations and whether they are still available.  
  
## Nonspecific Reservation  
If you choose **No** in the dialog box that appears, the **Reservation** page opens and allows you to reserve among all serial or lot numbers in inventory.  
  
Because of the structure of the reservation system, when you place a nonspecific reservation on an item-tracked item, the system must select specific item ledger entries to reserve against. Because the item ledger entries carry the item tracking numbers, the reservation indirectly reserves specific serial or lot numbers, even though you did not intend to. To handle this situation, the reservation system tries to reshuffle nonspecific reservation entries before posting.  
  
The system actually still reserves against specific entries, but then it uses a reshuffling mechanism whenever there is specific demand for the lot or serial number in the nonspecific reservation. This can be the case when you post a demand transaction, such as a sales order, consumption journal, or transfer order, for the serial or lot number, or when you try to specifically reserve the serial or lot number. The system reshuffles the reservations to make the lot or serial number available to the demand or to the specific reservation, thereby placing a different lot or serial number in the nonspecific reservation. If there is insufficient quantity in inventory, the system reshuffles as much as possible, and you receive an availability error if there is still insufficient quantity at the time of posting.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  On a nonspecific reservation the lot number or serial number field is blank in the reservation entry that points at the demand, such as the sale.  
  
## Reshuffle  
When a user posts an outbound document after picking the wrong serial or lot number, other nonspecific reservations are reshuffled to reflect the actual serial or lot number that is picked. This satisfies the posting engine with a fixed application between supply and demand.  
  
For all supported business scenarios, reshuffling  is possible only against positive item ledger entries that carry reservation and serial or lot numbers but without defined serial or lot numbers on the demand side.  
  
## Supported Business Scenarios  
The Late Binding functionality supports the following business scenarios:  
  
* Entering a specific serial or lot number on an outbound document with nonspecific reservation of a wrong serial or lot number.  
* Reserving a specific serial or lot number.  
* Posting an outbound document with nonspecific reservation of a serial or lot number.  
  
### Entering Serial or Lot Numbers on an Outbound Document with Wrong Nonspecific Reservation  
This is the most common of the three supported scenarios. In this case, the Late Binding functionality ensures that a user can enter a serial or lot number, which is actually picked, on an outbound document that already has a nonspecific reservation of another serial or lot number.  
  
For example, the need arises when an order processor has first made a nonspecific reservation of any serial or lot number. Later when the item is actually picked from inventory, the picked serial or lot number must be entered on the order before it is posted. The nonspecific reservation is reshuffled at posting time to ensure that the picked serial or lot number can be entered without losing the reservation and to ensure that the picked serial or lot number can be fully applied and posted.  
  
### Reserve Specific Serial or Lot Numbers  
In this business scenario, Late Binding functionality ensures that a user who is trying to reserve a particular serial or lot number that is currently nonspecifically reserved can do so. A nonspecific reservation is reshuffled at the time of reservation to free the serial or lot number for the specific request.  
  
The reshuffle happens automatically, but embedded Help is displayed at the bottom of the **Reservation** page and shows the following text:  
  
**XX of the Total Reserved Quantity are nonspecific and may be available.**  
  
In addition, the **Nonspecific Reserved Qty.** field shows how many reservation entries are nonspecific. By default, this field is not visible to users.  
  
### Posting an Outbound Document with Nonspecific Reservation of Serial or Lot Numbers  
This business scenario is supported with Late Binding functionality that enables fixed application and outbound posting of what is actually picked by reshuffling another nonspecific reservation of a serial or lot number. If reshuffling is not possible, then the following standard error message appears when the user tries to post the shipment:  
  
**Item XX cannot be fully applied.**

# Handling inventory and manufacturing costs

Although much of the cost accounting functionality is expressed in underlying processes with no user interaction, such as entry application and automatic cost adjustment, many fields, pages, and reports are aimed at users who directly or indirectly manage the cost of items or operations.  

 Assigning item charges to purchase documents is an example of an indirect cost accounting task. Updating the unit cost of assembly or production BOM item is an example of a more direct cost accounting task.  

 The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the articles that describe them.   

|**To**|**See**|

|Periodically or automatically update the unit cost of one or multiple items to forward any cost changes from inbound entries, such as those for purchases or production output, to the related outbound entries, such as consumption or transfers.|[Adjust Item Costs](inventory-how-adjust-item-costs.md)|  
|Get insight into average cost dynamics to make pricing decisions or to track cost fluctuations caused by data entry errors.|[Register New Items](inventory-how-register-new-items.md)|  
|Create a manufacturing item's standard cost by entering the three cost elements: material cost, capacity cost, and subcontractor cost.|[About Calculating Standard Cost](finance-about-calculating-standard-cost.md)|

# Sign up for a free Dynamics 365 Business Central trial

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers a free trial. There are two ways to access the trial version, depending on your location. If you are in a country where Microsoft offers official localization, you can follow one path. If you are in a country where localization is handled by partners, you'll need to follow a different path. Explore the different types of localization [here](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/compliance/apptest-countries-and-translations). After a quick sign-up, you'll have access to many of the app's key features. The trial allows you to test the app with sample data. If you want to try out things with your own data, you'll switch to a free 30-day trial. [Learn more about Business Central features](across-business-functionality.md).  

## Start the trial in Microsoft-based localizations 

You can find your free [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] trial on the **[Dynamics 365 Business Central product](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics-365/products/business-central)** page. You just need to follow the steps and you'll get trial localized version tailored for your location. If you want eventually to try different localization, you can do it in the sandbox. 

<!--## To sign up for the trial-->

[!INCLUDE [trial-get](includes/trial-get.md)]

## Start with the trial in location with partner-based localizations  

In countries where Microsoft doesn't offer built-in localization, obtaining a localized version by default isn't possible due to localization being managed by partners. Consequently, Microsoft can only provide the standard base app, typically without localization or translation. To avoid confusion not offering all local requirements and the language, we have different path of getting trial version, so you can have full local experience.  

You can get your trial version following these steps:

1. You must run "Find your partner" on [Microsoft web site](https://partner.microsoft.com/partnership/find-a-partner) or ask local Microsoft office for advice. 
2. Microsoft can help you find a partner for you or you might have already found a partner based on your experience. 
3. You might offer your partner for the trial version and then partner goes to CSP.  
   1. Finds or adds customer tenant.   
   2. Assigns the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Trial SKU in CSP. 
   3. Assigns the localization and translation, and eventually assigns translated demo data to the created tenant. 
   4. Sends customer link to the environment.   
   5. The test trial environment will be accessible. 

> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft doesn't oversee how partners set up the trial environment or what specific elements are included. While Microsoft offers recommendations, partners have the flexibility to implement them in their own way. Using a trial version from one partner doesn't obligate you to purchase a license from them, and you can always choose to switch partners at any time.  

## What to try

Your trial environment includes the same features as the paid version. The links below guide you through some of the key features.

- [Overview of business functionality](across-business-functionality.md)  
- [Get started](ui-get-ready-business.md#get-started)  
- [Get productive](ui-work-product.md)  
- [Quick starts](quick-start-business-central.md)  

## Get started with a subscription

Each time you sign in during the trial period, a notification in a blue bar at the top displays the time remaining. If you decide to subscribe, find a [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] partner.

# Column definitions in Financial Reporting

Use column definitions to specify the columns to include in a report. For example, you can design a report layout to compare net change and balance for the same period this year and last year. You can have up to 15 columns in a column definition. For example, multiple columns are useful for displaying budgets for 12 months with a column that shows the total.

## Create a new column definition

To create a new column definition, follow these steps:

1. On the **(Financial Report) Column Definitions** page, choose the **New** action.
1. Provide a unique name for the definition.
1. In the **Description** field, provide a descriptive name for the definition. This description provides context when you use the definition, but doesn't show on the report.
1. Provide an internal description for the definition.

## Edit the content of a column definition

To edit the content of a column definition, follow these steps.

> [!NOTE]
> Printed, previewed, and saved versions of a financial report display a maximum of five columns. In contrast, if a financial report is only meant for analysis on the **Financial Report** page, you can create as many columns as you want.

1. On the **(Financial Report) Column Definitions** page, select the definition, and then choose the **Edit Column Definition** action.
1. On the **Column Definition** page, create a row for each column of financial data that should show in the financial report. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
1. Choose **OK**.

> [!TIP]
> Open the **Financial Report** page from time to time to verify that the new column definition works as intended.

## Built-in column definitions

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides sample column definitions that can help you to quickly get started setting up finance reports that suit your needs.

<!-- update this when we release the new templates in 24.1
| Column definition code | Description | How to use this column definition | 
| ------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------ | 
| TBA 1 | TBA 1 | TBA 1 |
| TBA 2 | TBA 2 | TBA 2 |
| TBA 3 | TBA 3 | TBA 3 |
| TBA 4 | TBA 4 | TBA 4 |
-->

## Example: Create a column definition to calculate percentages

You might want to include a column in a financial report to calculate percentages of a total. For example, if you have rows that break down sales by dimension, you might want a column to indicate the percentage of total sales in each row.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 2.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Financial Reports**, then choose the related link.
1. On the **Financial Reports** page, select a financial report.  
1. Choose the **Edit Financial Report** action to set up a financial report row to calculate the total on which the percentages are based.  
1. Add a line immediately above the first row for which you want to display a percentage.  
1. Fill in the fields on the line as follows: 
    1. In the **Totaling Type** field, enter **Set Base for Percent**. 
    1. In the **Totaling** field, enter a formula for the total that the percentage is based on. For example, if row 11 contains the total sales, enter **11**.  
1. Choose the **Edit Column Definition** action to set up a column.  
1. Fill in the fields on the line as follows. 
    1. In the **Column Type** field, select **Formula**. 
    1. In the **Formula** field, enter a formula for the amount you want to calculate a percentage for, followed by the percentage sign (%). So, if column number N contains the net change, enter **N%**.  
1. Repeat steps 4 through 7 for each group of rows you want to break down by percentage.

## Comparing accounting periods using period formulas

Your financial report can compare the results of different accounting periods, such as the past month versus the same month last year. To do that, open the **Column Definition** page, and personalize it by adding the **Comparison Period Formula** field as a column. Learn more at [Personalize Your Workspace](ui-personalization-user.md). You can then set that field to a period formula.  

An accounting period doesn't need to match the calendar. However, each fiscal year must have the same number of accounting periods, although each period can be different in length.  

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses the period formula to calculate the duration of the comparison period in relation to the period represented by the date filter on the report. The comparison period is based on the period of the start date of the date filter. The following table shows the abbreviations for period specifications.

| Abbreviation | Description                                                                           |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| P            | Period.                                                                                |
| LP           | Last period of a fiscal year, half-year, or quarter.                                   |
| CP           | Current period of a fiscal year, half-year, or quarter. Use CP in formulas to set the period that starts or ends the formula. For example, FY\[1..CP\] denotes the time from the beginning of the current fiscal year to the current period.|
| FY           | Fiscal year. For example, FY\[1..3\] denotes the first quarter of the current fiscal year. |

Examples of formulas:

| Formula | Description |
|-----|-----|
| \<Blank\>       | Current period. |
| \-1P            | Previous period.            |
| \-1FY\[1..LP\]  | Entire previous fiscal year.                  |
| \-1FY           | Current period in previous fiscal year.       |
| \-1FY\[1..3\]   | First quarter of previous fiscal year.        |
| \-1FY\[1..CP\]  | From the beginning of the previous fiscal year to the current period in the previous fiscal year, including both periods. |
| \-1FY\[CP..LP\] | From the current period in previous fiscal year to the last period of the previous fiscal year, including both periods.   |

To calculate by regular time periods, enter a formula in the **Comparison Date Formula** field instead. For example, if the field is set to -1Y, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] compares to the same period one year earlier.

> [!NOTE]
> It isn't always obvious which periods you're comparing because you can set a date filter on a report that spans dates that are different than the accounting periods in your chart of accounts. So, if you create a financial report where you want to compare this period to the same period last year, set the **Comparison Date Formula** field to **-1FY**. Then, run the report on **February 28th** and set the date filter to **January and February**. As a result, the financial report compares January and February this year to January last year, which is the only completed accounting period of the two for last year.  

Learn more at [Work with Calendar Dates and Times](ui-enter-date-ranges.md).

## Find the reports that use a column definition

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/introduced_in_2025rw1.md)]

Before you change a column definition, it can be helpful to know which reports use it so that you understand the effect of your change. To find out which reports use a column definition, follow these steps:

1. On the **(Financial Report) Column Definitions** page, select the definition, and then choose the **Edit Column Definition** action.
1. To open a list of reports that use the definition, choose the **Where-Used** action.

## Best practices for working with column definitions

<!-- [!INCLUDE [report-best-practices-column-defs](includes/report-best-practices-column-defs2.md)] -->

## Import or export financial report column definitions

Starting with the 2024 release wave 1 (version 24.1), you can import and export financial report column definitions as RapidStart configuration packages. For example, configuration packages are useful for sharing information with other companies. The package is created in a .rapidstart file, which compresses the contents.

> [!NOTE]
> When you import financial report column definitions, they replace existing records with the same names. The configuration package for a report definition won't overwrite any existing row or column definitions that are used in the report definition.

To import or export financial report column definitions, follow these steps:

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 4.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Column Definitions**, and then choose the related link.
1. Choose the row definition, and then choose the **Import Column Definition** or **Export Column Definition** action, depending on what you want to do.

# Project Realization (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Project Realization** report shows how billing is performing against the costs.

The report compares the billable (invoiced price) value to the actual (total price) value, and highlights how much of each project was invoiced.

:::image type="content" source="media/projects/project-realization.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Project Realization Power BI Report" lightbox="media/projects/project-realization.png":::

## Use the report

Leadership and project managers use the report to identify which projects they need to invoice. CFOs also use this report.

CFOs can check which projects have low realization, and send invoices accordingly to ensure you meet monthly invoicing goals and have healthy turnover.

Project managers use this report to identify projects with completed work that isn't invoiced.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The *Project Realization* report includes the following KPIs:

# Set up Intrastat reporting

All companies in the European Union (EU) must report their trade with other EU countries/regions. Companies must report the movement of goods to the statistics authorities in their country/region every month, and the report must be delivered to the tax authorities. Intrastat is the system that's used to collect trade statistics about goods within these countries/regions. Use the Intrastat report to complete periodic Intrastat reporting by collecting, recording, and reporting the trade of goods according to local legislation.

Intrastat reporting is based on basic EU regulations that apply to all countries/regions. However, there are differences within the individual countries/regions. Each country/region has its rules about what and how to report.

> [!NOTE]  
> Intrastat information doesn't apply to the movement of services between countries/regions, but only goods (Items and Fixed Assets). If the local government requires registering the movement of services between countries/regions, it can be done using the **Service Declaration** feature.
>
> This feature is available as an app on [AppSource](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2081646). To use this feature, you must first install it on the **Extension Management** page. To learn more about this feature, go to [The Service Declaration Extension](finance-how-setup-use-service-declaration.md).  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This article describes the new Intrastat experience available in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] starting in the 2022 release wave 2, which includes extended features. If you haven't upgraded your solution, read the previous version's Intrastat setup and usage article at [Set Up and Report Intrastat](finance-how-setup-report-intrastat-v20.md).

## Assisted setup

To use assisted setup for the Intrastat, follow these steps:  

1. Select the :::image type="icon" source="media/ui-search/search_small.png" border="false"::: icon, enter **Assisted Setup**, and then select the related link. 
2. On the **Assisted Setup** page, select the line for **Set up Intrastat reporting** in the **Report on financial health** group.  
3. Follow the instructions for the basic setup for Intrastat. To read more about the Intrastat setup, see the [Intrastat configuration](#intrastat-configuration) section later in this article.
4. After the setup is completed, select **Finish** to start to use the new Intrastat experience.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You can install the Intrastat Reporting Core app on any base app country version, regardless of whether it's in the EU. However, this feature is intended for regulatory reporting in EU countries. Microsoft provides full regulatory and localization support only in EU countries. If you're in an EU country where Microsoft doesn't provide localization support, you must find partner-based localization support. You might have to install a country/region-specific Intrastat app in addition to the core extension to meet local requirements. The country-specific apps can only be installed on base apps because they're intended for localization purposes. Intrastat Core has one core app and country-specific local apps.  

## Intrastat configuration

Before you can use Intrastat reports, there are several configurations that must be set up.  

### Intrastat reporting setup

Use the **Intrastat Reporting Setup** page to enable and set the default behavior for Intrastat reporting. You can specify whether you need to report Intrastat from shipments (dispatches), receipts (arrivals), or both, depending on thresholds set by your local authorities. You can also set default transaction types for the regular and return documents that are used for transaction reporting.

Follow these steps to set up Intrastat reporting.

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Intrastat Report Setup**, and then select the related link.
2. On the **General** FastTab, select or enter field information as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)] The following table describes some of the key fields.

   | Field | Description |
   | --- | --- |
   | **Report Receipts** | Specifies that you must include arrivals of received goods in Intrastat reports. |
   | **Report Shipments** | Specifies that you must include shipments of dispatched items in Intrastat reports. |
   | **Include Drop Shipments** | Specifies if drop shipment transactions are included in Intrastat reports. To learn more, see [Work with Intrastat Reporting](finance-how-report-intrastat.md).  |  
   | **Shipments Based On**  | Specifies the country code based on which Intrastat report lines are taken.  |
   | **Sales VAT Reg. No. Based On** | Specifies which customer code, or document VAT number is taken for the Intrastat report. Users can choose to have the default value from **Sell-to** or **Bill-to** customer or to use **Document** as an option. If the user uses multiple VAT numbers feature, **Document** option is recommended option for accurate **Country/Region Code** and **VAT Reg. No.** information on the Intrastat report based on Ship-to details from the document header. |
   | **Purchase VAT Reg. No. Based On** | Specifies which vendor code, or document VAT number is taken for the Intrastat report. Users can choose to have the default value from **Buy-from** or **Pay-to** vendor or to use **Document** as an option. |
   | **Project VAT Reg. No. Based On** | Specifies which customer code VAT number is taken for the Intrastat report. Users can choose to have the default value from **Sell-to** or **Bill-to** customer. |
   | **Sales Intrastat Info Based On** | Specifies which customer code Intrastat settings are added to the document. |
   | **Purchase Intrastat Info Based On** | Specifies which vendor code Intrastat settings are added to the document. |
   | **Company VAT No. on File** | Specifies how the company's VAT registration number is exported to the Intrastat file.  |

   | **Customer VAT No. on File** | Specifies how a customer's VAT registration number is exported to the Intrastat file.  |
   | **Get Partner VAT** | Specifies which type of Intrastat report line the partner's VAT registration number is updated from. Depending on your local requirements, you can choose receipt lines only, shipment lines only, or both types of lines. |
   | **Default Country Code for Item Tracking** | Specifies the default source of country code for item tracking. You can read more about this feature [here](#automate-the-process-of-inheriting-the-country-of-origin-for-items). |

4. On the **Default Transactions** FastTab, select or enter field information as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)] The following table describes some of the key fields.

   | Field | Description |
   | --- | --- |
   | **Default Trans. Type** | Specifies the default transaction type for regular sales shipments, service shipments, and purchase receipts. |
   | **Default Trans. Type – Returns** | Specifies the default transaction type for sales returns, service returns, and purchase returns. |
   | **Default Private Person VAT No.** | Specifies the default private person VAT number if the private person must have a dedicated VAT number on the Intrastat report. |
   | **Default 3-Party Trade VAT No.** | Specifies the default three-party trade VAT number if you don't have the VAT number. |
   | **Default VAT for Unknown State** | Specifies the default VAT number for an unknown state. |
   | **Default Country/Region Code** | Specifies the default receiving country code. |

5. On the **Reporting** FastTab, select or enter the field information as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)] The following table describes some of the key fields.

   | Field | Description |
   | --- | --- |
   | **Data Exch. Def. Code** | Specifies the data exchange definition code to generate the Intrastat file. This field is available only if the **Split Receipts/Shipments Files** field is set to **No**. |

### Set up a reporting file

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Data Exchange Definitions**, and then select the related link.
2. Select **New**, and then, on the **General** FastTab, enter information about the data exchange definition, data file type, column separator, related codeunits, XMLport, and other fields as needed.
3. On the **Line Definitions** FastTab, enter a value in the **Line Type** field to describe the formatting of lines in the data file and where you need to define the number of columns for this line.
4. On the **Column Definitions** FastTab, fill in the line for each planned column. 
5. On the **Line Definitions** FastTab, select **Field Mapping**.
6. On the **Field Mapping** page, create a new entry.
7. On the **General** FastTab, select the **Table ID** value (for **Intrastat Report Line**, choose **4812**), and enter the following field information:

   1. In the **Key Index** field, specify the key index to sort the source records before export.
   2. In the **Mapping Codeunit** field, select a value.

8. On the **Field Mapping** FastTab, add the columns that you previously configured on the **Column Definitions** FastTab, and then add the following field information:

   1. Specify the **Field ID** value for each of the columns.
   2. Specify the **Transformation Rule** value for each column as needed. The value specifies the rule that transforms imported text to a supported value before it can be mapped to a specified field in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. When you choose a value in this field, the exact value is entered in the **Transformation Rule** field in the **Data Exch. Field Mapping Buf.** table. (Conversely, when an exact value is entered in the **Transformation Rule** field in the **Data Exch. Field Mapping Buf.** table, a value is chosen in this field.)

9. If you need to group entries based on some columns, on the **Field Grouping** FastTab, select the fields that you want to use for grouping.

> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE[prod_long](includes/prod_long.md)] comes with the preconfigured data exchange definition for Intrastat for all localized countries/regions. To learn more about how to create a new data exchange definition, see [Set Up Data Exchange Definitions](across-how-to-set-up-data-exchange-definitions.md).

### Set mandatory fields with the Intrastat report checklist

In some countries/regions, the authorities require that Intrastat reports include, for example, the shipment method for purchases or other values when sales are over a certain threshold.

To set mandatory fields or values on the **Intrastat Report** page, follow the steps.

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Intrastat Report Setup**, and then select the related link.
2. Select **Intrastat Report Checklist**.
3. Follow the steps to add the necessary lines for checking:
   1. Set the **Field No.** field to a field that must be checked for a nonempty value.
   2. Enter a value in the **Filter Expression** field if needed, based on the following rules:

        1. When you open the **Filter Page**, select the filter that you need to use for checking.
        2. Select a value related to the selected filter.
        3. If you must fill more filters for the chosen field, repeat the previous two steps to add another filter.
        4. When you finish entering the filters for the chosen field, select **OK**.

   3. Select the **Reversed Filter Expression** checkbox to specify that the check for fields is run only on those lines that don't match the filter expression. If the line isn't filtered, this field is ignored.

> [!NOTE]
> When you open the **Filter Page** from the **Filter Expression** line, you can use all standard filter expressions related to the specific field you want to filter.
>
> Be careful when you set up validation rules, because they can differ between countries/regions.

## Use custom codeunits in Intrastat reporting

If you want to change how Intrastat works, and the default configuration isn't enough, you can customize the system by extending the standard features. If you need to further change the Intrastat behavior, you can develop your own codeunits. When you create codeunits, you need to make extra changes to use them. To configure [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to use your own objects, follow these steps.

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Reports Configuration**, and then select the related link.
2. On the **VAT Reports Configuration** page, add a new line.
3. In the **VAT Report Type** field, select **Intrastat Report**.
4. In the **VAT Report Version** field, specify the version of the report.
5. Add your codeunits for the following options:
   1. In the **Suggest Lines Codeunit ID** field, specify the new codeunit for suggesting lines in the Intrastat report lines.
   2. In the **Content Codeunit ID** field, specify the new codeunit for exporting data as a file using a Data Exchange Definition.
   3. In the **Validate Codeunit ID** field, specify the new codeunits for validating results inside Intrastat report lines.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This line must be empty if you use the standard codeunits. You should only create a line and configure it if you have custom codeunits.

## Other Intrastat configurations

Customer and vendor cards include the **Intrastat Partner Type** field, which has the same option values as the **Partner Type** field: 

- (blank)
- Company
- Person

The **Intrastat Partner Type** field replaced the **Partner Type** field in Intrastat reporting. The **Partner Type** field is used in the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) to define the SEPA Direct Debit Scheme (Core or B2B). The **Intrastat Partner Type** field is used for Intrastat reporting only. Therefore, you can specify different values for the two fields if necessary.

If the **Intrastat Partner Type** field is left blank, the value from the **Partner Type** field is used for Intrastat reporting.

In addition to **Intrastat Report Setup**, **Data Exchange Definitions**, and **Intrastat Report Checklist**, the following settings must also be configured.

| Page | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| **Countries/Regions** | On the **Countries/Regions** page, add **EU Country/Region Code** and **Intrastat Code** information to specify a code for the country/region that you're trading with. This information is used in Intrastat reporting. |
| **Tariff Numbers** | In many countries/regions, the customs and tax authorities establish eight-digit codes for various items. To enable item entries to contain the necessary information when the program imports them to the Intrastat journal line, enter the item code on the **Tariff Numbers** page. Find the codes for the items that your company deals with, and enter them on the **Tariff Numbers** page. |
| **Transport Methods** | There are seven, one-digit codes for Intrastat transport methods: **1** for sea, **2** for rail, **3** for road, **4** for air, **5** for the post, **7** for fixed installations, and **9** for own propulsion (for example, transporting a car by driving it). [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't require these specific codes. However, we recommend that the descriptions provide a similar meaning. |
| **Transaction Types** | Countries and regions have different codes for types of Intrastat transactions. For example, for ordinary purchases and sales, exchange of returned goods, and exchange of nonreturned goods. Set up all the codes that apply to your country/region. These codes are then used on the **Foreign Trade** FastTab on sales and purchase documents and when you process returns. |
| **Transaction Specifications** | Set up codes to supplement the transaction type descriptions. |
  
> [!NOTE]
> Starting in January 2022, Intrastat requires different transaction nature codes for dispatches to private individuals or non-VAT registered businesses and VAT-registered businesses. To comply with this requirement, we recommend that you review or add new transaction nature codes on the **Transaction Types** page, according to the requirements in your country. You should also check and update the **Intrastat Partner Type** field to *Person* for a private individual or non-VAT registered business customers on the relevant **Customer** page. If you're unsure about the correct Intrastat partner type or transaction type to use, we recommend that you ask an expert in your country or region.

|   Field   |   Description   |
| --------- | --------------- |
| **Net Weight** | Weight is one of the basic configurations  that are related to Intrastat reporting, because the total weight is mandatory for reporting. To be ready for this requirement, enter a value in the **Net Weight** field on the item or fixed asset card. |
| **Country of Origin Code** | Use the two-letter ISO Alpha Codes on the item or fixed asset card for the country/region where the good was obtained or produced. If the good was produced in more than one country/region, the country/region of origin is the last country/region where it was processed. |
| **VAT identification number of the partner operator in the Member State of import** | This number is the VAT-ID of the partner operator in the member state of import. The VAT-ID is also used in the exchange of intra-EU-export data among the member states and allows the member states to allocate the received data to the importing company in their own country/region. Reporting units must report on the VAT-ID of the company that declared the intra-Union acquisition of goods in the member state of import. |

Optionally, you can also set up:

- **Commodity codes**: Customs and tax authorities have numerical codes that classify items and services. You can specify these codes on items.
- **Areas**: Supplementary information about countries and regions.
- **Entry/exit points**: Specify the locations where you ship or receive items to or from other countries/regions. An airport is an example of an entry or exit point. You enter entry or exit points on sales and purchase documents on the **Foreign Trade** FastTab. This information is copied from the item entries when you create the Intrastat journal.
- **Supplementary unit of measure**: The quantity of goods for Intrastat reporting can be either net weight (in kilograms) or a supplementary unit. If supplementary units are required, you must configure them for items and fixed assets.

> [!NOTE]
> If you add a supplementary unit of measure, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] asks whether you want to update related items. If you choose to update related items, the **Unit of Measure** value on the **Item Units of Measure** page is updated for all items that have the same tariff number.
>
> When you add a tariff number that has a defined **Unit of Measure** value to the item, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically adds a new unit of measure to the **Item Units of Measure** value for the item. The **Qty. per Unit of Measure** value is based on the **Quantity Rounding Precision** field.

## Automate the process of inheriting the country of origin for items

> [!NOTE]
> If you want to transfer the country of origin from the purchase document to the sales invoice, you must use item tracking lines. Otherwise, the system won't use the default value.

The sections that follow describe how to set up the transfer.

### Intrastat report

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Intrastat Report Setup**, and then select the related link.
2. In the **Intrastat Report Setup** in the **Default Country Code for Item Tracking** field, choose the **Purchase Headers** option.  

### Item  

You must enable item tracking for these items, either serial numbers, lots, or both. To enable item tracking for the item, follow these steps.

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Item**, and then select the related link.
2. Choose the item that you want to configure.

5. Close the page.
6. Repeat this process for each line on the **Item Tracking Lines** page where you configured item tracking.
7. Close the **Item Tracking Lines** page.

When you work with sales invoices, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically collects the **Country/Region Code** for any lot or serial number you choose. You can always check the code using the **Item Tracking Lines** action from the sales lines.  

These **Country/Region Codes** are automatically populated in the **Country/Region of Origin Code** field in the **Intrastat Report Lines**.  

## Enter country/region Intrastat settings

Intrastat requirements are similar in all member states of the EU, though there are important exceptions. In theory, the rules should be uniformly applied in all member states. However, there are differences in implementations, because some member states provide guidelines about how to apply the principles in specific situations (for example, commercial samples and returns of goods). These guidelines can produce different results for various situations. Therefore, the information that countries/regions must enter can differ, as can the file format that they must use for reporting.

> [!NOTE]
> If you don't fill in the **Lot No. Information Card** or **Serial No. Information Card** pages for a lot or serial number, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] won't use the **Country/Region Code** from the purchase document. Instead, the information comes from the **Item** card.  

### Austria

Intrastat reporting in Austria requires two different files for receipts and shipments. To verify that your setup is correct, follow the steps.

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Intrastat Report Setup**, and then select the related link.

# Set up approval workflows

You can set up and use workflows that connect business-process tasks performed by different users. System tasks, such as automatic posting, can be included as steps in workflows, preceded or followed by user tasks. Requesting and granting approval to create new records are typical workflow steps. Learn more at [Use Approval Workflows](across-use-workflows.md).

Before you begin to use approval workflows, you must set up workflow users and approval users, specify how users receive notifications about workflow steps, then create the workflows.

On the **Workflow** page, you create a workflow by listing the involved steps on the lines. Each step consists of a workflow event, moderated by event conditions, and a workflow response, moderated by response options. You define workflow steps by filling in fields on workflow lines using fixed lists of event and response values that represent scenarios supported by the application code.

[!INCLUDE[workflow](includes/workflow.md)]

# Payment practices report  

Authorities in some country/regions require large companies to report their payment practices and performance regarding how quickly they pay their vendors. For example, each year Swedish companies with 250 or more employees must report to the Swedish Companies Registration Office the payment times they have for purchases from smaller companies. Similar acts exist in the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand. The legislation is intended to protect smaller businesses from bearing financial burdens that late payments cause.

> [!NOTE]
> Only some countries currently require this type of reporting. Because the requirements are largely the same, this is a global feature that all countries/regions can use.  

You can base the report on different sources, and can sort vendors based on their size or defined payment terms. Companies can provide reports for vendors for the following information, as required by local authorities:  

- The average agreed payment period.  
- The average actual payment term.
- The percentage of invoices they paid within the agreed payment period.

You can select the period for which to run a calculation and to find details based on a grouping that you choose. For each of these groupings, you can find sourced entries.

## Generate the report

To run the **Payment Practices** report, use the following steps:

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that op the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Payment Practices**, and then select the related link. 
2. Select **New**.
3. On the **General** FastTab, enter values in the following fields:

   | Field | Description |
   |---------|-----------------------------------|
   | No. | Specify the number of the entry or record for the report. |
   | Aggregation Type | Specify how data is aggregated. If you choose **Period**, the report is covers the period defined in the **Starting Date** and **Ending Date** fields. If you choose **Company Size**, the report is based on the number of employees in the vendor company. **Note:** To use the **Company Size** option, you must first create sizes in the **Company Sizes** page and assign them to the relevant vendors in the **Company Size Code** field on the **Vendor Card** page.  |
   | Header Type | Specifies the source for entries in the payment practice, and you can choose Vendors, Customers or both. |
   | Starting Date | Specifies the starting date of the payment practice. |
   | Ending Date | Specifies the ending date of the payment practice. |

4. After you fill in the fields in the header, use the **Generate** action to generate the report data.

When you generate the report, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] fills in the **Generated On** and **Generated By** fields with the date and time it was generated and by whom, respectively.

## Edit the results

Based on the selection in the **Aggregation Type** field, you get different lines. You can change the values on the lines. If you do, the report is marked as **Modified Manually**.

## Review the calculations

To explore the calculations behind the values on the **Statistics** FastTab, choose the value in the field to open the **Payment Practice Data List** page.

## Print the report

To print the document, choose the **Print** action.

# Create number series

For each company that you set up, you need to assign unique identification codes to things such as general ledger accounts, customer and vendor accounts, invoices, and other documents. Numbering isn't only important for identification. A well-designed numbering system also makes the company more manageable and easier to analyze, and can reduce data entry errors.

> [!Important]
> By default, gaps aren't allowed in number series because the exact history of financial transactions must be available for auditing, by law, and therefore must follow an unbroken sequence with no deleted numbers.
>
> If you want to allow gaps in certain number series, consult with your auditor or accounting manager to ensure that you adhere to the legal requirements in your country/region. For more information, see the [Gaps in Number Series](#gaps-in-number-series) section.

> [!NOTE]  
> We recommend that you use the same number series codes as you see listed on the **No. Series List** page in the CRONUS demonstration company. Codes such as *P-INV+* might not make immediate sense to you, but [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] has a number of default settings that depend on these number series codes.

You create a numbering system by setting up one or more codes for each type of master data or document. For example, you can set up one code for numbering customers, another code for numbering sales invoices, and another code for numbering documents in general journals. After you set up a code, you must set up at least one number series line. The number series line contains information such as the first and last number in the series and the starting date. You can set up more than one number series line per number series code, with a different starting date for each line. Number series are consecutive, starting each series on the respective starting date.

> [!NOTE]
> The maximum length of a number in a number series is 20 characters. There are some situations where [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will append a number with a system-generated ID. For example, when documents such as invoices are used to apply transactions, such as payments, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] generates identifiers for the applied transactions. The identifier is comprised of a number from a number series and a six character system-assigned ID, such as -12345. If you expect to process more than 9999 documents in bank or GIRO journals, or cash receipt journals, set up number series for those types of documents to include fewer than 14 characters.

You typically set up your number series to automatically insert the next consecutive number on new cards or documents that you create. However, you can also set up a number series to allow you to manually enter a number. To manually enter numbers, turn on the **Manual Nos.** toggle.

If you want to use more than one number series code for one type of master data - for example, if you want to use different number series for different categories of items - you can use number series relationships.

## Get assistance from Copilot

The suggest number series with Copilot feature can help administrators create and maintain number series for all entities and documents in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] based on structured input or natural language. To learn more about this AI-based capability, go to [Suggest number series with Copilot](suggest-number-series-copilot.md).

## Gaps in number series

Not all records that you create in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] are financial transactions that must use sequential numbering. For example, you assign number series to customers, sales quotes, and warehouse activities, but they aren't subject to financial auditing and can be deleted. For such number series, you can select the **Allow Gaps in Nos.** checkbox on the **No. Series Lines** page. This setting can also be changed after creating the number series. For more information, see [To create a new number series](ui-create-number-series.md#to-create-a-new-number-series).

## Behavior of the No. field on documents and cards

On sales, purchase, transfer, and service documents, and on all cards, the **No.** field can be filled in automatically from a predefined number series, or you can add it manually. <!--However, under certain circumstances, the **No.** field is invisible to prevent you from editing it.-->

The **No.** field can be filled in three ways:

1. If only one number series for the type of document or card exists, and the **Default Nos.** field is selected and the **Manual Nos.** field isn't selected for that number series, then the field is automatically filled with the next number in the series.<!-- The **No.** field doesn't display on the card or document.-->  

    <!--Even if you define templates with various number series for customers, if the number series that is defined in the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page is set up in this way, the **No.** field doesn't display on the customer card, no matter which template you use. The same applies to other types of cards and documents.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > If the number series isn't working, for example because it's reached the last number defined for its range, the **No.** field displays so you can manually enter a number. You can resolve issues on the **No. Series** page.-->

2. If you have more than one number series for a type of document or card, and the **Default Nos.** checkbox isn't selected for the assigned number series, the **No.** field displays, and you can go to the **No. Series** page and select the number series you want to use. The next number in the series is then inserted in the **No.** field.

3. If you don't have a number series for a type of document or card, or if the **Manual Nos.** field is selected for the number series, the **No.** field displays and you must enter a number manually. You can enter up to 20 alphanumeric characters.

When you open a new document or card that a number series exists for, the **No. Series Setup** page opens so that you can set up a number series for that type of document or card and continue working.

> [!NOTE]  
> If you need to enable manual numbering on, for example, new item cards that were created with a data migration process that has hidden the **No.** by default, go to the **Inventory Setup** page and choose the **Item Nos.** field to open and set the related number series to **Manual Nos.**.
>
> The same is true if you're using service management features. To resolve that issue, go to the **Service Management Setup** page and choose the **Service Item Nos.** field to set the number series to **Manual Nos.**.

## To create a new number series

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **No. Series**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. On the new line, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  
4. Choose the **Lines** action.  
5. On the **No. Series Lines** page, fill in the fields to define the actual use and content of the number series that you created in step 2.  
6. Repeat step 5 for as many different uses of the number series that you need. The **Starting Date** field defines which number series line is active.  

> [!TIP]
> To allow users to specify numbers manually when they register a new customer or vendor, for example, choose the **Manual Nos.** field on the number series itself. To prevent manual numbering, clear the field.

You can assign number series to the templates that you set up for the different types of customers and vendors that your sales people and purchasers most often add. In that case, set up the relevant number series, link them through relationships, and then add the first number series in the relevant relationship to the relevant setup page. Then, when a user creates a customer, they choose the relevant template, and the new customer gets a number assigned from the number series that is defined for that template.  

## To create relationships between number series

If you set up more than one number series for the same kind of information or transactions, you can create relationships between the series. This feature can help you decide among the codes when you use a number. When you set up a relationship between a group of number series, you associate all of the related series to one number series. Then, you can enter that code in a field on the **Numbering** FastTab on setup pages, such as **Sales & Receivables Setup**.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **No. Series**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the line with the number series you want to create relationships for and then choose **Relationships**.
3. In the **Series Code** field, enter the code for the number series that you want to relate to the series you selected in step 2.
4. Add a line for each code that you want to relate to the selected number series.
5. Close the page.

Now when you set up something that requires a number, you can use the relationships you created to select among the related number series.

## To set up where a number series is used

The following procedure shows how to set up number series for the Sales area. The steps are similar for other areas.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales & Receivables**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Sales & Receivables** page, on the **Number Series** FastTab, select the desired number series for each sales card or document.

The selected number now fills in the **No.** field on the card or document according to your settings.

# Outbound warehouse processes

Outbound processes in warehouses start when you release a source document to take items out of a warehouse location. For example, either to ship the items somewhere or to move them to another company location. You can ship physical and noninventory items. To learn more about receiving noninventory items, go to [Post noninventory items](#post-noninventory-items).

In principle, the process of shipping outbound orders consists of two activities:

* Picking items from the shelves.
* Shipping items out of the warehouse.

The source documents for outbound warehouse flow are:  

* Sales order  
* Outbound transfer order  
* Purchase return order  
* Service order  

> [!NOTE]
> Production and assembly orders with component needs also represent outbound source documents. Production and assembly orders are a little different because they're typically internal processes that don't involve shipping. Instead, they're used to put-away produced items or move the components needed to assemble an item to an assembly area. Learn more about these processes at [Design Details: Internal Warehouse Flows](design-details-internal-warehouse-flows.md).  

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you pick and ship items using one of four methods, as described in the following table.

|Method|Outbound Process|Require Pick|Require Shipment|Complexity Level (Learn more at [Warehouse Management Overview](design-details-warehouse-management.md))|  
|------|----------------|-----|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
|A|Post the pick and shipment from the order line|||No dedicated warehouse activity.|  
|B|Post the pick and shipment from an inventory pick document|Turned on||Basic: Order-by-order.|  
|C|Post the pick and shipment from a warehouse shipment document||Turned on|Basic: Consolidated receive/ship posting for multiple orders.|  
|D|Post the pick from a warehouse pick document, and post the shipment from a warehouse shipment document|Turned on|Turned on|Advanced|  

The approach to choose depends on your warehouse practices and level of organizational complexity. The following are some examples that might help you decide.

* In an order-by-order environment with straightforward processes and a simple bin structure, method A, picking and shipping from the order line is appropriate.
* If items for an order line come from more than one bin, or if warehouse workers can't work with order documents, the use of separate pick documents is appropriate, method B.
* If picking and shipping involves multiple orders and requires greater control and overview, you might choose methods C and D to separate the picking and shipping tasks.  

In methods A, B, and C, picking and shipping activities are combined in one step when posting the document as shipped. In method D, you first register the pick, and then post the shipment later from a different document.

> [!NOTE]
> Although warehouse picks and inventory picks sound similar, they're different documents, and they're used in different processes.
>
> * The inventory pick used in method B, together with registering picking information, also posts the shipment of the source document.
> * The warehouse pick used in method D can't be posted and only registers the pick. The registration makes the items available for the warehouse shipment but doesn't post the shipment. In the outbound flow, the warehouse pick requires a warehouse shipment.

## No dedicated warehouse activity

The following articles provide information about how to process receipts for source documents if you don't use dedicated warehouse activities.

* [Transfer Orders](inventory-how-transfer-between-locations.md)
* [Process Purchase Returns or Cancellations](purchasing-how-process-purchase-returns-cancellations.md)
* [Create Service Orders](service-how-to-create-service-orders.md)

## Basic warehouse configurations

The following diagram illustrates the outbound warehouse processes for different types of documents in basic warehouse configurations. The numbers in the diagram correspond with the steps in the sections following the diagram.  

:::image type="content" source="media/design-details-warehouse-management-outbound-basic-flow.png" alt-text="Shows the steps in a basic outbound flow in a warehouse.":::

### 1: Release a source document in a basic configuration

When you use the **Release** action on a source document, such as a sales or transfer order, the items on the document are ready to be handled in the warehouse. For example, picked and put in the bin specified on the document. Alternatively, you can create inventory pick documents for individual lines on orders, in a push fashion, based on specified bins and quantities to handle.  

### 2: Create an inventory pick

On the **Inventory Pick** page, the warehouse worker retrieves, in a pull fashion, the source document lines. Alternatively, the inventory pick lines are already created, in a push fashion, by the user who is responsible for the source document.  

### 3: Post an inventory pick

On each line for items that were picked or moved, partially or fully, fill in the **Quantity** field, and then post the inventory pick. Source documents related to the inventory pick are posted as shipped or consumed.  

For inventory picks, negative item ledger entries are created, warehouse entries are created, and the pick request is deleted, if fully handled. For example, the **Quantity Shipped** field on the outbound source document line is updated. A posted shipment document is created  that reflects the sales order, for example, and the shipped items.  

## Advanced warehouse configurations

The following diagram illustrates the outbound warehouse processes for different types of documents in advanced warehouse configurations. The numbers in the diagram correspond with the steps in the sections following the diagram.  

:::image type="content" source="media/design_details_warehouse_management_outbound_advanced_flow.png" alt-text="Shows the steps in an advanced outbound warehouse flow.":::

### 1: Release a source document in an advanced configuration

Releasing a source document in advanced configurations does the same thing as for basic configurations. The items become available for handling in the warehouse. For example, they can be included in a shipment.  

### 2: Create a warehouse shipment

On the **Warehouse Shipment** page, get the lines from the released source document. You can combine lines from several source documents in one warehouse shipment.  

### 3: Create a warehouse pick

On the **Warehouse Shipment** page, create warehouse pick activities for warehouse shipments in one of two ways:

* In a push fashion, where you use the **Create Pick** action. Select the lines to pick and prepare the picks by specifying, for example, which bins to take from and place in, and how many units to handle. The bins can be predefined for the warehouse location or resource.
* In a pull fashion, where you use the **Release** action. On the **Pick Worksheet** page, warehouse workers can use the **Get Warehouse Documents** action to get their assigned picks. When the warehouse picks are fully registered, the lines in the **Pick Worksheet** are deleted.

### 4: Register a warehouse pick

On the **Warehouse Pick** page, a warehouse worker fills in the **Quantity** field for each line that they fully or partially picked, and then registers the pick.

Warehouse entries are created, and the warehouse pick lines are deleted if the full quantity was picked. The warehouse pick document remains open until the full quantity of the warehouse shipment is registered. The **Qty. Picked** field on the warehouse shipment lines is updated accordingly.  

### 5: Post the warehouse shipment

When all items on the warehouse shipment document are registered as picked, the warehouse worker posts the shipment. Posting updates the item ledger entries to reflect the reduction in inventory. For example, the **Quantity Shipped** field on the outbound source document line is updated.

# Set up stock keeping units

Use stock keeping units (SKUs) to record information about items for a specific location or a variant. They let you add different information about an item for a specific location, for example:

* A warehouse or distribution center
* Variants, such as different shelf numbers and different replenishment information, for the same item  

## To set up a SKU  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Stock keeping Units**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. Fill in the fields as necessary. The following fields are required: **Item No.**, **Location Code**, and/or **Variant Code**. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  

After you set up the first SKU for an item, the **Stockkeeping Unit Exists** checkbox on the **Item** card is selected.  

To create several SKUs for an item, use the **Create Stockkeeping Unit** batch job. To learn more about batch jobs, go to [Use Job Queues to Schedule Tasks](admin-job-queues-schedule-tasks.md).  

> [!NOTE]  
> The information on the **Stockkeeping Unit** card has priority over the **Item** card.

> [!Warning]
> If the SKU is supplied through production, the **Standard Cost** field isn't used when invoicing and adjusting the actual cost of the produced item. Instead, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses the value in the **Standard Cost** field on the item card, and variances are calculated against the cost shares of that item.<br><br>
> Although you can assign production BOMs and routings to SKUs, the unit cost roll-up and the related calculation of cost shares aren't available on SKUs. To learn more about standard costs, go to [About Calculating Standard Cost](finance-about-calculating-standard-cost.md)

# Inventory Power BI app

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The Power BI Inventory app is designed to pull data directly from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to give leadership, managers, and warehouse staff key information about inventory. This app has various reports that offer insights into business operations. Use the information from these reports to make informed decisions that ensure you meet demand, keep costs low, and don't delay production.

## Inventory analytics for the leadership team

To fit this category, you might have a role such as:

- Chief Operations Officer
- Chief Finance Officer

### Example scenario: maintaining stock turnover

COOs want to ensure that stock moves so you don't have aging stock on hand. The [Inventory by Lot](inventory-powerbi-inventory-by-lot.md) report shows how much stock is in each lot and where stock is expired. You can also compare this report with the information on the [Purchase and Sales Quantity](inventory-powerbi-purchase-and-sales-qty.md) report to ensure you aren't over-purchasing and increasing storage costs.

## Inventory analytics for the management team

To fit this category, you might have a role such as:

- Warehouse Manager
- Procurement Manager
- Supply Chain Manager
- Production Manager

### Example scenario: maintaining stock on hand

Warehouse managers want to ensure that each location has adequate stock levels. The [Inventory by Location](inventory-powerbi-inventory-by-location.md) report helps you ensure adequate stock levels at each location. It also indicates where to move stock around to supply locations.

Production or procurement managers can use the [Gross Requirement](inventory-powerbi-gross-requirement.md) to ensure that production planning is supplied by stock.

## Inventory analytics for the warehouse team

To fit this category, you might have a role such as:

- Order picker
- Order shipping

### Example scenario: tracking stock

Order pickers in a warehouse want to ensure that each bin contains enough stock to meet orders. Use the [Bin Contents](inventory-powerbi-bin-contents.md) report to be sure that bins contain the right amount of stock. To see tracking information, use the [Bin Contents by Item Tracking](inventory-powerbi-bin-contents-by-item-tracking.md) report.

To see lot and serial information on an item by item basis, other staff in the warehouse can use either the [Inventory by Lot](inventory-powerbi-inventory-by-lot.md) or [Inventory by Serial](inventory-powerbi-inventory-by-serial-no.md) reports.

## Use the reports

The following table provides descriptions on how you can use each report in the Power BI Inventory app.

# Liabilities (Power BI report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Liabilities** report provides an overview of your company's financial obligations, highlighting total liabilities, current liabilities, payroll liabilities, and long-term liabilities. It also shows key performance indicators such as debt ratio and dept-to-equity ratio, along with total assets.

These key performance indicators can help you understand the balance between debt and equity while monitoring liabilities that affect future cash flow and operational flexibility.

Drill through into the **Liabilities Drill-Through** page to explore the underlying ledger entries that make up the balance.

## Use the report

The audiences for the report are:

- Executives
- Directors
- Other high-level decision makers

Executives can use the report to evaluate your company's financial position before engaging in a new expansive initiative. By first analyzing current liabilities, you can gauge your immediate debt burden. This analysis helps you determine whether there are enough liquid assets to meet short term obligations, and ensure you have cash-flow to support existing operations and new development.

Next, you could assess the debt ratio and debt-to-equity ratios. These key performance indicators provide insight into the company's leverage and risk profile. For example, a high debt-to-equity ratio could indicate that the company has a high reliance on borrowed funds. This type of data can help inform how you decide to finance the expansion project.  

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The *Liabilities* report includes the following KPIs and measures: 

- [**Liabilities**](finance-powerbi-kpis.md#liabilities)
- [**Current Liabilities**](finance-powerbi-kpis.md#current-liabilities)
- [**Payroll Liabilities**](finance-powerbi-kpis.md#payroll-liabilities)
- [**Longterm Liabilities**](finance-powerbi-kpis.md#longterm-liabilities)
- [**Debt Ratio**](finance-powerbi-kpis.md#debt-ratio)
- [**Debt/Equity Ratio**](finance-powerbi-kpis.md#debtequity-ratio)
- [**Assets**](finance-powerbi-kpis.md#assets)
- [**Balance at Date (Neg)**](finance-powerbi-kpis.md#balance-at-date-neg)

# Design Details: Reconciliation with the General Ledger
When you post inventory transactions, such as sales shipments, production output, or negative adjustments, the quantity and value changes to the inventory are recorded in the item ledger entries and the value entries, respectively. The next step in the process is to post the inventory values to the inventory accounts in the general ledger.  

There are two ways to reconcile the inventory ledger with the general ledger:  

* Manually, by running the **Post Inventory Cost to G/L** batch job.  
* Automatically, every time that you post an inventory transaction.  

## Post Inventory Cost to G/L Batch Job  
When you run the **Post Inventory Cost to G/L** batch job, the general ledger entries are created based on value entries. You have the option to summarize general ledger entries for each value entry, or create general ledger entries for each combination of posting date, location code, inventory posting group, general business posting group, and general product posting group.  

The posting dates of the general ledger entries are set to the posting date of the corresponding value entry, except when the value entry falls in a closed accounting period. In this case, the value entry is skipped, and you must change either the general ledger setup or the user setup to enable posting in the date range.  

When you run the **Post Inventory Cost to G/L** batch job, you might receive errors because of missing setup or incompatible dimension setup. If the batch job encounters errors in the dimension setup, it overrides these errors and uses the dimensions of the value entry. For other errors, the batch job does not post the value entries and lists them at the end of the report in a section titled, **Skipped Entries**. To post these entries, you must first fix the errors. To see a list of errors before you run the batch job, you can run the **Post Invt. Cost to G/L - Test** report. This report lists all of the errors that are encountered during a test posting. You can fix the errors, and then run the inventory cost posting batch job without skipping any entries.  

## Automatic Cost Posting  
To set up cost posting to the general ledger to run automatically when you post an inventory transaction, select the **Automatic Cost Posting** check box on the **Inventory Setup** page. The posting date of the general ledger entry is the same as the posting date of the item ledger entry.  

## Account Types  
During reconciliation, inventory values are posted to the inventory account in the balance sheet. The same amount, but with the reverse sign, is posted to the relevant balancing account. Usually the balancing account is an income statement account. However, when you post direct cost related to consumption or output, the balancing account is a balance sheet account. The type of the item ledger entry and value entry determines which general ledger account to post to.  

The entry type indicates which general ledger account to post to. This is determined either by the sign of the quantity on the item ledger entry or the valued quantity on the value entry, since the quantities always have the same sign. For example, a sales entry with a positive quantity describes an inventory decrease caused by a sale, and a sales entry with a negative quantity describes an inventory increase caused by a sales return.  

### Example  
The following example shows a bike chain that is manufactured from purchased links. This example shows how the various general ledger account types are used in a typical scenario.  

The **Expected Cost Posting to G/L** check box on the **Inventory Setup** page is selected, and the following setup is defined.  

The following table shows how the link is set up on the item card.  

|Setup Field|Value|  
|-----------------|-----------|  
|**Costing Method**|Standard|  
|**Standard Cost**|LCY 1.00|  
|**Overhead Rate**|LCY 0.02|  

The following table shows how the chain is set up on the item card.  

|Setup Field|Value|  
|-----------------|-----------|  
|**Costing Method**|Standard|  
|**Standard Cost**|LCY 150.00|  
|**Overhead Rate**|LCY 25.00|  

The following table shows how the work center is set up on the work center card.  

|Setup Field|Value|  
|-----------------|-----------|  
|**Direct Unit Cost**|LCY 2.00|  
|**Indirect Cost Percentage**|10|  

##### Scenario  
1. The user purchases 150 links and posts the purchase order as received. (Purchase)  
2. The user posts the purchase order as invoiced. This creates an overhead amount of LCY 3.00 to be allocated and a variance amount of LCY 18.00. (Purchase)  

    1. The interim accounts are cleared. (Purchase)  
    2. The direct cost is posted. (Purchase)  
    3. The indirect cost is calculated and posted. (Purchase)  
    4. The purchase variance is calculated and posted (only for standard-cost items). (Purchase)  
3. The user sells one chain and posts the sales order as shipped. (Sale)  
4. The user posts the sales order as invoiced. (Sale)  

    1. The interim accounts are cleared. (Sale)  
    2. Cost of goods sold (COGS) is posted. (Sale)  

        ![Results of sales posting to GL accounts.](media/design_details_inventory_costing_3_gl_posting_sales.png "Results of sales posting to GL accounts")  
5. The user posts consumption of 150 links, which is the number of links used to produce one chain. (Consumption, Material)  

    ![Results of material posting to GL accounts.](media/design_details_inventory_costing_3_gl_posting_material.png "Results of material posting to GL accounts")  
6. The work center used 60 minutes to produce the chain. The user posts the conversion cost. (Consumption, Capacity)  

    1. The direct costs are posted. (Consumption, Capacity)  
    2. The indirect costs are calculated and posted. (Consumption, Capacity)  

        ![Results of capacity posting to GL accounts.](media/design_details_inventory_costing_3_gl_posting_capacity.png "Results of capacity posting to GL accounts")  
7. The user posts the expected cost of one chain. (Output)  
8. The user finishes the production order and runs the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job. (Output)  

    1. The interim accounts are cleared. (Output)  
    2. The direct cost is transferred from the WIP account to the inventory account. (Output)  
    3. The indirect cost (overhead) is transferred from the indirect cost account to the inventory account. (Output)  
    4. This results in a variance amount of LCY 157.00. Variances are only calculated for standard-cost items. (Output)  

        ![Results of output posting to GL accounts.](media/design_details_inventory_costing_3_gl_posting_output.png "Results of output posting to GL accounts")  

        > [!NOTE]  
        >  For the sake of simplicity, only one variance account is shown. In reality, five different accounts exist:  
        >   
        >  * Material Variance  
        >  * Capacity Variance  
        >  * Capacity Overhead Variance  
        >  * Subcontracting Variance  
        >  * Manufacturing Overhead Variance  

9. The user revalues the chain from LCY 150.00 to LCY 140.00. (Adjustment/Revaluation/Rounding/Transfer)  

    ![Results of adjustment posting to GL accounts.](media/design_details_inventory_costing_3_gl_posting_adjustment.png "Results of adjustment posting to GL accounts")

# Create production orders

Typically, businesses use the planning engine to create production orders automatically to fulfill a known demand. To learn more, go to [Planning](production-planning.md). However, you can create a production order manually. This article describes how to create a firm planned production order. You can also create production orders with a different status.  

## To create a production order header

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Firm Planned Prod. Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. In the **No.** field, add the next number in the number series you use for production orders.  
4. In the **Source Type** field, select the source of the production order:

   - **Item**: Standard items that you produce for inventory.
   - **Family**: A predefined family of items that you produce for inventory. To learn more, go to [Work With Production Families](production-how-work-family.md).
   - Sales header: Items are produced for the sales order that you specify in the **Source No.** field.
5. In the **Source No.** field, select the item number, family, or sales header for which to create the production order.  
6. Fill in the **Quantity** and **Due Date** fields according to your specifications.  
7. On the **Lines** FastTab, in the **Item No.** field, specify the item to produce.
8. In the **Due Date** field, specify when the item is needed. For example, for a sales order.

> [!NOTE]
> The **Starting Date-Time** and **Ending Date-Time** fields are automatically filled in based on the item's routing and the value that you enter in the **Due Date** field.

9. In the **Quantity** field, specify how many units to produce on the line.

When production requirements change, such as components or operations, you can quickly replan the production order. To learn more, go to [Replan or Refresh Production Orders Directly](production-how-to-replan-refresh-production-orders.md).

# The Ceridian Payroll Extension

To account for salary payments and related transactions, you must import and post financial transactions made by your payroll provider to the general ledger.

To do this, you first import a file that you receive from the payroll provider into the **General Journal** page. Then you map the external accounts in the payroll file to the relevant G/L accounts. Lastly, you post the payroll transactions according to the account mapping. For more information, see [Import Payroll Transactions](finance-how-import-payroll-transactions.md).

The Ceridian Payroll extension allows you to import payroll transactions from the Ceridian HR/Payroll (US) and Ceridian PowerPay (Canada) services.

# Troubleshoot connectivity for Business Central

> **APPLIES TO:** [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Online
>
> This feature is currently in preview. The functionality and documentation may change in later releases. If you would like to contribute to the documentation based on your own findings, please select ![Edit article in GitHub.](media/github-edit-pencil.png) **Edit**, and propose changes. Then we'll take a look!

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Online includes the **Troubleshooting Connectivity** page that you can use to identify problems with your connection to the online service. There are several things that affect connectivity to Business Central, like the firewall settings of your network or domain name service configuration. The page lets you run a list of checks that diagnose common Business Central connectivity issues. You can use the information to try to fix the problems yourself, or pass it on to your support representative.

> [!NOTE]
> The **Troubleshooting Connectivity** page doesn't test network performance or reliability, like the speed of your connection. It only verifies connectivity to different resources.

## Start the connectivity check 

1. Open an Internet browser.
2. In the address, enter the URL that you use to open Business Central and add `/connectivity` at the end. 

    For example, if you use `https://businesscentral.dynamics.com`, then enter:

    ```http
    https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/connectivity
    ```

    Or, if the URL includes the tenant ID, like `https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/aaaabbbb-0000-cccc-1111-dddd2222eeee`, then you'd enter:

    ```http
    https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/aaaabbbb-0000-cccc-1111-dddd2222eeee/connectivity
    ```
 
3. On the **Troubleshooting Connectivity** page, choose **Start check**.

    A series of checks is run, and the result of each check is shown:

    - ![Connectivity check succeeded.](media/connectivity-check.png) indicates the check succeeded.
    - ![Connectivity check failed.](media/connectivity-failed.png) indicates the check failed. Review the message below the check for more details.
    - ![Connectivity check was not run.](media/connectivity-blocked.png) indicates the check wasn't run, typically because of a failure of a previous check. Review the message below the check for more details.

4. To run the check again, choose **Restart check**.

The following sections explain the checks that are run, and provide some tips for fixing any problems.

## Basic internet connectivity

# Review and apply payments manually after automatic application
For each journal line representing a payment on the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page, you can open the **Payment Application** page to see all candidate open entries for the payment and view detailed information for each entry about the data matching that a payment application is based on. Here, you can manually apply payments or reapply payments that were applied automatically to a wrong entry. For more information about automatic application, see [Reconcile Payments Using Automatic Application](receivables-how-reconcile-payments-auto-application.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>   When the bank account that you are reconciling payments for is set up for the local currency, then the **Payment Application** page will show all open entries in the local currency, including open entries for documents that were originally invoiced in foreign currencies. Payments applied to entries with converted currencies may therefore be posted with different amounts than on the original document because of the potentially different exchange rates used by the bank and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] respectively.

Therefore, we recommend that you look for foreign currency codes in the **Currency Code** field on the **Payment Application** page to check if applications are based on converted currencies. To review the original document amount in the foreign currency and to see the exchange rate used, choose the **Applies-to Entry No.** field, and then, on the shortcut menu, choose the drilldown button to open the **Customer Ledger Entries** or **Vendor Ledger Entries** page.

Any gains-and-loss adjustment required due to currency conversions isn't handled automatically by [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

> [!NOTE]  
>   You cannot apply entries with a different sign than the sign on the payment. For example, to close both a negative-sign credit memo and its related positive-sign invoice, you must first apply the credit memo to the invoice, and then apply the payment to the invoice with the reduced remaining amount.

> [!WARNING]  
>   If you use payment discounts, and if the payment date is before the payment due date, then the **Remaining Amt. Incl. Discount** field on the **Payment Application** page will be used for matching. Otherwise, the value in the **Remaining Amount** field will be used. If the payment was made with a discounted amount after the payment due date, or the full amount was paid but a discount was granted, then the amount will not be matched.

> [!NOTE]  
>   You can only apply a payment to one account. If you want to split the application on multiple open entries, for example to apply a lump-sum payment, then the open entries must be for the same account. For more information, see steps 7 and 8 in the procedure in this topic.

## To review or apply payments after automatic application
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Payment Reconciliation Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the payment reconciliation journal for a bank account that you want to reconcile payments for. For more information, see [Reconcile Payments Using Automatic Application](receivables-how-reconcile-payments-auto-application.md).
3. On the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page, select a payment that you want to review or manually apply to one or more open entries, and then choose the **Apply Manually** action.
4. Select the **Applied** check box on the line for the open entry that you want to apply the payment to.
5. The payment amount, which is also shown in the **Transaction Amount** field on the **Payment Application** page, is inserted in the **Applied Amount** field, but you can modify the field, for example if you want to apply the amount to several open entries.
6. To apply a part of the paid amount to another open entry for the account, for example to apply a lump-sum payment, select the **Applied** check box for the line. The applied amount is automatically deducted from the transactions amount to reflect the distribution on the two open entries.
7. To apply a part of a payment to one or more open entries that doesn't exist in the database, create a new line under the line for the same account. In the **Applied Amount** field, enter the amount to apply on the new line, and then adjust the **Applied Amount** field on the existing line.
8. Repeat steps 5, 6, or 7 for other open entries that you want to apply a full or partial payment amount to.
9. When you have reviewed a payment application or manually applied to one or more open entries, choose the **Accept Application** action.

The **Payment Application** page  closes, and on the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page, the value in the **Match Confidence** field is changed to **Accepted** to indicate to you that you have reviewed or manually applied the payment.

# Design details: Handling reordering policies

To include an item in supply planning, you must specify a reordering policy for it on the **Item Card** page. The following reordering policies are available:  

* Fixed Reorder Qty.  
* Maximum Qty.  
* Order  
* Lot-for-Lot  

The **Fixed Reorder Qty.** and **Maximum Qty.** policies relate to inventory planning. These policies coexist with the step-by-step balancing of supply and order tracking.  

## The role of the reorder point

A reorder point represents demand during lead time. When inventory is projected to pass below the level defined by the reorder point, it's time to order more. Inventory decreases gradually until the replenishment arrives. It might reach zero or the safety stock level. The planning system suggests a forward-scheduled supply order at the point when the inventory passes below the reorder point.  

Inventory levels can move significantly during the time bucket. Therefore, the planning system constantly monitors available inventory.

## Monitoring the projected inventory level and the reorder point

Inventory is a type of supply, but for inventory planning, the planning system distinguishes between two inventory levels:  

* Projected inventory  
* Projected available inventory  

### Projected inventory  

At the start of the planning process, projected inventory is the gross quantity of inventory. The gross quantity includes posted and unposted supply and demand in the past. This quantity becomes a projected inventory level that gross quantities from future supply and demand maintain. Future supply and demand are introduced along the time line, whether reserved or allocated in other ways.  

The planning system uses projected inventory to monitor the reorder point and determine the reorder quantity using the **Maximum Qty.** reordering policy.  

### Projected available inventory  

Projected available inventory is the inventory that is available to fulfill demand at a given point in time. The planning system uses projected available inventory when monitoring the safety stock level. Safety stock must always be available for unexpected demand.  

### Time buckets  

Projected inventory is important detecting when the reorder point is reached or crossed, and to calculate the right order quantity when using the **Maximum Qty.** reordering policy.  

The projected inventory level is calculated at the start of the planning period. It's a gross level that doesn't consider reservations or other allocations. To monitor this inventory level during the planning sequence, the planning system monitors the aggregated changes over a period of time. That period is called a *time bucket*. To learn more about time buckets, go to [The role of the time bucket](#the-role-of-the-time-bucket). The planning system ensures that the time bucket is at least one day. One day is the minimum unit of time for demand or supply events.  

### Determining the projected inventory level  

The following sequence describes how the planning system determines the projected inventory level:  

* When a supply event is fully planned, such as a purchase order, it increases the projected inventory on the event's due date.  
* When a demand event is fully satisfied, it doesn't decrease the projected inventory right away. Instead, it posts a decrease reminder, which is an internal record that holds the date and quantity of the addition to projected inventory.  
* When a later supply event is planned and added to the timeline, the system investigates posted decrease reminders one by one to the planned date of the supply. During this process, the reorder point level of the internal increase reminder might be reached or crossed.  
* When a new supply order is introduced, it checks whether it was entered before the current supply. If it is, the new supply becomes current supply and the balancing procedure restarts.  

The following image shows this principle.  

![Determining the Projected Inventory Level.](media/nav_app_supply_planning_2_projected_inventory.png "Determining the Projected Inventory Level")  

1. Supply **Sa** of 4 (fixed) closes Demand **Da** of -3.  
2. CloseDemand: Create a decrease reminder of -3 (not shown).  
3. Supply **Sa** is closed with a surplus of 1 (there isn't more demand).  

     The projected inventory level increases to +4, while the projected **available** inventory becomes -1.  

4. The next supply **Sb** of 2 (another order) is already placed on the timeline.  
5. The planning system checks for a decrease reminder before **Sb** (in this example there isn't, so no action is taken).  
6. The planning system closes supply **Sb** (no more demand exists) by either A, reducing it to 0 (cancel) or B, by leaving it as is.  

     The projected inventory level increases (A: +0 => +4 or B: +2 = +6).  

7. The planning system makes a final check. Is there any decrease reminder? Yes, there's one on the date of **Da**.  
8. The planning system adds the decrease reminder of -3 reminder to the projected inventory level, either A: +4 -3 = 1 or B: +6 -3 = +3.  
9. For A, the planning system creates a forward-scheduled order starting on date **Da**. For B, the reorder point is reached and a new order is created.

## The role of the time bucket

The purpose of the time bucket is to collect demand events within a time period in order to make a joint supply order.  

For reordering policies that use a reorder point, you can define a time bucket. Time buckets help ensure that demands within the same time period are accumulated. The system then checks the effect on projected inventory and whether the reorder point is passed.

If you pass the reorder point, the system forward schedules a new supply order from the end of the time bucket. Time buckets begin on the planning starting date.  

The time bucket concept reflects the manual process of checking the inventory level on a frequent basis rather than for each transaction. You define the frequency (the time bucket). For example, you might gather all item needs from a vendor to place a weekly order.  

![Example of time bucket in planning.](media/nav_app_supply_planning_2_reorder_cycle.png "Example of time bucket in planning")  

Time buckets are often used to avoid a cascade effect. For example, a balanced row of demand and supply where an early demand is canceled, or a new one is created. The result would be that every supply order (except the last one) is rescheduled.

## Stay below the overflow level

When using the **Maximum Qty.** and **Fixed Reorder Qty.** reordering policies, the planning system focuses on the projected inventory in the given time-bucket only. It might suggest extra supply when negative demand or positive supply changes happen outside the time bucket. For extra supply, the planning system calculates the quantity by which you should decrease the supply. This quantity is called the "overflow level." The overflow is available as a planning line with a **Change Qty. (Decrease)** or **Cancel** action and the following warning message:  

* Attention: The projected inventory [xx] is higher than the overflow level [xx] on the Due Date [xx].*  

![Inventory overflow level.](media/supplyplanning_2_overflow1_new.png "Inventory overflow level")  

### Calculating the overflow level  

The overflow level is calculated in different ways depending on the reordering policy.  

#### Maximum Qty.

Overflow level = maximum inventory  

> [!NOTE]  
> If you use a minimum order quantity, it's added as follows:
>
> overflow level = maximum inventory + minimum order quantity.  

#### Fixed Reorder Qty.  

overflow level = reorder quantity + reorder point  

> [!NOTE]  
> If the minimum order quantity is higher than the reorder point, it's replaced as follows:
>
> overflow level = reorder quantity + minimum order quantity  

#### Order multiple  

If an order multiple exists, it adjusts the overflow level for both the Maximum Qty. and Fixed Reorder Qty. reordering policies.  

### Creating the planning line with an overflow warning  

A planning line is created when a supply causes the projected inventory to be higher than the overflow level at the end of a time bucket. To warn about the extra supply, the planning line has a warning message, the **Accept Action Message** field isn't selected, and the action message is either **Cancel** or **Change Qty.**  

#### Calculating the planning line quantity  

The quantity on a planning line is calculated as follows:

planning line quantity = current supply quantity – (projected inventory – overflow level)  

> [!NOTE]  
> As with all warning lines, the maximum and minimum order quantity and order multiple are ignored.  

#### Defining the action message type  

* If the planning line quantity is higher than 0, the action message is **Change Qty.**  
* If the planning line quantity is equal to or less than 0, the action message is **Cancel**  

#### Composing the warning message  

If there's overflow, the **Untracked Planning Elements** page displays a warning message with the following information:  

* The projected inventory level that triggered the warning  
* The calculated overflow level  
* The due date of the supply event  

Example: “The projected inventory 120 is higher than the overflow level 60 on 01-28-23”  

### Example scenario  

In this scenario, a customer changes a sales order from 70 to 40 pieces between two planning runs. The overflow feature reduces the purchase that was suggested for the initial sales quantity.  

#### Item setup  

|Reordering Policy|Maximum Qty.|  
|-----------------------|------------------|  
|Maximum Order Quantity|100|  
|Reorder Point|50|  
|Inventory|80|  

#### Situation before a sales decrease  

|Event|Change Qty.|Projected Inventory|  
|-----------|-----------------|-------------------------|  
|Day one|None|80|  
|Sale|-70|10|  
|End of time bucket|None|10|  
|Suggest new purchase order|+90|100|  

#### Situation after sales decrease  

|Change|Change Qty.|Projected Inventory|  
|------------|-----------------|-------------------------|  
|Day one|None|80|  
|Sale|-40|40|  
|Purchase|+90|130|  
|End of time bucket|None|130|  
|Suggest to decrease purchase<br><br> order from 90 to 60|-30|100|  

#### Resulting planning lines  

The system creates a warning planning line to reduce the purchase by 30, from 90 to 60, to keep the projected inventory at 100 according to the overflow level.  

![Plan according to overflow level.](media/nav_app_supply_planning_2_overflow2.png "Plan according to overflow level")  

> [!NOTE]  
> Without the overflow feature, no warning is created if the projected inventory level is above the maximum, which could cause an extra supply of 30.

## Handling projected negative inventory

The reorder point expresses the anticipated demand during the lead time of the item. The projected inventory must be large enough to cover the demand until the new order is received. Meanwhile, the safety stock should take care of fluctuations in demand up to a targeted service level.  

The planning system considers it an emergency if a future demand can't be served from the projected inventory. Or, expressed in another way, that the projected inventory goes negative. The system suggests that you create a new supply order to cover the unmet part of the demand. The size of the new supply order doesn't consider the maximum inventory or the reorder quantity nor the following order modifiers:

* Maximum order quantity
* Minimum order quantity
* Order multiple 

Instead, it reflects the exact deficiency.  

The planning line for this type of supply order displays an **Emergency** warning icon provide additional information about the situation.  

In the following image, supply D represents an emergency order to adjust for negative inventory.  

![Emergency planning suggestion to avoid negative inventory.](media/nav_app_supply_planning_2_negative_inventory.png "Emergency planning suggestion to avoid negative inventory")  

1. Supply **A**, initial projected inventory, is below the reorder point.  
2. A new forward-scheduled supply is created (**C**).  

     (quantity = maximum inventory – projected inventory level)  
3. Supply **A** is closed by demand **B**, which isn't fully covered.  

     (Demand **B** could try to schedule Supply C in, but the time-bucket prevents that.)  
4. New supply (**D**) is created to cover the remaining quantity on Demand **B**.  
5. Demand **B** is closed (creating a reminder to the projected inventory).  
6. The new supply **D** is closed.  
7. Projected inventory is checked. The reorder point isn't crossed.  
8. Supply **C** is closed (there's no more demand).  
9. Final check. There are no outstanding inventory level reminders.  

The following section describes the characteristics of the four supported reordering policies.

## Reordering policies

Reordering policies define how much to order when the item needs to be replenished. Four different reordering policies exist.  

### Fixed Reorder Quantity

The Fixed Reorder Qty. policy is typically used for inventory planning for items with the following characteristics:

* Low inventory cost
* Low risk of obsolescence
* Low number of items

Typically, use this policy with a reorder point that reflects the anticipated demand during the item's lead time.  

#### Calculated per time bucket  

If you reach or cross at the reorder point in a time bucket (reorder cycle), the system suggests two actions:

* Create a new supply order for the reorder quantity
* Forward schedule the order from the first date after the end of the time bucket  

The time bucketed reorder point reduces the number of supply suggestions. It reflects a process of manually checking to actual contents of bins in your warehouse.  

#### Creates only necessary supply  

Before it suggests a new supply order to meet a reorder point, the planning system checks for the following supply:

* Whether supply is already ordered
* Whether you expect to receive the supply within the item’s lead time

The system doesn't suggest a new supply order if a supply brings the projected inventory to the reorder point within the lead time.  

Supply orders that are created specifically to meet a reorder point are excluded from supply balancing and aren't changed. If you want to phase out an item that has a reorder point, review your outstanding supply orders manually or change the reordering policy to **Lot-for-Lot**. The system reduces or cancels extra supply.  

#### Combines with order modifiers  

The Minimum Order Quantity, Maximum Order Quantity, and Order Multiple order modifiers shouldn't play a significant role when you use the Fixed Reorder Qty. policy. However, the planning system takes them into account:

* Decrease the quantity to the specified maximum order quantity (and create two or more supplies in order to reach the total order quantity)
* Increase the order to the specified minimum order quantity
* Round up the order quantity to meet a specified order multiple  

#### Combines with calendars  

Before suggesting a new supply order to meet a reorder point, the planning system checks whether the order is scheduled for a nonworking day. It uses the calendars you specify in the **Base Calendar Code** field on the **Company Information** and **Location Card** pages.  

If the scheduled date is a nonworking day, the planning system moves the order forward to the nearest work day. Moving the date might result in an order that meets a reorder point but doesn't meet a specific demand. For such unbalanced demand, the planning system creates an extra supply.  

#### Shouldn't be used with forecasts  

Because the anticipated demand is already expressed in the reorder point level, it isn't necessary to include a forecast in the planning. If it's relevant to base the plan on a forecast, use the **Lot-for-Lot** policy.  

#### Must not be used with reservations  

If you reserve a quantity, for instance a quantity in inventory, for a distant demand, you might disturb the planning foundation. Even if the projected inventory level is acceptable in relation to the reorder point, the quantities might not be available. The system might try to compensate by creating exception orders. However, we recommend that the **Reserve** field is set to **Never** on items that are planned using a reorder point.

### Maximum Quantity

The Maximum Quantity policy is a way to maintain inventory using a reorder point.  

Everything regarding the Fixed Reorder Qty. policy also applies to this policy. The only difference is the quantity of the suggested supply. When you use the maximum quantity policy, the reorder quantity is defined dynamically based on the projected inventory level. Therefore, it usually differs from order to order.  

#### Calculate per time bucket

When you reach or cross the reorder point, the system determines the reorder quantity at the end of a time bucket. It measures the gap between the current projected inventory level and the specified maximum inventory to determine the quantity to order. The system then checks:

* Whether supply is already ordered
* Whether you expect to receive the supply within the item’s lead time

If so, the system reduces the quantity of the new supply order by the quantities already ordered.  

If you don't specify a maximum inventory quantity, the planning system ensures that the projected inventory reaches the reorder quantity.

#### Combine with order modifiers

Depending on your setup, it might be best to combine the Maximum Quantity policy with order modifiers:

* Ensure a minimum order quantity
* Round the quantity to an integer number of purchase units of measure
* Split the quantity into lots as defined by the maximum order quantity  

### Combine with calendars

Before suggesting a new supply order to meet a reorder point, the planning system checks whether the order is scheduled for a nonworking day. It uses the calendars you specify in the **Base Calendar Code** field in the **Company Information** and **Location Card** pages.  

If the scheduled date is a nonworking day, the planning system moves the order forward to the nearest work day. Moving the date might result in an order that meets a reorder point but doesn't meet a specific demand. For such unbalanced demand, the planning system creates an extra supply.

### Order

In a make-to-order environment, an item is purchased or produced to cover a specific demand. Typically, the Order reordering policy is used for items with the following characteristics

* Demand is infrequent
* The lead-time is insignificant
* Required attributes vary  

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates an order-to-order link, which acts as a preliminary connection between the supply (a supply order or inventory) and the demand. You can apply the order-to-order link during planning in the following ways:  

* When you use the Make-to-Order manufacturing policy to create multi-level or project type production orders (producing needed components on the same production order)  
* When you use sales order planning to create a production order from a sales order  

> [!TIP]
> If item attributes don't vary, it might be best to use a Lot-for-Lot reordering policy. As a result, the system uses unplanned inventory and only accumulates sales orders with the same shipment date or within a defined time bucket.  

#### Order-to-order links and past due dates

Unlike most supply-demand sets, linked orders with due dates before the planning starting date are fully planned for by the system. The reason for this exception is that specific demand-supply sets must be synchronized. To learn more about the frozen zone that applies to most demand-supply types, go to [Process orders before the planning start date](design-details-balancing-demand-and-supply.md#process-orders-before-the-planning-start-date).

### Lot-for-Lot

The Lot-for-Lot policy is the most flexible because the system only reacts to actual demand. It acts on anticipated demand from forecast and blanket orders and then settles the order quantity based on the demand. The policy is intended for items where inventory can be accepted but should be avoided.  

In some ways, the Lot-for-Lot policy is similar to the Order policy. It can accept quantities in inventory, and it bundles demand and supply in the time buckets you define.

You specify the time bucket in the **Time Bucket** field on the **Item Card** page. The minimum size of time bucket is one day, because that's the smallest time unit of measure on demand and supply events in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

The time bucket also limits when you should reschedule a supply order to meet a given demand. Supply within the time bucket is rescheduled in or out to meet the demand. Earlier supply causes extra inventory, and you should cancel it. For supply that's later, create a new supply order.  

With this policy, you can specify a safety stock to compensate for changes in supply or to meet a sudden demand. The lot-for-lot policy can also include a dampener period and dampener quantity to reduce order scheduling.  

Together with the **Rescheduling Period** field, the **Lot Accumulation Period** field contributes to defining the reorder cycle. From the date of the first demand, the system accumulates all demands in the next lot accumulation period into one supply order on the date of the first demand. Demand that is outside the lot accumulation period isn't covered by the supply order.

Because the supply order quantity is based on the actual demand, it can make sense to use order modifiers:

* Round up the order quantity to meet an order multiple (or purchase unit of measure)
* Increase the order to a specified minimum order quantity
* Decrease the quantity to the specified maximum quantity (and thus create two or more supplies to reach the total needed quantity)

# Walkthrough: Tracing Serial/Lot Numbers

<!-- [!INCLUDE[complete_sample_data](includes/complete_sample_data.md)]   -->

When product defects occur, the errors must be identified and affected items must be prevented from leaving the company. If defective items have already been shipped, you must trace who received them and, if you need to, recall the items.  

The first task of defects management is to investigate where the defective items came from and where they were used. This investigation is based on historic data and is made easier by searching through item tracking entries using the **Item Tracing** page.  

The second task of defects management is to determine whether the traced items are planned for in open documents, such as non-posted sales orders or consumption journals. This work is performed on the **Find entries** page. You can use the Find Entries feature to search all kinds of database records.  

## About This Walkthrough

This walkthrough demonstrates how to identify which items are defective, which vendor supplied them, and where they are used so that those orders can be stopped or recalled.  

This walkthrough illustrates the following tasks:  

- Tracing usage to origin.  
- Tracing origin to usage.  
- Searching for all current records which hold the traced serial/lot number.  

## Roles

This walkthrough demonstrates tasks that are performed by the following user roles:  

- Quality Controller  
- Warehouse Manager  
- Order Processor  
- Purchasing Agent  

## Prerequisites

To complete this walkthrough, you will need:  

- The [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] company.  
<!-- - To create new items and several business transactions by following the [Prepare Sample Data](walkthrough-tracing-serial-lot-numbers.md#prepare-sample-data).   -->

## Story

Ricardo, the quality controller, is acting on a sales return of item 1002, Racing Bike. The customer, Selangorian Ltd., complained that the frame has cracked welding seams. Quality control engineers have confirmed that the racing frame of the returned bike is defective. The quality controller must now determine:  

- Which lot of racing frames was faulty.  
- On which purchase order the faulty lot was received.  

From the sales department, the quality controller knows that the returned racing bike, item 1002, had the serial number SN1. By using this basic information, they must determine where the finished racing bike was last used, and then they must trace backward to the earliest origin to establish which lot number the faulty component, the racing frame, came from.  

The results of this first item tracking task identify which racing frames were defective and which vendor supplied them. Afterward, but in the same overall tracking process, the quality controller must find all the sold racing bikes that contain racing frames from the faulty lot so that those orders can be stopped or recalled. Lastly, the quality controller must find any open documents where the faulty lot is used so that no additional transactions are made.  

The first two defects-management tasks are performed on the **Item Tracing** page. The last task is performed on the **Find entries** page in integration with the **Item Tracing** page.  

## Prepare Sample Data

You must create the following new items:  

- 2000, Racing Frame: lot-specific tracking, component of 1002  
- 1002, Racing Bike: serial number-specific tracking  

Then you must create various purchase, production, and sales transactions with the two items.  

### To create the items  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. In the **No.** field, enter **2000**, and then proceed to fill in the following fields.

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  Do not post the last sales order for five racing frames.  

    This completes the preparation of data to demonstrate the Item Tracing and Find Entries features.  

## Tracing from Usage to Origin

 From the sales department, the quality controller knows that the returned racing bike, item 1002, has the serial number SN1. By using this basic information, they can determine where the finished racing bike was last used, in this case, on the sales shipment to Selangorian Ltd.. Then, the quality controller must trace backward to the earliest origin to establish which lot number the faulty racing frame came from and which vendor supplied it.  

### To determine which lot included the faulty frame and who supplied it

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Item Tracing**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  On the **Item Tracing** page, enter **SN1** in the **Serial No. Filter** field, and then enter **1002** in the **Item Filter** field.  
3.  Keep the default setting of **Item-Tracked Only** in the **Show Components** field, and keep the default trace method of **Usage – Origin** in the **Trace Method**.  
4.  Choose the **Trace** action.  

    Note that one sales shipment header matches the search criteria. Before you continue the trace, verify that the shipment is the one that shipped the faulty racing bike to Selangorian Ltd.  

5.  Select the trace line, and then choose the **Show Document** action.  

    Now continue to trace the origin of the sales shipment of the racing bike with number SN1.  
6.  Choose the + icon on the trace lines to gradually expand and trace backward in the chain of transactions that the sales shipment originates from.  

    You can trace the following transaction history:  

    - The first posted document backward in the chain of transactions is the output posting of SN1 from the first released production order.  
    - The next posted document backward after that is the consumption posting from the first released production order. Here the quality controller sees that a racing frame from LOT1 was used.  
    - The lowest posted document in this chain is the posted purchase receipt on which racing frames with LOT1 entered inventory.  

    The quality controller has now established which lot of racing frames was faulty and they can search for the last trace line to see which vendor supplied them, namely Custom Metals Incorporated.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  Do not make any additional modifications to the trace result, as you will use it in the next section.  

     This completes the first defects-management task using the **Item Tracing** page. The quality controller must now determine whether other posted documents have processed racing frames from LOT1.  

## Tracing from Origin to Usage

 The quality controller has established that the faulty racing frames came from LOT1. They must now find any other racing bikes that contain racing frames from the faulty lot so that those bikes can be stopped or recalled.  

 One way to prepare this trace task on the **Item Tracing** page is to manually enter LOT1 in the **Lot No. Filter** field and 2000 in the **Item Filter** field. However, this walkthrough will use the **Trace Opposite - from Line** function.  

### To find all usage of the faulty lot  

1.  On the **Item Tracing** page, select the line of the purchase receipt, the last trace line, and then choose **Trace Opposite – from Line**.  

    The trace result is now based on the filters of the trace line for the purchase receipt, LOT1 and item 2000, and the result is based on trace method **Origin - Usage**.  

    To obtain an overview of all usage of item 2000 with LOT1, continue to expand all trace lines.  

2.  Choose the **Expand All** action.  

    The first four trace lines refer to the sales shipment to Selangorian Ltd., which is already resolved. The last line indicates that one more racing bike, SN2, was produced in the same released production order and then sold and shipped on another sales shipment.  

    The quality controller immediately informs the sales department so that they can initiate a recall of the defective racing bike from the customer, Cannon Group PLC.  

    At the same time, they can see from the last three trace lines that another two items, SN3 and SN4, have been produced based on racing frames from LOT1. They take action to block these end items in inventory.  

    This completes the second defects management task using the **Item Tracing** page for defects management. Since the **Item Tracing** page is based on posted entries only, the quality controller must continue to the **Find entries** page to make sure that LOT1 is not used in non-posted documents.  

## Finding All Records of a Serial/Lot Number

 With the **Item Tracing** page, the quality controller learned that LOT1 contained the faulty racing frames, which vendor supplied them, and in which posted transaction they have been used. They must now determine whether LOT1 is in any open documents by integrating from the trace result to the **Find entries** page where they can perform a search through all database records.  

### To find all occurrences of LOT1 in non-posted records, such as open orders  

1.  On the **Item Tracing** page, select the first trace line, the purchase receipt of LOT1.  
2.  Choose the **Find entries** action.  

    The **Find entries** page is preset with search filters based on the trace result for LOT1. The quality controller recognizes most of the records as pertaining to documents already identified on the **Item Tracing** page. For example, the last Find Entries line of type Production Order refers to the two released production orders that consumed racing frames from LOT1.  

    However, the second Find Entries line of type **Sales Line** is a non-posted document line, so the quality controller proceeds to investigate.  

3.  To open the sales line record, select the second Find Entries line, choose the **Show** action. Alternatively, choose the value in the **No. of Records** field.  

    Here the quality controller sees one open sales line for the faulty racing frames. They immediately suggest to the sales department that this order be canceled and a new production order, based on good racing frames, be initiated.  

 This completes the walkthrough of how to use the **Find entries** page for defects management in integration with the **Item Tracing** page.

# Display a stockout warning

When someone enters a quantity for an item on a sales document that exceeds the item's current inventory level at the location, you might want to let them know by displaying a notification. The notification is just to inform them of the potential problem, and doesn't prevent them from creating the order.

## To show a warning about low inventory on a sales document

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales & Receivables Setup**, and then choose the related link.
1. Depending on whether you want to show the warning, turn on or turn off the **Stockout Warning** toggle.

## Video guidance

The following video shows a scenario where someone is creating a sales order, and the quantity exceeds the available inventory level for the item at its location.

# Managing VAT rate changes

VAT rates can change depending on local legislation. Any change in VAT impacts your data in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] whether the VAT rate is lowered, raised, or removed. VAT is connected to many entities in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], such as customers, vendors, items, resources, item charges, and general ledger accounts. Changes in VAT rates usually happen at a specific date. Before that date, you should change your VAT setup, posting groups, and so on, so that new sales orders and purchase orders use the new VAT rate.

## Changing VAT rates

A good approach to managing a VAT rate change is to fully post and close open orders and other documents before the date of the rate change. Posting and closing helps ensure that the orders and documents aren't affected. This approach is the cleanest because it lets you start new orders and documents with the new VAT rate.

The following approach is suggested to manage a VAT rate change:

1. Post and close open orders, journals, and other documents fully before the switch date. However, you can wait until afterward as long as you don't add new lines and you ensure the effective date is before the switch date.  
2. Create the new VAT setup.  
3. Make the VAT switch on the relevant entities, such as customers, vendors, items, and so on.  
4. On the VAT rate switch date, you create new documents that use the new rate.  

## The VAT Rate Change tool

The VAT Rate Change tool can help you convert VAT rates on master data, journals, and orders. The tool is useful if you want to convert VAT on master data more easily or if you have orders that you can't close before the switch date. However, there are a few restrictions and limitations.

## Understanding the VAT rate conversion process and limitations

The VAT Rate Change tool converts VAT rates for master data, journals, and orders in different ways. The new general product posting group or VAT product post group update the selected master data and journals. If an order was fully or partially shipped, the shipped items keep the current general product posting group or VAT product posting group. A new order line is created for the unshipped items and updated to align current and new VAT or general product posting groups. Also, item charge assignments, configuration templates for items, reservations, and item tracking information updates accordingly.

On order lines, the unit price updates for all lines of the type Item and Resource, if you're using prices including VAT for the item. For other line types, you can decide whether to update the unit price.

There are a few things that the tool doesn't convert:

* Sales or purchase orders and invoices where shipments were posted. These documents are posted using the current VAT rate.  
* Documents with posted prepayment invoices. For example, you made or received prepayments on invoices that aren't completed before you use the VAT rate change tool. In this case, there's a difference between the VAT that's due and the VAT that was paid in the prepayments when the invoice is completed. The VAT rate change tool skips these documents and you must manually update them.  
* Sales or purchase orders with warehouse integration if they're partially shipped or received.  
* Drop shipments.
* Special orders.
* Assembly orders.
* Service contracts.  
* Credit memos.
* Return orders.
* Prices on items (master data)
* Prices on sales prices (master data)
* Business posting groups on customers and vendors.

### To prepare VAT rate change conversions

Before you set up the VAT rate change tool, make the following preparations.

* If you have transactions that use different rates, separate them into different groups. Do that either by creating new general ledger accounts for each rate or by using data filters to group transactions according to rate.  
* If you create new general ledger accounts, you must create new general posting groups.  
* To reduce the number of documents that get converted, post as many documents as possible. The fewer unposted documents you have, the better.  
* Back up data.

### To set up the VAT rate change tool

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Rate Change Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Master Data**, **Journals**, and **Documents** FastTabs, choose a posting group value from the option list for needed fields. For each group, choose whether to convert VAT product posting groups or general product posting groups, or convert both values if they're available for the master data. For some areas, you can also filter to convert only a subset of values, for example, G/L accounts.
3. On the **Unit Price Incl. VAT** FastTab, choose which line types on orders for which you want to update unit prices. Unit prices on lines of type Item and Resource always update.

### To set up product posting group conversion

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Rate Change Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **VAT Rate Change Setup** page, choose either the **VAT Prod. Posting Group Conv.** or **Gen Prod. Posting Group Conv.** action.  
3. In the **From Code** field, enter the current posting group.  
4. In the **To Code** field, enter the new posting group.  

### To perform VAT rate change conversion

You use the VAT rate change tool to manage changes in the standard rate of VAT. You perform VAT and general posting group conversions to change VAT rates and maintain accurate VAT reporting. Depending on your setup, the following changes happen:  

* VAT and general posting groups are converted.  
* Changes are implemented in general ledger accounts, customers, vendors, open documents, journal lines, and so on.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Before you perform VAT rate change conversion, you can test the conversion. To do so, follow these steps, but make sure to clear the **Perform Conversion** and **VAT Rate Change Tool Completed** checkboxes. During test conversion, the **Converted** field in the **VAT Rate Change Log Entry** table is cleared and the **Converted Date** field in the **VAT Rate Change Log Entry** table is blank. After the conversion completes, choose **VAT Rate Change Log Entries** to view the results of the test conversion. Verify each entry before you perform the conversion. In particular, verify transactions that use an old VAT rate.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Rate Change**, and then choose the **VAT Rate Change Setup** link.  
2. Verify that you already set up the VAT product posting group conversion or general product posting group conversion.  
3. Choose the **Perform Conversion** checkbox.  

    > [!IMPORTANT]  
    > Clear the **VAT Rate Change Tool Completed** checkbox. The checkbox is automatically selected when the VAT rate change conversion is completed.  

4. Choose the **Convert** action.  
5. After the conversion is complete, choose the **VAT Rate Change Log Entries** action to view the results of the conversion.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> After the conversion, the **Converted** field in the **VAT Rate Change Log Entry** table is chosen and the **Converted Date** field in the **VAT Rate Change Log Entry** table displays the conversion date.

# Create workflows to connect tasks in business processes

You can create workflows that connect tasks that different people do in business processes. You can include system tasks, such as automatic posting, as steps in workflows that user tasks precede or follow. Requesting and granting approval to create new records are typical workflow steps.  

On the **Workflow** page, create a workflow by listing the steps on the lines. Each step consists of a trigger and a response:

* An event that specifies the conditions that start the workflow.
* A workflow response that defines what the workflow does.

[!INCLUDE[workflow](includes/workflow.md)]

When you create workflows, you can copy the steps from existing workflows or from workflow templates. Workflow templates are noneditable workflows that [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides. The identifiers for workflow templates are prefixed with "MS-". For example, "MS-PIW." Learn more at [Create Workflows from Workflow Templates](across-how-to-create-workflows-from-workflow-templates.md).  

> [!NOTE]  
> All notifications about workflow steps are sent through a job queue. Make sure the job queue reflects your business needs. Learn more at [Use Job Queues to Schedule Tasks](admin-job-queues-schedule-tasks.md).  

:::image type="content" source="media/Workflows/workflow-example.png" alt-text="Illustration of a workflow example.":::

A workflow is divided into three sections:

1. **When Event**  
   This is where you select the trigger.  

   Examples of a trigger:

   * A master data record is changed
   * A journal line is created
   * An incoming document is created or released
   * Approval of a document is requested
2. **On Condition**  
   Conditions are related to the event and allow you to create filters to specify how the workflow continues.
3. **Then Response**  
   Responses specify the next steps in the workflow.

The options for events and responses are system-defined. To add new options, you must develop an extension.

## To create a workflow

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Workflows**, then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action. The **Workflow** page opens.  
3. In the **Code** field, enter a maximum of 20 characters to identify the workflow.  
4. To create the workflow from a workflow template, on the **Workflows** page, choose the **New Workflow from Template** action. Learn more at [Create Workflows from Workflow Templates](across-how-to-create-workflows-from-workflow-templates.md).  
5. In the **Description** field, describe the workflow.  
6. In the **Category** field, specify which category the workflow belongs to.  
7. In the **When Event** field, specify the event that must occur to start the workflow step.  

   When you choose the field, the **Workflow Events** page lists all available workflow events.  
8. In the **On Condition** field, specify one or more conditions that must be met before the event in the **When Event** field can occur.  

   When you choose the field, the **Event Conditions** page lists filter fields that can be conditions for the event. You can add new filter fields if you want.  

   If the workflow event is the change of a specific field on a record, use the **Event Conditions** page to select the field and the type of change.  

   1. To specify a field change for the event, on the **Event Conditions** page, in the **Field** field, select the field that changes.  
   2. In the **Operator** field, select either **Decreased**, **Increased**, or **Changed**.  
9. In the **Then Response** field, specify the response when the workflow event occurs.  

   When you choose the field, the **Workflow Responses** page lists all available workflow responses and response options.  
10. On the **Options for the Selected Response** FastTab, specify options for the workflow response by selecting values in the different fields that appear, as follows:  

    1. To specify options for a workflow response that involves sending a notification, fill the fields as described in the following table.  

    > [!NOTE]
    > These fields vary, depending on the response you chose.

       |Field|Description|
       |-----|-----------|
       |**Notify Sender**|Specify whether to notify the approval requestor instead of the approval request recipient. If you select the checkbox, the **Recipient User ID** field is disabled because the requestor of the approval, the sender, is notified instead. The name of the workflow response changes accordingly, to **Create Notification for &lt;Sender&gt;**. If the checkbox isn't selected, the name of the workflow response is **Create Notification for &lt;User&gt;**.|
       |**Recipient User ID**|Specify the user the notification must be sent to. **Note**: This option is only available for workflow responses with a placeholder for a specific user. For workflow responses without placeholders for users, the notification recipient is typically defined by the **Approval User Setup**.|
       |**Notification Entry Type**|Specify a trigger for the workflow notification. The trigger can be a record change, an approval request, or passed due date.|
       |**Link Target Page**|Specify the page that the link in the notification opens. The page must have the same source table as the record involved.|
       |**Custom Link**|Specify the URL of a link included in the notification in addition to the link to the page.|

    2. To specify options for a workflow response that involves creating an approval request, fill the fields as described in the following table.  

       |Field|Description|  
       |-----|-----------|  
       |**Due Date Formula**|Specify the number of days the approver has to resolve the request. The period starts when the request is sent.|
       |**Delegate After**|Specify if and when an approval request is automatically delegated to the substitute. You can select to automatically delegate one, two, or five days after the date when the approval was requested.|
       |**Approver Type**|Specify who the approver is, according to the setup of approval users and workflow users. When the field is set to **Salesperson/Purchaser**, the user specified in the **Salespers./Purch. Code** field on the **Approval User Setup** page determines the approver. Approval request entries are then created according to the value in the **Approver Limit Type** field. Learn more at [Set Up Approval Users](across-how-to-set-up-workflow-users.md).|
       |**Show Confirmation Message**|Specify whether to show a confirmation message after a user requests an approval.|
       |**Approver Limit Type**|Specify the effect of limits for approvers. An approver's approval limit must be above the value on the request. The following options exist: <ol><li>**Approver Chain** specifies that approval request entries are created for all the requester's approvers up to and including the first qualified approver</li><li>**Direct Approver** specifies that an approval request entry is only created for the requester's immediate approver, regardless of the approver's approval limit.</li><li>**First Qualified Approver** specifies that an approval request entry is only created for the requester's first approver.</li><li>**Specific Approver** specifies that you notify the user chosen in the **Approver ID** field.</li></ol>|

    3. To specify options for a workflow response that involves creating journal lines, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

       |Field|Description|  
       |-----|-----------|  
       |**General Journal Template Name**|Specify the name of the general journal template that the specified journal lines are created in.|  
       |**General Journal Batch Name**|Specify the name of the general journal batch that the specified journal lines are created in.|  

11. Choose the **Increase Indent** and **Decrease Indent** buttons to indent the event name in the **When** field to define the step's position in the workflow.  

    1. To indicate that it's the next step, indent the event under the name of the previous step.  
    2. Indicate the step is one of several alternative steps that might start, depending on its condition, by indenting the event name to match the other alternative steps. Order such optional steps according to priority by placing the most important step first.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > You can only change the indent of a step that doesn't have a subsequent step.  

12. Repeat steps 7 through 11 to add more workflow steps, either before or after the step you created.  
13. Turn on the **Enabled** toggle to specify that the workflow starts when the event on the first step of type **Entry Point** occurs. Learn more at [Use Workflows](across-use-workflows.md).

    2. In the **On Condition** field, choose the word **Always**. Then, on the **Event Conditions** page, choose the **Add a condition for when a field value changes** link, then select the **Name** field. The result of this step is that the condition reads as *Name is Changed*.  
    3. In the **Then Response** field, choose the **Select Response** link. Then, on the **Workflow Responses** page, in the **Select Response** field, choose the **Revert the value of the \<Field\> field on the record and save the change** response. Then, in the **Options for the Selected Response** section, specify the **Name** field.  
    4. Choose the **Add More Responses** link, then add an entry for the **Create an approval request for the record using approver type <%1> and <%2>** response.  
    5. In the **Options for the Selected Response** section for the new response, change the **Approver type** field to **Workflow User Group**. Then, in the **Workflow User Group** field, specify the user group. Learn more at [Set Up Approval Users](across-how-to-set-up-approval-users.md).  
    6. Add a third response, **Send approval request for the record and create a notification**.  
    7. Add a fourth response, **Show message "%1"**. Then, in the **Options for the Selected Response** section, in the **Message** field, specify **An approval request has been sent**.  
    8. Choose **OK** to return to the workflow step.  

5. In the next line, add a new workflow step for the **An approval request is approved** event.

    1. In the **When Event** field, specify **An approval request is approved**.  
    2. Choose the line menu, then choose **Increase Indent**.  
    3. In the **On Condition** field, choose **Always**. Then, in the **Pending Approvals** field, specify **0**. The condition reads as **Pending Approvals:0** to indicate that the request doesn't require more approvers.  
    4. In the **Then Response** field, choose the **Select Response** link. Then, on the **Workflow Responses** page, in the **Select Response** field, choose the **Send approval request for the record and create a notification** response.  
    5. Choose **OK**.  
6. In the next line, add a second workflow step for the **An approval request is approved** event.  

    1. In the **When Event** field, specify **An approval request is approved**.
    2. In the **On Condition** field, choose **Always**. Then, in the **Pending Approvals** field, specify **>0**. The condition reads as **Pending Approvals:>0** to indicate that this isn't the last approver.  
    3. In the **Then Response** field, choose the **Select Response** link. Then, on the **Workflow Responses** page, in the **Select Response** field, choose the **Send approval request for the record and create a notification** response.  
    4. Choose **OK**.  
7. In the next line, add a workflow step for the **An approval request is delegated** event.  

    1. In the **When Event** field, specify **An approval request is delegated**.  
    2. In the **On Condition** field, leave the value as **Always**.  
    3. In the **Then Response** field, choose the **Select Response** link. Then, on the **Workflow Responses** page, in the **Select Response** field, choose the **Send approval request for the record and create a notification** response.  
    4. Choose **OK**.  
8. In the next line, add a second workflow step for the **An approval request is rejected** event.  

    1. In the **When Event** field, specify **An approval request is rejected**.  
    2. In the **On Condition** field,  leave the value as **Always**.  
    3. In the **Then Response** field, choose the **Select Response** link. Then, on the **Workflow Responses** page, in the **Select Response** field, choose the **Discard the new values** response.  
    4. Choose the **Add More Responses** link, then add an entry for the **Reject the approval request for the record and create a notification** response
    5. Choose **OK**.  
9. To enable the workflow, turn on the **Enabled** toggle.  

The following illustration provides an overview of the result of this procedure.  

:::image type="content" source="media/Workflows/workflow-example-2.png" alt-text="Illustration of the Vendor Name Approval workflow.":::

# About unit cost calculation

Each item has a unit cost that is calculated based on the company's costing method and other factors. As a rule, with the *Standard* costing method, the **Unit Cost** field value is based on the standard cost for the item. For all other costing methods (*FIFO*, *LIFO*, *Specific*, and *Average*), the unit cost is calculated based on the average unit cost across a period of time.  

## When is the unit cost field updated for item

The chosen costing method influences when the **Unit Cost** field is updated.

When the costing method is set as *Standard*, the **Unit Cost** field is updated whenever the standard cost is changed, and users can't edit the **Unit Cost** field. For more information, see [About Calculating Standard Cost](finance-about-calculating-standard-cost.md).

If the costing method is *FIFO*, *LIFO*, *Specific*, or *Average*, then the **Unit Cost** is updated in the following cases:

* When the item is cost-adjusted, automatically or by an [Adjust Cost](inventory-how-adjust-item-costs.md#to-adjust-item-costs-manually) task.
* During the posting of purchase invoices, output, or positive adjustment if one of the following conditions is true:
  * The net invoiced quantity of the item changes from negative or zero to positive.
  * The current unit cost is zero.

If one of these conditions is true, then the **Unit Cost** field is updated with the value in the **Last Direct Cost** field on the item card.

> [!NOTE]
> The **Unit Cost** field is not updated if the current unit cost is higher than zero and the new unit cost is zero. A unit cost of zero is considered an exception from regular business. Therefore, the current unit cost is retained to provide the last known, relevant value. This exception applies even if the existing inventory has been revalued to zero.

In the **Unit Cost** field on the item card, you can drill down to view the history of transactions that the average cost of units on hand is calculated from in the **Average Cost Calc. Overview** window.

## Impact of unit cost field on purchases and sales
How the contents of the **Costing Method** field influence the unit cost calculation for purchases and sales is described in more detail in the following sections.

### Unit cost calculation for purchases

When you purchase items, the value in the **Last Direct Cost** field on the item card is copied to the **Direct Unit Cost** field on a purchase line or to the **Unit Amount** line on an item journal line.

What you select in the **Costing Method** field influences how [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates the contents of the **Unit Cost** field on the lines.

#### Costing method FIFO, LIFO, Specific, or Average

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates the contents of the **Unit Cost (LCY)** field on the purchase line or the contents of the **Unit Cost** field on the item journal line according to the following formula:

*Unit Cost (LCY) = (Direct Unit Cost – (Discount Amount / Quantity)) x (1 + Indirect Cost % / 100) + Overhead Rate*

#### Costing method Standard

The **Unit Cost (LCY)** field on the purchase line or the **Unit Cost** field is filled on the item journal line by copying the value in the **Unit Cost** field on the item card. By using costing method set as *Standard*, this value is always based on the standard cost.

When you post the purchase, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses the unit cost from the purchase line or item journal line to the purchase item invoice entry. You can see it on the entry list for the item.

#### All costing methods

The unit cost from the source document line is used to calculate the contents of the **Cost Amount (Actual)** field, or if applicable, the **Cost Amount (Expected)** field that relates to this item entry, regardless of the costing method of the item.

### Unit cost calculation for sales

When you sell items, the unit cost is copied from the **Unit Cost** field on the item card to the sales line or the item journal line.

When you post, the unit cost is copied to the sales invoice item entry, and it can be seen on the entry list for the item. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses the unit cost from the source document line to calculate the contents of the **Cost Amount (Actual)** field, or if applicable, the **Cost Amount (Expected)** field in the value entry related to this item entry.

<!--
## To make general changes in the last direct unit cost

If you need to change the direct unit cost for several items, you can use the **Adjust Item Costs/Prices** batch job.  

The batch job changes the contents in the **Unit Price** field on the item card. The batch job changes the content of the field in the same way for all items or selected items. The batch job multiplies the value in the field by an adjustment factor that you specify.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Adjust Item Costs/Prices**, and then choose the related link.  
2. In the **Adjust Field** field, specify which item or SKU card field you want to adjust.  
3. In the **Adjustment Factor** field, specify the factor by which to adjust the value. For example, enter **1.5** to increase the value by 50%.  
4. On the **Item** FastTab, set filters to specify, for example, which items to process with the batch job.  
5. Choose the **OK** button.

# Sustainability management overview

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This feature is available in Business Central starting from **2024 release wave 1**.  

Business Central offers a sustainability management feature that helps you monitor and manage your organization's and its effect on the environment. This feature is designed to oversee and regulate an organization's environmental footprint by tracking various greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In this way, it facilitates proper insights. The feature supports the basic process of collecting emission data via sustainability journals or purchase documents, and recalculation of emissions to CO2 equivalent. You can either manually enter known data or use built-in methods for calculating emissions footprints; calculation using formulas are available for use only when using sustainability journals.   

> [!NOTE]
> This solution is still in early stages of development and new set of features will be added with the next release.  

The first version of the feature focuses on GHG emissions. The environmental, social, and governance (ESG) standard defines three emission scopes:

- **Scope 1 emissions** include emissions from stationary and mobile combustion, and from inadvertent fugitive emissions.
- **Scope 2 emissions** include indirect emissions from the generation of energy that is purchased from utility providers.
- **Scope 3 emissions** include a wide spectrum of emissions, from purchased goods and services and capital goods, to fuel and energy–related activities, to upstream and downstream transportation, to generated waste, to business travel and employee commuting, and so on.

With this feature, you can:

- Set up emission factors for different sources and categories of GHG emissions.
- Record emission data in sustainability journals, either manually or by using predefined calculation methods.
- Record emission data directly working with purchase documents.
- Record purchase of carbon credit using purchase documents.
- Calculate internal carbon fee.
- Recalculate emission of all gasses to CO2 equivalent using formulas.
- Post emission entries (and carbon credits) to the sustainability ledger, where you can view and analyze the emission data by various dimensions.
- Set scorecards and goals and compare them with baseline and targeted values.
- Generate sustainability reports that show your organization's GHG emissions performance.
- Use financial reports for cross functional reporting.

# Set Up Fault Reporting
Fault reporting lets you establish standards for recording fault information for service items. For example, you can specify what the problem is, the symptoms you see, the reason for the problem, and how to resolve it.  

Fault codes describe the typical service item faults or the actions taken on service items. Depending on the level of fault reporting in your company, you might need to set up fault area codes and symptom codes before you set up fault codes. Fault areas describe areas of service item faults. Fault reason codes describe the reason for service item faults and, if needed, whether to exclude warranty and contract discounts. For example, you might want to exclude warranty and contract discounts if the customer was somehow responsible for the fault in the service item. You assign fault reason codes to service orders. For more information, see [Work on Service Tasks](service-how-to-work-on-service-tasks.md).  

## To specify the overall level of fault reporting
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. In the **Fault Reporting Level** field, choose one of the options described in the following table.  

    |**Fault Level**|**Description**|  
    |------------|-------------|  
    |None | No reporting codes are used.|  
    |Fault | Codes are listed in the **Fault Codes** table. These codes identify service item faults or actions to take on service items. You can cluster related codes into **Fault Area Code** groupings.|  
    |Fault + Symptom | You provide a combination of codes in the **Fault Codes** and **Symptom Codes** tables. Typical symptom codes include indicators that a customer might use to describe a problem, such as a noise or a quality.|  
    |Fault + Symptom + Area | You use fault, symptom, and fault area codes as an implementation of the International Repair Coding System (IRIS).|  

To complete the setup of fault reporting, you can also specify what repairs or resolutions are associated with a fault or defect. You set that up on the **Fault/Resolution Code Relationships** page, where you set up combinations of codes for the service item group of the service item from which you accessed the window and the number of occurrences for each one.

## To create fault and resolution code relationships
<!--this needs to go in a working with topic-->
To be able to see the most common methods of repair for particular item faults when you are servicing the items, you need to build up information on fault/resolution codes relationships. Use the **Insert Fault/Resol. Codes Relationships** batch job to find all the combination of fault and resolution codes in posted service orders and record them on the **Fault/Resol. Codes Relationships** page.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Insert Fault/Resol. Codes Relationships**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Enter dates to define the period you want to include in the batch job.  
3. To group the relationships by service item group, choose the **Relation Based on Service Item Group** check box.  
4. To retain the records that you have already inserted manually on the **Fault/Resol. Codes Relationships** page, choose the **Retain Manually Inserted Rec.** check box.

# Autofill fields with Copilot (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]

Copilot's autofill feature assists you by automatically filling in editable blank fields on your page. Use autofill when creating or modifying a record. It suggests field values that you can choose to keep or discard. These suggestions are based on your Business Central data, such as frequently or recently used values, or they can be AI-generated based on option values, lookup values, or page context.

When Copilot generates suggestions, it only accesses the business data you can access. Copilot never saves suggestions automatically but presents them for you to decide what to keep. Copilot uses AI, and suggestions might not be correct.

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-note-d365.md)]

<!--[!INCLUDE [preview-note](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/production-ready-preview-dynamics365.md)]-->

<!--Suggestions are based on Business Central that only you have access to.-->

## Prerequisites

Autofill is activated, and you have the required permissions to use it. Learn more in [Configure Copilot and agent capabilities](enable-ai.md).

## Supported languages

[!INCLUDE[copilot-language-support-en-only](includes/copilot-language-support-en-only.md)]

## Availability

### Where the autofill feature is available

The autofill feature is available on card and document pages, like a **Customer card** or a **Sales Order**, and only on editable fields in FastTabs on these pages, except for the fields listed in the following section.

> [!NOTE]  
> Autofill works on editable fields in FastTabs added to card and document pages by add-on apps (extensions).

### Where the autofill feature isn't available

The autofill feature isn't available on these types of pages:

- List pages like **Customers** and **Sales Orders**.
- Worksheet pages like the **Put-away Worksheet**.
- Setup pages, like **Company information** and **General Ledger Setup**, and assisted setup pages, like **Set up sales tax** and **Set up outgoing email**.
- Task dialogs.

The autofill feature isn't available on these fields regardless of the page type:

- Noneditable fields.
- Fields in the FactBox pane.
- Fields in rows and columns.
- Multiline text fields.
- Masked fields like passwords and secrets.
- Date and time fields.
- Toggle switches.
- Fields that uniquely identify a record like IDs and numbers from a series.
- Certain fields depending on your country/region. For example, Copilot can't make suggestions for address fields until web search powered by Bing is available in your country/region.

## Use autofill on fields

Open the page for editing, select a field, and then select the ![Shows the Copilot icon for generating suggestions for field values.](media/copilot-star-unfilled.png) **Suggest a value for this field and related fields** icon or press <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>i</kbd>. If the icon doesn't appear, autofill isn't available for the field, so try another field.

![Shows a card page with a Copilot icon for generating suggestions for field values.](media/autofill-field.svg)

Suggestions are generated only for fields in the FastTab that you are on. When Copilot finds suggestions, they're automatically entered in the fields in italics along with the ![Shows the details icon for a suggestion](media/autofill-info.png) **Show details** icon. Fields remain unchanged if suggestions aren't found or they don't support the autofill feature.

![Shows a suggested field with the accept and discard buttons.](media/autofill-suggested-value-field.svg)

When you hover over or select a field that includes a suggestion, the ![Shows the accept button for a Copilot suggestion](media/autofill-accept.png) **Accept the suggestion** and ![Shows the discard button for a Copilot suggestion](media/autofill-discard.png) **Discard the suggestion** buttons appear.

### Review suggestions

Review the suggestion for each field and take appropriate action. Suggestions aren't saved until you accept them.

- To learn more about a suggestion, select the ![Shows the details icon for a suggestion](media/autofill-info.png) **Show details** icon next to the field, or press <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>i</kbd>. The details include the source of the suggestion, like the most frequently or recently used value. Use the thumbs-up and thumbs-down icons to give feedback.
- To keep a suggestion, select ![Shows the accept button for a Copilot suggestion](media/autofill-accept.png) **Accept the suggestion** or press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.
- To reject a suggestion and keep the original value, select ![Shows the discard button for a Copilot suggestion](media/autofill-discard.png) **Discard the suggestion** or press <kbd>Delete</kbd>.
- To change a suggestion, select **Change** in the details or press <kbd>F2</kbd>.

You can also use the **Keep all** button in the upper right corner of the page to accept or discard suggestions on all fields.

When you leave the page while there are unaccepted suggestions, Copilot asks you to accept or discard suggestions first.

<!--The first time you use Copilot, you're asked to accept the terms to continue.-->

## Autofill behavior with other data-entry features

Business Central offers many other features that reduce data entry, such as customer templates and business process settings that default values. On some pages, for example, when you specify the value for a field, Business Central validates and automatically sets related fields, like zip code and country. Unlike Copilot, these features don't use AI, and values are saved immediately.

When Copilot suggests a field value and you use any feature that saves a value to the same field, Copilot's suggestion is always discarded in favor of the value set by Business Central.

# Gross Requirement (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Gross Requirement** report looks at all outbound transactions to determine the quantity required per item.

The report shows the gross requirement for an item and the different documents that include it. This information is coupled with the **Project Available Balance** that calculates the balance at any point in time.

:::image type="content" source="media/inventory/gross-requirement.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Gross Requirement Power BI Report" lightbox="media/inventory/gross-requirement.png":::

## Use the report

The report helps management and procurement officers to determine whether the organization is keeping up with demand.

Managers can use the report to ensure that stock levels are high enough to maintain the production schedule and sales demand for each item. The report helps identify bottlenecks in production by showing items where the available inventory doesn't meet the gross requirement.

Procurement officers can view sales and production volumes and ensure your available balance meets the requirements for each item. With this information, you can make informed decisions on the items you should replenish.

# Walkthrough: managing projects

<!-- [!INCLUDE[complete_sample_data](includes/complete_sample_data.md)]   -->

This walkthrough introduces you to the project management features. Projects are a way for you to schedule the usage of your company's resources and to keep track of the various costs associated with the resources on a specific project. Projects involve the consumption of employee hours, machine hours, inventory items, and other types of usage that you might want to track as a project progresses.  

This walkthrough covers the setup of a new project and related tasks:

- Handle fixed pricing
- Make payments in installments
- Post invoices from projects
- Copy projects

## About this walkthrough

 This walkthrough demonstrates the following tasks:  

### Setting up a project

With the budget structure set up for projects, creating a project is straightforward. This walkthrough covers the following procedures:  

- Set up project task lines and planning lines.  
- Create project-specific prices for items, resources, and general ledger accounts.  
- Invoice customers for a project.  

### Handling fixed prices

 You can handle fixed prices and the prices for services or goods that are agreed upon in advance with customers. In this walkthrough, you'll learn how to:  

- See how contract and invoice values are determined.  
- Allow for extra work in the schedule that isn't invoiced.  

### Copying a Project

 This part of the walkthrough focuses on how to copy part or all of a project in order to reduce manual data entry and improve accuracy.

- Copy part of a project to a new project.  
- Copy project-specific prices.  
- Copy planning lines.  

### Making Payment by Installment

 When a large, expensive project lasts for a long period, the customer often makes an agreement with the company to pay by installments. This scenario shows how you set up payment by installments and covers:  

- Create payment by installments for a project.  
- Invoice payments to customers.  
- Account for usage in a project set up for payment by installments.  

## Roles

 This walkthrough includes tasks for the following roles:  

- Project Manager  
- Project Team Member  

## Prerequisites

 Before you can perform the tasks in the walkthrough, you must:  

- Install the CRONUS demonstration database.
- Create sample data by using the steps in the following section.  

## Story

This walkthrough focuses on CRONUS, which is a fictional design and consultancy firm that designs and fits new infrastructures. For example, conference halls and offices with furniture, accessories, and storage units. Most of its work is project oriented. Prakash, a project manager at CRONUS uses project to get an overview of each ongoing task that CRONUS started and completed. Prakash is usually the one who sets up deals with customers and enters the core of the project, which is task and planning lines in addition to prices, into [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Prakash finds that creating, maintaining, and reviewing information is straightforward. Prakash also likes the way [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] enables copying projects and payment by installments.

 Tricia, a project team member who reports to Prakash, is responsible for monitoring the project day-to-day. Tricia enters the work done by technicians on every task, records the items that they used, and the costs that they incurred.  

## Preparing sample data

To prepare for this walkthrough, you must add Tricia as a resource.  

### To prepare the sample data  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Resources**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action to create a new resource card.  
3. On the **General** FastTab, enter the following information:  

    - **No.**: **Tricia**  
    - **Name**: **Tricia**  
    - **Type**: **Person**  

4. Choose the **Base Unit of Measure** field, and choose the **New** action to open the **Resource Unit of Measure** page. In the **Code** field, select **Hour**.  
5. On the **Invoicing** FastTab, enter the following information:  

    - **Direct Unit Cost**: **5**  
    - **Indirect Cost %**: **4**  
    - **Unit Cost**: **10**  
    - **Gen. Prod. Posting Group**: **Services**  
    - **VAT Prod. Posting Group**: **VAT 25**  

6. Close the page.

In the next procedure, you create a project journal batch for Tricia in order to post their usage.  

### To create a project journal batch  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Project Journals**, and then choose the related link.

3. Choose the **New** action to create a new line with the following information:  

    - **Name**: **Tricia**  
    - **Description**: **Tricia**  
    - **No. Series**: **JJNL-GEN**  

4. Choose the **OK** button to save the changes.

## Setting up a project

In this scenario, CRONUS won a contract with a customer, Progressive Home Furnishings, to design a conference and dining hall. The customer is based in the United States and the project requires special software. The project manager reaches an agreement with the customer and creates a project that covers the agreement.  

### To set up a project  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Projects**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action to create a new card.  
3. On the **General** FastTab, enter the following information:

    1. **G/L Account**: **8430 (Travel)**  
    2. **Unit Cost Factor**: **1.25**  

9. Close the page.  

 The final steps in setting up a project are adding the project tasks and the planning lines that are part of each task. The planning lines determine what is invoiced to the customer.  

### To add project tasks  

1. On the **Project** card for the new project, choose the **Project Task Lines** action.  
2. The following table describes the information that you should enter in the fields.  

    |Project Task No.|Description|Project Task Type|  
    |------------------|---------------------------------------|-------------------|  
    |1000|Consulting on hall setup|Begin-Total|  
    |1010|Consultation meeting with customer|Posting|  
    |1020|Development|Posting|  
    |1090|Consulting Total|End-Total|  

3. To show that some tasks are subcategories of other tasks, choose the **Indent Project Tasks** action.  

A planning line can be one of the following types:  

- **Budget**: Added to the schedule, but not invoiced.  
- **Billable**: Invoiced, but not added to the schedule.  
- **Both Budget and Billable**: Invoiced and added to the schedule.  

In this walkthrough, the project manager uses **Both Budget and Billable**. They create three planning lines for task 1010, and two planning lines for task 1020.  

### To create planning lines  

1. Select line 1010, and then choose the **Project Planning Lines** action.  
2. Create planning lines with the following information:  

    | Line | Line Type | Planning Date  | Type        | No.   | Quantity | Unit Price |
    |------|-----------|----------------|-------------|-------|----------|------------|
    | 1    | Both Budget and Billable | (today's date) | Resource | Tricia | 40        |     |
    | 2    | Both Budget and Billable | (today's date) | Resource | Timothy | 40        |     |
    | 3    | Both Budget and Billable | (today's date) | G/L Account | 8430 (Travel) | 2 | 400    |

     Close the page. The totals are updated on the **Project Task Lines** page.  
3. Select line 1020, and then choose the **Project Planning Lines** action. Enter the following information:  

    | Line | Line Type | Planning Date  | Type        | No.   | Quantity | Unit Price |
    |------|-----------|----------------|-------------|-------|----------|------------|
    | 1    | Both Budget and Billable | (today's date) | Resource | Tricia | 80        |     |
    | 2    | Both Budget and Billable | (today's date) | Item | 80201 (Graphic program) | 1 |     |

4. Close the page. Totals are updated on the **Project Task Lines** page.  

## Calculating remaining usage

Tricia, the team project member, has been working on the project for a while and wants to register their hours and usage. Tricia didn't work more hours than was agreed upon with the customer in advance. Tricia uses the **Calculate Remaining Usage** batch job to calculate remaining usage in a project journal. For each task, the batch job calculates the difference between scheduled usage of items, resources, and general ledger expenses and the actual usage posted in project ledger entries. The remaining usage is then displayed in the project journal, and Tricia can post it.  

### To calculate remaining usage  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Project Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Project Journal** page, in the **Batch Name** field, open the **Project Journals Batches** list. Select the **Tricia** project journal batch.  
3. Choose the **Calc. Remaining Usage** action.  
4. On the **Project Calc. Remaining Usage** page, on the **Project Task** FastTab, choose the **Project No.** field, and select the relevant project number, typically project J00010.  
5. On the **Options** FastTab, type **J00001** in the **Document No.** field. This information makes future tracking of the posting easier.  
6. Enter today's date as the posting date.  
7. Choose the **OK** button. This action generates project journal lines based on the planning lines that Prakash created.  
8. Choose the **OK** button on the confirmation page. The generated lines are added to the project journal.  
9. Make sure that all the document numbers are J00001, and then choose the **Post** action. Choose **Yes** to confirm the posting.  

The lines are now posted.  

## Creating and posting a project sales invoice

Next, Tricia can create a new invoice for the whole project or for part of a project. Tricia can also attach the invoice to another invoice for the same customer for the same project. In this case, Tricia invoices for the whole project because the project is now completed.  

### To create a project sales invoice  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Projects**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the project that you created earlier, and then choose the **Create project Sales Invoice** action.  
3. On the **Project Task** FastTab, clear any filter on **Project Task No.** in order to invoice the project. In the **Project No.** field, select the relevant project.  
4. On the **Options** FastTab, fill in the posting date and define whether you want to create one invoice per task or just a single invoice for all tasks.  
5. Choose the **OK** button to create the invoice and choose the **OK** button on the confirmation page.  

After Tricia creates the invoice, it's available from the **Sales Order Processor** Role Center, for example.

### To post a new sales invoice  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Invoices**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the invoice for Customer No. 01445544. You can see the information that was entered from the planning lines.  
3. Choose the **Post** action. Choose **Yes** to confirm the posting.  

### To view the posted invoice  

1. Open the project, and then choose the **Project Planning Lines** action.  
2. Select any of the planning lines that were invoiced, and then choose the **Sales Invoice/Credit Memo** action.
3. On the **Project Invoices** page, choose the **Open Sales Invoice/Credit Memo** action.  

Tricia has a question about the prices, costs, and profits that are relevant to this particular project, so Tricia accesses that information on the **Statistics** page.  

### To open the Statistics page  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Projects**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **Statistics** action. You can review detailed information about the project prices, costs, and profits in both local and foreign currencies.  
3. Choose the **Close** button to close the **Project Statistics** page.  

## Handling fixed prices

CRONUS is contracted to set up conference rooms. As the project manager, Prakash wants a good overview of the tasks required for the project with the associated budgeted and incurred costs for each task. In addition, Prakash wants to know the total contracted price for the project and the amount that was invoiced to this point. They're in agreement with the customer regarding fixed pricing for the project.  

### To manage fixed pricing in projects  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Projects**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the **Guildford** project number, and then choose the **Project Task Lines** action.  
3. Select line 1120, and in the **Budget (Total Cost)** field, right-click the amount and choose **DrillDown**.  

     By reviewing the Project Planning Lines, it's determined that Prakash needs Tricia for 30 hours for this stage of the project. Prakash agrees on a fixed price with the customer.  

4. On the **Project Task Lines** page, select line 1120, and then choose the **Project Planning Lines** action. Create a planning line with the following information:  

    | Line | Line Type | Type        | No.   | Quantity |
    |------|-----------|-------------|-------|----------|
    | 1    | Both Budget and Billable  | Resource | Tricia | 30 |

     Close the page.  
5. In the **Budget (Total Cost)** field, right-click the field, and choose **Drilldown** again on the **Project Task Lines** page. View the changes to the schedule. You see that 30 hours are added to the schedule.  
6. Close the pages.  

After being added to the schedule for this task line, Tricia works 25 hours on the project, and enters these hours into the project journal.  

### To enter hours in a project journal  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Project Journals**, and then choose the related link.

    - **Quantity**: **25**  

3. Choose the **Post** action.  

     A few days later, Tricia works for another 10 hours on the project and has worked 35 hours in all. Because the agreement is for 30 hours with the customer, only five of these hours are charged to the customer. Tricia manually adds the other five hours to the schedule.  

4. On the **Project Journal** page, choose the **Calc. Remaining Usage** action.  
5. On the **Project Calc. Remaining Usage** page, on the **Options** FastTab, enter the following information:  

    - **Document No.**: **J00003**  
    - **Posting Date**: **(today's date)**  

6. On the **Project Task** FastTab, enter the following information:  

    - **Project No.**: **Guildford**  
    - **Project Task No.**: **1120**  

7. Choose the **OK** button to run the calculation.

    There are five hours of work remaining for Tricia. The **Line Type** field is blank, which indicates that only the usage remains to be posted because the work was already scheduled.  

8. In the **Project Journal**, create a new line with the following information. Make sure that both project numbers are sequential with the numbers you've already used:  

    - **Line Type**: **Budget**  
    - **Project No.**: **Guildford**  
    - **Project Task No.**: **1120**  
    - **Type**: **Resource**  
    - **No.**: **Tricia**  
    - **Quantity**: **5**  

     If you use the **Budget** line type, there are updates to the scheduled costs and prices, but no updates to the contract costs and prices that are invoiced to the customer.  

9. Choose the **Post** action. Choose the **OK** button to close the page.  
10. Open the **Projects** list.  
11. Select the GUILDFORD project, and then, in the **Project Task Lines** section, select line 1120 and in the **Budget (Total Cost)** field, right-click the amount. Choose **DrillDown** to view the information.  

     Changes are automatically entered on the line for Project Task No. 1120. In the total cost of scheduled work, five more hours of work by Tricia were added to the schedule.  

12. Choose the **Close** button to close the page.  
13. Right-click the amount in the **Contract (Total Cost)** field and choose **DrillDown** to view the information.  

In the total price for the contract, only the original contracted 30 hours are included, as agreed upon with the customer.  

## Copying projects

Prakash reached an agreement with a customer, Selagorian Ltd, to set up 10 conference rooms. The agreement resembles an earlier project. Therefore, it saves time to copy that earlier project.  

On the **Copy Project** page, you can select the project and task lines that you want to copy.

- Copy the source project ledger entries to create planning lines based on actual use.
- Copy the source project planning lines to copy the original planning lines to the new project.

You can then choose what planning line or ledger entry line type that you want to include, selecting only what is relevant to this new project. Finally, you can select the project that you want to copy to and define whether prices and quantities should be copied as well.  

### To copy a project  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Projects**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action to create a new project. Enter the following information:  

    - **Description**: **Setting up 10 Conference Rooms**  
    - **Bill-To Customer No.**: **20000**  

3. Choose the **Copy Project Tasks from** action.  
4. On the **Copy Project Tasks** page, enter the following:  

    - **Project No.**: **Guildford**  
    - **Project Task No. From**: **1000**  
    - **Source**: **Project Planning Lines**  
    - **Incl. Planning Line Type**: **Budget + Billable**  
    - **To Project No.**: **GuildfordSetting up 10 Conference Rooms**  
    - Select the **Copy Dimensions** and **Copy Quantity** fields.  

5. Choose the **OK** button to copy the project, and then choose the **OK** button to close the confirmation page.  

By comparing prices, project task lines, and project planning lines for the two projects, you can see that the information was successfully copied.  

## Making payments by installments

CRONUS just landed a large project that will take a year to complete. Because it requires many resources, the project manager sets up the contract so that the customer pays part of the price up front, part when the project is halfway completed, and the final payment upon completion.  

### To set up a new account  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Chart of Accounts**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Chart of Accounts** page, choose the **New** action to create a new card.  
3. On the **New G/L Account** card, enter the following information:  

    - **No.**: **40255**  
    - **Name**: **Project Payment**  

4. On the **Posting** FastTab, in the **Gen. Prod. Posting Group** field, select **Services**. Close the page.  
5. On the **Chart of Accounts** page, select **No. 40255 Job Payment**, and then choose the **Indent Chart of Accounts** action. Choose **Yes** to confirm.  

The following procedures show how to create a new project, set pricing, and then set up payment by installment. In the project task lines, you can create specific lines dedicated to the payment by installments. All work completed on the project that is added to the schedule will be entered on the usage lines. For each payment task line on the planning lines, the line type is **Billable**, which means that the customer will be invoiced. Enter a new line for the down payment. On the usage task line, you can enter the information for the items and resources that have been used in this project, which will increase the schedule, such as employee hours and items used on the project.  

### To make a payment by installment  

1. Create a new project.  
2. On the new **Project** card, fill in the following information:  

    - **Description**: **Redecoration of Reception Area**  
    - **Bill-to-Customer No.**: **30000**  
    - **Project Posting Group**: **Setting up**  
    - **WIP Method**: **Cost Value**  

3. On the Project Card, choose the **Prices** action, and then choose the **Resource** action. Enter the following information:  

    - **Code**: **Tricia**  
    - **Unit Price**: **10**  

     Close the page.  

4. On the **Project** card, in the **Tasks** section, add project task lines as described in the following table:  

    | Line | Project Task No. | Description          | Project Task Type |
    |------|--------------|----------------------|---------------|
    | 1    | 1000         | Payment-Down Payment | Posting       |
    | 2    | 2000         | Usage                | Posting       |
    | 3    | 3000         | Payment - Midway     | Posting       |
    | 4    | 4000         | Payment - Completion | Posting       |

5. Choose task 1000, and then choose the **Project Planning Lines** action.  

6. Create a planning line with the following information:  

    | Line | Line Type | Planning Date  | Type        | No.   | Quantity | Unit Price |
    |------|-----------|----------------|-------------|-------|----------|------------|
    | 1    | Billable  | (today's date) | G/L Account | 40255 | 1        | 5000       |

     Close the page.  

7. Choose task 2000, and then choose the **Project Planning Lines** action.  

8. Create a planning line with the following information:

    | Line | Line Type | Planning Date  | Type     | No.    | Quantity |
    |------|-----------|----------------|----------|--------|----------|
    | 1    | Budget    | (today's date) | Resource | Tricia | 120      |
    | 2    | Budget    | (today's date) | Item     | 70104  | 10       |

     Close the page. On the **Project Task Lines** page, you can see the schedule amounts have been updated.  

9. Choose task 32000, and then choose the **Project Planning Lines** action.  

10. Create a planning line with the following information:

    | Line | Line Type | Planning Date   | Type        | No.   | Quantity | Unit Price |
    |------|-----------|-----------------|-------------|-------|----------|------------|
    | 1    | Billable  | (a future date) | G/L Account | 40255 | 1        | 5000       |

     Close the page.  

11. Create a similar planning line entry for project task 4000.  

 Now that the task and planning lines have been entered, Prakash creates an invoice for the first payment. Prakash does this from the project task lines to make sure that the invoice only contains the lines for the first payment. You can open the sales order from the planning lines or the task lines.  

### To create an invoice  

1. On the **Project Task Lines** page, select line 1000, and then choose the **Create Sales Invoice** action.  
2. On the **Create Sales Invoice** page, set today's date as the posting date, specify **Per Task**, and choose the **OK** button to create an invoice with the default information. Choose the **OK** button to close the confirmation page.  
3. Choose the **Sales Invoice/Credit Memo** action. On the sales invoice, you can see that only the down payment is included in the invoice. You can now send this to the customer as agreed.  

## Summary

# Manually Synchronize Table Mappings


An integration table mapping associates a [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] table, such as customer, with a [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] table, such as account. Synchronizing an integration table mapping enables you to synchronize data in all records of the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] table and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] table that are coupled. Additionally, depending on the configuration of the table mapping, synchronization can create and couple new records in the destination solution for uncoupled records in the source.  

Manually synchronizing integration table mappings can be useful during the initial set up of an integration, and when diagnosing synchronization errors.  

This article describes three methods for manually synchronizing integration table mappings. Each method provides a different level of synchronization.

## Run a Full Synchronization
A full synchronization runs all the default integration synchronization jobs for synchronizing [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] records and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] tables, as defined on the **Integration Table Mappings** page. 

A full synchronization performs the following operations For [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] or [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] records that are:

* Not coupled, a new matching row will be created and coupled in the opposing solution.
Whether and where a row gets created depends on the synchronization direction. For example, when synchronizing data from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] customers to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] accounts, if there is a customer that is not coupled to an account, then a new account will be automatically added in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] and coupled to the customer in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The opposite holds true when the synchronization direction is from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For each account that is not already coupled to a customer, a new matching customer will be created in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and coupled to the account in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)].  

     > [!NOTE]  
     >  To achieve this, the full synchronization operation temporarily clears the **Synch. Only Coupled Records** option on the integration table mapping that is used by the synchronization job. At the end of the full synchronization process, you will be prompted whether you want to keep this option cleared for all jobs.  

* Coupled, the synchronization direction (for example, from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] or from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]) is predetermined by the integration table mappings. For more information, see [Standard Table Mapping for Synchronization](admin-synchronizing-business-central-and-sales.md#standard-table-mapping-for-synchronization).  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  You typically only use the full synchronization when you initially set up integration between [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] and only one of solutions contains data, which you want to copy to the other solution. A full synchronization can be useful in a demonstration environment. Because the full synchronization automatically creates and couples records between the solutions, it makes it faster to start working with synchronizing data between records. On the other hand, you should only run a full synchronization if you want a row in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] for each row in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] for the given table mappings. Otherwise, you can have unwanted or duplicate records in either [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] or [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)].  

### To run a full synchronization  
1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Dataverse Connection Setup**, and then choose the related link.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you want to run a full synchronization for tables through Dynamics 365 Sales, use the **Microsoft Dynamics 365 Sales Connection Setup** page instead.

2.  Choose the **Run Full Synchronization** action, and then choose the **Yes** button.  
3.  When the full synchronization is completed, you can specify whether to allow scheduled synchronization jobs to create new records.  

    If you want all synchronization jobs to create new records in the destination for uncoupled records in the source, choose **Yes**. This sets the **Synch. Only Coupled Records** field on the table mappings that are used by the synchronization jobs.  

    If you want synchronization jobs to run as they did before the full synchronization with regard to creating new records, choose **No**. This sets the **Synch. Only Coupled Records** field to the setting it had before the full synchronization.  

You can view the results of the full synchronization on the **Integration Synchronization Jobs** page. For more information, see [View the Status of a Synchronization](admin-how-to-view-synchronization-status.md).  

## Synchronizing All Modified Records
You can use the **Common Data Service Connection Setup** page to synchronize changes to data in all integration table mappings. This is similar to a full synchronization. It will synchronize data in all coupled records in the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] tables that are defined in the table mappings. By default, only data that has been modified since the last synchronization will be synchronized. Synchronization jobs synchronize table mappings in the following order to avoid coupling dependencies between the tables:  

1.  CURRENCY  
2.  SALESPEOPLE  
3.  VENDOR  
4.  CUSTOMER  
5.  CONTACTS  

You can view the results of the synchronization on the **Integration Synchronization Jobs** page. For more information, see [View the Status of a Synchronization](admin-how-to-view-synchronization-status.md).  

> [!TIP]  
>  By modifying the integration table mapping in advance, you can create filters to control the data to synchronize, or configure mappings to create new data in the destination solution for uncoupled records or rows in the source. For more information, see [Modify Table Mappings for Synchronization](admin-how-to-modify-table-mappings-for-synchronization.md).

### To synchronize data for all tables  
1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Microsoft Dynamics 365 Sales Connection Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2.  Choose the **Synchronize Modified Records** action, and then choose **Yes**.  

## Synchronize Individual Table Mappings
You can use the **Integration Table Mappings** page to run a synchronization job for table mappings. This will synchronize data for all coupled records and rows in the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] tables that are defined by the table mapping. By default, only data that has been modified since the last synchronization will be synchronized.  

### To synchronize records of an integration table mapping  
1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Integration Table Mappings**, and then choose the related link.
2.  Choose the **Synchronize Modified Records** action, and then choose **Yes**.

# Design Details: Inventory Posting

Each inventory transaction, such as a purchase receipt or a sales shipment, posts two entries of different types.  

|Entry type|Description|  
|----------|-----------|  
|Quantity|Reflects the change of quantity in inventory. This information is stored in item ledger entries.<br /><br /> Accompanied by item application entries.|  
|Value|Reflects the change of inventory value. This information is stored in value entries.<br /><br /> One or more value entries can exist for each item ledger entry or capacity ledger entry.<br /><br /> For information about capacity value entries related to the use of production or assembly resources, see [Design Details: Production Order Posting](design-details-production-order-posting.md).|  

 In relation to quantity postings, item application entries exist to link inventory increase with inventory decrease. This enables the costing engine to forward costs from increases to the related decreases and vice versa. For more information, see [Design Details: Item Application](design-details-item-application.md).  

 Item ledger entries, value entries, and item application entries are created as a result of posting an item journal line, either indirectly by posting an order line or directly in the Item Journal page.  

 At regular intervals, value entries that are created in the inventory ledger are posted to the general ledger to reconcile the two ledgers for financial control reasons. For more information, see [Design Details: Reconciliation with the General Ledger](design-details-reconciliation-with-the-general-ledger.md).  

 ![Entry flow when reconciling inventory with G/L.](media/design_details_inventory_costing_1_entry_flow.png "Entry flow when reconciling inventory with G/L")  

## Example

The following example shows how item ledger entries, value entries, and item application entries result in general ledger entries.  

 You post a purchase order as received and invoiced for 10 items with a direct unit cost of LCY 7 and an overhead rate of LCY 1. The posting date is 01-01-20. The following entries are created.  

### Item Ledger Entries (1)

|Posting Date|Entry Type|Cost Amount (Actual)|Quantity|Entry No.|  
|------------|----------|--------------------|--------|---------|  
|01-01-20|Purchase|80.00|10|1|  

### Value Entries (1)

|Posting Date|Entry Type|Cost Amount (Actual)|Item Ledger Entry No.|Entry No.|  
|------------|----------|--------------------|---------------------|---------|  
|01-01-20|Direct Cost|70.00|1|1|  
|01-01-20|Indirect Cost|10.00|1|2|  

### Item Application Entries (1)

|Entry No.|Item Ledger Entry No.|Inbound Item Entry No.|Outbound Item Entry No.|Quantity|  
|---------|---------------------|----------------------|-----------------------|--------|  
|1|1|1|0|10|  

 Next, you post a sale of 10 units of the item with a posting date of 01-15-20.  

### Item Ledger Entries (2)

|Posting Date|Entry Type|Cost Amount (Actual)|Quantity|Entry No.|  
|------------|----------|--------------------|--------|---------|  
|01-15-20|Sale|-80.00|-10|2|  

### Value Entries (2)

|Posting Date|Entry Type|Cost Amount (Actual)|Item Ledger Entry No.|Entry No.|  
|------------|----------|--------------------|---------------------|---------|  
|01-15-20|Direct Cost|-80.00|2|3|  

### Item Application Entries (2)

|Entry No.|Item Ledger Entry No.|Inbound Item Entry No.|Outbound Item Entry No.|Quantity|  
|---------|---------------------|----------------------|-----------------------|--------|  
|2|2|1|2|-10|  

At the end of the accounting period, you run the **Post Inventory Cost to G/L** batch job to reconcile these inventory transactions with the general ledger.  

 For more information, see [Design Details: Accounts in the General Ledger](design-details-accounts-in-the-general-ledger.md).  

 The following tables show the result of reconciling the inventory transactions in this example with the general ledger.  

### Value Entries (3)  

|Posting Date|Entry Type|Cost Amount (Actual)|Cost Posted to G/L|Item Ledger Entry No.|Entry No.|  
|------------|----------|--------------------|------------------|---------------------|---------|  
|01-01-20|Direct Cost|70.00|70.00|1|1|  
|01-01-20|Indirect Cost|10.00|10.00|1|2|  
|01-15-20|Direct Cost|-80.00|-80.00|2|3|  

### General Ledger Entries (3)

|Posting Date|G/L Account|Account No. (En-US Demo)|Amount|Entry No.|  
|------------|-----------|------------------------|------|---------|  
|01-01-20|[Inventory Account]|2130|70.00|1|  
|01-01-20|[Direct Cost Applied Account]|7291|-70.00|2|  
|01-01-20|[Inventory Account]|2130|10.00|3|  
|01-01-07|[Overhead Applied Account]|7292|-10.00|4|  
|01-15-20|[Inventory Account]|2130|-80.00|5|  
|01-15-20|[COGS Account]|7290|80.00|6|  

> [!NOTE]  
> The posting date of the general ledger entries is the same as for the related value entries.  
> 
> The **Cost Posted to G/L** field in the **Value Entry** table is filled.  

 The relation between value entries and general ledger entries is stored in the **G/L - Item Ledger Relation** table.  

### Relation Entries in the G/L – Item Ledger Relation table (3)

|G/L Entry No.|Value Entry No.|G/L Register No.|  
|-------------|---------------|----------------|  
|1|1|1|  
|2|1|1|  
|3|2|1|  
|4|2|1|  
|5|3|1|  
|6|3|1|  

## Assembly and Production Posting

Capacity and resource ledger entries represent the time that is posted as consumed in production or assembly. These process costs are posted as value entries to the general ledger along with the involved material costs in a similar structure as described for item ledger entries in this topic.  

For more information, see [Design Details: Assembly Order Posting](design-details-assembly-order-posting.md).

# Purchases By Purchaser (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Purchases by Purchaser** report provides a detailed overview of purchasing activities for each purchaser. The report lets you analyze the item categories and items that each purchaser buys most frequently, and how much they spent.

:::image type="content" source="media/purchases/purchases-by-purchaser.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Purchases by Purchaser Power BI report" lightbox="media/purchases/purchases-by-purchaser.png":::

## Use the report

The report is especially useful for purchasing managers and purchasers.

Purchasing managers can easily identify top purchasers and track their purchasing trends over time using the **Purchases by Vendor** report. This information can help you make informed decisions about future purchasing activities and optimize purchasing strategies.

Purchaser can use this report to monitor purchasing activities, including purchase amounts and quantities. This report also shows the items you bought the most and how they contribute to overall spending. This information can help you make good decisions about future purchases.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The *Purchases by Purchaser* report includes the following KPIs and measures:

- [**Purchase Amount**](purchases-powerbi-kpis.md#purchase-amount)
- [**Purchase Quantity**](purchases-powerbi-kpis.md#purchase-quantity)
- [**% GT Purchase Amount**](purchases-powerbi-kpis.md#-gt-purchase-amount)
- [**% GT Purchase Quantity**](purchases-powerbi-kpis.md#-gt-purchase-quantity)

title: Extend your trial version of Business Central
description: If you need more time to decide whether to subscribe to Dynamics 365 Business Central, you can extend your trial version once. Learn about your options.

# Need more time to decide whether to subscribe?

It's important to make the right decision when choosing a business application, and we know that it can take time to explore all of the corners in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. If you need more time to finish your evaluation, you can extend the trial period yourself for another 30 days. When the expiration date for your trial period is approaching, we display a notification to alert you when you sign in. The notification contains a link to the **Extend Trial Period** guide that you can use to extend your trial period. The extra 30 days start the moment you choose **Extend Trial** in the guide.

Extending the trial period yourself is a one time-thing though. You can't extend it twice, at least not yourself. If you already extended the period, your Microsoft partner can extend it for you again, which is also a one-time thing. If you aren't already working with a partner, see [How do I find a reselling partner?](/dynamics365/business-central/across-faq#how-do-i-find-a-reselling-partner).  

## To extend your trial period

1. Sign in to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] at [https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/).

    Sign in with the email account that you used when you signed up for the trial.  

    If you signed up with an email account from a [30-day trial of Microsoft 365](/microsoft-365/commerce/sign-up-for-office-365-trial), then you must first extend your Microsoft 365 trial, or buy a Microsoft 365 subscription. For more information, see [Extend your trial for Microsoft 365 for business](/microsoft-365/commerce/extend-your-trial).
2. In the notification at the top of the workspace, choose **Extend Trial**.

    If you dismissed the notification, you must sign out and then sign in again.

> [!TIP]
> If you cannot see the notification, you can force [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to run the **Extend Trial** assisted setup guide by adding the ```?page=1828``` parameter to the URL, such as in the following example: [https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=1828](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=1828)

## What happens if my trial period is expired?

If your first 30-day trial period is expired, you can extend it yourself. Just sign in to the demonstration company and start the **Extend Trial Period** guide from the notification.  

After you create your own company, sign out and then sign in again with the credentials for that company.  

If your organization has a reseller relationship with a partner, they can sign in to your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] as a delegated administrator and run the same **Extend Trial Period** guide. For more information, see [Extending trials (as an administrator)](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/tenant-administration#extending-trials).  

However, after this second extension gives your organization up to 90 days of trial, you must either subscribe to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] or stop using it. If you decide to not continue, we recommend that you export any data that you rely on in your business.

When your extended trial period is expired, you can [subscribe](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=828659) to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] within 90 days and continue working in the company you created. 90 days after the extended trial expires, we'll delete your company and data unless you subscribe.

# Register new customers

Customers are your source of income. You must register each customer you sell to as a customer card. Customer cards contain the information required to sell products to the customer. To learn more, go to [Invoice Sales](sales-how-invoice-sales.md) and [Register New Items](inventory-how-register-new-items.md).  

Before you can register new customers, you must set up various sales codes to choose from when you fill in customer cards. To learn more, go to [Setting Up Sales](sales-setup-sales.md).

> [!VIDEO https://learn-video.azurefd.net/vod/player?id=37d3ec2a-71c2-4f0d-9a94-62c83805fbfa]

## Add new customers

You can add new customers manually by filling out the **Customer Card** page, or you can use templates that contain predefined information. For example, you can create a template for different types of customer profiles. Using templates saves time when adding new customers, and helps ensure the information is correct each time.

If you create:

* Multiple templates for use with more than one type of customer, you can choose the suitable template when you add a customer.
* Only one template is used for all new customers.

After you create a template, you can use the **Apply Template** action to apply it to one or more selected customers. To create a template, fill in the information to be reused on the **Customer Card** page, then save it as a template. To learn more, go to [To save the customer card as a template](sales-how-register-new-customers.md#to-save-the-customer-card-as-a-template).

> [!TIP]
> It can be helpful to personalize the **Customer Template** page when you create a template. For example, you might want to add the **Credit Limit** field to a template. To learn more, go to [Personalize your workspace](/dynamics365/business-central/ui-personalization-user#start-personalizing-by-using-the-personalization-mode).

You can also create a customer from a contact. To learn more, go to [To create a customer, vendor, employee, or bank account from a contact](marketing-create-contact-companies.md#to-create-a-customer-vendor-employee-or-bank-account-from-a-contact).  

### To create a new customer card

[!INCLUDE[create_new_customer](includes/create_new_customer.md)]

The **Prices & Discounts** action provides options for managing special prices or discounts for a customer when an order meets certain criteria. When purchasing a certain item, ordering a minimum quantity, or buying before a date, such as when a campaign ends, are examples of such criteria. To learn more, go to [Record Sales Price, Discount, and Payment Agreements](sales-how-record-sales-price-discount-payment-agreements.md).

The customer is now registered, and the customer card is ready to be used on sales documents.  

### To save the customer card as a template

You can use a customer card as a template when you create new customer cards.

1. On the **Customer Card** page, choose the **Save as Template** action. The **Customer Template** page opens showing the customer card as a template.
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
3. To reuse dimensions in templates, choose the **Dimensions** action. The **Dimension Templates** page opens showing any dimension codes set up for the customer.
4. Edit or enter dimension codes you want to apply to new customer cards created with this template.  
5. When you complete the new customer template, choose **OK**.

The customer template is added to the list of customer templates, and you can use it to create new customer cards.

## Delete customer cards

If you post a transaction for a customer, you can't delete the customer card because the ledger entries might be needed for auditing. To delete customer cards with ledger entries, contact your Microsoft partner to do so through code.  

## Manage credit limits

Credit limits, balance amounts, and payment terms make it possible for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to issue a credit and an overdue balance warning when you enter a sales order. Furthermore, reminder term and finance charge term elements enable you to invoice interest and/or extra fees.  

The **Credit Limit** field on a customer card specifies the maximum amount you allow the customer to exceed the payment balance before warnings are issued. When you enter information in journals, quotes, orders, and invoices, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] tests the header and lines to determine whether the document exceeds the credit limit.

You can post even if the credit limit exceeds. A blank field means there's no credit limit for this customer.  

You can choose not to receive warnings when the customer's credit limit is exceeded, and you can specify which types of warnings you want to see.

### To specify credit limit warnings

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales & Receivables Setup**, then choose the related link.

2. On the **General** FastTab, in the **Credit Warnings** field, choose the relevant option as described in the following table:

    |Option| Description|
    |------|------------|
    |**Both Warnings**| Both the **Credit Limit** and the **Balance Due** fields on the customer's card are checked, and a warning is shown if the customer exceeds its credit limit or has an overdue balance.|
    |**Credit Limit**|The value in the **Credit Limit** field on the customer's card is compared with the customer's balance, and a warning is shown if the customer's balance exceeds this amount.|
    |**Overdue Balance**|The **Balance Due** field on the customer's card is checked, and a warning is shown if the customer has an overdue balance.|
    |**No Warning**|No credit warnings are shown regarding the customer's status.|

## Assign a salesperson

You can assign salespeople to customer ship-to address rather than their billing address so your sales reports reflect the true geographical distribution of your sales. Assigning a salesperson to a customer's ship-to address gives you more precise insights and optimizes resource allocation.

Assign a salesperson on the **Customer** card page by choosing **Customer**, and then **Ship-To Addresses** to open the **Ship-to Addresses List** page. Choose **Manage**, and then **Edit** to open the **Ship-to Address** card page. Enter or choose a **Salesperson Code** to select the salesperson.

When you choose the **Alternate Shipping Address** option as a **Ship-To** location on a sales document, the **Salesperson Code** updates to match the salesperson from the **Ship-to** rather than the **Bill-to** address.

# Set up validation of purchase amounts

> [!NOTE]
> Businesses around the world can benefit from this functionality, so in 2025 release wave 1 we moved it out of the Dutch version and made it available to everyone.

You can validate the total amount on purchase invoices and credit memos before you post the documents. You can turn on the **Check Doc. Total Amounts** toggle on the **Purchases & Payables Setup** page. By default, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] validates the total amount when you post the document. The total amount of the purchase lines must equal the amount including VAT and the VAT amount. To validate the amount automatically, you must enter the document amount including VAT and the document amount VAT on the **Purchase Invoice** or **Purchase Credit Memo** page.  

If you have only one purchase line, or several purchase lines with the same VAT percentage, the correct document amount VAT is calculated automatically when you add the purchase lines and the document amount including VAT. If you have several purchase lines with different VAT percentages, you must manually change the document amount VAT value.  

If the total amount on the document differs from the total amount of its lines, you can add a few values to the page that can help you find out why. You can add the total amount, total base amount, total VAT amount, and total amount including VAT values. The values display at the bottom of the document. To avoid clutter on the page during daily work, these values are hidden. To add these values to the document, turn on the **Show Totals on Purch. Inv.-CM.** toggle on the **Purchases & Payables Setup** page.  

You can turn on this option only if the purchase invoice or purchase credit memo has:  

- A minimum of one purchase line.  
- The quantity field specified.  

## To set up validation of total amounts for purchase documents  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchases & Payables Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **General** FastTab, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Show Totals on Purch. Inv./CM.**|Recalculate the totals on all purchase invoices and credit memos. Depending on how many documents you have, the recalculation can take some time.|  
    |**Check Doc. Total Amounts**|Verify the **Doc. Amount Incl. VAT** and **Doc. Amount VAT** fields on the purchase invoices and credit memos.|  

3. Choose the **OK** button.

# FAQ for Sales Line Suggestions with Copilot (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]

These frequently asked questions (FAQ) describe the AI impact of the sales line suggestions feature in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/production-ready-preview-dynamics365.md)]

## What is Sales Line Suggestions with Copilot?

Sales line suggestions with Copilot can assist with creating lines on sales documents such as sales quotes, orders, and invoices based on structured input or natural language. The feature isn't a general-purpose chat, but a highly specific and integrated experience that you can use on sales documents. The feature offers two distinct skills that help you find data about individual products or entire documents.

## What are the capabilities of sales line suggestions with Copilot?

* Find products

  Information that describes products is stored in multiple places in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For example, item numbers and descriptions are stored in the **Item** table, multiple barcodes are stored in the **Item Reference** table, and product properties are stored in the **Item Attributes** table. While you might prompt for *Red bicycle*, the actual product might be *Crimson tourer*, where *Bicycle* is a product category and *red* is an attribute.

* Find a document by reference

  People often repeat a previous order, or at least use it as a starting point. But it might be tricky to find the right order in a stack of orders. You might remember some of the order's ID, which can be a company-assigned number or a reference number received from a customer. Being able to use prompts such as *Need last invoice from April* should help you find an order faster.

* Find a document by reference and then find a product within the document

  Use a combination of the **Find product** and **Find document** capabilities. You can use a prompt such as, *Need red bicycle from last invoice from April*.

* Find products from attachments
  
  If your typical sale contains multiple products, your customer might send you an attachment with details about the products they want to buy. Being able to understand the attachment and generate suggestions based its content makes it faster to create sales lines.

## What is the intended use of sales line suggestions?

* Find products

  Intended to answer user prompts to find products based on vague, incomplete, or inaccurate descriptions.

  Because the average number of items (products/services) for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] customers is 10.000, finding the right ones might be tough without prior experience or knowledge. The way data is stored in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] doesn’t make things easier, because you need to do multiple searches or filtering exercises on the different pages that store product data.

  Copilot extracts the requested products and quantities and identifies the main search term and attributes, so you can enter your prompt more quickly. Then, Copilot does an advanced search through multiple related tables, applies synonyms, corrects typos, and evaluates the quality of the search output.

* Find a document by reference

  Quickly reply to inquiries by finding sales documents for a customer using partial or approximate information.

  In B2B environments, people often deal with recurring requests, and order processors often need to repeat a past document or at least use it as a starting point. However, finding the right document might be tricky:

  - Through its lifecycle, a sales document can evolve from quote to order to posted invoice or shipment. Documents can also be archived.
  - You might have an ID, but don't know what it represents. For example, is it order number, invoice number, or external reference?
  - Sometimes you have a date or a period, but not an ID for a document.

  To find a source document manually, you need to open multiple pages and use search and filter multiple times. Copilot simplifies this process with a single, natural language query that lets you express what you're looking for in your own way.

  *	*Get products from order 103031*
  *	*Need products from last invoice in August*

* Find products from attachment
  
  Intended to find product suggestions based on the content of a file.
  
  * Copilot analyzes an attached file to understand its format, such as the column separator and data type. It also identifies columns that contain a product, quantity, and unit of measure (optional). You can change review and change the mapping if needed.
  * Copilot passes the contents of columns that contain product details to the **Find product** capability to find the requested items.

## How was sales line suggestions evaluated? What metrics are used to measure performance?

The feature underwent extensive testing where numerous prompts in US English representing both typical use and use by bad actors. Testing was based on [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]'s demonstration data and a large labeled product catalog available as open source.

This feature is built in accordance with Microsoft's Responsible AI Standard. Learn more about responsible AI from Microsoft at [Empowering responsible AI practices](https://aka.ms/RAI).

## What are the limitations of sales line suggestions? How can users minimize the impact of the sales line suggestions limitations when using the system?

* Find products
  
  Find products works best in the English language. While you can use this feature in any of the languages that [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports, item searches in other languages might be less accurate.

If your industry or domain overlaps with what Microsoft considers sensitive topics (such as drugs, violence, adult entertainment, and so on) Copilot might defer to neutral, curated responses, or give inaccurate responses.

Sales line suggestions only populates fields where the **Type** is **Item**, and the **No.**, **Unit of Measure**, and **Quantity**. Other fields, including **Unit Price** and **Location**, use the current logic and are filled in either based on item settings or values from the document header.

The **Variant Code** isn't currently supported. If you can ship a product in two different colors, for example, Copilot finds the product but leaves the **Variant Code** field empty. You need to fill in the field manually.

How you name your items can affect output. For example, using cryptic abbreviations versus friendly names can reduce output quality.

For items, the following table lists the tables and fields that Copilot searches.

|Table  |Fields  |
|---------|---------|
|**Items**     |  * No.<br>* Description<br>* Description 2<br>* Search Description<br>* GTIN<br>* Vendor Item Number       |
|**Item Variant**     | * Code<br>* Description<br>* Description 2	        |
|**Item Reference**     | * Reference No.<br>* Description<br>* Description 2        |
|**Item Attributes**     | * Name<br>* Value        |
|**Item Category**     |  * Code<br>* Description<br>* Parent Category - 1 Level	       |
|**Item Translation**     | * Language<br>* Description<br>* Description 2	        |
|**Item Identifier**     |  * Code       |
|**Extended text Line**     |  * Text      |

* Find documents by reference

  Currently, you can start sales line suggestions from sales orders, invoices, and quotes, and search the following documents:

  * Sales orders
  * Sales quotes
  * Sales invoices
  * Posted sales invoices
  * Posted sales shipments
  * Blanket sales order

  Copilot searches the following fields:

  * Document No.
  * External Document No.
  * Your Reference
  * Quote No.
  * Document Date
  * Sell-to Customer No.

  Copilot doesn't return all lines of the type Item. It transfers only item numbers, variant codes, and quantities. Copilot converts quantities from the source document to the **Sales Unit of Measure**.

* Find products from attachment

Currently, this feature supports only CSV files. If you received files in a different format, for example Microsoft Excel, use the **Save As** action to save the worksheet as a CSV.

To safeguard against scenario where a large file is uploaded, the CSV file is limited to 10,000 characters.

## In which geographies and languages is sales line suggestions available?

[!INCLUDE[copilot-geo-and-language-availability-en-only](includes/copilot-geo-and-language-availability-en-only.md)]

## What operational factors and settings allow for effective and responsible use of the feature?

AI-powered suggestions might sometimes be incorrect or incomplete. You should always review the accuracy of Copilot's suggestions before you choose whether to keep them. Copilot’s suggestions aren't saved to the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] database until you choose the **Keep it** button and exit the Copilot window. You can edit and correct any suggestions before you choose to keep it, or after they're inserted in a sales document.

### What is expected of administrators and end-users when using Sales lines suggestions?

After an administrator enables the **Sales lines suggestions** feature, each user can choose whether to use it always, sometimes, or never.  

Administrators make the overall decision on whether to use Copilot capabilities in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. If administrators enable Copilot, they should be sure to grant access to the appropriate users.

> [!NOTE]
> * We don't support this feature in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises or private cloud.
> * Partners can't extend this feature. That means partner developers can't modify, replace, or extend it.

## Is Copilot the only means to create sales lines?  

No, use of Copilot is optional. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers non-AI-powered ways to insert sales lines or copy documents. Organizations can use both approaches at the same time.  

## How do I give feedback about AI-generated content?  

Each time Copilot provides suggestions, you can provide feedback to Microsoft directly from the Copilot window, using the Like and Dislike buttons. Your feedback remains anonymous and we use this data to improve the quality of the service.

# Troubleshoot synchronization errors

There are lots of moving parts involved in integrating [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)], and sometimes things go wrong. This article points out some of the typical errors that occur and gives some pointers for how to fix them.

Errors often occur either because of something that a user did to coupled records, or something is wrong with how the integration is set up. For errors related to coupled records, users can resolve them themselves. Causes for these errors are often actions, such as deleting data in one, but not both, business apps and then synchronizing. For more information, see [View the Status of a Synchronization](admin-how-to-view-synchronization-status.md).

Errors that are related to how the integration is set up typically require an administrator's attention. You can view these errors on the **Integration Synchronization Errors** page. 

The following table provides examples of typical issues:  

|Issue  |Resolution  |
|---------|---------|
|The permissions and roles assigned to the integration user aren't correct. | This error comes from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] and it often includes the following text, **Principal user (Id=\<user id>, type=8) is missing \<privilegeName> privilege**. This error happens because the integration user is missing a privilege that allows it to access an entity. Typically, this error happens if you're synchronizing custom entities, or if you have an app installed in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] that requires permission to access other [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] entities. To resolve this error, assign the permission to the integration user in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)].<br><br> You can find the integration user name on the **Dataverse Connection Setup** page. The error message provides the name of the permission, which can help you identify the entity for which you need permission. To add the missing privilege, sign in to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] with an administrator account and edit the security role assigned to the integration user. For more information, see [Create or edit a security role to manage access](/power-platform/admin/create-edit-security-role). |
|You're coupling a record that uses another record that isn't coupled. For example, a customer whose currency isn't coupled or an item for which the unit of measure isn't coupled. | You must first couple the dependent record, for example, a currency or unit of measure, and then retry the coupling. |
|Your connection to Dataverse paused during synchronization. For example, because your session timed out. When that happens, the following error displays when you resume your session: _Table connection for table type CRM must be registered using RegisterTableConnection or cmdlet New-NAVTableConnection before it can be used._|* For session timeouts, refresh the page to reconnect to Dataverse. The error message disappears.<br><br>* For an issue in the code, for example, if you're using a custom page to show data from a Dataverse entity, contact your Microsoft partner or support. When you do, use the **Copy details** action to share details about the error. |
|User does not have required privileges (or role membership) to access the org when it is in Admin Only mode.|You can set a sandbox, production, or trial (subscription-based) environment in administration mode so that only users with System Administrator or System Customizer security roles will be able to sign in to that environment. Administration mode is useful when you want to make operational changes and not have regular users affect your work, and not have your work affect end users (non-admins). 
Data synchronization doesn't work on Dataverse environments in Administration mode. Learn how to disable Administration mode in [Administration mode](/power-platform/admin/admin-mode#set-administration-mode).|

The following are some tools on the Integration Synchronization Errors page that can help you manually resolve these issues.  

* The **Source** and **Destination** fields can contain links to the row where the error was found. Choose the link to investigate the error.  
* The **Delete Entries Older than 7 Days** and the **Delete All Entries** actions clean up the list. Typically, you use these actions after you resolve the cause of an error that affects many records. Use caution, however. These actions might delete errors that are still relevant.
* The **Show Error Call Stack** action shows information that can help identify the cause of the error. If you can't resolve the error yourself and you decide to submit a support request, include the information in the support request.

# Split Warehouse Activity Lines

In warehouse put-aways, movements, or picks, and in inventory put-aways and inventory picks, bins are suggested for picking or putting away items. The quantity that's actually in the suggested bin may not be sufficient, or there isn't enough room in the bin to put away the required quantity. In these cases, you can split the line so that the items for one line are either taken from or placed in more than one bin.  

The following procedure applies to the following warehouse documents:

* Warehouse put-aways
* Warehouse movements
* Warehouse picks
* Inventory put-aways
* Inventory movements
* Inventory picks  

## To split warehouse activity lines  

1. Open a warehouse activity line where you are trying to handle an insufficient quantity.  
2. In the **Qty. to Handle** field, enter the reduced quantity that you're able to handle.  
3. On the **Lines** FastTab, choose the **Actions** action, choose the **Functions** action, and then choose the **Split Line** action. A new line appears. The line is a copy of the original line except that the **Qty. to Handle** field contains the quantity that you removed from the original line.  
4. Assign a bin and, if you're using directed put-away and pick, a zone, or continue splitting the line as necessary until you find appropriate bins for all of the quantity.  

> [!NOTE]  
> If the location uses directed put-away and pick and you split the lines, you must be familiar with the warehouse and be able to choose a bin that matches the storage requirements of the item and that fulfills the general requirements of the warehouse document. For example, you would not split a line on a pick document and place some items in bulk storage.

# Walkthrough: Selling, Assembling, and Shipping Kits

<!-- [!INCLUDE[complete_sample_data](includes/complete_sample_data.md)]   -->

To support just-in-time inventory and the ability to customize products to customer requests, assembly orders can be automatically created and linked as soon as the sales order line is created. The link between the sales demand and the assembly supply enables sales order processors to customize the assembly item and promise delivery dates according to component availability. In addition, assembly consumption and output are posted automatically with the shipment of the linked sales order.  

Special functionality exists to govern the shipping of assemble-to-order quantities, both in basic and in advanced warehouse configurations. When workers in charge of assembly finish assembling parts or all of the assemble-to-order quantity, they record it in the **Qty. to Ship** field on the warehouse shipment line, in advanced configurations, and then choose **Post Shipment**. The result is that the corresponding assembly output is posted, including the related component consumption, and a sales shipment for the quantity is posted for the linked sales order. This walkthrough illustrates the advanced warehouse process.  

In basic warehouse configurations, when an assemble-to-order quantity is ready to be shipped, the warehouse worker in charge posts an inventory pick for the sales order lines. This creates an inventory movement for the components, posts the assembly output, and the sales order shipment. For more information, see [Handling Assemble-to-Order Items in Inventory Picks](warehouse-how-to-pick-items-with-inventory-picks.md#handling-assemble-to-order-items-with-inventory-picks).  

## About This Walkthrough

This walkthrough demonstrates the following tasks:  

### Setting up Assembly Items

Assembly items are characterized by their replenishment system and the assembly BOM. The item's assembly policy can be either assemble-to-order (ATO) or assemble-to-stock (ATS). This section covers the following tasks:  

-   Setting the appropriate replenishment system and assembly policy on a new assembly item card.  
-   Creating an assembly BOM that lists the assembly components and the resource that go into the assembly item.  

### Selling Customized Assembly Items

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides the flexibility to enter both an inventory quantity and an assemble-to-order quantity on one sales order line. This section covers the following tasks:  

-   Creating a pure ATO sales order line where the full quantity is unavailable and must be assembled before shipment.  
-   Customizing ATO items.  
-   Recalculating the unit price of a customized assembly item.  
-   Creating a mixed sales order line where parts of the sales quantity is provided from inventory and the remaining part must be assembled before shipment.  
-   Understanding ATO availability warnings.  

### Planning for Assembly Items

Assembly demand and supply are handled by the planning system, just like for purchase, transfer, and production. This section covers the following tasks:  

-   Running a regenerative plan for items with sales demand for assembled supply.  
-   Generating an assembly order to fulfill a sales line quantity by the demanded shipment date.  

### Assembling Items

Assembly orders function in a similar way as production orders, expect the consumption and output is recorded and posted directly from the order. When the items are assembled to inventory, the assembly worker has full access to all header and line fields. When the items are assembled to an order where the quantity and date are promised to the customer, then certain fields on the assembly order are not editable. In that case, the assembly posting is performed from the warehouse shipment for the linked sales order. This section covers the following tasks.  

-   Recording and posting assembly consumption and output to inventory.  
-   Accessing a warehouse shipment line from an ATO assembly order to record assembly work.  
-   Accessing an ATO assembly order from a warehouse shipment line to review the automatically entered data.  

### Shipping Assembly Items, from Stock and Assembled to Order

Special functionality exists to govern the shipping of assemble-to-order quantities. This section covers the following tasks:  

-   Creating a warehouse pick for inventory assembly items and for assembly components to be assembled before shipment.  
-   Registering warehouse picks for assembly components and then for assembly items.  
-   Accessing an assembly order from a warehouse shipment to review picked or consumed components.  
-   Shipping assemble-to-order quantities.  
-   Shipping inventory assembly items.  

## Roles

This walkthrough demonstrates tasks that are performed by the following user roles:  

-   Sales Order Processor  
-   Planner  
-   Assembly Worker  
-   Picker

## Story

On January 23, Susan, the sales order processor takes an order from The Device Shop for three units of Kit B, which is an ATO item. All three units are customized and must contain the strong graphics card and an extra RAM block. The disc drives are upgraded to DWD because the CD drives are unavailable. Susan knows that the units can be assembled immediately, and leaves the suggested shipment date of January 23.  

At the same time, the customer orders fifteen units of Kit A with a special request that five units be customized to contain the strong graphics card. Although Kit A is typically an assemble-to-stock item, the order processor combines the sales line quantities to sell ten units from stock and assemble five customized units to the order. The ten units of Kit A are unavailable and must first be supplied to inventory by an assembly order according to the item's assembly policy. Susan learns from the assembly department that Kit A units cannot be completed in the current week. Susan sets the shipment date of the second sales order line, for the mixed ATO and inventory quantity, to January 27 and informs the customer that the 15 units of Kit A will be shipped four days later than the three units of Kit B. To signal to the shipping department that this sales order requires assembly processing, Susan creates the warehouse shipment document from the sales order.  

Eduardo, the planner, runs the planning worksheet and generates an assembly order for ten standard units of Kit A with an internal due date of January 27.  

Sammy, who is responsible for shipping, gets three warehouse shipment lines for the sales order: One line for the three pure ATO units, one line for the five ATO units on the mixed sales order line, and one line for the ten ATS units on the mixed sale order line. Sammy creates a warehouse pick document for all the assembly components that are needed to assemble the total of eight ATO units on the warehouse shipment document.  

John, the picker, retrieves components for all the ATO quantities on the warehouse shipment document and brings them to the assembly area. John enters the quantity to handle and registers the warehouse pick.  

Linda assembles the three ATO units of Kit B. The components are already picked, and Linda does not record output and consumption quantities or post the order, because both of these actions are performed automatically through the related warehouse shipment lines.  

Sammy records the assembled quantity on the warehouse shipment line and posts the shipment of the three units of Kit B. The first line on the sales order is updated as shipped. The linked assembly order remains open until the sales order is fully invoiced. The two warehouse shipment lines, one ATO and one ATS, for Kit A with due dates on January 27 remain open.  

On January 27, Linda processes two assembly orders for Kit A. The first order is the ATO order for five units, which Linda processes differently than the ATO order for Kit B processed on January 23. On this order, Linda is authorized to access the warehouse shipment line herself to record the completed assembly work. The needed components are ready in the assembly department, as they were picked together with components for Kit B.  

The second assembly order is the ATS order for ten units that were created by the planning system. On this ATS order, Linda performs all involved actions from the assembly order. Linda creates a warehouse pick document for the assembly components that are needed to assemble the ten units. When the PCs are assembled, Linda posts the assembly order and thereby signals that the items are available in inventory and can be picked for shipment.  

Sammy creates a warehouse pick document for any quantities that remain before the warehouse shipment can be posted. A pick document is created for the ten units of Kit A that have just finished. The components needed to assemble the five units of Kit A to order where picked on January 23.  

John brings the ten units of Kit A from the warehouse to the specified shipping area, records the quantity to handle, and then registers the pick.  

Sammy packs the ten ATS units with the five ATO units that Linda assembled earlier in the day. Sammy fills in the quantity to ship on both lines and then posts the last shipment for The Device Shop. The related assembly order for five units of Kit A is automatically posted. The second line on the sales order is updated as shipped. Two linked assembly order remains open until the sales order is invoiced and closed.  

When the sales order is later posted as fully invoiced, the sales order and the linked assembly orders are removed.

    >   
    >  In this section, actions on the assembly order are performed indirectly from the warehouse shipment line. For more information about how to process an assembly order directly, see the "Assemble Items to Inventory" section in this walkthrough.  

2.  Open the most recent warehouse shipment that is created at WHITE location.  

    Notice the three warehouse shipment lines: One line for the ATO quantity of Kit B, due on January 23. One line for the ATO quantity of Kit A, due on January 27. One line for the inventory quantity of Kit A, due on January 27.  

    The **Assemble to Order** field specifies the assembly method.

    Next, create a pick document for all the ATO assembly components that are needed on the warehouse shipment.  

3.  Choose the **Create Pick** action, and then choose the **OK** button.  

    Next, perform the picker's task.  

4.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Picks**, and then choose the related link.  
5.  Open the warehouse pick document that you created in step 3 in this section.  

    Notice the value in the **Source Document** field and that all the pick lines are for assembly components.  

    Next.register the pick without changing the default information.  

6.  Choose the **Autofill Qty. to Handle** action.  
7.  Choose the **Register Pick** action.  

    Return to performing the shipping tasks.  

8.  Reopen the **Warehouse Shipment** page.  

    Notice that the **Qty. Picked** field is still empty on all lines. This is because you still have not picked the items to be shipped, but only the components needed to assemble the ATO quantities.  

    Proceed to review the related assembly order.  

9. Select the shipment line for three units of Kit B.  
10. On the **Lines** FastTab, choose **Line**, and then choose **Assemble to Order**. The **Assembly Order** page opens.  

    Notice that several fields on the assembly order are unavailable because the order is linked to a sales order.  

    Notice on the assembly order lines that the **Qty. Picked** field is filled. This is due to the pick that you registered in step 7 in this section.  

11. In the **Quantity to Assemble** field, try to enter any value lower than **3**.  

    Read the error message explaining why this field can only be filled through the **Qty. to Ship** field on the related shipment.  

    The **Quantity to Assemble** field is editable is to support situations where you want to partially ship an inventory quantity instead of assembling more units to the order. For more information, see the "Combination Scenarios" section in [Understanding Assemble to Order and Assemble to Stock](assembly-assemble-to-order-or-assemble-to-stock.md).  

12. Close the **Assembly Order** page to return to the **Warehouse Shipment** page.  
13. On the shipment line for three units of Kit B, in the **Qty. to Ship** field, enter **3**.  
14. Choose the **Post Shipment** action, and then select the **Ship** button.  

    Along with this warehouse shipment posting, the full consumption and output quantities of the related assembly order are posted, and the **Remaining Quantity** field is empty. The sales order line for Kit B is updated to show that the three units are shipped.  

    Warehouse activities to fulfill the first sales order line by January 23 are completed. Next, fulfill the sales order lines that are shipping on January 27  

### Assembling and Recording the Second ATO Quantity  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Assembly Orders**, and then choose the related link.  

    Notice that the ATO order for shipped units of Kit B is still in the list, although the **Remaining Quantity** is empty. This is because the linked sales order is still not fully invoiced.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  In this section, the assembly worker is responsible for recording the completed ATO assembly work on the warehouse shipment line. This workflow may occur in environments where the assembly work is performed in a separate assembly department and assembly workers are authorized to change the warehouse shipment line.  

2.  Open the ATO assembly order for five units of Kit A.  

    Notice that the **Quantity to Assemble** and the **Quantity to Consume** fields are empty because no work is recorded yet.  

    Notice on the assembly order lines that the **Qty. Picked** field is filled. This is due to the pick that was registered on January 23.  

    Next, record that the assembly order is completed.  

3.  Choose the **Asm.-to-Order Whse. Shpt. Line** action.  
4.  On the **Asm.-to-Order Whse. Shpt. Line** page, in the **Qty. to Ship** field, enter **5**, and then close the page.  

    Notice on the **Assembly Order** page that the **Quantity to Assemble** and the **Quantity to Consume** fields are now filled with the output and consumption quantities that will be posted with the shipment.  

5.  Close the **Assembly Order** page.  

### Assembling the ATS Quantity  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Assembly Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Open the assembly order for ten units of Kit A.  

    Notice that the **Quantity to Assemble** field is filled with the expected quantity.  

    Next, create a pick document to retrieve the needed components.  

3.  Choose the **Release** action.  
4.  Choose the **Create Whse. Pick** action, and choose the **OK** button.  

    Next, perform the picker's task.  

5.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Picks**, and then choose the related link.  
6.  Open the warehouse pick document that you created in step 4 in this section.  

     Proceed to register the pick without changing the default information.  

7.  Choose the **Autofill Qty. to Handle** action.  
8.  Choose the **Register Pick** action.  

    Return to the assembly order to perform the last assembly task.  

9. In the **Assembly Order**, choose the **Post** action, and then choose the **Yes** button.  

    Notice that the assembly order is removed from the list of open orders.  

### Shipping the Remaining Items, Partly from Stock and Partly Assembled to the Order  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Warehouse Shipment**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Open the most recent warehouse shipment that is created at WHITE location.  

    Notice on the line for ten units of Kit A that the **Qty. to Ship** and **Qty. Picked** field are empty.  

    Next, pick any remaining items.  

3.  Choose the **Create Pick** action, and then choose the **OK** button.  

    Next, perform the picker's last task for this warehouse shipment.  

4.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Picks**, and then choose the related link.  
5.  Open the warehouse pick document that you created in step 3 in this section.  

    Notice that this pick document is for assembly item, not for assembly components.  

    Next, register the pick without changing the default information.  

6.  Choose the **Autofill Qty. to Handle** action.  
7.  Choose the **Register Pick** action, and then choose the **Yes** button.  

    Return to the warehouse shipment to perform the last task.  

8.  Reopen the **Warehouse Shipment** page.  

    On the **Warehouse Shipment** page, on the line for ten units of Kit A, notice that the **Qty. to Ship** and **Qty. Picked** fields now contain **10**.  

9. Choose the **Post Shipment** action, and the choose **Ship**.  

    The warehouse shipment document is removed, which indicates that the involved warehouse activities are completed. Next, verify that the sales order has been processed.

# Bulk Invoicing for Microsoft Bookings in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]

If your company uses the Bookings app in Microsoft 365, you can do bulk invoicing for appointments. The **Bookings Not Invoiced** page in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides a list of the company's completed bookings. In this page you can quickly select the appointments that you want to invoice and create draft invoices for the services provided.  

## Connect to Bookings

To connect your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with Bookings, you must specify your Bookings company, what to synchronize with Bookings, how often to synchronize, and which templates to use. You set up this information on the **Booking Sync. Setup** page, which you can launch from the **Exchange Sync. Setup** page, which you can find through [Search](ui-search.md).  

For example, if you want to synchronize customers between Bookings and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you must specify the default template to use to add new customers in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] based on the customers in your Bookings company.  

> [!NOTE]
> The Bookings app is designed to book appointments for individual customers rather than companies. The synchronization with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will, therefore, only synchronize customer contacts with a Type of *Person*. An email address is also required for the contact to synchronize.  

Similarly, if you want to synchronize service items between Bookings and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you must specify the default template to use to add new service items in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] based on the services in our Bookings company.  

> [!NOTE]
> Only items of type *Service* will synchronize between Bookings and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The template that you set up in the **Configuration Templates** page so it can be used for the item synchronization must define the type as *Service*.

## Invoice Appointments

When it is time to send invoices for the completed bookings, you go to the **Bookings Not Invoiced** page. Depending on how often the information is synchronized, the list is long or short. You can create invoices for all bookings in the list or one booking at a time. You can select one or more entries in the list and invoice those only.  

The support for invoicing appointments from Bookings is simpler than the fuller workflow of working with sales quotes, sales orders, and sales invoices. For more information, see [Invoice Sales](sales-how-invoice-sales.md). You can choose to sell your services using [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] or choose to use Bookings, depending on your business needs.  

> [!NOTE]
> In May 2022, we discovered an issue in the integration with Bookings. Currently, the sync from Bookings to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] requires you to manually associate the invoices with customers in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

# Manage product variants

Item variants are a great way to keep your list of products under control. For example, you have a large number of items that are almost identical and vary only in color. You can define each variant as a separate item. But you can also choose to set up one item and specify the various colors as variants of the item.  

> [!TIP]
> For a practical introduction to using variants in production, see [Walkthrough: Variants](contoso-coffee/manufacturing/variants.md) for the Contoso Coffee demo data.  

## Add variants to an item

It's easy enough to define variants for an item.  

### To add variants

1. Open [the **Items List** page](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=31), open the relevant item.  
2. On the **Item** card, choose the **Related** action, then choose **Item**, and then choose the **Variants** action.  
3. On the **Item Variants** page, list the variants.  

Then, when you create a sales document and add the item, you can specify the variant of the item in the Variant **Code** field. The same applies to purchasing documents.  

## Item availability by variant

[!INCLUDE [inventory_variant-availability](includes/inventory_variant-availability.md)]

## Require use of variants

Starting in 2022 release wave 2, admins can require that users specify the variant in documents and journals for items that have variants. To activate the capability, on the **Inventory Setup** page, and select the **Variant Mandatory if Exists** field. You can override this global setting for specific items.  

On item cards, the **Variant Mandatory if Exists** field has the following options:

|Field value |Description|
|---------|----|
|Default (No)| The setting from **Inventory Setup** applies to this item.|
|No| Users aren't required to specify a variant for this item.|
|Yes| If the item has one or more variants, users must specify the relevant variant. If they don't, they're blocked from posting the transaction.|

> [!NOTE]
> These settings don't affect items that don't have variants.

If the capability is switched on, you can't post an entry if the variant isn't specified.

# Report and document layouts overview

A report layout controls content and format of the report. For example, the data fields in the report dataset that appear on the report, how they're arranged, the text style, images, and so on. From [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can change which layout is used on a report, create new layout, or modify the existing layouts.

> [!NOTE]  
> In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the term "report" also covers externally facing documents, such as sales invoices and order confirmations that you send to customers as PDF files.

You can also use report layouts to add content to email messages. For example, report layouts can save time and help ensure consistency by reusing the same content when you communicate with your customers. To use custom report layouts with email, the file type for the layout must be Word. You can't use the RDLC file type. Learn more in [Set up reusable email texts and layouts](admin-how-setup-email.md#set-up-reusable-email-texts-and-layouts).

## Introduction

A report layout sets up the following things:

* The label and data fields to include from the dataset of the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] report.
* The text format, such as font type, size, and color.
* The company logo and its position.
* General page settings, such as margins and background images.

You can set up multiple layouts for a report, and then switch between them to suit different reporting needs.

<!--You can use one of the built-in report layouts or you can create custom report layouts and assign them to your reports as needed. Learn more in [Create a Custom Report or Document Layout](ui-how-create-custom-report-layout.md).-->

There are two important aspects of report layouts that influence how you work with them:

* The **Layout Type** indicates the kind of file that the layout is based on.
* The **Layout Source** indicates the origin of the layout.

## Layout types

There are four types of layouts that you can use for reports:

* Word
* RDLC
* Excel
* External

### Word

Word layouts are based on Word documents (.docx file type). Word layouts enable you to design report layouts by using Microsoft Word. A Word layout determines the report's content - controlling how that content elements are arranged and how they look. A Word layout document typically uses tables to arrange content, where the cells can contain data fields, text, or pictures.

[![Example of a word report layout document for Business Central.](media/word-layout-overview.png)](media/word-layout-overview.png#lightbox)

<!--![Example of a word report layout document for Business Central.](media/nav_wordreportlayout_edit_in_word_example.png) -->

Learn more in [Work with Word Layouts](ui-how-add-fields-word-report-layout.md).

### Excel

Excel layouts are based on Microsoft Excel workbooks (.xlsx file type). They let you create reports by using familiar Excel features for summarizing, analyzing, and presenting data with tools like formulas, PivotTables, PivotCharts, and more.

[![Shows the an example of an Excel layout.](media/excel-layout-2.png)](media/excel-layout-2.png#lightbox)

Learn more in [Work with Excel Layouts](ui-excel-report-layouts.md).

### RDLC

RDLC layouts are based on client report definition layout files (.rdl or .rdlc file types). These layouts are created and modified by using SQL Server Report Builder or Microsoft RDLC Report Designer. The design concept for RDLC layouts is similar to Word layouts, where the layout determines what fields to show and how they're arranged. However, designing RDLC layouts is more advanced than Word layouts.

[![Shows the an example of an RDLC layout.](media/rdlc-layout-overview.png)](media/rdlc-layout-overview.png#lightbox)

Learn more in [Work with RDLC Layouts](ui-rdlc-report-layouts.md).

### External

An external layout type refers to an advanced type designed for specific reports. The reports and the layouts themselves are typically provided by partners, not Microsoft. The actual file type of the layout varies depending on the provider.

Learn more in [Developing a custom report render](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-report-custom-render).

## Layout sources

In addition to the type, layouts are further divided into three categories, based on their source or origin.

* Extension layouts

   Extension layouts are layouts that are part of an extension installed in a [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] environment. These layouts are typically standard layouts provided by Microsoft, for example, in the base application. Or, they could be layouts that are included in extensions from other software providers. You can identify extension layouts on the **Report Layouts** page because the **Extension** column shows the extension name and publisher.

* User-defined layouts

   The other source of layouts is the people who use [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. People with the right permissions can add new layouts in various ways. For example, you could start from an existing extension layout or a user-defined layout. You can identify user-defined layouts on the **Report Layouts** page because the **Extension** column is blank.

   Learn more in [Get started creating report layouts](ui-get-started-layouts.md).

* Custom layouts (obsolete)

  Custom layouts are also layouts that users create. The difference is that these layouts are created from the now obsolete **Custom Report Layouts** page, and they can only be Word and RDLC type. Although you can still create custom layouts, they're being phased out in favor of user-defined layouts.

  Learn more in [(Obsolete) Create and modify custom report layouts](ui-how-create-custom-report-layout.md).

Learn more about which type is best for you in [Decide what type of layout you want](ui-get-started-layouts.md#decide).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> One important thing to remember is that you can't modify extension layouts from the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] client. For example, you can't change the layout name or type, or upload and replace it with another version. If you try, an error message displays. You can create a user-defined or custom layout based on the extension layout instead.

<!--
### Built-in and custom report layouts

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes several built-in layouts. Built-in layouts are predefined layouts that are designed for specific reports. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] reports will have a built-in layout as either an RDLC report layout, Word report layout, or in some cases both. You can’t modify a built-in report layout from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] but you use them as a starting point for building your own custom report layouts.

Custom layouts are report layouts that you design to change the appearance of a report. You typically create a custom layout based on a built-in layout, but you can create them from scratch or from a copy of an existing custom layout. Custom layouts enable you to have multiple layouts for the same report, which you switch among as needed. For example, you can have different layouts for each [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] company, or you can have different layouts for the same company for specific occasions or events, like a special campaign or holiday season.

Deciding on whether to use a Word, Excel, or RDLC layout type will depend on how you want the generated report to look and your knowledge of tools for creating the layouts, like Word, Excel, and SQL Server Report Builder.

* The general design concepts for Word and RDLC layouts are similar. However each type has certain design features that affect how the generated report appears in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. This means that the same report might look different when using the Word report layout compared to the RDLC report layout.

* The process for setting up Word, Excel, and RDLC report layouts on reports is the same. The main difference is in the way you modify the layouts. Word and especially Excel layouts are typically easier to create and modify than RDLC report layouts because you use Word and Excel. RDLC report layouts are modified by using SQL Server Report builder, which targets more advanced users.

* Not all reports and document have a dataset that is optimized for use with an Excel layout. For example, aggregations and complex calculations work best with RDLC or Word layouts. The same is true for documents.

For information about how to switch the layout currently used on a report, see [Set the Layout Used by a Report](ui-set-report-layout.md).

-->

## View report layout lifecycle telemetry

You can set up [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to send data to an Application Insights resource in Microsoft Azure about the actions users take on report layouts, like adding, modifying, deleting, and more. Then, using Azure Monitor, you create reports and set up alerts on the gathered data. Learn more in the following articles of the Developer and IT Pro help:

* [Monitoring and analyzing telemetry - Enable telemetry](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/telemetry-overview?toc=/dynamics365/business-central/toc.json#enable)

# Power BI Sales app

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The reports in the Power BI Sales app provide comprehensive sales analytics to stakeholders at all levels of your organization.

Executives and the leadership team can use the [Sales Overview](sales-powerbi-sales-overview.md), [Period-Over-Period Growth](sales-powerbi-period-over-period-growth.md), and [Month-To-Date](sales-powerbi-month-to-date.md) reports to identify trends in sales performance.

Managers and team leaders can track individual sales team performance using the [Sales by Salesperson](sales-powerbi-sales-by-salesperson.md) report. They can also monitor overall team progress toward meeting sales goals by comparing actual results against targets in the [Actual vs. Budget](sales-powerbi-actual-vs-budget.md)  report.

Sales teams can use aggregated reports, such as the [Sales by Item](sales-powerbi-sales-by-item.md) and [Sales by Customer](sales-powerbi-sales-by-customer.md) reports, to identify top-selling items and the customers that generate the most revenue. You can drill down from these aggregated views into transaction-level data for more detailed analyses.

You can use the reports in the Power BI Sales app for different things, depending on your role. This article provides some examples of use cases for different roles in your organization.

## Sales analytics for the leadership team

The leadership team can use the app to gain a high-level overview of the organization's sales trends and financial health. The app helps leaders identify spending patterns, monitor budget adherence, and make strategic decisions to improve financial performance. It provides a clear picture of sales efficiency and highlights areas for potential cost reduction.

To fit this category, you might have a role such as:

- Executive
- Director
- Other high-level decision maker

### Example scenario: preparing for an upcoming board meeting

Imagine you're the CEO of a company, and you're preparing for an upcoming board meeting. You need to present an analysis of your company's sales performance for the current fiscal year. To better understand the company's current position, you can use the Power BI Sales app.

Start by reviewing the [Period-Over-Period Growth](sales-powerbi-period-over-period-growth.md) report, which provides a quick, comparative view of the current year versus the previous year. Sales are up by 35%, outlined by the [Sales Amount MATG % (Fiscal)](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#sales-amount-matg--fiscal) metric shown in the following image.

:::image type="content" source="media/powerbi/sales/sales-period-over-period-fiscal-year.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Sales Period-Over-Period Power BI report" lightbox="media/powerbi/sales/sales-period-over-period-fiscal-year.png":::

Next, you review the [Sales by Customer](sales-powerbi-sales-by-customer.md) report to identify which group of customers contributed most to sales. The **Sales by Customer** matrix shows that domestic customers outperformed foreign customers by contributing 56.59% to the total annual sales, as the following image shows.

:::image type="content" source="media/powerbi/sales/sales-by-customer-matrix.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Sales by Customer matrix" lightbox="media/powerbi/sales/sales-by-customer-matrix.png":::

Finally, you review the [Moving Averages](sales-powerbi-moving-average.md) report, which visualizes [Sales Amount](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#sales-amount) and [Sales Amount Average 30D](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#sales-amount-avg-30d-fiscal). The 30 day average smooths out the sales trend for the year and provides more good news for the company. On average, sales were stable through the first half of the year and then increased through the second half of the year.

:::image type="content" source="media/powerbi/sales/30-Day-Moving-Average.png" alt-text="Screenshot from the Moving Average Power BI report" lightbox="media/powerbi/sales/30-Day-Moving-Average.png":::

The insights you gained from this report let you confidently present your organization's sales performance to the board, armed with data-driven analysis and a deeper understanding of your company's current position.

## Sales analytics for the management team

The goal of the sales management team is to effectively oversee and manage sales processes. <!--This app allows you to track -->

To fit this category, your job title might be:

- Sales Manager
- Sales Team Leader

### Example scenario: driving sales over the next two quarters

As a Sales Manager, you're tasked with driving sales over the next two quarters. You turn to the Power BI Sales app to understand the sales team's current standing.

Start by reviewing the [Sales by Salesperson](sales-powerbi-sales-by-salesperson.md) report to evaluate individual team performance. You quickly identify Jim Olive as the top performer, generating 83% of the total sales for the year. You also see that Helena Ray was the most profitable salesperson on the team, but only by a small margin.

:::image type="content" source="media/powerbi/sales/sales-by-salesperson-matrix.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Sales by Salesperson matrix" lightbox="media/powerbi/sales/sales-by-salesperson-matrix.png":::

You know that clear targets help Lina and Helena reach their maximum potential. By establishing a new sales budget with revised targets for each salesperson, you can provide your team with the tools they need to progress. Using the [Actual vs. Budget](sales-powerbi-actual-vs-budget.md) report, you monitor progress to ensure the team is on track to meet their new goals.

The [Daily Sales](sales-powerbi-daily-sales.md) report lets you monitor the team's progress over the next two quarters. You can use the heat map to gauge which day of the week the team performs best, and when the company should roll out marketing incentives to help drive customer engagement.

:::image type="content" source="media/powerbi/sales/sales-daily-sales-heat-map.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the heatmap in the Daily Sales Power BI report" lightbox="media/powerbi/sales/sales-daily-sales-heat-map.png":::

## Sales analytics for daily sales work

People who work with sales on a daily basis often focus on handling day-to-day sales tasks with greater accuracy and efficiency.

To fit this category, you might have a job title such as:

- Account Manager
- Sales Person

### Example scenario: using data to drive day-to-day sales

After the sales team receives the new sales targets from the sales manager, they're eager to improve their performance and meet the revised goals. To shape an effective strategy as a salesperson, you turn to the Power BI Sales app for insights into the company's sales patterns.

Start by analyzing the [Sales by Item](sales-powerbi-sales-by-item.md) and [Sales by Customer](sales-powerbi-sales-by-customer.md) reports to identify high-potential products and key customers. These aggregated reports provide a clear view of where opportunities lie. That information helps you focus on the customers and items most likely to generate growth and help your team achieve their targets.

:::image type="content" source="media/powerbi/sales/sales-by-customer-matrix-2.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Sales by Customer matrix version 2" lightbox="media/powerbi/sales/sales-by-customer-matrix-2.png":::

The [Sales by Item](sales-powerbi-sales-by-item.md) report highlights product performance by clearly identifying which items generate the most revenue and, conversely, which items experienced a decline in sales. Targeting key products lets you and your team prioritize your efforts on highly profitable items and items with growing demand.

# Put items away with warehouse put-aways

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you receive items and put them away using one of four methods, as described in the following table.

|Method|Inbound Process|Require Receipts|Require Put-aways|Complexity Level (Learn more at [Warehouse Management Overview](design-details-warehouse-management.md))|  
|------------|---------------------|--------------|----------------|------------|  
|A|Post receipt and put-away from the order line|||No dedicated warehouse activity.|  
|B|Post receipt and put-away from an inventory put-away document||Turned on|Basic: Order-by-order.|  
|C|Post receipt and put-away from a warehouse receipt document|Turned on||Basic: Consolidated receive/ship posting for multiple orders.|  
|D|Post receipt from a warehouse receipt document and post put-away from a warehouse put-away document|Turned on|Turned on|Advanced|  

Learn more at [Inbound Warehouse Flow](design-details-inbound-warehouse-flow.md).

This article refers to method D in the table, and assumes that receiving has already happened. Learn more at [Receive Items](warehouse-how-receive-items.md).

When a location is set up to require warehouse put-away processing and warehouse receive processing, use warehouse put-away documents to control how items are put away. When you post a warehouse receipt, source documents such as purchase, inbound transfer, or sales return orders, are updated. The quantity received is posted to the item ledger, and the lines for the received items are sent to the put-away function in the warehouse.

Depending on the value in the **Use Put-away Worksheet** field on the **Location card**, the lines are either made available to the put-away worksheet or used to generate put-away documents immediately. Learn more at [Setting Up Warehouse Management](warehouse-setup-warehouse.md).  

In addition to the standard ways to create warehouse put-aways that this article describes, you can create put-aways from the related posted warehouse receipt. This is useful if you have deleted put-away lines, or if you decide not to use the put-away worksheet, because you can create or recreate put-away instructions from the posted receipt lines.

## Zone and bin codes

At locations that are set up to use directed put-away and pick, the following settings are required to determine the best place to put the items:  

* A put-away template is set up. Learn more at [Set Up Put-away Templates](warehouse-how-to-set-up-put-away-templates.md).  
* The weight, cubage, and special storage requirements of the item or stock-keeping unit are defined.
* The capacity, bin type, and bin ranking are defined for the bins.  

The bin ranking is used when more than one bin matches the criteria on the put-away template. If both the put-away template criteria and the bin ranking are the same for more than one bin, the bin with the highest number is selected.

## To create put-away documents in bulk with the put-away worksheet  

[!INCLUDE [edit-in-excel](includes/edit-in-excel.md)]

You can create put-away documents for multiple receipts at the same time on the **Put-away Worksheet** page.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Put-away Worksheets**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **Get Warehouse Documents** action. The **Put-away Selection** page opens.  

    The list contains all posted receipts that are ready to be put away, including those for which put-away instructions have already been created. Documents with put-away lines that have been completely put away and registered are not shown on this list.  
3. Select the documents that you want to work on. You can work on lines from several documents at the same time.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > If you select a receipt or internal put-away document for which you've already created instructions for all lines, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]] informs you that there's nothing to handle.  

4. Fill in the **Sorting Method** field to sort the lines.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > The way the lines are sorted in the worksheet doesn't automatically carry through to the put-away instruction. However, the same opportunities for sorting and bin ranking exist. You can recreate the line order you plan in the worksheet when you create the put-away instructions or sort in the put-away instructions.

5. Fill in the **Qty. to Handle** field. Choose the **Autofill Qty.to Handle** action, or fill in the fields manually.  
6. If needed, edit the lines manually. You can delete lines, for example, if some items need to be put away in a bin that's far away from the bins for the other items.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > When you delete lines they're only deleted from this worksheet. They aren't deleted from the put-away selection.  

7. Choose the **Create Put-away** action. The **Create Document** page opens, where you can add more information to the put-away you're creating.  

    * You can assign the put-away to a specific employee.  
    * You can sort the put-away instruction lines as you did in the worksheet or by bin ranking. When you sort according to bin ranking, the *Take* lines appear first, because most receipt bins have a 0 bin ranking. The *Place* lines appear last, starting with the bins with the lowest bin ranking. If you have structured your warehouse so bins of similar bin ranking are side by side, sorting lines in this way will save steps for warehouse employees.  
    * You can choose not to include the lines that [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] created when it converted a large unit of measure to smaller units of measure by selecting the **Set Breakbulk Filter** field. Learn more about breakbulk at [Enable Automatic Breaking Bulk with Directed Put-away and Pick](warehouse-enable-automatic-breaking-bulk-with-directed-put-away-and-pick.md).  
    * You can choose not to have the **Qty. to Handle** field automatically filled in on the put-away instructions.  
    * You can choose to print the document immediately.  

8. Choose **OK** to create the put-away.  

## To create a put-away from a posted receipt

If a location uses both put-away processing and receive processing and you have deleted put-away lines, or if you use directed put-away and pick and have decided not to use the put-away worksheet, you can create or recreate put-away instructions for the posted receipt lines.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Posted Warehouse Receipts**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select a posted receipt to put away.  
3. Choose the **Card** action.  

    If the **Document Status** field is blank, the receipt has not been put away at all. Otherwise, the field indicates whether the receipt is partially or completely put-away.  

4. If the receipt is partially put away or not put away at all, choose the **Create Put-away** action.  
5. Fill in the fields as necessary, and then choose **OK**.  

## To put items away

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Warehouse Put-aways**, and then choose the related link.

2. Open the warehouse put-away that's ready to handle.  
3. If your warehouse requires, enter your user ID when you start work on a put-away.  

    You can sort the put-away lines by various criteria, for example, by item, shelf number, or due date. Sorting can help optimize the put-away process, for example:

    * If the Take and Place lines for each receipt line don't immediately follow one another, and you want them to, sort the lines by selecting **Item** in the **Sorting Method** field.  
    * If bin rankings reflect the physical layout of the warehouse, use the **Bin Ranking** sorting method to organize the work by bin locations.

  > [!NOTE]  
  > Lines are sorted in ascending order by the selected criteria. If you sort by document, sorting is done first by document type based on the **Warehouse Activity Source Document** field. If you sort by ship-to, sorting is done first by destination type based on the **Warehouse Destination Type** field.

4. Perform the actions.

    If a bin code is mandatory for the locations, each receipt line becomes at least two lines in the warehouse put-away, as follows.  

    * The first line, with **Take** in the **Action Type** field, indicates where the items are located in the receiving area. You can't change the zone and bin on this line.  
    * The next line, with **Place** in the **Action Type** field, shows where you must place the items in the warehouse. If you receive a large number of items on one receipt line, you might have to put the items away in several bins, so there's a Place line for each bin. 

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you must place the items for one line in more than one bin, for example because the designated bin is full, use the **Split Line** action on the **Lines** FastTab. The action creates a line for the remaining quantity to handle.

5. When you have placed all the items in bins as instructed, choose the **Register Put-away** action.

# Create G/L budgets

Budgets play an important role in business intelligence. Examples include a financial statement based on financial reports that include budget entries or when analyzing budgeted versus actual amounts in the chart of accounts. To learn more, go to [Financial Reporting](bi.md).

You can create budgets for any given time period. However, most often businesses set up budgets for their fiscal year. You can create multiple budgets for the same period so you can work with multiple budget versions or revisions. You can create budgets for dimensions too, so you can analyze budget variances per dimension. You can work with up to four dimensions in a budget. To learn more, go to [Work with Dimensions](finance-dimensions.md).

In cost accounting, you work with cost budgets in a similar way. To learn more, go to [Creating Cost Budgets](finance-create-cost-budgets.md).  

## To create a new G/L budget

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **G/L Budgets**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **Edit List** action, then fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  
3. Choose the **Edit Budget** action.
4. At the top of the **Budget** page, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  

   The page shows only entries that contain the budget name you entered in the **Budget Name** field. Because you just created the budget name, there are no entries that match the filter. Therefore, the page is empty.  
5. To enter an amount, choose the relevant cell in the matrix. The **G/L Budget Entries** page opens.  
6. Create a new line and fill in the **Amount** field. Close the **G/L Budget Entries** page.  
7. Repeat steps 5 and 6 for all amounts in the budget.  

> [!NOTE]  
> On the **Filters** FastTab, you can filter the budget information by the budget dimensions you set up under the budget name.

## Exporting and importing G/L budgets with Excel

You can export data on budget pages to Microsoft Excel for further processing or analysis and then import budget data back in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

### Exporting G/L budgets to Excel

Exporting a G/L budget to an Excel workbook lets you work offline and using Excel's powerful data manipulation features.

To export the budget to Excel, follow these steps:

1. Open the Budget: Select the budget you want to work on from the list of G/L budgets. Choose the **Edit Budget** action.
1. To export to Excel, on the **Budget** page, choose **Export to Excel**.
1. Choose the dimensions and filters you want to include in the export. For example, you might want to filter by specific departments or projects.
1. To generate the Excel file, choose **OK**.
1. Save the exported Excel file to your local drive for further editing.

### Editing G/L budgets in Excel

After you export the G/L budget to Excel, you can fill in your budget data. Here's a few tips to be more effective and reduce errors:

- Add budget amounts for each combination of dimensions and periods. Ensure that the data is accurate and adheres to the formatting requirements of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For example, your numbering shouldn't have special characters or formatting.
- Take advantage of Excel features such as formulas, data validation, and conditional formatting to streamline data entry and ensure accuracy.
- Save the Excel file after you enter the budget data.
- Make local copies of your budgets as backups.

### Importing G/L budgets to Excel

After you add your budget numbers in a local Excel workbook, the next step is to import it back into [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Do as follows to import the budget from Excel:

1. Open the Budget: Select the budget you want to work on from the list of G/L budgets. Choose the **Edit Budget** action.
1. To import from Excel, on the **Budget** page, choose **Import from Excel**.
1. Choose the Excel file from your local drive. You can choose which budget you're uploading to and whether to add or replace the entries. The **Add** action adds the entries from Excel to entries that already exist. The **Replace** action overwrites entries existing entries in the budget.
1. If everything looks correct, choose **OK** to complete the import process. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] updates the budget with the imported data.

### Scenario example: setting budget targets for payroll expenses

You know that the new budgeted salaries cost is going to be 1.200.000 in local currency (LCY). You want to enable the Salaries department to budget for the three specific lines (of the Posting account type) for full-time employees, part-time employees, and temp help. The three lines are grouped under a Salaries heading line.

You enter 1.200.000 on the Heading line, export the budget to Excel, then send it to the Salaries department, telling them to distribute the LCY 1.200.000.

The Salaries department distributes the amount on the three posting accounts. When you import back into the G/L budget, the three accounts are filled in with the new Excel data, summing to LCY 1.200.000, and the Heading line is blank.

> [!NOTE]
> The chart of accounts, which general ledger (G/L) budgets are based on, has lines of the account type Heading. These lines contain the total of the lines below it. When you export a G/L budget, you export data on all lines regardless of the account type. However, you can only import data on lines of the Posting account type. Similarly, when you import a G/L budget, any values on Heading lines are deleted. They're deleted to avoid incorrect totals after you import data that was created or edited in Excel.

## Tips for effective budget management

Here are some tips for effective budget management:

- Regular Updates: Periodically update your G/L budgets to reflect changes in your financial plans and business environment. You can copy any of the budgets and turn them into forecasts.
- Version Control: Maintain different versions of your budget to compare actual performance against various scenarios.
- Collaboration: Encourage collaboration by involving relevant stakeholders in the budgeting process, ensuring that the budget is comprehensive and realistic.

# (Obsolete) Update Custom Report Layouts

[!INCLUDE[legacy-custom-layouts](includes/legacy-custom-layouts.md)]

Occasionally, you may need to update a custom report layout that is used on a report. This is required when there has been a design change to the report's data set, for example, a field that is used in the layout has been removed from the report data set. If a report layout requires updating, you will get an error message when you try to preview, print or save the report.  

You can automatically update a report layout from the error message that appears when you run the report by choosing the **Yes** button on the error message. Or, in advance of running reports, you can update specific report layouts or all custom report layouts that might be affected by dataset changes.  

You also have the option to test updates without applying the required changes to the custom report layouts. This enables you to see what changes will be applied to the report layout and identify possible issues in the process. From the test results, you can open the custom report layouts directly for editing to fix any issues. We recommend that you test the report layout update before you apply the updates.  

Not all report dataset changes can be automatically updated in the report layouts. Some changes will require that you manually edit the report layout. For more information, see [Limitations of the Custom Report Layout Update](ui-update-report-layouts.md#UpdateLimitations).  

## To update one or more custom report layouts  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Report Layout Selection**, and then choose the related link.  

2.  On the **Report Layout Selection** page, if you want to update a specific report, select the layout from the list, and then choose the **Update Layout** action. Or, if you want to update all custom report layouts for the company, choose the **Update All Layouts** action.  

If no errors occur, then the updates is applied to the report layouts. If errors occur, then a message that contains the errors appears. You will then have to manually edit the custom report layout to fix the error. For more information, see [Fixing Errors](ui-update-report-layouts.md#FixErrors).  

## To test custom report layout updates  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Report Layout Selection**, and then choose the related link.  

2.  On the **Report Layout Selection** page, choose the **Test Layout Updates** action.  

 Changes to the report layouts are tested but not applied to the actual report layouts. A **Report Layout Update Log** page appears that provides the status a potential updates for each report layout. If there are errors for a report layout, you can access the report layout directly for editing from the message to fix any issues. For more information, see [Fixing Errors](ui-update-report-layouts.md#FixErrors).  

##  <a name="UpdateLimitations"></a> Limitations of the Custom Report Layout Update  
 There are several types of changes that the automatic update can apply to custom report layouts, for example, a field that is used in the layout has been removed from the report data set. However, the automatic update cannot handle the following changes to a report dataset.  

1.  Deleted fields, labels, or data items.  

2.  Duplicate field names in the report layout after a field has been renamed in the dataset. This should be treated as a design error.  

3.  Upgrade scenarios where there are multiple iterations of a report layout that causes multiple rename actions on the same fields, labels or data items.  

 If the update process detects any one of these issues, the update cannot be applied. You will have to fix the issues manually, for example by editing the report layout in Word, or programmatically by using upgrade codeunits.  

##  <a name="FixErrors"></a> Fixing Errors  
 If you get an error message when you update or test report layout updates, you most likely will have to modify the report layout to fix the problem. Read the error message to help determine the cause of the problem.  

 The most typical problem occurs when a field that is used on the layout has been removed from the report dataset. In this case, you will see a line in the error message that states that an item has been removed. To fix this issue, you will have to modify the layout and remove the field in question.  

 For more information, see [Create and Modify a Custom Report Layout](ui-how-create-custom-report-layout.md#ModifyCustomLayout).  

After you modify the layout, try to update the layout again.

# Design details: Creating warehouse entries

Warehouse entries contain information about item movements within the warehouse. For example, you create entries when you post a warehouse journal, or any transaction that moves items from one place to another. Each transaction can create several warehouse entries and warehouse register records. Warehouse register records have the first and last warehouse entry numbers. This information lets you identify the warehouse entries that a particular action created. And, conversely, each warehouse entry has a field that points to the warehouse register.

The following image illustrates the relationship between warehouse registers and warehouse entries for three transactions.

:::image type="content" source="media/warehouse register and entries.png" alt-text="Diagram shows the relations between warehouse register records and warehouse entries.":::

## Creating warehouse transactions

When [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates warehouse transactions, it checks the `ConcurrentWarehousingPosting` feature key to determine how to assign entry numbers to warehouse register records and warehouse entries.

### If the feature key is turned off

If the feature key is turned off, both tables are locked. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] finds the last entry in both tables and assigns a number that is one digit higher. For example, if the last entry number is 10, then it assigns the number 11. This method of assignment ensures that warehouse entry numbers are consecutive in the warehouse register, but it blocks other users from registering warehouse transactions.

### If the feature key is turned on

If the feature key is turned on, which it is by default, entry numbers in both tables are assigned from `SequenceNumbers` in the database to allow users to register warehouse transactions at the same time. Using sequence numbers might cause warehouse entry numbers from two or more transactions to overlap, as the following image shows.

:::image type="content" source="media/warehouse register and entries 2.png" alt-text="Diagram shows how warehouse register records and warehouse entries can overlap.":::

## When to turn off the feature key

You might want to turn off the `ConcurrentWarehousingPosting` feature key if you work with a feature or extension that extends warehouse management and the following are true:

* The feature relies on consecutive entry numbers.
* The feature locks tables during a process.

# Work with dimensions

Dimensions are values that categorize entries so you can track and analyze them on documents, such as sales orders. Dimensions can, for example, indicate the project or department an entry came from.  

So, instead of setting up separate general ledger accounts for each department and project, you can use dimensions as a basis for analysis and avoid having to create a complicated chart of accounts. Learn more at [Business Intelligence](bi.md).

Another example is to set up a dimension called *Department*, then use that dimension when you post sales documents. This way, you can use business intelligence tools to see which department sold which items. The more dimensions you use, the more detailed are the reports you base your business decisions on. In fact, a single sales entry can include information from multiple dimensions, such as:  

* The account the item sale was posted to.  
* Where the item was sold.
* Who sold it.
* Which customer bought it.

## Analyze by dimensions

Dimensions play an important role in business intelligence, such as when defining analysis views. Learn more at [Analyze Data by Dimensions](bi-how-analyze-data-dimension.md).

> [!TIP]
> A quick way to analyze transactional data by dimensions is to use the **Set Dimension Filter** action to filter totals by dimensions in the chart of accounts and on pages for entries.

> [!NOTE]
> Analysis views often use data from dimensions. If you discover an incorrect dimension has been used on posted general ledger (G/L) entries, you can correct the dimension values and update your analysis views. This helps keep your financial reports and analyses accurate. Learn more at [Troubleshooting and Correcting Dimensions](finance-troubleshooting-correcting-dimensions.md#changing-dimension-assignments-after-posting).

## Dimension sets

A dimension set is a unique combination of dimension values. They're stored as dimension set entries in the database. Each dimension set entry represents a single dimension value. In addition, each dimension set, and dimension set entry within it, is identified by a common dimension set ID.  

When you create a journal line, document header, or document line, you can specify a combination of dimension values. Instead of explicitly storing each dimension value in the database, a dimension set ID is assigned to the journal line, document header, or document line to specify the dimension set.  

## Set up dimensions

You can define dimensions and dimension values to categorize journals and documents, such as sales orders and purchase orders. You set up dimensions on the **Dimensions** page, where you create one line for each dimension, such as *Project*, *Department*, *Area*, and *Salesperson*.

You also set up values for dimensions. Let's say values represent your company's departments. Dimension values can be set up in a hierarchical structure similar to the chart of accounts. That means data can be broken down into various levels of granularity, and subsets of dimension values can be totaled. You can define as many dimensions and dimension values as you need, and everyone in your company can use them.

When dimensions and values are set up, you can define global and shortcut dimensions on the **General Ledger Setup** page. These dimensions are then always available for you to select as fields on journal and document lines, and ledger entries, without opening the **Dimensions** page first. Learn more in the [To set up global and shortcut dimensions](finance-dimensions.md#to-set-up-global-and-shortcut-dimensions) section.

* **Global Dimensions** are used as filters, for example, on reports, batch jobs, and XMLports. You can use only two global dimensions, so choose dimensions you'll use often.
* **Shortcut Dimensions** are available as fields on journals, document lines, and ledger entries. You can create up to eight of these.  

> [!NOTE]
> After you use a new dimension in any entry, such as a line or new record, you cannot delete the dimension, even if you do not post the entry. This is because [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] immediately creates a dimension set for the line or record. Learn more in the [Dimension Sets](finance-dimensions.md#dimension-sets) section.

### To set up default dimensions for customers, vendors, and other accounts

You can assign a default dimension for a specific account. The dimension is copied to the journal or document when you enter the account number on a line, but you can delete or change the code on the line if appropriate. You can also require a dimension for posting an entry in a specific type of account. > 

> [!NOTE]
> Default dimension priorities open up for scenarios in sales and purchases that you might want to pay special attention to. When you use default dimension priorities on sales and purchase documents, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] always considers the dimensions in the header as coming from the customer or vendor. This is true for dimensions that you set manually or by default, and is especially relevant when you use default dimensions on locations and items but not on customers or vendors.
>
> **Example**
>
> You have a scenario with the following dimension settings:
>
> * A customer without default dimensions
> * An item with ADM as the dimension value for the DEPARTMENT dimension
> * A location with PROD as the dimension value the DEPARTMENT dimension
> * Default dimension priorities are set as Customer > Item > Location
>
> When you create a new document in this scenario, dimensions are used as follows:
>
> * If you create a new document and add a location, the default value for new lines will be PROD. When you add lines with items, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will keep PROD because it comes from the header of the document.
>
> * If you create a new document and add items that have the ADM dimension value, and then specify a location in the header of the document, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will ask whether you want to overwrite the existing lines because there's a conflict.
>
> We recommend that you to test your default dimensions setup, dimension priorities, and the order in which you enter data in documents.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Dimensions**, then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Dimensions** page, select the relevant dimension, then choose the **Account Type Default Dim** action.  
3. Fill in a line for each new default dimension you want to set up. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

> [!TIP]  
> If you want to require a dimension but don't want to assign a default value to the dimension, leave the **Dimension Value Code** field blank, then select **Code Mandatory** in the **Value Posting** field.  

> [!WARNING]  
> If an account is used in an **Adjust Exchange Rates** or **Post Inventory Cost to G/L** batch job, do not select **Code Mandatory** or **Same Code**. These batch jobs cannot use dimension codes.  

> [!NOTE]  
> If an account must have a different dimension than the default dimension assigned to the account type, you must set up a new default dimension for the account. The default dimension for the account then replaces the default dimension for the account type.  

### To set up default dimension priorities

Different account types, such as a customer account and an item account, can have different default dimensions. As a result, an entry might have more than one  proposed default dimension. To avoid such conflicts, you can apply priority rules to the different sources.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Default Dimension Priorities**, then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Default Dimension Priorities** page, in the **Source Code** field, enter the source code for the entry table to which the default dimension priorities will apply.  
3. Fill in a line for each default dimension priority you want for the selected source code.
4. Repeat the procedure for each source code you want to set up default dimension priorities for.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> If you set up two tables with the same priority for the same source code, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] always selects the table with the lowest table ID.  

### To set up dimension combinations

To avoid posting entries with contradictory or irrelevant dimensions, you can block or limit specific combinations of two dimensions. A blocked dimension combination means you can't post both dimensions on the same entry regardless of what the dimension values are. In contrast, a limited dimension combination means you can post both dimensions to the same entry, but only for certain combinations of dimension values.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Dimension Combinations**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Dimension Combinations** page, choose the dimension combination field you want from the following options.  

    |Field|Description|
    |----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**No limitation**|This dimension combination has no restrictions. All dimensions values are allowed.|  
    |**Limited**|This dimension combination has restrictions depending on which dimension values that you enter. You must define the limitations on the **Dimension Value Combination** page.|  
    |**Blocked**|This dimension combination isn't allowed.|  

3. If you selected the **Limited** option, you must define which combinations of dimension values are blocked. To do this, choose the field to define the dimension value combination.  
4. Now select a dimension value combination that is blocked and enter **Blocked** in the field. A blank field means the dimension value combination is allowed. Repeat if multiple combinations are blocked.  

> [!NOTE]  
> The same dimensions are displayed in both rows and columns, meaning all dimension combinations appear two times. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically displays the setting in both fields. You cannot select anything in the fields from the upper-left corner and down, because those fields have the same dimension in both rows and columns.  
>
> The selected option is not visible before you exit the field.  
>
> To show the name of the dimensions instead of the code, select the **Show Column Name** field.

### To set up global and shortcut dimensions

Global and shortcut dimensions can be used as filters in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], including on reports, batch jobs, ledger entry pages, and analysis views. Global and shortcut dimensions can be inserted directly without first opening the **Dimensions** page. On journal and document lines, you can select global and shortcut dimensions in a field on the line. You can set up two global dimensions and eight shortcut dimensions. Choose the dimensions that you use most frequently.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Changing a global or shortcut dimension requires all entries posted with the dimension be updated. To change a global dimension, you can use the **Change Global Dimensions** function, but that can be time-consuming, may affect performance, and tables may be locked during the update. Make sure you choose your global and shortcut dimensions carefully so you won't have to change them later. To change a shortcut dimension, use the **Change Dimensions** action.
>
> Learn more in the [To change global dimensions](finance-dimensions.md#to-change-global-dimensions) section.

> [!NOTE]
> When you add or change a global or shortcut dimension, you are automatically signed out and back in so the new value is prepared for use.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Ledger Setup**, then choose the related link.
2. On the **Dimensions** FastTab, fill in the fields. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

#### To change global dimensions

When you change a global or shortcut dimension, all entries posted with that dimension are updated. Because this process may be time-consuming and can affect performance, two different modes are provided to adapt the process to the size of the database.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Ledger Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **Change Global Dimensions** action.
3. At the top of the page, select one of the following two modes for running the batch job.

    |Option|Description|
    |-|-|
    |**Sequential**|(Default) The change is done in one transaction that reverts all entries to the dimensions they had before the change.<br /><br />This option is recommended if the company has relatively few posted entries, in which case the batch job takes the shortest time to complete. The process locks multiple tables and blocks other users until it's done. Note that with large databases, the process might not complete in this mode. In that case, use the **Parallel** option.|
    |**Parallel**|The dimension change happens in multiple background sessions and the operation is split into multiple transactions. To use this option, turn on the **Parallel Processing** toggle. <br /><br />We recommended this option for large databases or companies with numerous posted entries because it will complete in the shortest time. Note that in this mode, the update process won't start if there's more than one active database session.|  

4. In the **Global Dimension 1 Code** and/or **Global Dimension 2 Code** fields, enter the new dimension(s). The current dimensions are displayed in gray behind the fields.
5. Depending on the mode, do one of the following:
    * In **Sequential** mode, choose the **Start** action.
    * In **Parallel** mode, choose the **Prepare** action.

    The **Log Entries** tab is filled with information about the dimensions to be changed.
6. Sign out of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], then sign in again.
7. Choose the **Start** action to begin the parallel processing of the dimension changes.

### Example of dimension setup

Let's say your company wants to track transactions based on organizational structure and geographic locations. To do that, you set up two dimensions on the **Dimensions** page:

* **AREA**  
* **DEPARTMENT**  

| Code | Name | Code Caption | Filter Caption |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AREA |Area |Area Code |Area Filter |
| DEPARTMENT |Department |Department Code |Department Filter |

For **AREA**, add the following dimension values:

| Code | Name | Dimension Value Type |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 10 |Americas |Begin-Total |
| 20 |North America |Standard |
| 30 |Pacific |Standard |
| 40 |South America |Standard |
| 50 |Americas, Total |End-Total |
| 60 |Europe |Begin-Total |
| 70 |EU |Standard |
| 80 |Non-EU |Standard |
| 90 |Europe, Total |End-Total |

For the two main geographic areas, Americas and Europe, you add subcategories for regions by indenting the dimension values. This lets you report on sales or expenses in regions, and get totals for the larger geographic areas. You could also choose to use countries, regions, counties, or cities as your dimension values, depending on your business.

> [!NOTE]  
> To set up a hierarchy, the codes must be in alphabetical order. This includes the codes of the dimension values provided in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

For **DEPARTMENT**, add the following dimension values:

| Code | Name | Dimension Value Type |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ADMIN |Administration |Standard |
| PROD |Production |Standard |
| SALES |Sales |Standard |

With this setup, you can add your two dimensions as the two global dimensions on the **General Ledger Setup** page. This means you can use AREA and DEPARTMENT as filters for general ledger entries, as well as on all reports. Both global dimensions are also automatically available for use on entry lines and document headers as shortcut dimensions.

## Getting an overview of dimensions used multiple times

The **Default Dimensions-Multiple** page specifies how a group of accounts uses dimensions and dimension values. You can set this up by highlighting multiple accounts, then specifying default dimensions and dimension values for them. After that, the application suggests these dimensions and dimension values whenever one of these accounts is used, such as on a journal line. This makes entry posting easier for the user, as the dimension fields are filled in automatically. Also note, however, that the dimension values suggested can be changed on, for example, a journal line.

The **Default Dimensions-Multiple** page contains the following fields:

|Field|Description|
|-----|-----------|  
|**Dimension Code**|Shows all dimensions defined as default dimensions on one or more highlighted accounts. By choosing this field, you can see a list of all available dimensions. If you select a dimension, that dimension is defined as a default dimension for all highlighted accounts.|
|**Dimension Value Code**|Shows either a single dimension value or the term (Conflict). If a dimension value is shown in the field, then all highlighted accounts have the same default dimension value for a dimension. If the term (Conflict) is shown in the field, then not all highlighted accounts have the same default dimension value for a dimension. Upon choosing the **Dimension Code** field, you'll see a list of all available dimension values for a dimension. If you select a dimension value, it will be defined as a default dimension value for all highlighted accounts.|
|**Value Posting**|Shows either a single value posting rule or the term (Conflict). If a value posting rule is shown in the field, then all highlighted accounts have the same value posting rule for a dimension value. If the term (Conflict) is shown in the field, then not all the highlighted accounts have the same value posting rule for a dimension value. Upon choosing the **Value Posting** field, you'll see a list of value posting rules for a dimension. If you select a value posting rule, it will be applied to all highlighted accounts.|

## Use dimensions

In a document such as a sales order, you can add dimension information for both an individual document line and the document itself. So on the **Sales Order** page, you could enter dimension values for the first two shortcut dimensions on the individual sales lines, then add more dimension information if you choose the **Dimensions** button.  

If you work in a journal instead, you can add dimension information to an entry in the same way, if you have set up shortcut dimensions as fields directly on journal lines.  

You can also set up default dimensions for accounts or account types, so dimensions and dimension values are filled in automatically.

### To view global dimensions in ledger entry pages

Global dimensions are always company-defined and company-named. To see the global dimensions for your company, open the **General Ledger Setup** page.

In a ledger entry page, you can see whether there are global dimensions for the entries. The two global dimensions differ from your other dimensions because you can use them as filters anywhere in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Chart of Accounts**,  then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Chart of Accounts** page, choose the **Ledger Entries** action.  
3. To see only entries that are relevant, set one or more filters on the page.  
4. To see all the dimensions for an entry, select the entry, then choose the **Dimensions** action.  

> [!NOTE]  
> The **Ledger Entry Dimensions** page displays the dimensions one ledger entry at a time. You'll see as you scroll through the ledger entries, the content on the **Ledger Entry Dimensions** page changes accordingly.

# Managing Sales Opportunities
Any incoming lead can be considered a sales opportunity. You can create opportunities and associate them to a salesperson so that you can keep track of potential sales.

Before you can start using opportunity management, you must set up sales cycles and sales cycle stages. As you create opportunities, you should provide information about the contact, salesperson, sales cycle, and dates, as well as your estimates for the sales value of the opportunity and your estimation of the chances of its success.

The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the topics that describe them.

| To | See |
| --- | --- |
| Set up the sales cycles that you usually follow, and the different stages within each opportunity sales cycle. |[Set Up Opportunity Sales Cycles and Cycle Stages](marketing-how-setup-opportunity-sales-cycles-stages.md) |
| Create sales opportunities that you have from your contacts. |[Create Opportunities](marketing-how-create-opportunities.md) |
| Move a sales opportunity through the sales cycle to completion. |[Process Sales Opportunities](marketing-processing-sales-opportunities.md) |

# Handling missing option values

This article is intended for a technical audience. The processes it describes require the help of a developer.

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] contains three option set fields that contain values that you can map to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] fields of the Option type for automated synchronization. During synchronization, nonmapped options are ignored and the missing options are appended to the related [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] table and added to the **Dataverse Option Mapping** system table to handle manually later. For example, by adding the missing options in either product and then updating the mapping.

The **Integration Table Mapping** page contains three fields that contain one or more mapped option values. After a full synchronization, the **Dataverse Option Mapping** page contains the nonmapped options in the three fields.

|         Record             | Option Value | Option Value Caption |
|----------------------------|--------------|----------------------|
| Payment Terms: NET30	     | 1            | Net 30	           |
| Payment Terms: 2%10NET30   | 2            | 2% 10; Net 30        |
| Payment Terms: NET45	     | 3            | Net 45               |
| Payment Terms: NET60	     | 4            | Net 60               |
| Shipment Method: FOB	     | 1            | FOB                  |
| Shipment Method: NOCHARGE  | 2            | No Charge            |
| Shipping Agent: AIRBORNE   | 1            | Airborne             |
| Shipping Agent: DHL        | 2            | DHL                  |
| Shipping Agent: FEDEX      | 3            | FedEx                |
| Shipping Agent: UPS        | 4            | UPS                  |
| Shipping Agent: POSTALMAIL | 5            | Postal Mail          |
| Shipping Agent: FULLLOAD   | 6            | Full Load            |
| Shipping Agent: WILLCALL   | 7            | Will Call            |

The content of the **Dataverse Option Mapping** page is based on enum values in the **CRM Account** table. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)], the following fields on the account table are mapped to fields on the customer and vendor records:

- **Address 1: Freight Terms** of data type Enum, where values are defined as follows:

```
enum 5335 "CDS Shipment Method Code"
{
    Extensible = true;
    value(0; " ") { Caption = ' '; }
    value(1; "FOB") { Caption = 'FOB'; }
    value(2; "NoCharge") { Caption = 'No Charge'; }
}
```

- **Address 1: Shipping Method** of data type Enum, where values are defined as follows:

```
enum 5336 "CDS Shipping Agent Code"
{
    Extensible = true;
    value(0; " ") { Caption = ' '; }
    value(1; "Airborne") { Caption = 'Airborne'; }
    value(2; "DHL") { Caption = 'DHL'; }
    value(3; "FedEx") { Caption = 'FedEx'; }
    value(4; "UPS") { Caption = 'UPS'; }
    value(5; "PostalMail") { Caption = 'Postal Mail'; }
    value(6; "FullLoad") { Caption = 'Full Load'; }
    value(7; "WillCall") { Caption = 'Will Call'; }
}
```

- **Payment Terms** of data type Enum, where values are defined as follows:

```
enum 5334 "CDS Payment Terms Code"
{
    Extensible = true;
    value(0; " ") { Caption = ' '; }
    value(1; "Net30") { Caption = 'Net 30'; }
    value(2; "2%10Net30") { Caption = '2% 10; Net 30'; }
    value(3; "Net45") { Caption = 'Net 45'; }
    value(4; "Net60") { Caption = 'Net 60'; }
}
```

All of the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] enums are mapped to option sets in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)].

## Extending option sets in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]
1. Create a new AL extension.

2. Add an Enum extension for the options that you want to extend. Be sure that you use the same value. 

```
enumextension 50100 "CDS Payment Terms Code Extension" extends "CDS Payment Terms Code"
{
    value(779800001; "Cash Payment") { Caption = 'Cash Payment'; }
    value(779800002; "Transfer") { Caption = 'Transfer'; }
}
```

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> You must use the same option ID values from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] when you extend the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] enum. Otherwise synchronization will fail.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Do not use the ","  character in the enum values and captions. This is currently not supported by the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] runtime.

> [!NOTE]
> The first ten characters of the new option value names and captions must be unique. For example, two options named "Transfer 20 working days" and "Transfer 20 calendar days" will cause an error because both have the same first 10 characters, "Transfer 2". Name them, for example, "TRF20 WD" and "TRF20 CD."

## Update [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] option mapping
Now you can recreate the mapping between [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] options and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] records.

On the **Integration Table Mapping** page, choose the line for the **Payment Terms** map, and then choose the **Synchronize Modified Records** action. The **Dataverse Option Mapping** page is updated with the following records.

|         Record                 | Option Value   | Option Value Caption |
|--------------------------------|----------------|----------------------|
| Payment Terms: NET30	         | 1              | Net 30	             |
| Payment Terms: 2%10NET30       | 2              | 2% 10; Net 30        |
| Payment Terms: NET45 	         | 3              | Net 45               |
| Payment Terms: NET60	         | 4              | Net 60               | 
| **Payment Terms: CASH PAYME**  | **779800001**  | **Cash Payment**     |
| **Payment Terms: TRANSFER**    | **779800002**  | **Transfer**         |

The **Payment Terms** table in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] has new records for the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] options. In the following table, new options are in bold font. Italic rows represent all options that can now be synchronized. Remaining rows represent options aren't in use and are ignored during synchronization. You can remove them or extend Dataverse options with the same names.

# Average Production Times (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Average Production Times** report shows the detailed average production times for each item. The report can help you make informed decisions and optimize your production processes.

:::image type="content" source="media/manufacturing/avergage-production-times-v26.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Average Production Times Power BI Report" lightbox="media/manufacturing/avergage-production-times-v26.png":::

## Use the report

The report is meant for manufacturing managers and supervisors.

Manufacturing managers use the report to understand the average time it takes to produce each item. For example, you might want to identify the items that take the longest to produce and schedule their production process.

Production supervisors use this report to monitor the production time for a particular item and the quantity produced on production orders. For example, you notice that the production time for a particular item is longer than expected. You can use the report to identify the cause of the delay and optimize the production process to increase efficiency.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The *Average Production Times* report includes the following KPIs and measures:

- [Average Production Time Per Finished Quantity](manufacturing-powerbi-kpis.md#average-production-time-per-finished-quantity)
- [Actual Time Used](manufacturing-powerbi-kpis.md#actual-time-used)
- [Finished Quantity](manufacturing-powerbi-kpis.md#finished-quantity)

[!INCLUDE[click-on-a-kpi-link](includes/click-on-a-kpi-link.md)]

[!INCLUDE[powerbi-tip-track-kpis](includes/powerbi-tip-track-kpis.md)]

## Data used in the report

The report uses data from the following tables in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]:

- Item
- Production Order
- Capacity Ledger Entry

# Design Details: Change the Costing Method for Items

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you cannot change a costing method for an item after you have included the item in a transaction. For example, after you have bought or sold the item. If an incorrect costing method was assigned to the item or items, you might not discover the issue until you do your financial reporting.

This topic describes how to resolve this situation. The recommended approach is to replace the item that has the incorrect costing method with a new item, and use an assembly order to transfer the inventory from the old item to the new.

> [!NOTE]
> Using assembly orders allows the costs to still flow although there are outstanding purchase invoices or shipping charges to post. Additionally, it allows you to undo the conversion and get the quantities of the original items back, if needed.

> [!TIP]
> To become familiar with the process, we recommend that you start the conversion process with a single item or a small set of items.

## About Costing Methods

Costing methods control cost calculations when goods are purchased, received in inventory, and sold. Costing methods affect the timing of amounts recorded in COGS that affect gross profit. It is this flow that calculates COGS. The cost of goods sold (COGS) and revenue are used to determine gross profit, as follows:

*gross profit* = *revenue - COGS*

When you set up inventory items, you must assign a costing method. The method can vary from business to business, and from item to item, so it's important to choose the right one. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports the following costing methods:

* Average
* FIFO
* LIFO
* Standard
* Specific

For more information, see [Design Details: Costing Methods](design-details-costing-methods.md).

## Use Assembly Orders to Change Costing Method Assignments

This section describes the following steps for changing the costing method assigned to an item:

1. Define a default costing method.
2. Identify the items that to change the costing method for and renumber them.
3. Create new items with the old numbering scheme and copy the master data in a batch.
4. Manually copy related master data from the existing item to the new item.
5. Determine the inventory quantity to convert from the original item to the new item.
6. Transfer the inventory to the new item.
7. Handle inventory quantities that are allocated to demand.
8. Block the original item from further use.  

### Define a default costing method

To help avoid future mistakes you can specify a default costing method for new items. Whenever someone creates a new item, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will suggest the default costing method. You specify the default method in the **Default Costing Method** field on the **Inventory Setup** page. 

### Identify the items to change the costing method for and renumber them

You may want to give your new items the same numbers as those they are replacing. To do that, change the numbers of the existing items. For example, if the existing item number is "P1000," you might change it to "X-P1000." This is a manual change that you must make for each item.

### Create new items with the old numbering scheme and copy the master data in a batch

Create the new items using the current number scheme. With the exception of the **Costing Method** field, the new items should contain the same master data as the existing items. To transfer the master data for the item, and related data from other features, use the **Copy Item** action on the **Item Card** page. For more information, see [Copy Existing Items to Create New Items](inventory-how-copy-items.md).

After you create the new items and transfer the master data, assign the correct costing method.

### Manually copy related master data from the original item to the new item

To make the new items fully useful you must manually copy some master data from other areas, as described in the following table.

|Area  |What to copy  |How to copy it  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|Inventory |Stock-keeping units (SKUs) |Check whether a SKU is specified for the original item. If planning parameters have been entered for each SKU card, then you must manually create the SKU for the new item. If the parameters are not specified, you can use the **Create Stockkeeping Unit** batch job from the **Item Card** page to create the data.|
| |Item substitutions |Check whether any item substitutions are defined for the original item. If there are, transfer that data to the new item. To view substitute items, use the **Substitutions** action on the **Item Card** page. |
| |Analysis reports |Review the Item Analysis, Sales Analysis, and Purchase Analysis reports. For those that reference the original items you can either create a new analysis report with a reference to the new item (keeping the original analysis report to use as history) or adjust the reports so that they reference the new item. |
| |Standard journals |Check whether standard journals reference the original item and transfer that data to the new item when necessary. This information is found on the standard journals, which are available on the item journal.  |
|Sales |Sales prepayment percentage | Check whether any sales prepayment percentages are defined for the original item and transfer that data to the new item. To view prepayment percentages, on the **Item Card** page, choose **Sales**, and then **Prepayment Percentages**.|
|Purchase |Purchase prepayment percentage |Check whether any purchase prepayment percentages are defined for the original item and transfer that data to the new item. To view prepayment percentages, on the **Item Card** page, choose **Purchases**, and then **Prepayment Percentages**. |
|Warehouse |Bin contents |Review the bin content defined for the original item. If columns such as Min. Qty., Max. Qty., Default, and Dedicated have been individually entered then you must manually create bin content for the new item. If they are not, no action is required. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will maintain the records when you register warehouse documents and journals.|
|Job |Job Prices |Check whether project prices are defined for the original item and transfer that data to the new item. This information is available on the **Project Card** page in the **Project Details – No. of Prices** part on the **FactBox pane**. |
|Service |Service resource skill |Check whether service resource skills are defined for the original item and transfer that data to the new item. To view resource skills, use the **Resource Skills** action on the **Item Card** page.  |
| |Service item components |Check whether components are defined for the original service item and transfer that data to the new item. To view service item components, on the **Item Card** page use the **Service Item** action to open the list of related service items, and then choose the **Components** action.  |
|Production |Production BOMs |Check whether any production BOMs contain the original item and replace it with the new item. To replace the original item, on the **Production BOMs** page, choose the **Exchange Production BOM Item** action. |
|Assembly |Assembly BOMs |Check whether any assembly BOMs contain the original item and manually replace it with the new item. |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If the new costing method is Standard you should enter a value in the **Standard Cost** field on the **Item Card** page. You can use the **Standard Cost Worksheet** page to set the cost shares accordingly. For more information, see [Update Standard Costs](finance-how-to-update-standard-costs.md).

### Determine the inventory quantity to convert from the original item to the new item

> [!NOTE]
> This step does not consider quantities that are included in unshipped orders. For more information, see [Handle inventory quantities that are allocated to demand](design-details-changing-costing-methods.md#handle-inventory-quantities-that-are-allocated-to-demand). 

Use a physical inventory journal to produce a list of the quantities in inventory. Depending on the warehouse location setup, use one of the following:

* Physical Invt. Journals
* Whse. Phys. Invt. Journals

Both journals can calculate the inventory quantity of the item, including the location, variant, bin, and storage location. For more information, see [Count, Adjust, and Reclassify Inventory Using Journals](inventory-how-count-adjust-reclassify.md).

### Transfer the inventory to the new item

Create and post assembly orders to transfer the cost and inventory quantity from the original item to the new item. Assembly orders can convert one item to another while preserving the costs. This helps ensure that the net totals for the inventory account and COGS are not affected (except when the new costing method is Standard, in which case costs may be distributed to variance accounts). For more information, see [Assembly Management](assembly-assemble-items.md).

When creating assembly orders, use the information from the Physical Invt. journal or Whse. Phys. Invt. journal. The following tables describe the information in the reports to enter in the header and lines on the assembly order.

#### Header

|Field  |Value to enter  |
|---------|---------|
|Item No. |The number of the new item. |
|Quantity |The quantity in physical inventory journal.<br> **NOTE:** The quantities calculated by the physical inventory journals does not include the quantities that are on orders that have not yet shipped.  |
|Variant Code |The same as in physical inventory journal.  |
|Location Code |The same as in physical inventory journal. |
|Unit of Measure Code |The same as in physical inventory journal. |
|Bin Code |The same as in physical inventory journal. |

#### Lines

|Field  |Value to enter  |
|---------|---------|
|Type |Item |
|No. |The number of the original item. |
|Quantity per |1 |
|Variant Code |The same as in physical inventory journal. |
|Location Code |The same as in physical inventory journal. |
|Unit of Measure Code |The same as in physical inventory journal. |

> [!NOTE]
> An assembly order can handle only one SKU of an item at a time. You must create an assembly order for each combination of SKU that has a quantity in inventory.

> [!NOTE]
> For a warehouse location, you might have to create picks before you can post the assembly order. To investigate that, review the setup for picking on the **Location Card** page. For more information, see [Set Up Items and Locations for Directed Put-away and Pick](warehouse-how-to-set-up-items-for-directed-put-away-and-pick.md).

### Handle inventory quantities that are allocated to demand

Ideally, the inventory for the original item should go to zero after you transfer the inventory quantities. However, there can be outstanding orders, worksheets, and journals (see the table below) that still require a quantity of the original item. The quantity could also be blocked by a reservation or item tracking.

**Example**
There are 1000 pcs. in inventory, and 20 pcs. are reserved for a sales order that has not yet shipped. In that case, you might decide to keep the 20 pcs. in the old item so that you can fulfill the outstanding order.

> [!NOTE]
> There are functional areas that can affect the quantity, as listed in the table below, so it can be tricky to find the correct amount. To be safe, using the example above, you can choose to keep 100 pcs. and transfer the remaining 900 pcs. instead. Another way to do it would be to process the documents and journals so that only a manageable few remain. Yet another alternative is to transfer the entire quantity to the new item and then transfer some of it back to the original item using the assembly order.

The following table lists functional areas where there might be outstanding quantities.

|Area  |Where to look for outstanding quantities  |
|---------|---------|
|Sales |Sales documents, including orders, return orders, invoices, quotes, blanket orders, and credit memos |
|Inventory |Item journals, reservations, item tracking, and standard cost worksheet |
|Purchase |Purchase documents, including orders, return orders, invoices, quotes, blanket orders, and credit memos |
|Planning |Requisition worksheet, planning worksheet, and order planning |
|Warehouse |Transfer orders, warehouse shipments, warehouse journals, and warehouse picks, put-aways, and movements, internal picks and put-aways, and bin creation worksheets |
|Assembly |Assembly documents, including orders, return orders, and blanket orders |
|Jobs |project planning lines and project journal lines |
|Service |Service documents and service contracts |
|Production |Production orders (planned, firm planned, and released) |

### Block the original item from further use

When the inventory for the original item is zero, you can block the item to prevent it fom being used in new transactions. To block the item, on the **Item Card** page, turn on the **Blocked** toggle. For more information, see [Block Items from Sales or Purchasing](inventory-how-block-items.md).

## Summary

Changing the costing method on items that have been used in transactions is a process, and not a standard action in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. You can use the steps described in this topic as a template for the process.

The process can be time consuming because there are several manual steps. However, taking the time to complete it will minimize the impact of mistakes on your general ledger.

We recommend the following:

1. Assess the feasibility of the process by taking one, or maybe a few, representative items through the entire process.
2. Consider contacting an experienced partner who can help you with the process.

# Set up bank accounts

Use bank accounts in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to keep track of your banking transactions. Accounts can be denominated in your local currency or a foreign currency. After you set up bank accounts, you can also print checks. Bank accounts also offer features for [payment reconciliation](receivables-apply-payments-auto-reconcile-bank-accounts.md), [bank reconciliation](bank-how-reconcile-bank-accounts-separately.md), and the import and export of bank files.

You can include bank accounts in transactions in general journal. Each bank account links to an account in the chart of accounts through the assigned bank account posting group. Using a bank account in a payment transaction automatically creates an entry in both the bank account and the connected general ledger (G/L) account.  

Bank accounts work differently depending on whether a currency code is specified:

- If a currency code isn't specified, all transactions in the bank account are in the local currency (LCY) for the current company. If you make a transaction for the account in another currency, the amounts post to the account in LCY based on the currency exchange rate. Any checks issued from this account must be in LCY. If the bank account is used in a journal, the journal line automatically uses the blank currency code.  
  
- If a currency code is specified, all transactions made to this account, and all checks issued from it, must use the same currency as the account.

You can save time on data entry by making a bank account the default account to use for the currency specified for the account. If you do, the account is assigned to sales and service documents that use the currency. To make the account the default for sales and service documents, on the **Bank Account Card** page, turn on the **Use as Default for Currency** toggle. If needed, you can choose a different account when you're working on a document.

A bank account is an integral part of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and plays a role in many other capabilities. The following illustration shows the most important relations:

![Illustration of bank account relations.](media/Set-Up-Bank-Accounts/Bank_Account_Relations.png)

Creating a bank account makes it available in all the places shown in the illustration, and are mirrored in the G/L account and on the **Company Information** page.

Bank accounts are often monitored daily to ensure new payments from customers are registered as quickly as possible. Registering payments quickly helps ensure a customer's actual status is reflected in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Keeping the status of customer payments current helps sales people, accountants, and other employees making unnecessary calls regarding overdue invoices or delays in shipments.  

![Illustration of bank payment.](media/Set-Up-Bank-Accounts/Bank-payment-flow.png)

Another task is to import vendor currency payments with the realized currency rates to make sure that the actual status of the vendors is up-to-date. Using the [payment reconciliation](receivables-apply-payments-auto-reconcile-bank-accounts.md) capability is the easiest way to do that. In the **Payment Reconciliation Journal**, you can import bank transactions directly from an online bank application and post them more or less automatically. The journal automatically identifies and posts the following transactions:  

- Direct debit payments from customers.  
- Customer payments of single invoices.  
- Lump-sum payments from customers.  
- Customer payments in foreign currencies.  
- Vendor payments.  
- Vendor payments in foreign currency.  
- Vendor payments and subscriptions that are recurring.  
- Bank charges and interests.  

Payment reconciliation provides significant time savings in posting incoming and outgoing payments. However, the transactions on the bank account in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] aren't considered 100% correct until you run a bank reconciliation.  

Bank reconciliation is how you make sure that the bank account in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] matches the external account at the bank.  

 ![Illustration of bank account reconciliation.](media/Set-Up-Bank-Accounts/BankReconciliation.png)

In the illustration, the left side represents the bank account in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], and the rightmost side represents transactions imported from the bank through the online bank application. The diagram in the middle shows the transactions from both sides that make up the bank reconciliation.

From the bank account in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], most transactions should be known to the physical bank. The few exceptions include the following cases:  

- Corrections posted in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  
- Checks issued that aren't cashed.
- Vendor payments not yet approved by the bank.  

From the physical account at the bank, transactions not identified in the payment reconciliation journal arrive all the time, such as the following transactions:  

- New vendor subscriptions  
- Customer payments without description
- Bank interest
- Bank charges
- Credit card charges not yet reported

The better you are at mapping information in the payment reconciliation journal, the more transactions are posted automatically and the easier periodic bank reconciliation becomes.

The following video shows the basic steps to set up a bank account in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## To set up bank accounts

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Bank Accounts**, then choose the related link.
2. On the **Bank Accounts** page, choose the **New** action.
3. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

    An example would be the **Bank Acc. Posting Group** field that connects the bank account to the underlying G/L account in the balance sheet. Learn more at [Set Up Posting Groups](finance-posting-groups.md).

> [!TIP]
> Some fields are hidden until you choose the **Show more** action, typically because they are rarely used. Others must be added through personalization. Learn more at [Personalize Your Workspace](ui-personalization-user.md).

You can create as many bank accounts as you need for your business. For each bank account, you must specify information that makes the bank account uniquely identifiable. This information includes the bank's geographical address; number series for different types of transactions, such as direct debit and credit transfers; the currency amounts are specified in; and information used for importing bank statements. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

-->

## To enter an opening balance

To fill in the **Balance** field with an opening balance, you must post a bank account ledger entry with the amount in question. You post the entry through a bank account reconciliation. Learn more at [Reconcile Bank Accounts](bank-how-reconcile-bank-accounts-separately.md).  
>
> Alternatively, you can implement the opening balance as part of general data creation in new companies using the **Migrate Business Data** assisted setup guide. Learn more at [Getting Ready for Doing Business](ui-get-ready-business.md).  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Don't post the opening balance directly to the general ledger. Entries in the G/L account that were posted directly to it typically prevent you from reconciling the bank account. With foreign currency bank accounts, direct posting results in differences that accumulate as you post more bank reconciliations. Usually, you post the opening bank balance directly to the bank account, and the amount ends up in the G/L account. Alternatively, later you can reverse it out of the G/L account you use to balance the opening general ledger balance. In either case, you must balance any direct posting to the G/L account before you start your first bank reconciliation&mdash;especially if the bank account is in a foreign currency.

## To set up your bank account for import or export of bank files

The fields related to the import and export of bank feeds and files are on the **Transfer** FastTab on the **Bank Account Card** page. Learn more at [Using the AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals Extension](ui-extensions-amc-banking.md) and [Set Up the Envestnet Yodlee Bank Feeds Service](bank-how-setup-bank-statement-service.md).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 2.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Bank Accounts**, then choose the related link.
2. Open the card for the bank account to export or import bank files for.
3. On the **Transfer** FastTab, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

> [!NOTE]  
> Different file export services and their formats require different setup values on the **Bank Account Card** page. You'll be informed of wrong or missing setup values when you export the file. Read the short descriptions of the fields carefully or refer to the related procedure topics. For example, exporting a payment file for North American electronic funds transfer (EFT) requires that both the **Last Remittance Advice No.** and the **Transit No.** fields be filled in. Learn more at [Export Payments to a Bank File](finance-make-payments-with-bank-data-conversion-service-or-sepa-credit-transfer.md#exporting-payments-to-a-bank-file).

The fields on the **Transit** FastTab on the bank account serve different purposes, depending on whether the payment is inbound or outbound.

The following illustration shows the route of inbound payments. The numbers in the description correspond with the numbers in the illustration.

:::row:::
    :::column:::

1. The transactions are exported from the bank account in either a human-readable .csv format or the bank's own format.
2. The data exchange definition maps the information in the file to the fields in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Learn more at [Set Up Data Exchange](across-set-up-data-exchange.md)
3. The data export/import setup defines the export or import, and links to the data exchange definition.
4. The bank statements import format links the import setup to the bank account.
5. The payments are imported through the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** or the **Bank Account Reconciliation** page.

  :::column-end:::
  :::column:::

        ![Illustration of payments received from the bank into bank accounts.](media/Set-Up-Bank-Accounts/payments-in-and-out-1.png)

  :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::

Incoming payments are always imported through the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** or directly into the **Bank Account Reconciliation** page. In contrast, outgoing payments can originate from any payment journal. The only prerequisite is that the **Allow Payment Export** field in the relevant payment journal batch must be selected.

The following illustration shows the route of outbound payments. The numbers in the description correspond with the numbers in the illustration.

:::row:::
    :::column:::

6. The transactions populate in a payment journal that was prepared for exporting payments to file.
7. The bank statements import format links the import setup to the bank account.
8. The data export/import setup defines the export or import, and links to the data exchange definition.
9. The data exchange definition maps the information in the file to the fields in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Learn more at [Set Up Data Exchange](across-set-up-data-exchange.md)
10. The payments are exported from the payment journal and imported into the bank account.

  :::column-end:::

## To set up vendor bank accounts for export of bank files

Fields on the **Transfer** FastTab on the **Vendor Bank Account Card** page are related to the export of bank feeds and files. Learn more at [Use the AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals extension](ui-extensions-amc-banking.md) and [Export Payments to a Bank File](finance-make-payments-with-bank-data-conversion-service-or-sepa-credit-transfer.md#exporting-payments-to-a-bank-file).

[!INCLUDE[purchase-vendor-bank-account](includes/purchase-vendor-bank-account.md)]

## Changing your bank account

To use a different bank account for your business, you must create the new bank account in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. We recommend that you don't just replace the information about the account you're currently using because that can cause incorrect data. For example, your opening balance might be incorrect or your bank feed might stop working correctly. It's important that you keep the current and new accounts separate.

After you create the new bank account, you should also create a new bank posting group and assign it to a new general ledger account. You can reuse an existing bank posting group, and bank transactions are posted to the same general ledger accounts as other bank accounts sharing that bank posting group. However, we recommend that you create a new bank posting group and general ledger account so that reconciliations are easier to do.

> [!NOTE]
> Remember that the bank account information on open sales invoices still shows the original bank account. Accordingly, payments are likely to still be posted to that account. We recommend that you keep both accounts active for a period of time after the change.

To get a more condensed view of your cash accounts in financial reporting, use the **Begin-Total** and **End-Total** accounts in your chart of accounts, the **Totaling** rows in financial reports, or G/L account categories. Learn more at [Business Intelligence and Financial Reporting](bi.md) section.

# The Envestnet Yodlee Bank Feeds Extension

To quickly reconcile payments made to your bank accounts, the Envestnet Yodlee Bank Feeds service allows you to link your system bank account to your online bank account. This means that the latest bank statement is automatically or manually fed into your reconciliation journal, ensuring that you are always processing the latest payments with minimal risk of errors.

The Envestnet Yodlee Bank Feeds service is only supported in the United States and Canada.

> [!NOTE]
> The Envestnet Yodlee Bank Feeds service is only supported in the online version of Business Central. To use this functionality on-premises, you must obtain a cobrand account from Envestnet Yodlee.<br /><br />
> The Envestnet Yodlee Bank Feeds service is only supported in the United States and Canada.
> Only banks residing in these countries/regions are supported, even though banks from other countries/regions may appear in the Envestnet Yodlee Bank Feeds bank selection window in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Due to the new Payment Services Directive in Europe (PSD2), after September 14, 2019, you will no longer be able to automatically import bank statements from banks in the United Kingdom into [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. We are looking into the possibility of offering this feature again in the future.

The Envestnet Yodlee Bank Feeds service provides the following benefits:

* Removes the need for manual entry.
* Improves efficiency and accuracy when doing payment reconciliation.
* Supports a large number of banks.
* Allows up-to-date information about bank transactions from within [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].
* Supports manual as well as automatic bank feeds.
* Enables outsourcing of payment reconciliation to an accountant by providing access to bank statements.

## Available bank feeds

You can check whether a bank is supported by setting up and connecting to the Envestnet Yodlee Bank Feeds service. The bank will appear on the list if it is supported by Envestnet Yodlee.

For more information, see [Set Up the Envestnet Yodlee Bank Feeds Service](bank-how-setup-bank-statement-service.md).

# Track Email Message Exchanges Between Salespeople and Contacts

[!INCLUDE[azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id](~/../shared-content/shared/azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id.md)]

Get more out of the communications between your salespeople and customers by turning email exchanges into actionable opportunities. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can work with Exchange Online to keep a log of the inbound and outbound messages. You can view and analyze the contents of each message on the **Interaction Log Entries** page.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and Exchange Online must be on the same tenant.

## To set up email logging

### Set up public folders and rules for email logging in Exchange Online

[!INCLUDE[admin-setup-email-public-folder](includes/admin-setup-email-public-folder.md)]

Next, you connect [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with Exchange Online.

### Set Up a shared mailbox and rules for email logging in Exchange Online

> [!NOTE]
> These steps require administrator access for Exchange Online.

Prepare a shared mailbox in the Exchange admin center. Alternatively, you can also use Exchange Online PowerShell. For more information, see [Create a shared mailbox](/microsoft-365/admin/email/create-a-shared-mailbox) or [Exchange Online PowerShell](/powershell/exchange/exchange-online-powershell?view=exchange-ps&preserve-view=true).

> [!NOTE]
> If you use Exchange Management PowerShell, your changes are available in the Exchange admin center after a delay. The delay might be several hours.

### Add a user account for members of the shared mailbox

The account that you use for email logging is an Exchange Online account. The scheduled job uses the account to connect to the shared mailbox and process emails. This account shouldn't be associated with a specific person. Add the email account to the members for the shared mailbox. For more information, see [Use the EAC to edit shared mailbox delegation](/exchange/collaboration-exo/shared-mailboxes#use-the-eac-to-edit-shared-mailbox-delegation).

### Allow other users to see logged emails

You can allow another user to open an email message in Exchange that is related to an interaction log entry from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. To do that, give the user ``Read`` permission to the **Archive** folder in the shared mailbox. For more information, see [Exchange Online PowerShell](/powershell/exchange/exchange-online-powershell?view=exchange-ps&preserve-view=true).

### Create mail flow rules

Mail flow rules look for specific conditions on messages and take action on them. Create two mail flow rules based on the information in the following table. For more information, see [Manage mail flow rules in Exchange Online](/exchange/security-and-compliance/mail-flow-rules/manage-mail-flow-rules?preserve-view=true) and [Mail flow rule actions in Exchange Online](/exchange/security-and-compliance/mail-flow-rules/mail-flow-rule-actions?preserve-view=true).

|Purpose  |Name  |Apply this rule if...  |Do the following...  |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|A rule for incoming email     |Log Email Sent to This Organization|The sender is located outside the organization, and the recipient is located inside the organization|BCC the email account that is specified for the shared mailbox.|
|A rule for outgoing email     |Log Email Sent from This Organization|The sender is located inside the organization, and the recipient is located outside the organization.|BCC the email account that is specified for the shared mailbox.|

> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] only processes messages in the Inbox folder in the shared mailbox. If a rule moves messages from the Inbox to another folder, those messages will not be processed. Additionally, messages in the Junk Mails folder are also ignored.

## Set Up [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to log email messages

Get started with email logging in two easy steps:

1. Connect [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with Exchange Online for your Microsoft 365 subscription. Exchange Online handles your email messages. We made this step easy by providing an assisted setup guide. You just need your administrator credentials for your administrator account in Microsoft 365. To start the guide, go to the **Assisted Setup** page, and then select the **Set up email logging** guide.  

2. Make sure that the email addresses for your sales people and contacts in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] are valid. To do that, for each customer or salesperson, open the **Contact** or **Salesperson/Purchaser** card and have a look in the **Email** field.

    > [!Tip]
    > After you complete the steps in the guide you can check whether the connection was successful. Search for **Email Logging**, choose **Actions**, and then choose **Validate Setup**.

## View email message exchanges in the Interaction Log

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates an entry on the **Interaction Log** page each time a salesperson and a contact exchange an email message. To view the interaction log, open the **Contact** card for the person, choose **Related**, then **History**, and then **Interaction Log Entries**. There are a few things you can do with each entry in the log, for example:

* View the content of the email message that was exchanged by selecting **Process** and then **Show Attachments**.
* Turn an email exchange into a sales opportunity. If an entry looks promising, you can turn it into an opportunity and then manage its progress toward a sale. To turn an email exchange into an opportunity, choose the entry, then **Process**, and then **Create Opportunity**. For more information, see [Managing Sales Opportunities](marketing-manage-sales-opportunities.md).

## Mailbox and folder limits in Exchange Online

There are mailbox and folder limits in Exchange Online, such as limits for folder sizes and the number of messages. For more information, see [Exchange Online limits](/office365/servicedescriptions/exchange-online-service-description/exchange-online-limits#storage-limits) and [Limits for public folders in Exchange Server](/Exchange/collaboration/public-folders/limits?view=exchserver-2019&preserve-view=true).

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] stores logged email messages in a folder in Exchange Online. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] also stores a link to each logged message. The links open the logged messages in Exchange Online from the Interaction Log Entries, Contact Card, and Salespersons Card pages in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. If a logged message is moved to another folder, the link is broken. For example, a message might be moved manually, or Exchange Online might automatically start AutoSplit when a storage limit is reached.

The following steps can help you avoid breaking links to messages in Exchange Online.

1. Don't move existing messages to another folder after you change settings for your email logging setup. Keeping existing messages put preserves the links. Links to messages in the new folder are valid.
2. Avoid reaching the mailbox and folder limits. If you're about to reach a limit, take the following steps:
    1. Set up a new shared mailbox in Exchange Online.
    2. Update your email flow rules in Exchange Online.
    3. Update your email logging setup in Business Central accordingly

## Connect on-premises versions to Microsoft Exchange

You can connect [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises to Exchange on-premises or Exchange Online for email logging. For both versions of Exchange, settings for the connection are available on the **Marketing Setup** page. For Exchange Online, you can also use an assisted setup guide.

<!-- [!IMPORTANT]
> The new experience doesn't support a connection to Exchange on-premises. If you must use Exchange on-premises, do not enable the feature update for the new experience.

## Connect to Exchange on-premises
<!--
## [Current Experience](#tab/current-experience)
To connect [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises to Exchange on-premises, on the **Marketing Setup** page, you can use **Basic** as the **Authentication Type**, and then enter credentials for the user account for Exchange on-premises. Then turn on the **Enabled** toggle to start logging email.

## [New Experience](#tab/new-experience)
The new experience does not support connections to Exchange on-premises.
-->
## Connect to Exchange Online

To connect to Exchange Online, you must register an application in Microsoft Entra ID. Provide the application ID, key vault secret, and the redirect URL to use for the registration. The redirect URL is preset and should work for most installations. For more information, see [To register an application in Microsoft Entra ID for connecting from Business Central to Exchange Online](#to-register-an-application-in-microsoft-entra-id-for-connecting-from-business-central-to-exchange-online). 

You must also use **OAuth2** as the **Authentication Type**. You must also register an application in Microsoft Entra ID. Provide the application ID, key vault secret, and the redirect URL to use for the registration. The redirect URL is prepopulated and should work for most installations. For more information, see [To register an application in Microsoft Entra ID for connecting from Business Central to Exchange Online](#to-register-an-application-in-microsoft-entra-id-for-connecting-from-business-central-to-exchange-online).

You must set up your installation to use HTTPS. For more information, see [Configuring SSL to Secure the Business Central Web Client Connection](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/deployment/configure-ssl-web-client-connection). If you're setting up your server to have a different home page, you can change the URL. The client secret is saved as an encrypted string in your database.

### To register an application in Microsoft Entra ID for connecting from Business Central to Exchange Online

The following steps assume that you use Microsoft Entra ID to manage identities and access. For more information, see [Quickstart: Register an application with the Microsoft identity platform](/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app). 

1. In the Azure portal, under **Manage**, choose **Authentication**.
2. Under **Redirect URL**, add the redirect URL that is suggested on the **Email Logging** page in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. If the redirect URL field on the Email Logging page is empty, find the suggested redirect URL on the **Assisted Setup** page. To open the page, on the **Email Logging** page, choose **Actions**, and then **Assisted Setup**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you do not specify the redirect URL, you can do so later by choosing **Add a platform**, and then choosing **Web** to add the web application and the redirect URL.

3. Under **Manage**, choose **API permissions**, and choose **Microsoft Graph**, and then choose **Delegated permissions**.
4. Use the search box to find and select **Mail**, and then add the **Mail.ReadWrite.Shared** permission.
5. Under **Manage**, choose **Certificates & Secrets**, and then create a new secret for your app. You use the secret either in the **Client Secret** field on the **Email Logging** page in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].
6. Choose **Overview**, and then find the **Application (client) ID** value. This value is the client ID of your application. You must enter it either in the **Client ID** field on the **Email Logging** page.
7. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], set up email logging on the **Email Logging** page, or use the **Assisted Setup** guide for assistance.

### Use Another Identity and Access Management Service

If you aren't using Microsoft Entra ID to manage identities and access, you need some help from a developer. If you prefer to store the app ID and secret in a different location, you can leave the Client ID and Client Secret fields blank and write an extension to fetch the ID and secret from the location. You can provide the secret at runtime by subscribing to the OnGetEmailLoggingClientId and OnGetEmailLoggingClientSecret events in codeunit 1641 "Setup Email Logging."

## To start logging email

1. To start logging email, on the **Email Logging** page, turn on the **Enabled** toggle.
2. Sign in with the Exchange Online account that the scheduled job uses to connect to the shared mailbox and process emails.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you are not prompted to sign in the the Exchange Online account, it might be because your browser is blocking pop-ups. To sign in, allow pop-ups from https://login.microsoftonline.com.

## To stop logging email

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Email Logging**, and then choose the related link.
2. Turn off the **Enabled** toggle.

## To change the user account used for email logging

### [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Online

1. Sign in to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with the account that the scheduled job uses to connect to the shared mailbox and process emails. This account must have access to both [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and Exchange Online.
2. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Email Logging**, and then choose the related link. 
3. Choose **Related**, and then **Job Queue Entry**.
4. Restart the **Email Logging** job.

### [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Email Logging**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose **Actions**, and then **Renew Token**.
3. Sign in with the Exchange Online account that the scheduled job uses to connect to the shared mailbox and process emails.

# Setting up user accounts for integrating with Microsoft Dataverse via data sync

This article provides an overview of how to set up the user accounts that are required to integrate [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## Set up the administrator user account

To set up the connection between [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)], you must sign in to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with a user account that is assigned to the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Essential or [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Premium license. We'll use this account one time to install and configure some required components.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> During set-up, you'll be asked to provide credentials for the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] environment. Provide the credentials of an account that is a licensed user and assigned to the **System Administrator** security role on the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] environment and [User Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#user-administrator) role on the tenant to which the environment belongs. This account doesn't need a license to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] because it will be used only to do set-up tasks in the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] environment.
>
> After the connection setup is done, you can remove this [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] user. The integration will continue using the user account that is automatically created specifically for the integration.

## Permissions and security roles for user accounts in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)]

The Base Integration Solution creates the following role in [!INCLUDE [cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] for the integration:

* **Business Central Dataverse Integration** - Allows you to manage the connection between [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and [!INCLUDE [cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)]. Typically, this is assigned only to the automatically created user account for synchronization.

> [!NOTE]
> Only the application user who runs the integration should have the **Business Central Dataverse Integration** role. The application user doesn't need the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] or [!INCLUDE [cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] licenses.

When you install the Base Integration Solution, it configures the permissions for the integration user account. If those permissions are changed manually, you can reset them. Choose **Redeploy Integration Solution** on the **Dataverse Connection Setup** page to reinstall the Base Integration Solution. This step will deploy the  Business Central Integration security role.

<!--
The following tables list the minimum permissions for the user accounts in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)].

# Production Scrap (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Production Scrap** report presents important key performance indicators (KPIs) such as **Scrap %** and **Scrap Quantity by Work Center**, **Machine Center**, **Source No.**, and **Production Order**.

The **Production Order Scrap %** KPI card highlights the relationship between **Finished Quantity** and **Scrap Quantity** to help clarify the drivers behind the production order scrap percent.

The **Scrap Quantity Over Time** chart shows how scrap quantity changes over time. This chart allows you to identify trends in production scrap as processes change.

Work center and machine center statistics display in the KPI Bar. **Work Center Scrap %** and **Machine Center Scrap %** are derived from the **Work Center Scrap** and **Work Center Output** respectively. These figures help you understand the efficiency of your production facilities at a glance.

The **Scrap % by Production Order** chart gives you an easy way to compare scrap rates across different productions orders. Cross filter this report by the **Scrap Quantity vs. Expected Scrap Quantity by Source No.** chart to identify which production orders contribute to the scrap rate.

The **Scrap Quantity by Scrap Code** visual allows you to quickly compare and analyze why scrap occurred.

Used together, these visuals help uncover where and why waste is happening, so you can take steps to reduce it.

## Use the report

The report is meant for business leaders and manufacturing managers.

COOs use the report to measure the effectiveness of manufacturing processes and resources. By analyzing the capacity scrap quantity, you can identify areas that need improvement and optimize resource use. For example, a high scrap rate at a particular location might indicate a problem with the machinery or the materials it uses. By addressing these issues, you can reduce waste and improve efficiency, leading to cost savings.

For manufacturing managers, this report reveals important measures about capacity scrap quantity. By analyzing the scrap rate, you can identify areas that need improvement, such as processes or materials.

# Adding Contacts to Segments
After you have created a segment and entered basic information about it, you may want to add contacts to the segment. You can do this by filling in the lines on the **Segment** page manually, but it is easier and faster to use the **Add Contacts** action.

## To add a contact to a segment
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Segments**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the segment, and then choose the **Add Contacts** action. The **Add Contacts** batch job page opens.
3. In the **Contact** section, set filters to specify the information by which you want to select contacts.

To enter additional filters, repeat this procedure on each of the remaining sections, and then choose the **OK** button.

If you have added contacts by mistake and want to go back one step, then choose the **Go Back** action.

## To refine the number of contacts
After you have selected the contacts within a segment, you may decide to remove some but keep others. You can manually remove contacts from the lines on the **Segment** page, but it is easier and faster to use the **Refine Contacts** action.

1. Open the segment.
2. Choose **Contacts**, and then choose the **Refine Contacts** action. The **Remove Contacts - Refine** page opens.
3. In the **Contact** section, enter filters to specify the information that you want to use to select the contacts to be removed from the segment.
4. Add additional filters as needed, and then choose the **OK** button.

You can refine a segment as many times as you want. If you have refined the segment by mistake and want to go one step back, choose the **Go Back**.

To see a list of the segment criteria that you have used, in the **General** section, choose the **No. of Criteria Actions** field.

## To reduce the number of contacts
After you have selected the contacts within a segment, you may want to remove some of them. You can do this by manually removing them from the lines in the Segment page, but it is easier and faster to use the Reduce Contacts function to specify which contacts to remove, and to use the Refine Contacts function to specify which contacts to keep.

1. Open the segment.
2. Choose Contacts, and then choose the **Reduce Contacts** action. The **Remove Contacts - Reduce** page opens.
3. In the **Contact** section, enter filters to specify the information that you want to use to select the contacts to be removed from the segment.
4. Add additional filters as needed, and then choose the **OK** button.

You can reduce a segment as many times as you want. If you have refined the segment by mistake and want to go one step back, then choose the **Go Back** action.

# Period-Over-Period Growth (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Period-Over-Period Growth** report provides valuable insights into your organization's sales performance over time. The report compares sales amounts for different time periods to the same period in the previous year, providing insight into growth trends and areas for improvement.

For example, if the analysis scope is fiscal months, the report compares the sales amount in September 2023 to the sales amount in September 2022. If the analysis scope is fiscal years, the report compares the sales amount in fiscal year 2023 to the sale amount in fiscal year 2022.

## Use the report

The report is meant for business leaders and managers.

CEOs are responsible for making strategic decisions that drive growth for organizations. The report provides valuable insights into your organization's sales performance over time. By comparing sales amounts for different time periods to the same period in the previous year, this report helps you identify growth trends and areas for improvement.

For example, you might notice that sales consistently declined in a particular region or product category. You can use this information to make decisions about investments or changes to your sales strategy. Changes might include increasing your marketing efforts in that region, or improving your product offerings to be more competitive.

For sales managers who oversee daily sales activities, the report can help you identify areas where the sales team is excelling, and areas where they need more support. By analyzing the growth amount and growth percentage, you can evaluate your team's performance over the current fiscal year compared to the previous fiscal year. This information can help you adjust sales strategies, coach team members, and improve overall sales performance.

## Key performance indicators

The report includes the following key performance indicators (KPIs) and measures:

- [**Sales Amount**](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#sales-amount)
- [**Previous Period**](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#sales-amount-pp-fiscal)
- [**Period-over-Period Growth Amount**](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#sales-amount-pop-fiscal)
- [**Period-over-Period Growth %**](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#sales-amount-pop--fiscal)

[!INCLUDE[click-on-a-kpi-link](includes/click-on-a-kpi-link.md)] 

[!INCLUDE[powerbi-tip-track-kpis](includes/powerbi-tip-track-kpis.md)]

## Data used in the report

The report uses data from the following tables in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]:

- Value Entry
- Sales Line

# Working with Microsoft Excel layouts

Microsoft Excel report layouts are based on Excel workbooks (.xlsx files). With them, you can create reports that include familiar Excel features for summarizing, analyzing, and presenting data such as formulas, PivotTables, and PivotCharts.

![Example of an Excel layout.](media/excel-layout-2.png)

This article explains important information you need to know to get started with Excel layouts.

## Why use Excel layouts?

Benefits of using Excel layouts:

- You can create your own report layouts with Excel, either from scratch or based on an existing layout.
- You can include multiple worksheets, interactive elements, visualizations, pivot tables, and slicers.
- You can view raw data from the report dataset to help understand how the report works and where the data in visuals comes from.
- You can use built-in Microsoft Office features for post-processing on rendered reports, including:
  - [Protecting worksheets](https://support.microsoft.com/office/protect-a-worksheet-3179efdb-1285-4d49-a9c3-f4ca36276de6)
  - [Applying sensitivity labels](https://support.microsoft.com/office/apply-sensitivity-labels-to-your-files-and-email-in-office-2f96e7cd-d5a4-403b-8bd7-4cc636bae0f9)
  - [Adding comments and notes](https://support.microsoft.com/office/insert-comments-and-notes-in-excel-65f504d8-160b-4a05-ac30-46fbd5227a52)
  - [Forecasting and analysis](https://support.microsoft.com/office/introduction-to-what-if-analysis-22bffa5f-e891-4acc-bf7a-e4645c446fb4)
- You can use installed add-ins and app integrations, such as Power Automate flows and OneDrive.

> [!TIP]
> With OneDrive integration set up, when you run a report with an Excel layout, the Excel workbook file is copied to OneDrive and then opened in Excel online. For more information, go to [Save Excel workbooks and report files in OneDrive](./across-onedrive-overview.md#save-excel-workbooks-and-report-files-in-onedrive)

## Get started

There are two tasks involved in setting up an Excel layout for a report:

1. Create the new Excel layout file.
2. Add the new layout to the report.

## Task 1: Create the Excel layout file

There are several ways to create an Excel layout for your report:

* From any report.
* From an existing Excel report layout.
* From Visual Studio Code.

### [From any report](#tab/any-report)

Follow these steps to create an Excel layout from any report, regardless of the current layout type. The Excel layout contains the required **Data** sheet and table, and a **Report Metadata** sheet.

1. [!INCLUDE[open-report-layouts-page](includes/open-report-layouts-page.md)]
2. On the **Report Layouts** page, choose any layout for the report, then choose the **Run Report** action.
3. On the report's request page, choose **Send to**, then **Microsoft Excel Document (data only)**, and then **OK**.

   This step downloads an Excel workbook that contains the report dataset.
4. Open the downloaded file in Excel, make your changes, and then save the file.

### [From an existing Excel report layout](#tab/other-layout)

If there's already an Excel layout for a report, you can use the existing layout as a starting point. There are two approaches to getting a copy of the layout. You can either export the existing layout from the **Report Layouts** page or download the layout from the report's request page. Both ways download an Excel layout file that includes all the sheets of the existing file. The difference is when you download it from the request page, the layout includes actual data. The data isn't required, but it helps when you design the layout.

**Approach 1: Export the layout from the Report Layouts page**

1. [!INCLUDE[open-report-layouts-page](includes/open-report-layouts-page.md)]
2. Select the Excel layout from the list, and then choose the **Export Layout** action.
3. Open the file in Excel, make your changes, and then save the file.

**Approach 2: Download the layout from the report's request page**

1. [!INCLUDE[open-report-layouts-page](includes/open-report-layouts-page.md)]
2. On the **Report Layouts** page, choose any layout for the report, and then choose the **Run Report** action.
3. On the report's request page, choose **Download**.
4. Open the file in Excel, make your changes, and then save the file.

### [From Visual Studio Code](#tab/from-code)

Using Visual Studio Code is the most advanced way to create an Excel report layout. It requires knowledge of AL code and is intended for programmers. In this approach, the Excel layouts are part of an extension package you install. Learn more at [Creating an Excel layout report](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-howto-excel-report-layout) in the Developer and IT Pro help.

---

## Task 2: Add the Excel layout to the report

When you have the Excel layout file, the next task is to add it as a new layout for the report.

1. [!INCLUDE[open-report-layouts-page](includes/open-report-layouts-page.md)]
2. Choose **New Layout**.
3. Set **Report ID** to **Report**.
4. In the **Layout Name** field, enter a name.
5. In the **Format Options** field, choose **Excel**.
6. Select **OK**, and then do one of the following steps to upload the layout file for the report:

   [!INCLUDE[file-upload](includes/file-upload.md)]

   The selected file is uploaded to the layout, and the **Report Layouts** page opens.
8. To review the report in the new layout, choose the layout from the list, and then select **Run Report**.

<!--

**Data** sheet
  - An Excel layout must contain a sheet named **Data**.
  - The **Data** sheet must include a table named **Data**.

**Data** table
  - The **Data** sheet must include a table named **Data**.
  - The table must have at least one column and can only include columns that are also in the report dataset.
  - The table must start in the first cell **A1** of the **Data** sheet.

3. Report metadata 
-->

## Understanding Excel layouts

There are a few things you need to know or consider when you create or change Excel layouts. Every Excel layout must have a **Data** sheet and a **Data** table. These elements define the business data that you can work with from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The **Data** sheet links the layout to the business data, which is the basis for the calculations and visualizations that you present on other sheets.

For the layout to work, there are some requirements to the structure of the Excel workbook that must be met. The following diagram and table outline the elements of an Excel layout and the requirements.

[![The different elements of an Excel layout.](media/excel-layout-callouts-2.png)](media/excel-layout-callouts-2.png#lightbox)

|No.|Element|Description|Mandatory|
|---|-------|----|---|
|1|**Data** sheet|<ul><li>Must have the name **Data**.</li><li>Can only include one table, which must be named **Data**.</li></ul>|![Is mandatory](media/check.png) | 
|2|**Data** table|<ul><li>Must have the name **Data**.</li><li>Must have at least one column.</li><li>Can only include columns that are in the report dataset.</li><li>Must start in the first cell **A1** of the **Data** sheet.</li></ul>|![Is mandatory](media/check.png)|
|3|Presentation sheets|<ul><li>Used to present data.</li><li>Data comes from the **Data** sheet. </li></ul>||
|4|**Report Metadata** sheet|<ul><li>Automatically included if the layout was created by exporting another Excel report.</li><li>Contains general information about the report.</li><li>Can be deleted.</li></ul>|

In summary when working with the **Data** sheet:

- You can delete or hide columns.
- You can place the sheets in any order, with the **Data** sheet first or last.
- You shouldn't rename the **Data** sheet, **Data** table, or any of the columns.
- You shouldn't add columns unless they already exist in the report dataset.

# Analyze list page and query data using data analysis feature

> **APPLIES TO:** Public preview in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] 2023 release wave 1 for analyzing list pages. Generally available in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] 2023 release wave 2 for analyzing data from list pages and queries.

This article explains how to use the data analysis feature from list pages and queries. The data analysis lets you analyze data directly from the page, without having to run a report or open another application, such as Excel. The feature provides an interactive and versatile way to calculate, summarize, and examine data. Instead of running reports using different options and filters, you can add multiple tabs that represent different tasks or views on the data. Some examples are: "My customers," "Follow up items," "Recently added vendors," "Sales statistics," or any other view you can imagine.

> [!TIP]
> A good thing about the data analysis feature is that it doesn't change the underlying data of a list page or query. It also doesn't change the layout of the page or query when it isn't in analysis mode. So the best way to learn about what you can do in analysis mode is to try things out.

## Prerequisites

- If you're using [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] version 22, the data analysis feature is in preview. So, an admin must enable it before you can use it. To enable it, go to the **Feature Management** page and switch on **Feature Update: Analysis mode, quickly analyze data directly in Business Central**. [Learn more about Feature Management](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/feature-management).
- In version 23 and later, your account must be assigned the **DATA ANALYSIS - EXEC** permission set or include execute permission on the system object **9640 Allow Data Analysis mode**. As an admin, you can exclude these permissions for users who you don't want to access the analysis mode.

> [!NOTE]
> Some list pages don't offer the **Enter analysis mode** toggle for turning on analysis mode. The reason is that developers can disable analysis mode on specific pages by using the [AnalysisModeEnabled property](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/properties/devenv-analysismodeenabled-property) in AL.

## Get started

Follow these steps to start using the analysis mode.

> [!TIP]
> Analysis mode also includes a Copilot feature called *analysis assist* that can help you get started. [Learn more about analysis assist with Copilot.](analysis-assist.md)

1. Open the list page or query.

   For example, to work with the **Customer Ledger Entries** page, select the ![Magnifying glass that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png) icon (<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Q</kbd>), enter *customer ledger entries*, and then choose the related link. 

1. In the action bar at the top of the page, select the **Enter analysis mode** ![Shows the button for turning on analysis mode](media/analysis-mode-icon.png) button.

    The analysis mode opens the data in an experience that's optimized for data analysis. While in analysis mode, the normal action bar is replaced with a special analysis mode bar. The following figure illustrates the different areas of a page in the analysis mode.

   [![Shows an overview of a page in the analysis mode](media/analysis-mode-overview-3.png)](media/analysis-mode-overview-3.png#lightbox)

   Each area is explained in the sections that follow.

1. Use the different areas to manipulate, summarize, and analyze data. See the sections that follow for details.

1. When you want to stop the analysis mode, select the **Leave analysis mode** ![Shows the button for turning off analysis mode](media/analysis-mode-exit-icon.png) button.

   The analysis tabs that you added remain until you delete them. If you return to the analysis mode again, you see them exactly as you left them.

> [!NOTE]
> The data shown in analysis mode is controlled by the filters or views set on the list page. This allows you to pre-filter data before entering analysis mode.

## Work with analysis mode

In the analysis mode, the page is divided into two areas:

- The main area, which consists of the data area (1), summary bar (2), and tabs bar (5).
- The data manipulation area, which consists of two panes: columns (3) and analysis filters (4).

### Data area (1)

The data area is where the rows and columns of the list page query are shown and data is summarized. The data area provides a versatile way to control the layout of columns and a quick way to get a summary of the data. For columns that contain numeric values, the sum of all values in the column is shown in the last row, unless you define row groups. In this case, the sums appear as a subtotal for the groups.  

:::image type="content" source="media/analysis-mode-data-area.png" alt-text="Shows an overview of a data area on a page in the analysis mode" lightbox="media/analysis-mode-data-area.png":::

- To move a column, select it and drag it to where it makes the most sense in your analysis.
- To sort on a column, select the column header. To sort on multiple columns, select and hold the <kbd>Shift</kbd> key while selecting the column headers you want to sort on.
- To access several actions that you can do on columns, right-click the column or hover over it and select the menu icon ![Shows the icon on a column in analysis mode that opens a menu of actions](media/analysis-mode-column-menu-icon.png). For example:

  - To pin a column to the data area so that it doesn't move off the screen when you scroll, select ![Shows the icon on a column in analysis mode that opens a menu of actions](media/analysis-mode-column-menu-icon.png) > **Pin column** > **Pin left** the column part.
  - Define data filters directly on the column definition instead of going to the **Analysis Filters** panes. You can still peek in on details about related data and for each line, and open the card to learn more about a given entity.   
- Use the data area to interact with the data. For columns that contain numeric, summable values, you can get descriptive statistics on a set of fields by marking them. The statistics appear in the status bar (2) along the bottom of the page.

Note that in the data area, you can filter on all columns, including totals such as sum or count. 

:::image type="content" source="media/analysis-mode-filter-on-totals.png" alt-text="Screenshot of how to filter on totals in analysis mode" lightbox="media/analysis-mode-filter-on-totals.png":::

### Summary bar (2)

The summary bar is along the bottom of the page and displays statistics about the data in the list page or query. As you interact with columns whose values can be summed, like selecting multiple rows in a column that displays amounts, the data updates.

:::image type="content" source="media/analysis-mode-totals-row.png" alt-text="Shows an overview of a summary bar on the analysis mode" lightbox="media/analysis-mode-totals-row.png":::

The following table describes the different numbers that are shown in the totals area:

|Number|Description|
|-|-|
|Rows|The number of selected rows as a part of the total number of available rows. |
|Total rows|The number of rows in the unfiltered list or query.|
|Filtered|The number of rows displayed as a result of the filters applied to the list or query.|
|Average|The average value in all the selected summable fields.|
|Count|The number of selected rows.|
|Min|The minimum value in all the selected summable fields.|
|Max|The maximum value in all the selected summable fields.|
|Sum|The sum total of all the values in the selected summable fields.|

### Columns (3)

The **Columns** pane is one of two panes that work together to define your analysis. The other area is the **Analysis filters** pane. The **Columns** pane is used to summarize the data. Use the **Columns** pane to define which columns should be included in the analysis.

:::image type="content" source="media/analysis-mode-columns-3.png" alt-text="Shows an overview of the columns pane in the analysis mode" lightbox="media/analysis-mode-columns-3.png":::

|Areas|Description|
|-|-|
|Search/check or clear all boxes|Search for columns. To select/clear all columns, select the checkbox.|
|Check boxes|This area includes a checkbox for each field in the list's or query's source table. Use this area to change what columns are shown. Select a checkbox to show a column for the field on the page; clear the checkbox to hide the column. |
|Row groups|Use this area to group and sum data by one or more fields. You can only include non-numeric fields, like text, date, and time fields. Row groups are used often in pivot mode.|
|Values|Use this area to specify fields that you want a sum total for. You can only include fields that contain numbers that can be added together; for example, not text, date, or time fields.|

To move a field from one area to another, select the grab icon ![Shows the button for grabbing a field in the analysis mode](media/column-grab-icon.png) next to the column in the list and drag it into the target area. You're prevented from moving a field to an area where it isn't allowed.

> [!NOTE]
> If you use personalization to add or remove fields from a list page, your choice of visibility is reflected in the **Columns** pane. An added field has the **Show** checkbox cleared. To include the added field in an analysis definition, select the checkbox in the **Columns** pane. To learn more about personalization, go to [Add/remove fields and columns on a page](ui-personalization-user.md#fields).

#### Add fields from related tables

> [!NOTE]
> Adding fields from related tables is available from version 26.2 and to use it, you must have the **Add Related Fields** permission set. 
>
> The feature is enabled with the feature key `Add fields from related tables in analysis mode`. Learn more in [Add fields from related tables in analysis mode feature key](analysis-mode-feature-key.md).

Starting with [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] version 26.2, analysis mode allows you to add fields from related tables to your analysis view. For example, if you're analyzing the **Customer** page, you can add fields from the **Location** table. You can then group data by these related fields, enabling a more comprehensive and advanced data analysis.

To add fields from related tables, you select the **Add columns from** option from the **Analysis** context menu. Now, you see the tables related to the current page's source table as suggestions. When you choose the related table, an **Insert column(s) from** dialog opens with all the fields that are available in that table. You can also use the **Choose a source page** dropdown to navigate through and find fields that you'd like to see in your analysis view. When you have chosen the field or fields to add, these are added to the **Columns** pane and to the data area. Use the **Remove related columns** option to remove the related fields from the analysis tab. 

:::image type="content" source="media/analysis-view-add-columns.png" alt-text="Add columns from option":::

If you want to see all table suggestions, choose **Other source...** from the **Add columns from** menu. This opens an **Insert column(s)** dialog, where you pick the source and related table, the source page they are available on, and then the field or fields to show on your analysis view.

:::image type="content" source="media/analysis-view-other-source.png" alt-text="Add columns from another source":::

##### Things to check

If you don't find the table or field that you're looking for, there are a few things to check:

- The table must be related to the source table of the page you're analyzing. 
- You must have permission to access the table or field. If you don't have permission, the field won't be available in the list of fields to add.
- The field must be a field that can be added to the analysis. For example, you can't add fields that are internal or not allowed in customizations.
- The table or field must have a page associated with it. If the table or field doesn't have a page, you won't be able to add it to the analysis.
- Certain types of fields, such as Media fields, aren't supported in analysis mode.
- When you add related fields, all calculated fields are lost. 


### Analysis filters (4)

The **Analysis filters** pane lets you set further data filters on columns to limit the entries in the list. Set filters on columns to limit the entries in the list and subsequent sums to only those entries you're interested in based on a criteria you define. For example, suppose you're only interested in data for a specific customer or sales orders that exceed a specific amount. To set a filter, select the column, choose the comparison operation from the list (like **Equals** or **Starts with**), and then enter the value.

:::image type="content" source="media/analysis-mode-filters-2.png" alt-text="Shows an overview of the filters pane in the analysis mode" lightbox="media/analysis-mode-filters-2.png":::

> [!NOTE]
> The additional filters only apply to the current analysis tab. This allows you to define exactly the extra data filters that are needed for a specific analysis.

### Tabs (5)

The tabs area at the top lets you create different configurations (columns and analysis filters) on separate tabs, where you can manipulate data on the tabs independently of each other. There's always at least one tab, called **Analysis 1** by default. Adding more tabs is beneficial for saving frequently used analysis configurations on a dataset. For example, you might have tabs for analyzing data in the pivot mode, and other tabs that filter to a subset of rows. Some tabs might show a detailed view with many columns, and others only display a few key columns.

Here are some pointers on working with multiple analysis tabs:

- To add a new tab, select the large **+** sign next to the last analysis tab.
- Select the down arrow on a tab to access a list of actions you can do on a tab, like rename, duplicate, delete, and move.

   - **Delete** deletes the tab you currently have open. **Delete All** deletes all tabs that you added, except the default **Analysis 1** tab.
- You can't completely remove the **Analysis 1**, but you can rename it by using the **Rename** action and clear the changes you made by using **Delete** or **Delete All**.  

- The analysis tabs that you add and configure remain until you delete them. If you return to the analysis mode, they're exactly as you left them.

   > [!TIP]
   > The tabs that you set up are only visible to you. Other users will only see tabs they've set up.
- You can copy analysis tabs. Copying can be useful, for example, for experimenting with changing a tab without changing the original. Copying is also useful if you want to create different variations of the same analysis.

## Date hierarchies

In analysis mode, date fields of the dataset are generated in a Year-Quarter-Month hierarchy of three separate fields. This hierarchy is based on the normal calendar, not any fiscal calendars defined in Business Central.

The extra fields are named *\<field name\> Year*, *\<field name\> Quarter*, and *\<field name\> Month*. For example, if the dataset includes a field called *Posting Date*, then the corresponding date hierarchy consists of fields called *Posting Date Year*, *Posting Date Quarter*, and *Posting Date Month*.

> [!NOTE]
> The date hierarchy currently only applies to fields of type date, not for fields of type datetime.

## Pivot mode

You can use pivot mode to analyze large amounts of numerical data, subtotaling data by categories and subcategories. The pivot mode is like [pivot tables in Microsoft Excel](https://support.microsoft.com/office/create-a-pivottable-to-analyze-worksheet-data-a9a84538-bfe9-40a9-a8e9-f99134456576).

To turn pivot mode on and off, turn on the **Pivot Mode** toggle on the **Columns** pane (3). When you turn on pivot mode, the **Column labels** area appears in the pane. Use the **Column labels** area to group sum totals for rows into categories. Fields that you add to the **Column labels** area show as columns in the data area (1).

Building out the data analysis in pivot mode involves moving fields into the three areas: **Row groups**, **Columns labels**, and **Values**. The following figure illustrates where the fields map to the data area (1), where `sum` is the calculated data, and optionally **Values**.

## Analyze large amounts of data

If the dataset you want to analyze exceeds 100,000 rows, we suggest you enter an analysis mode that's optimized for large datasets. There are currently two limitations if you switch to this mode: 

- Formatting of fields of the following four data types might change: 

   - currency 
   - decimals (always shown with two decimals) 
   - dates (always shown in the format YYYY-MM-DD)
   - timezones
- Fields that are used in pivot mode and added to column labels must have a low number of distinct values.

   If you enable pivot mode and drag a field into the **Column labels** area, where the underlying data for that field has too many distinct values, your browser tab might become unresponsive. The browser eventually closes, requiring you to start over in a new session. In this case, either don't pivot on that field or set a filter on the field before you add it to the **Column labels** area.

## Share data analysis

After you prepare an analysis on a tab, you can share it as a link with coworkers and others in your organization directly from the client. Only recipients who have permission to the company and the data can use the link.

1. On the analysis tab, select the down arrow, and then select **Copy link**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/analysis-mode-copy.png" alt-text="Shows the action for copying an analysis" lightbox="media/analysis-mode-copy.png":::

   The **Link to \<tab name\>** dialog opens.

1. By default, the analysis you share links to the page or query in the company you're currently working in, which is indicated by `company=<company_name>` in the URL field next to the **Copy** button. If you want to send a link to an analysis that isn't associated with a specific company, set the **Company:** field to **Do not link to a specific company**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/analysis-link-copied.svg" alt-text="Shows the copy link dialog for an analysis tab" lightbox="media/analysis-link-copied.svg":::

1. Select **Copy**.
1. Paste the link into the communication media of your choice, like Word, Outlook, Teams, or OneNote.
1. Recipients can select the link and open the analysis for the page or query in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. They're prompted to specify a name for the new analysis tab that they create.  

## Examples of how to analyze data

Use the **Data Analysis** feature for quick fact checking and ad hoc analysis:

- If you don't want to run a report.
- If a report for your specific need doesn't exist.
- If you want to quickly iterate to get a good overview on a part of your business.

The following sections provide examples of scenarios for many of the functional areas in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

### Example: Finance (Accounts Receivables)

To see what your customers owe you, maybe broken down into time intervals for when amounts are due, follow these steps:

1. Open the [Customer Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=25) list, and choose :::image type="content" source="media/analysis-mode-icon.png" alt-text="Enter analysis mode."::: to turn on analysis mode.
1. Go to the **Columns** menu and remove all columns (select the box next to the *Search* field on the right).
1. Turn on the **Pivot Mode** toggle (located above the **Search** field on the right).
1. Drag the **Customer Name** field to the **Row Groups** area, and drag **Remaining Amount** to the **Values** area.
1. Drag the **Due Date Month** field to the **Column Labels** area.
1. Use the **Analysis Filters** menu (located below the **Columns** menu on the right) to apply a filter and analyze data for a given year or quarter.
1. Rename your analysis tab to **Aged Accounts by Month**, or something that describes this analysis.

### Ad hoc data analysis examples by functional area

Many of the functional areas in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] have articles with ad hoc data analysis examples.

[!INCLUDE[ad-hoc-analysis-scenarios-table](includes/ad-hoc-analysis-scenarios-table.md)]

## Limitations in 2023 release wave 1 (preview)

The public preview of this feature has the following limitations:

- The analysis mode view has a limit of 100,000 rows. If you exceed this, you get a message telling you so. To work around this limitation, set filters on the page before you switch to analysis mode, if possible. For example, you want to analyze a certain group of customers or only want data from the current year. You can also choose a predefined view if it would work for your analysis.
- The share data analysis feature isn't available.
- The ability to save preferred data analysis choices on list pages and save analysis menus per analysis tab are currently not available.

# Depreciate or amortize fixed assets

Depreciation is used to allocate the cost of fixed assets, such as machinery and equipment, over their depreciable life. For each fixed asset, you must define how to depreciate it.  

 There are two ways to post depreciation:  

* Automatically, by running the **Calculate Depreciation** batch job.  
* Manually, by using the fixed asset G/L journal.  

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can calculate daily depreciation, which allows you to calculate depreciation for any period. You can therefore analyze current operating results on, for example, a monthly, quarterly, or annual basis. The calculation uses a standard year of 360 days and a standard month of 30 days. For more information, see [Depreciation Methods](fa-depreciation-methods.md).  

If several departments use a fixed asset, periodic depreciation can be automatically allocated to these departments according to a user-defined allocation table.  

You can cancel incorrect depreciation entries by using the **Cancel FA Ledger Entries** batch job. Afterward, you can post the correct amount by running the **Calculate Depreciation** batch job again. The errors you correct are posted as fixed asset error ledger entries.  

Indexation is used to adjust values for general price-level changes. You can use the **Index Fixed Assets** batch job to recalculate the depreciation amounts.  

## To calculate depreciation automatically

Once a month, or whenever you choose, you can run the **Calculate Depreciation** batch job. The batch job ignores fixed assets that were sold, are blocked or inactive, or use the manual depreciation method.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Calculate Depreciation**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  
3. Choose the **OK** button.  

    The batch job calculates the depreciation and creates lines in the fixed asset G/L journal.

4. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **FA G/L Journals**, and then choose the related link.  

    On the **Fixed Asset G/L Journal** page, in the **No. of Depreciation Days** field, you can see how many days of depreciation were calculated.  
5. Choose the **Post** action.  

> [!NOTE]
> Known limitation: If you set the **Use Force No. of Days** field to Yes, and the **Force No. of Days** field is set to a value where **Posting Date** minus **Number of Days** results in a date in the previous calendar year, the system will not let you post the depreciation.
> You can avoid it by reducing the **Force No. of Days** field to no more than than the calculated days until posting date using 30days/month OR set the flag **Fiscal Year 365 Days** in the Depreciation Book.
> We recommend the first option as you may not want to change the use of 30days/months for depreciation. For more information, see [Fiscal Year 365 Days Field Depreciation](fa-how-setup-depreciation.md#fiscal-year-365-days-field-depreciation).


## To post depreciation manually from the fixed asset G/L journal

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Fixed Asset G/L Journal**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Create an initial journal line and fill in the fields as necessary.  
3. In the **FA Posting Type** field, select **Depreciation**.  
4. Choose the **Insert FA Bal. Account** action. A second journal line is created for the balancing account that is set up for depreciation posting. For more information, see [To set up fixed asset posting groups](fa-how-setup-general.md#to-set-up-fixed-asset-posting-groups).
5. Choose the **Post** action to post the journal.  

The **Book Value** field on the **Fixed Asset Card** page is updated accordingly.

If you set up fixed asset allocation keys to allocate amounts to different departments or projects, the amounts are allocated during posting. For more information, see [Set Up General Fixed Assets Information](fa-how-setup-general.md).  

## To manage the ending book value

In the **Ending Book Value** field on the **FA Depreciation Books** page, you can specify the book value that you want your fixed asset to have in the current depreciation book after you fully depreciate it. You can enter the value manually, or you can fill in the **Default Ending Book Value** field on the related **Depreciation Book** page. The value automatically fills in the field.

> [!NOTE]
> If the last depreciation means that the **Book Value** field on the **Fixed Asset Card** page is zero, the last depreciation is automatically reduced by this amount.<br /><br />
> If the value in the **Book Value** field is greater than zero after the last depreciation,  for example because of a rounding problem or because a salvage value exists, the value in the **Ending Book Value** field on the **FA Depreciation Books** page is ignored. For more information, see [To post the salvage value together with the acquisition cost](fa-how-acquire.md#to-post-the-salvage-value-together-with-the-acquisition-cost).

## To calculate allocations for a Fixed Asset


1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **FA Posting Groups**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose **Related**, **Posting Group**, **Allocations** and then select **Depreciation**.
3. Fill in the G/L accounts and the corresponding allocation percentages for each posting group and then close the page.
4. Next, choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Fixed Asset G/L Journals**, and then choose the related link.
5. Enter the Fixed Asset and the corresponding FA Posting Group and Depreciation book will determine the allocation lines.
6. Choose the **Post** action to post the journal.

> [!NOTE]  
> If a fixed asset is used by several departments, you can select the dimension on the Fixed Asset G/L Journal line.

## Use duplication lists to prepare to post to multiple depreciation books

When you fill in journal lines to post to a depreciation book, you can duplicate the lines in a separate journal so you can post to a different depreciation book. For more information, see To [post entries to different depreciation books](fa-how-depreciate-amortize.md#to-post-entries-to-different-depreciation-books).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Depreciation Books**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the depreciation book, and then select the **Part of Duplication List** check box.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>   If you have selected the **Use Duplication List** field, do not use number series on the journal. The reason is that the number series for the fixed asset G/L journal does not the number series for the fixed asset journal.  

## To post entries to different depreciation books

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Fixed Asset G/L Journal**, and then choose the related link.  
2. In the journal that you want to post depreciation with, select the **Use Duplication List** check box.  
3. Fill in the remaining fields as necessary.  
4. Choose the **Post** action.  
5. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **FA Journals**, and then choose the related link.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > The **Fixed Asset Journal** page contains new lines for different depreciation books according to the duplication list.  
6. Review or edit the lines, and then choose the **Post** action.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > Another way to duplicate an entry in a separate book is to enter a depreciation book code in the **Duplicate in Depreciation Book** field when you fill in a journal line.  

You can copy entries from one depreciation book to another by using the **Copy Depreciation Book** batch job. The batch job creates journal lines in the journal batch that you specified on the **FA Journal Setup** page for the depreciation book that you want to copy to. To learn more, go to [To copy fixed asset ledger entries between depreciation books](#to-copy-fixed-asset-ledger-entries-between-depreciation-books).  

## To copy fixed asset ledger entries between depreciation books

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Depreciation Books**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the relevant depreciation book card, and then choose the **Copy Depreciation Book** action.  
3. On the **Copy Depreciation Book** page, fill in the fields as necessary.  
4. Choose the **OK** button.  

The copied lines are created in either the fixed asset G/L journal or the fixed asset journal, depending on whether the depreciation book that you're copying has integration to the general ledger.

# Chart of sustainability accounts and ledger

This article explains how to manage the chart of sustainability accounts (CoSA), categories and subcategories, and details about sustainability ledger entries.

## Chart of sustainability accounts

The CoSA forms the foundational structured list that is used to record all emissions, water, and waste data. It serves as a framework that categorizes and organizes sustainability accounts based on their attributes, such as the scope or other groupings. Each account is typically assigned a unique code or number for easy reference and tracking. It has the same structure as a traditional chart of accounts but is customized specifically to monitor sustainability-related data and metrics in an organization.  

Users can add sustainability account categories and sustainability account subcategories to define how the system behaves. In this way, they can select dedicated emissions, water, or waste for tracking, emission factors, formulas, and similar configurations.

> [!NOTE]
> Based on the greenhouse gas (GHG) standards, there are three emission scopes:
>
> - **Scope 1 emissions** include emissions from stationary and mobile combustion, and from inadvertent fugitive emissions.
> - **Scope 2 emissions** include indirect emissions from the generation of energy that is purchased from utility providers.
> - **Scope 3 emissions** include a wide spectrum of emissions, from purchased goods and services and capital goods, to fuel and energy–related activities, to upstream and downstream transportation, to generated waste, to business travel and employee commuting, and so on.
> - **Out of scope** is for situations where you can't assign a specific emission to the transaction.

> [!NOTE]
> You can also select **Water/Waste** as one of options in the **Emission Scope** when they want to post transactions related to the water and waste management.  

From the CoSA, you can do things such as:

- View reports that show sustainability ledger entries and balances.
- Open the sustainability account card to add or change settings.
- View the category and subcategory for the account.
- View separate balances for each emission for a single account.
- Add single or multiple dimensions to each account and set dimension filters.

You can add, change, or delete sustainability accounts. However, to prevent discrepancies, you can't delete a sustainability account if one or more ledger entries are associated with it.

### Add or change accounts

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 3.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Chart of Sustainability Accounts**, and then select the related link.
2. On the **Chart of Sustainability Accounts** page, you can open each sustainability account, and then add or change settings. Hover over a field to read a short description.

For accounts of the **Total** account type, you must set the **Totaling** field.

For accounts of the **End-Total** type, the **Indent** action automatically sets the **Totaling** field. After you set up all the accounts, select the **Indent Chart of Sustainability Accounts** action to run the **Indent** action and set the **Totaling** field.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The **Indent Chart of Sustainability Accounts** action overwrites the value of all fields for **End-Total** accounts. Therefore, if you entered definitions in the **Totaling** field for **End-Total** accounts before you ran the **Indent Chart of Sustainability Accounts** action, you must enter them again after you run it.  

### Delete accounts

You can delete a sustainability account. However, you must first make sure that no ledger entries are associated with it. Business Central prevents you from deleting a sustainability account if one or more ledger entries are associated with it.

## Account categories

You must add a sustainability account category to each sustainability account to define how the system behaves. You can select emission scopes (gas, water, or waste), dedicated to type of transaction to track, formulas, and similar configurations.  

To review sustainability account categories, follow these steps:

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 3.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sustainability Account Categories**, and then select the related link.
2. On the **Sustainability Account Categories** page, you can edit the existing list or create a new category. To create a new category, select the **New** action.
3. Fill in the **Code** and **Description** fields.
4. In the **Emission Scope** field, select one of the scope options related to gas emissions or water or waste intensity.
5. Select the gas emissions, or water or waste intensity, that you want to track. Currently, the following options are available: **CO2**, **CH4**, **N2O**, **Water Intensity**, **Discharged Into Water**, and **Waste Intensity**. You can select any combination that you want to track, but you must select at least one of them.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you choose one of gas emissions scopes as the **Emission Scope** you can select the **CO2**, **CH4**, or **N2O**, but you can't select the **Water Intensity**, **Discharged Into Water**, or **Waste Intensity**. Also, if you select **Water/Waste** as the **Emission Scope**, you can select only the  **Water Intensity**, **Discharged Into Water**, or **Waste Intensity**, but you can't select **CO2**, **CH4**, or **N2O**.

6. In the **Calculation Foundation** field, select the calculation foundation (formula) to use for emission calculations if you don't know the accurate emission or water or waste intensity amount.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If the formulas in the **Calculation Foundation** field aren't enough, you can extend the field and add more calculations for use in sustainability journals.

7. If you selected **Custom** in the **Calculation Foundation** field, you can configure a custom description in the **Custom Value** field.

If you set the **Calculation Foundation** field, the following table explains how [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates emissions based on the option that you selected. In the table, **EF** represents the **Emission Factor** value that you can configure on the **Sustainability Account Subcategory** page.

| Emission Type | Calculation Foundation | Formula | Comment |
|---------------|------------------------|---------|---------|
| **Scope 1** | | | |
| Stationary combustion | Fuel/Electricity | *Emission* = *Fuel* &times; *EF* | *Fuel* = Amount of fuel that is spent for boilers, heaters, thermal oxidizers, and so on. |
| Mobile combustion | Fuel/Electricity | *Emission* = *Fuel* &times; *EF* | *Fuel* = Amount of fuel that is spent for on-road or off-road vehicles, rail, and so on. |
| | | *Emission* = *Distance* &times; *EF* | *Distance* = Mileage of on-road or off-road vehicles, rail, and so on. |
| Fugitive emissions | Installation | *Emission* = *Installation multiplier* &times; *Custom Amount* &divide; 100 &times; *Time Factor* &times; *EF* | *Custom Amount* = Assembly losses, annual leak rate, and so on. |
| **Scope 2** | | | |
| Utility providers | Fuel/Electricity | *Emission* = *Electricity* &times; *EF* | *Fuel/Electricity* = Electricity quantity, steam quantity, heating unit, and so on. |
| | Custom | *Emission* = *Custom Amount* &times; *EF* | *Custom Amount* = Thermal unit, ton-hour, and so on. |
| **Scope 3** | | | |
| Purchased goods and services, and capital goods | Custom | *Emission* = *Custom Amount* &times; *EF* | *Custom Amount* = Cost (GL), and so on. |
| Upstream transportation and distribution | Distance | *Emission* = *Distance* &times; *EF* | |
| | Distance | *Emission* = *Distance* &times; *Multiplier* &times; *EF* | *Multiplier* = Load Factor / Tons of cargo *|
| Downstream transportation and distribution | Distance | *Emission* = *Distance* &times; *EF* | |
| | Distance | *Emission* = *Distance* &times; *Multiplier* &times; *EF* | *Multiplier* = Load Factor / Tons of cargo *|
| Waste generated in operations and end-of-life treatment of sold products | Custom | *Emission* = *Custom Amount* &times; *EF* | *Custom Amount* = Waste |
| Business travel and employee commuting | Distance | *Emission* = *Distance* &times; *EF* | *Distance* = Mileage of the used company car, rental car, train, flight, and so on. |
| | Custom | *Emission* = *Custom Amount* &times; *EF* | *Custom Amount* = Hotel stays |
| | Fuel/Electricity | *Emission* = *Fuel* &times; *EF* | *Fuel* = Amount of fuel spent in the company car, rental car, and so on. This is the only formula used for water or waste intensity calculation. |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This note applies to the formulas for **Upstream Transportation and Distribution** and **Downstream Transportation and Distribution** when you use the tons-of-cargo calculation model. While you can adapt the formulas, we recommend against using the exact number of tons of cargo as a multiplier. Instead, consult your sustainability advisor to ensure accurate calculations because emissions don't increase linearly with weight. A more accurate approach is to use the **Load Factor**, which represents the percentage of the truck's total capacity utilized (by weight or volume). The load factor can be calculated as **Weight of Cargo** / **Maximum Load Capacity of Truck**. But always confirm with your sustainability expert before you finalize calculations.

## Account subcategories

You must add a sustainability account subcategory to each sustainability account. This subcategory defines the emission factors that the formulas use, based on the emission tracking choice in the sustainability account category.

To review sustainability account subcategories, follow these steps:

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 3.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sustainability Account Subcategories**, and then select the related link.
2. On the **Sustainability Account Subcategories** page, you can edit the existing list or create a new category. To create a new category, select the **New** action.
3. Fill in the **Code** and **Description** fields.
4. Based on the gas emissions that you track in the sustainability account category and connect this subcategory to, you can also set one or more emission factors:

    - **Emission Factor CO2** – The emission factor for carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) emission.
    - **Emission Factor CH4** – The emission factor for methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) emission.
    - **Emission Factor N2O** – The emission factor for nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O) emission.
    - **Water Intensity Factor** - The intensity factor for Water.
    - **Discharged Into Water Factor** - The intensity factor for Discharged Into Water.
    - **Waste Intensity Factor** - The intensity factor for Waste.

5. If the subcategory is related to renewable energy, select the **Renewable Energy** field. However, you can select this field only if it's related to gas emissions and to water or waste.  

> [!NOTE]
> The **Import Data** and **Import From** fields are intended for integration with external systems that are used to collect emission factors. However, in **2024 release wave 1**, these fields can't be used as a feature by default.

You can have more than one account subcategory for a sustainability account, but only one can be set as the default value. You must set the default value for the account every time if you want to use it for posting.  

> [!TIP]
> For example, if you want to use one account for cars, but you have different types of cars with different emission factors. You can set up one account and create account subcategories for the different emission factors. When you work in a sustainability journal, you can change your account subcategory based on the car type.  

## Sustainability ledger entries

The sustainability ledger stores the history of all posted sustainability transactions and organizes all emission data according to the CoSA. When you post a sustainability journal, the data is recorded there. All active reports are generated based on the sustainability ledger entries.

To open this ledger for a specific account, use the **Ledger Entries** action on the **Chart of Sustainability Account** page. To open all the ledger entries, select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 3.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sustainability Ledger Entries**, and then select the related link. Hover over a field to read a short description.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> After you post your data to the sustainability ledger, you can't delete it. If you made a mistake, you can post a reverse transaction that has the same details but uses the negative sign for the amount.

> [!NOTE]
> If you posted entries before enabling **CO<sub>2</sub>e** in the **Emission Fees** page, you can run the **Update Carbon Fees** action from the **Emission Fees** page to recalculate carbon equivalent to in all transactions in the **Sustainability Ledger Entries**.

# Revalue general ledger account balances

If you use general ledger (G/L) accounts to register, balance sheet items in foreign currencies, you should revaluate the account balances before you produce financial statements. Currency exchange rates often change, and revaluation helps make your financial statements more accurate.

## Set up revaluations

You set up each account that you want to include in revaluations on the **G/L Account Card** page. You can select whether to post revaluation adjustments to realized or unrealized gains/losses accounts. Posting gains and losses during a currency exchange rate adjustment follows the normal posting routine. For example, you do it for each setup on the **Currencies** page. To learn more about exchange rate adjustments, go to [Update currency exchange rates](finance-how-update-currencies.md).

To minimize errors, in the **Source Currency Posting** field, you can set up a validation for the currencies that you want to allow to post to individual G/L accounts:

* All currencies (blank)
* Multiple currencies
* Same currency
* Local currency

## Run a revaluation

To revalue the foreign currency amounts in local currency for G/L account balances, on the **Chart of Accounts** page, use the **G/L Currency Revaluation** action to start a batch job. The batch job creates adjustment entries in the journal that you select. When you post the entries, you adjust the local currency (LCY) balance for the account. G/L account balances that always show in LCY now reflect changes to the currencies in which entries were posted. This revaluation enables you to produce a more accurate financial statement with less effort.

If you're using an additional reporting currency (ACY), the G/L revaluation entries have an ACY amount. The amount only corresponding to the LCY amount on these entries, not the ACY balance on the G/L account. If you adjust the ACY rates after you post the adjustments, run the currency exchange rate adjustment one more time to adjust all G/L entries.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> G/L account revaluation might not meet all requirements for transaction and asset registrations that need revaluation. For example, for financial instruments, securities, leased assets, or if you use them for specific or large volumes of transactions or assets. We recommend that you discuss with your auditor whether you can use the feature, and if so, how you should use it. For example, if you'll allow currencies to mix for an account, or if you need to keep a separate account for each asset you want to track.

> [!NOTE]
> Revaluation doesn’t provide the ability to apply or unapply entries, like you can with customer and vendor ledger entries. Adjustments happen on a balance per currency basis.

## Revaluate accounts vs. customer and vendor exchange rate adjustments

Revaluation simplifies the task of adjusting G/L account balances. The feature revaluates the balance per currency per G/L account much like you do for adjustments to G/L accounts that are linked to bank accounts. If you use a G/L account to track multiple assets, consider using a vendor or customer account instead.

> [!NOTE]
> G/L account revaluation might not meet all requirements for transaction and asset registrations that need revaluation. For example, for financial instruments, securities, leased assets, or if you use them for specific or large volumes of transactions or assets. We recommend that you discuss with your auditor whether you can use the feature, and if so, how you should use it. For example, if you'll allow currencies to mix for an account, or if you need to keep a separate account for each asset you want to track.

The following examples illustrate the difference between using a G/L account and using a vendor account to track the balance of two monetary assets that use a foreign currency.

**Use a G/L account**
If you're using one G/L account to track either multiple assets (for example, loans or fixed assets) in the same currency, or individual part transactions for the same asset but still in the same currency, G/L revaluation makes one entry per revaluation for the currency. This means that you can't track the adjustments related to individual assets or individual transactions for the same asset.

**Use a vendor account**
If you set up multiple assets as vendors and you post transactions to them, either in same or different currencies, you'll get an adjustment per currency per vendor. Or, if you turn on the **Posting per entry** toggle on the **Adjust Currency Exchange Rate** job queue entry, you'll get an adjustment entry for each separate vendor ledger entry.

This difference is important when you assess whether G/L revaluation is the right feature to you for your reporting needs.

> [!TIP]
> We recommend that you ask your accountant or auditor which type of account is best for your business. Also, there might be an app for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on [AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps?page=1&product=dynamics-365-business-central) that's just right for your business scenarios.

# Use OCR to turn PDF and image files into electronic documents

From PDF or image files that you receive from your trading partners, you can have an external OCR service (Optical Character Recognition) generate electronic documents that can be converted to document records in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For example, when you receive an invoice in PDF format from your vendor, you can [send it to the OCR service from the Incoming Documents page](#to-send-a-pdf-or-image-file-to-the-ocr-service-from-the-incoming-documents-page).

As an alternative to sending the file from the **Incoming Documents** page, the OCR service can offer the option to [process files forwarded to a dedicated email address](#to-send-a-pdf-or-image-file-to-the-ocr-service-by-email). Then, when you receive the electronic document back, a related incoming document record is created automatically in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

After some seconds, the OCR service sends the processed file to the **Incoming Documents** page as an electronic document record that can be [converted to a purchase invoice for the vendor](#to-receive-the-resulting-electronic-document-from-the-ocr-service), a sales invoice, credit memo, or a journal entry.

Because OCR is based on optical recognition, it's likely that the OCR service interprets characters in your PDF or image files wrongly when it first processes a certain vendor's documents, for example. It might not interpret the company logo as the vendor's name or it might misinterpret the total amount on a receipt because of its layout. To avoid these errors going forward, you can correct the errors in a separate version of the **Incoming Document** page. Then you send the corrections back to the OCR service to train it to interpret the specific characters and fields correctly next time it processes a PDF or image document for the same vendor. To learn more, go to [Train the OCR service to avoid errors](across-how-use-ocr-pdf-images-files.md#to-train-the-ocr-service-to-avoid-errors).

A dedicated job queue entry processes the traffic of files to and from the OCR service. This job queue is created automatically when you enable the external OCR service connection. To learn more, go to [Set Up Incoming Documents](across-how-setup-income-documents.md).

> [!NOTE]
> The OCR feature is provided by external providers. Choose a service package that is appropriate for your organization and/or country/region. Find services compatible with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and details on available features at [AppSource.microsoft.com](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2081646).

## To send a PDF or image file to the OCR service from the Incoming Documents page

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Incoming Documents**, and then choose the related link.
2. Create a new incoming document record and attach the file. For more information, see [Create Incoming Document Records](across-how-create-income-document-records.md).  
3. On the **Incoming Documents** page, select one or more lines, and then choose the **Send to Job Queue** action.

   The value in the **OCR Status** field changes to **Ready**. The attached PDF or image file is sent to the OCR service by the job queue according to the schedule, if no errors exist.
4. Alternatively, on the **Incoming Documents** page, select one or more lines, and then choose the **Send to OCR Service** action to immediately send the files for processing.

   The value in the **OCR Status** field changes to **Sent**, if no errors exist.

## To send a PDF or image file to the OCR service by email

From your email application, you can forward an email to the OCR service provider with the PDF or image file attached. For information about the email address to send to, see the OCR service provider's web site.

Since no incoming document record exists for the file, a new record is created automatically on the **Incoming Documents** page when the OCR service sends the resulting electronic document. To learn more, go to [Create Incoming Document Records](across-how-create-income-document-records.md).

> [!NOTE]  
> If you work on a tablet or phone, you can send the file to the OCR service as soon as you take a photo of the document, or you can create an incoming document directly. To learn more, go to [Create an incoming document record by taking a photo](across-how-create-income-document-records.md#create-an-incoming-document-record-by-taking-a-photo).

## To receive the resulting electronic document from the OCR service

The electronic document that is created by the OCR service from the PDF or image file is automatically received into the **Incoming Documents** page by the job queue entry that is set up when you enable the OCR service.

If you aren't using a job queue, or you want to receive a finished OCR document sooner than per the job queue schedule, you can choose the **Receive from OCR Service** action. This option gets any documents that the OCR service completed.

> [!NOTE]  
> If the OCR service is set up to require manual verification of processed documents, the **OCR Status** field contains **Awaiting Verification**. In that case, do the following steps to sign in to the OCR service website to manually verify an OCR document.

1. In the **OCR Status** field, choose the **Awaiting Verification** hyperlink.
2. On the OCR service website, sign in using the credentials of your OCR service account. To learn more, go to [Set up an OCR service](across-how-setup-income-documents.md#to-set-up-an-ocr-service).

   Information for the OCR document displays, showing both the source content of the PDF or image file and the resulting OCR field values.
3. Review the field values and manually edit or enter values in fields that the OCR service tagged as uncertain.
4. Choose the **OK** button. The OCR process is completed and the resulting electronic document is sent to the **Incoming Documents** page in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], according to the job queue schedule.
5. Repeat steps 2 through 4 for any other OCR document to be verified.

Now you can proceed to create document records for the received electronic documents in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], manually or automatically. For more information, go to the next procedure. You can also [connect the new incoming document record to existing posted or nonposted documents](across-how-connect-disconnect-income-document-records.md) so that the source file is easy to access from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## To create a purchase invoice from an electronic document received from the OCR service

The following procedure describes how to create a purchase invoice record from a vendor invoice received as an electronic document from the OCR service. The procedure is the same when you create, for example, a general journal line from an expense receipt or a sales return order from a customer.

> [!NOTE]  
> The **Description** and **No.** fields on the created document lines are filled in only if you mapped text found on the OCR document to the two fields in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. You can do this mapping as item references for document lines of the type Item. To learn more, go to [Use Item References](inventory-how-use-item-cross-refs.md). You can also use the **Text-to-Account Mapping** function. To learn more, go to [Map text on an incoming document to a specific vendor, G/L, or bank account](across-how-use-ocr-pdf-images-files.md#to-map-text-on-an-incoming-document-to-a-specific-vendor-account).

1. Select the line for the incoming document, and then choose the **Create Document** action.

A purchase invoice is created in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] based on the information in the electronic vendor document that you received from the OCR service. Information is added in the new purchase invoice based on the mapping that you defined as a reference or as text-to-account mapping.

Any validation errors, typically related to wrong or missing data in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], show on the **Errors and Warnings** FastTab. To learn more, go to [Handle errors when receiving electronic documents](across-how-use-ocr-pdf-images-files.md#to-handle-errors-when-receiving-electronic-documents).

### To map text on an incoming document to a specific vendor account

For incoming documents, you typically use the **Map Text to Account** action to define that a certain text on a vendor invoice received from the OCR service is mapped to a certain vendor account. Going forward, any part of the incoming document description that exists as a mapping text means that the **Vendor No.** field on resulting document or journal lines of type *G/L Account* are filled with the vendor in question.

In addition to mapping to a vendor account or G/L accounts, you can also map text to a bank account. This option is useful, for example, for electronic documents for expenses that are already paid, and for which you want to create a general journal line that is ready to post to a bank account.

1. Select the relevant incoming document line, and then choose the **Map Text to Account** action. The **Text-to-Account Mapping** page opens.
2. In the **Mapping Text** field, enter any text that occurs on vendor invoices that you want to create purchase documents or journal lines for. You can enter up to 50 characters.
3. In the **Vendor No.** field, enter the vendor that the resulting purchase document or journal line is for.
4. In the **Debit Acc. No.** field, enter the debit-type G/L account to add on the resulting purchase document or journal line of type G/L Account.
5. In the **Credit Acc. No.** field, enter the credit-type G/L account to insert on resulting purchase document or journal line of type G/L Account.

   > [!NOTE]
   > Don't use the **Bal. Source Type** and **Bal. Source No.** fields with incoming documents. They're used for automatic payment reconciliation only. To learn more, go to [Map Text on Recurring Payments to Accounts for Automatic Reconciliation](receivables-how-map-text-recurring-payments-accounts-auto-reconcilliation.md).
6. Repeat steps 2 through 5 for all text on incoming documents that you want to automatically create documents for.

## To handle errors when receiving electronic documents

1. On the **Incoming Documents** page, select the line for an electronic document received from the OCR service with errors, indicated by the *Error* value in the **OCR Status** field.
2. Choose the **Edit** action to open the **Incoming Document** page.
3. On the **Errors and Warnings** FastTab, select the message, and then choose the **Open Related Record** action.
4. The page that contains the wrong or missing data, such as a vendor card with a missing field value, opens.
5. Correct the error or errors as described in each error message.
6. Proceed to process the incoming electronic document by choosing the **Create Manually** action again.
7. Repeat steps 5 and 6 for any remaining errors until the electronic document can be received successfully.

## To train the OCR service to avoid errors

Because OCR is based on optical recognition, the OCR service can wrongly interpret characters in your PDF or image files when it first processes documents from a certain vendor, for example. It might not interpret the company logo as the vendor's name or it might misinterpret the total amount on an expense receipt because of its layout. To avoid such errors going forward, you can correct data received by the OCR service and then send the feedback to the service.

The **OCR Data Correction** page, which you open from the **Incoming Document** page, shows the fields from the **Financial Information** FastTab in two columns, one with the OCR data editable and one with the OCR data read-only. When you choose the **Send OCR Feedback** button, the content of the **OCR Data Correction** page is sent to the OCR service. Next time the service processes PDF or image files that contain the data in question, your corrections will be incorporated to improve the document recognition.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Incoming Documents**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open an incoming document record that contains data received from the OCR service that you want to correct.
3. On the **Incoming Document** page, choose the **Correct OCR Data** action.
4. On the **OCR Data Correction** page, overwrite the data in the editable column for each field that has an incorrect value.
5. To undo corrections that you made since you opened the **OCR Data Correction** page, choose the **Reset OCR Data** action.
6. To send the corrections to the OCR service, choose the **Send OCR Feedback** action.
7. To save the corrections, close the **OCR Data Correction** page.

The fields on the **Financial Information** FastTab on the **Incoming Document** page update with any new values that you entered in step 4.

# Viewing Service Statistics
You can use statistics to analyze service documents and determine how well you are managing your service processes. You can analyze service contracts, items, quotes, orders, invoices, and credit memos by choosing the **Statistics** action. For service items and contracts, you can also use the **Service Item Trendscape** or **Contract Trendscape** to view a summary of service ledger entries for a specific service item.   

## Viewing Statistics for Service Orders
The service order statistics feature gives you a quick overview of the contents of the entire service order, the details on the specific service lines, and information related to invoicing, shipping and consuming, and the customer's balance.  

The statistical data is displayed for a service order on the **Service Order Statistics** page for the relevant order. You can open the relevant statistics page from a service order. On the **Service Orders** page, choose **Statistics**. The FastTabs in this page show information such as quantity, amount, VAT, cost, profit, and customer credit limit. The amounts on the page are in the currency of the service order, unless otherwise indicated.  

### View totals for a service order  
You can view the total amount on the service lines, including and excluding VAT, VAT part, cost, and profit on the service lines. The page also displays item-specific information, such as weight, volume, and the quantity of parcels.  

### View shipping information  
You can see information about the items, resources, or costs to be shipped. To provide the information, the values specified in the **Qty. to Ship** field are used on each service line in the order.  

### View order details  
You can view information about the items, resource hours, and costs to be invoiced and consumed. The following table describes this information.  

|Column | Description|  
|------------|---------------------------------------|  
|**Invoicing**|Displays amounts that are to be posted as invoiced from the service order.|  
|**Consuming**|Displays the quantity and cost of items, or resources that will be posted as consumed.|  
|**Total**|Displays the total amounts on the service order that result from adding the invoicing amounts to the consuming amounts.|  

### Analyze service order lines  
You can analyze the information by the types of service lines included in the service order. The amounts are shown separately for:  

* Items  
* Resources  
* Costs and general ledger accounts  

### View customer information  
See the balance on the customer's account, in addition to the maximum credit that can be endued to the customer who you created the service document for.

## Viewing Service Item Statistics
On the **Service Item Statistics** page, you can see up-to-date information about a service item based the following service ledger entry types:  

* Resources  
* Items  
* Service cost  
* Service contracts  
* Total  

For each entry type, you can see the invoiced amount, usage (amount), cost amount, quantity, quantity invoiced and quantity consumed, profit amount and profit percentage. The profit percentage is calculated according to the following formula:  

* (Invoiced Amount - Usage (Cost)) x 100 / Invoiced Amount  

## Use Trendscapes
For service items and service contracts, the **Service Item Trendscape** or **Service Contract Trendscape** pages provides a scrollable summary of service ledger entries in a period of time for a specific service item or contract. To view the trendscape, open the service item or service contract, choose the **Statistics** action, and then choose **Trendscape**.

When you scroll the list, the amounts are calculated in the local currency according to the specified time interval. All amounts are calculated from service ledger entries, which are entries that are created when you post service orders or service invoices.

You can filter the list by specifing the service items to include.  

> [!Tip]  
>  If you have set the time interval to **Day** and you want to scroll over a long period, you can do it faster by shifting to a larger interval such as **Quarter**. When you have found the desired period, you can shift back to the original interval to see the data in more detail.   

## Viewing Gains and Losses on Contracts  
A contract gain or loss entry is generated when a contract quote is converted to a service contract, when contract lines are added or removed from a service contract, or when a contract is canceled. You can view contract gains or losses on the following pages.  

|Page | Description|  
|----------------|---------------------------------------|  
|**Contract Gain/Loss (Contracts)**|To view the contract gain/loss by service contract.|  
|**Contract Gain/Loss (Groups)**|To view the contract gain/loss by service contract group.|  
|**Contract Gain/Loss (Customers)**|To view the contract gain/loss by customer.|  
|**Contract Gain/Loss (Reasons)**|To view the contract gain/loss by reason code.|  
|**Contract Gain/Loss (Resp.Ctr)**|To view the contract gain/loss by responsibility center.|  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter the name of the page to display, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the filter criteria you want to apply. For example, on the **Contract Gain/Loss (Reasons)** page, choose a value for **Reason Code Filter**.  
3. Choose the **Show Matrix** action.

## Viewing Statistics for Posted Service Documents
The service statistics feature lets you gain a statistical overview of the contents of posted service documents, such as a posted shipment, posted invoice, and posted credit memo.  

The statistical information is displayed in the statistics page for the corresponding posted service document. You can open the relevant statistics page from posted service shipment, posted service invoice, or posted service credit memo documents. For each of these document types, choose the **Statistics** action. For example, from the **Posted Service Invoices** page, choose the **Statistics** action.  

### Posted Service Shipment Statistics  
The **Service Shipment Statistics** page provides an overview of a posted service shipment. This includes information about the physical contents of the shipment, such as quantity of the shipped items, resource hours or costs, and weight and volume of the shipped items.  

### Posted Service Invoice Statistics  
You can see a statistical summary on a posted service invoice on the **Service Invoice Statistics** page. You can view the totals of the posted service invoice. The data includes total amount on the service lines (including and excluding VAT) that has been posted as invoiced, VAT part, cost, and profit on the posted invoice. The page also displays information about the following:  

* The items on the service invoice lines, such as weight, volume, and the quantity of parcels.  
* The balance on the customer's account, and the maximum credit that you can extend the customer.  

### Posted Service Credit Memo Statistics  
You can use the **Service Credit Memo Statistics** page to get a statistical overview of the lines in a posted service credit memo. The overview can include:

* The total amounts on the posted credit memo, displayed as quantity, amount, VAT, cost and profit. There is also information about the items on the service lines of the posted credit memo, such as quantity, weight, and volume.  
* General information about the customer, such as the customer's credit limit and balance on the account.

# Make sales quotes

You create a sales quote to record your offer to a customer or a prospect to sell certain products on certain delivery and payment terms. You can send the sales quote to the customer to communicate the offer. You can email the document as a PDF attachment. You can also have the email body prefilled with a summary of the quote. To learn more, go to [Send Documents by Email](ui-how-send-documents-email.md#to-send-documents-by-email).

While you negotiate with the customer or prospect, you can change and resend the sales quote as much as needed. When the customer accepts the quote, you convert the sales quote to a sales invoice or a sales order in which you process the sale. To learn more, go to [Invoice Sales](sales-how-invoice-sales.md) or [Sell Products](sales-how-sell-products.md).

In most cases, you send sales quotes to prospective customers. You often have a contact person that you negotiate with. If they then accept your offer, you turn the sales quote into an order and register the prospect as a customer in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. In the following procedure, we focus on contacts, but you can also send quotes to existing customers.  

> [!TIP]
> You can use the Sales Order Agent in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to speed up the quote-to-order workflow. The agent can automate the process for creating quotes based on requests you receive by email from customers. With the agent handling the paperwork, you're free to focus on other tasks such as generating more prospects. To learn more, go to [Process sales quotes and orders with Sales Order Agent (preview)](sales-order-agent-process.md).

## To create a sales quote

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Quotes**, and then choose the related link.
2. Specify the contact or customer that you want to send the sales quote to.

    - If the sales quote is for an existing contact, then specify the name in the **Contact No.** field.  

        If the sales quote is for an existing customer, specify the customer in the **Customer** field.
    - If the contact isn't registered, follow these steps:

        1. In the **Contact No.** field, choose the :::image type="icon" source="media/assist-edit-icon.png" border="false"::: button.
        2. In the dialog box about selecting the contact, choose the **New** action, and then fill in the relevant fields. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)] To learn more, go to [Create Contacts](marketing-create-contact-companies.md).  
        3. After you fill in the contact card, select the new contact in the list of contacts, and then choose **OK** to return to the sales quote.

        Several fields on the sales quote are now filled with information that you specified on the new contact card.

        > [!NOTE]
        > To correctly calculate taxes and prices for a quote, you must choose the relevant customer template in the **Customer Template Code** field. The template is used to convert the contact to a customer when you convert the quote to a sales order or invoice.
    -  If the quote is for new customer, you must add the customer. To learn more, go to [Register New Customers](sales-how-register-new-customers.md).  

3. Fill in the remaining fields on the **Sales Quote** page as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  

    You're now ready to fill in the sales lines for products that you're selling or for any transaction with the customer or prospect that you want to record in a G/L account.  

    If you set up recurring sales lines for the customer, such as a monthly replenishment order, then you can insert these lines on the order by choosing the **Get Recurring Sales Lines** action.  

4. On the **Lines** FastTab, in the **Type** field, select the type of product, charge, or transaction to post for the customer with the sales line.
5. In the **No.** field, select a record to post according to the value in the **Type** field.

    You leave the **No.** field empty in the following cases:
    - If the line is for a comment. Write the comment in the **Description** field.
    - If the line is for a catalog item. Choose the **Select Catalog Items** action. To learn more, go to [Work With Catalog Items](inventory-how-work-nonstock-items.md).

6. In the **Quantity** field, enter how many units of the product, charge, or transaction that the line records for the customer.

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  If the item is of type **Service**, or the **Type** field contains **Resource**, then the quantity is a time unit, such as hours, as indicated in the **Unit of Measure Code** field on the line. To learn more, go to [Set Up Item Units of Measure](inventory-how-setup-units-of-measure.md)

    The value in the **Line Amount** field is calculated as *Unit Price* x *Quantity*.  

    The price and line amounts are with or without sales tax, depending on what you selected in the **Prices Including Tax** field on the customer card.  
7. If you want to give a discount, enter a percentage in the **Line Discount %** field. The value in the **Line Amount** field updates accordingly.  

    If special item prices are set up on the **Sales Prices and Sales Line Discounts** FastTab on the customer or item card, the price and amount on the sales line automatically update if the price criterion is met. To learn more, go to [Record Sales Price, Discount, and Payment Agreements](sales-how-record-sales-price-discount-payment-agreements.md).  
8. Repeat steps 4 through 7 for every product you want to offer the contact.

    The totals under the lines are automatically calculated as you create or modify lines.  
9. In the **Inv. Discount Amount** field, enter an amount that should be deducted from the value shown in the **Total Incl. Tax** field.

    If you set up invoice discounts for the customer, the specified percentage value is automatically inserted in the **Invoice Discount %** field if the criteria are met. The related amount is inserted in the **Inv. Discount Amount Excl. Tax** field. To learn more, go to [Record Sales Price, Discount, and Payment Agreements](sales-how-record-sales-price-discount-payment-agreements.md).

    > [!TIP]
    > To have the **Quote Valid Until Date** filled in automatically with a number of days after quote creation, you can enter a date formula in the **Quote Validity Calculation** field on the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page. To learn more about date formulas, go to .

10. When the sales quote lines are completed, choose the **Send by Email** action.
11. On the **Send Email** page, fill in any remaining fields and review the embedded sales quote. To learn more, go to [Send Documents by Email](ui-how-send-documents-email.md#to-send-documents-by-email).
12. If the contact accepts the quote, choose the **Make Order** action.  

    Alternatively, if your organization prefers that process, choose the **Make Invoice** action.  
    > [!NOTE]
    > If you added a customer in step 2, confirm the conversion of the quote to an order.  
    >
    > If you added a contact from a prospective customer in step 2, take the following steps:
    >
    >  - Convert the contact or prospect to a customer by choosing one of contact conversion templates. To learn more, go to [To create a customer, vendor, employee, or bank account from a contact](marketing-create-contact-companies.md#to-create-a-customer-vendor-employee-or-bank-account-from-a-contact).  
    > - Confirm the conversion of the quote to an order.

The conversion removes the sales quote from the database. A sales invoice or a sales order is created based on the information in the sales quote so that you can process the sale. The **Quote No.** field on the sales invoice or sales order shows the ID of the sales quote that it was made from. To learn more, go to [Invoice Sales](sales-how-invoice-sales.md) or [Sell Products](sales-how-sell-products.md).

# Walkthrough: Make cash flow forecasts using financial reports

This walkthrough describes how you can use the financial reports feature to make cash flow forecasts. Financial reports perform calculations that cannot be done directly in the chart of cash flow accounts. In the financial reports, you can set up subtotals for cash flow receipts and disbursements. These subtotals can be included in new totals that can then be used to make cash flow forecasts.  

## About this walkthrough

This walkthrough describes the following tasks:  

- Setting up a new cash flow financial report name.  
- Setting up financial report lines.  
- Setting up a new column definition.  
- Assigning a column definition to a financial report.  
- Viewing and printing the cash flow forecast.  

### Prerequisites

To complete this walkthrough, you will need:  

- [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]  
- A cash flow worksheet with registered lines  

## Roles

This walkthrough demonstrates tasks that are performed by the following user role:  

- Controller  

## Story

Ken is a controller at CRONUS who makes monthly cash flow forecasts. Ken includes finance, sales, purchase, and fixed assets in the forecasts, and presents to CFO Sara for business insight.  

## Set up a new financial report name

The financial report name is the name you give the cash flow forecast that includes a series of defined lines and a column definition.  

### Set up a new financial report name  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Financial Reports**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Financial Reports** page, choose **New** to create a new cash flow financial report name.  
3. In the **Name** field, enter **Forecast**.  
4. In the **Description** field, enter **Cash Flow Forecast**.  
5. Leave the **Row Definition** and **Column Definition** fields blank.

## Set up row definition lines

After a financial report name is set up, Ken defines each line in the cash flow financial report. Ken defines lines to be shown in reports in addition to lines that are only for calculation purposes.  

### Set up row definition lines  

1. On the **Financial Reports** page, select the new **Forecast** financial report you created, then choose the **Edit Row Definition** action.  
2. On the **Row Definition** page, enter each line as shown in the following table.  

    > [!TIP]  
    > Use the **Insert CF Accounts** function to quickly mark, in the cash flow accounts chart, the cash flow accounts you want and copy them to row definition lines.  

    | Row No. | Description              | Totaling Type            | Totaling | Row Type   | Amount Type | Show |

    > [!NOTE]
    > The row number R10 is used to capture the account totals for receivables. The row number R20 is used to calculate the sum of all cash receipts. The row number R30 is used to capture the account totals for payables. The row number R40 is used to calculate the sum of all cash disbursements. The row number R50 is used to capture the sum of cash surplus. The row number R60 is used to capture the liquid funds. The row number R70 is used to calculate the forecasted cash flow.

## Set up a new column definition

Before printing the cash flow forecast, Ken needs to create the column definition for the numerical information. In the columns, Ken defines the information needed to use from the lines.

- The first column has the number *C10* with the title **Amount** and contains the net change.  
- The second column has the number *C20* with the title **Balance at Date** and contains the transactions for the period.  
- The third column has the number *C30* with the title **Entire Year** and contains the net change in the balances for the entire fiscal year.  
- Finally, Ken assigns the column definition as the default option for the **Forecast** financial report.  

### Set up a new column definition

1. On the **Financial Reports** page, select the new **Forecast** financial report name you created. On the **Home** tab, in the **Process** group, choose **Edit Column Definition**.

2. Create a new column definition with the name **Cash Flow**.

3. Choose the **OK** button.

4. Enter each line exactly as shown in the following table.

    |Column No.|Column Header|Column Type|Ledger Entry Type|Amount Type|Show|  
    |----------|-------------|-----------|-----------------|-----------|----|
    |C10|Amount|Net Change|Entries|Net Amount|Always|  
    |C20|Amount Until Date|Balance at Date|Entries|Net Amount|Always|  
    |C30|Entire Fiscal Year|Entire Fiscal Year|Entries|Net Amount|Always|

## Assig the column definition to the financial report name

Ken is now ready to assign the column definition to the financial report name.  

### Assign the column definition to the financial report name

1. In the **Financial Reports** page, select the **Forecast** financial report, then choose the **Edit Column Definition** action.  
2. In the **Name** field, choose the column definition **Cash Flow** to assign as the default column definition.  

## View and print the cash flow forecast

1. On the **Financial Reports** page, choose the **Forecast** financial report [Financial analytics overview](bi.md)  to view the cash flow forecast.  
2. On the **Financial Report** page, you can select an amount and then view the cash flow forecast entries that make up the amount. In addition, you can view the formula used to calculate that amount. You can also filter the amounts by date and dimension.  
3. Choose the **Print** action to print the cash flow forecast.

# Sandbox Environments in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]

With [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, you can easily get a safe environment where you can test, train, or troubleshoot without disturbing your company's work processes or business data. Such a non-production environment is called a *sandbox*. Isolated from production, a sandbox environment is the place to safely explore, learn, demo, develop, and test the service without the risk of affecting the data and settings of your production environment.  

> [!TIP]
> Did you land on this article after you chose the name of your [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] environment in the top bar? Currently, you cannot change the name or the environment that way. Instead, you must ask your admin to change the name, or ask them to share the link to another environment.

Your administrator manages sandbox environments in the [administration center](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/tenant-admin-center-environments?toc=/dynamics365/business-central/toc.json).  

For example, if you want to create a sandbox for benchmarking, your administrator can create a dedicated environment in the administration center. For more information, see [Production and Sandbox Environments](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/environment-types) in the developer and administration content.  

You can also safely use sandboxes for training, such as for following a learning path from [Microsoft training](/training/dynamics365/business-central?WT.mc_id=dyn365bc_landingpage-docs), because it's a safe environment to experiment with. If anything goes wrong, you just delete the sandbox and start over.  

Once you're done, you can remove the sandbox, using the administration center.  

> [!NOTE]
> Technically, sandbox environments are very different from production environments. Your administrator can create a sandbox that includes production data, but it is still a sandbox, and you cannot request a database export, for example. For more information, see [Sandbox environments](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/environment-types#sandbox-environments) in the developer and administration content.

The sandbox environment is not least useful because it includes a couple of handy features:

* [Advanced user experience](#advanced-user-experience)  
<!--* [Complete sample data](#complete-sample-data)  -->
* [Designer](#designer)  

## Advanced user experience

It is possible to enable and try the full functionality of the standard version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in a sandbox tenant by setting the **Experience** field on the **Company Information** page to *Premium*. Find the **Company Information** page in the :::image type="content" source="media/ui-experience/settings_icon_small.png" alt-text="Settings icon."::: menu.  

After you have enabled the *Premium* user experience, you get access to all the standard profiles (roles) and Role Centers in the standard version. Alternatively, contact a reselling partner for a demonstration of the capabilities. For more information, see [How do I find a reselling partner?](across-faq.yml#how-do-i-find-a-reselling-partner).  

### Complete sample data

For situations where you need additional sample data, please talk to your reselling partner.
<!-- In the sandbox environment, you can also create a new company with the **Advanced Evaluation - Complete Sample Data** option so that you can take training or step through walkthroughs that require additional sample data, such as [Walkthrough: Receiving and Putting Away in Basic Warehouse Configurations](walkthrough-receiving-and-putting-away-in-basic-warehousing.md).   -->

<!--#### To create a company with complete sample data in a sandbox

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Companies**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action, and then choose **Create New Company**.  
3. In the **Assisted Setup for Creating a Company** page, choose **Next**.  
4. Specify a name for the new company, and then, in the **Select the data and setup to get started** field, choose **Advanced Evaluation - Complete Sample Data**.  
5. Complete the rest of the assisted setup guide.  

When the assisted setup guide completes, you can start exploring the new company with the complete sample data. For more information, see [Creating New Companies in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]](about-new-company.md).  -->

## Designer

In a sandbox environment, you will find the **Designer** enabled. You can activate Designer by selecting the design icon ![Designer.](./media/across-sandbox/sandbox-inclient-design-icon.png) on a page, or by choosing the **Design** menu item in the ![Settings](media/ui-experience/settings_icon_small.png) Settings menu.  

For more information, see [Use Designer](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-inclient-designer) in the developer and admin content (in English only).

# Prioritize Vendors

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can suggest various payments to vendors, for example, payments that will be due soon or payments where a discount is available. For more information, see [Suggest Vendor Payments](payables-how-suggest-vendor-payments.md).

First, you must prioritize your vendors by assigning numbers to them.
<br><br>
> [!Video https://learn-video.azurefd.net/vod/player?id=283f5ccb-3cbb-48c5-b50d-fd91466e8094]

## To prioritize vendors

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Vendors**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the relevant vendor, and then choose **Edit**.
3. In the **Priority** field, enter a number.

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] considers the lowest number, except 0, to have the highest priority. So, for example, if you use 1, 2, and 3, then 1 will have the highest priority.

If you do not want to prioritize a vendor, leave the **Priority** field blank. Then, if you use the payment suggestion feature, the vendor will be listed after all the vendors that have a priority number. You can enter as many priority levels as necessary.

# Define Retention Policies

This article describes how administrators can define retention policies to specify how often to delete outdated data in tables that contain log entries and archived records. For example, cleaning up log entries can make it easier to work with the more relevant data. Policies can delete data based on an expiration date, or you can add filters to include only certain expired data.

## Required setups and permissions

Before you can create retention policies, you must set up the tables to include and the periods of time to keep data.

|Setup  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|**Allowed Tables**     |We provide a list of tables that you can include in retention policies. If you want to add tables from an extension to a retention policy, a developer must add their tables to the list. To learn more, go to [Include your extension in a retention policy](admin-data-retention-policies.md#include-your-extension-in-a-retention-policy-requires-help-from-a-developer).          |
|**Retention Periods**     |Specify periods of time for which to keep data in the tables in a policy. The periods determine how often data is deleted.         |

Additionally, you must have the **SUPER** user permissions or the **Retention Policy Setup** permission set. Users who have the Retention Policy Setup permission set can define retention policies for tables. That's true, even if they don't have Read and Delete permissions for the tables. The job queue entry must run as a user with permissions to read and delete the data. Don't grant the Retention Policy Setup permission set to users who shouldn't be allowed to delete data.

> [!NOTE]
> If you're using [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, and you want to try out retention policies in the the Cronus demonstration database, there are a few things you need to do. The demonstration company doesn't contain tables that you can use with retention policies, so you need to add them. To do that, create a new, blank company in the demonstration database. In the new company, import the RapidStart configuration package for your country/region that corresponds to the standard NAV17.0.W1.ENU.STANDARD.rapidstart package. The setup data for retention policies will be available in the new company.

### Create retention periods

Retention periods can be as long or as short as you want. To create retention periods, on the **Retention Policies** page, use the **Retention Period** action. The periods you define are available for all policies.

> [!NOTE]
> For compliance reasons, we have defined a minimum retention period for some tables. If you set a retention period that's shorter than minimum required, a message displays the mandatory period.

### Set up a retention policy

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Retention Policies**, and choose the related link.
2. Select **New** to create a new retention policy. 
3. In the **Table ID** field, choose the table that you want to include in the policy.
4. In the **Retention Period** field, specify the length of time for which to keep the data in the table.
5. Optional: You can apply the policy to specific data in a table, rather than all records, by filtering the data for each line. The policy will apply only to the records that the filters return. To specify the filter criteria, turn off the **Apply to all records** toggle. The **Record Retention Policy** FastTab displays, where you can set filter criteria. To learn more about how filters work, go to [Filtering](ui-enter-criteria-filters.md#filtering).

   > [!NOTE]
   > Each line has its own retention period. If you specify different retention periods for the same data, the longest period is used. Also, some tables contain filters that you can't change or remove. To help you identify these filters, they appear in a lighter color font.

#### Video guidance

This video provides an example of how to set up a retention policy.

>[!VIDEO https://learn-video.azurefd.net/vod/player?id=511928c9-f956-45f6-8748-0c96f7ff0d33]

## Apply retention policies

You can use a job queue entry to apply retention policies to delete data automatically, or you can manually apply policies.

To apply a retention policy automatically, just create and enable a policy. When you enable a policy,, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates a job queue entry that applies the it according to its retention period. All retention policies will use the same job queue entry. By default, the job queue entry applies the policy every day at 0200. You can change the default, but if you do we recommend that it runs outside business hours. To learn more, go to [Use Job Queues to Schedule Tasks](admin-job-queues-schedule-tasks.md). 

You can manually apply a policy by using the **Apply Manually** action on the **Retention Policies** page. If you want to always apply a policy manually, turn on the **Manual** toggle. The job queue entry will disregard the policy when it runs.

## View retention policy log entries

You can view activity related to retention policies in the **Retention Policy Log** page. For example, entries are created when a policy is applied, or if errors occurred.

## Include your extension in a retention policy (requires help from a developer)

By default, retention policies cover only [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in the list we provide. You can remove default tables from the list, and you can add tables that you own. That is, you can't add a table that you did not create yourself. For example, you can't add other tables from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] or from an extension that you have purchased.

To add your tables to the list of allowed tables, a developer must add some code. For example, to the installer codeunit for the extension (a codeunit with the *install* subtype).

When a developer adds a table, they can specify mandatory and default filters. Mandatory filters can't be removed or modified later when you add tables to define a retention policy. The default filters are just suggestions.

The following are examples of how to add a table to the list of allowed tables with, and without, mandatory or default filters. For a more complex example, go to codeunit 3999 "Reten. Pol. Install - BaseApp".

```al
 trigger OnInstallAppPerCompany()
    var
        RetenPolAllowedTables: Codeunit "Reten. Pol. Allowed Tables";
    begin
        RetenPolAllowedTables.AddAllowedTable(Database::"Retention Policy Log Entry");
    end;
```

The following example includes a mandatory filter.

```al
 trigger OnInstallAppPerCompany()
    var
        ChangeLogEntry: Record "Change Log Entry";
        RetenPolAllowedTables: Codeunit "Reten. Pol. Allowed Tables";
        RetentionPeriod: Enum "Retention Period Enum";
        RecRef: RecordRef;
        TableFilters: JsonArray;
        Enabled: Boolean;
        Mandatory: Boolean;
    begin
        ChangeLogEntry.Reset();
        ChangeLogEntry.SetFilter("Field Log Entry Feature", '%1|%2', ChangeLogEntry."Field Log Entry Feature"::"Monitor Sensitive Fields", ChangeLogEntry."Field Log Entry Feature"::All);
        RecRef.GetTable(ChangeLogEntry);
        Enabled := true;
        Mandatory := true;
        RetenPolAllowedTables.AddTableFilterToJsonArray(TableFilters, RetentionPeriod::"28 Days", ChangeLogEntry.FieldNo(SystemCreatedAt), Enabled, Mandatory, RecRef);
        RetenPolAllowedTables.AddAllowedTable(Database::"Change Log Entry", ChangeLogEntry.FieldNo(SystemCreatedAt), TableFilters);
    end;
```

After a developer has added tables to the list, an administrator can include them in a retention policy.

# Use the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] apps in Power BI

> **APPLIES TO:** [!INCLUDE [prod_long](includes/prod_long.md)] online 

[!INCLUDE [prod_long](includes/prod_long.md)] publishes the following Power BI apps, which provide detailed dashboards for viewing data:

- [!INCLUDE [prod_long](includes/prod_long.md)] - CRM  
- [!INCLUDE [prod_long](includes/prod_long.md)] - Finance  
- [!INCLUDE [prod_long](includes/prod_long.md)] - Sales

## Overview

Each app includes several reports that you can drill into for data, including the following features:

- Choose any visual on the dashboard to bring up one of the underlying reports.  
- Filter the report or add fields that you want to monitor.  
- Pin a customized view to the dashboard to continue tracking.  
  You can refresh data manually, and you can set up a refresh schedule. For more information, see [Configuring scheduled refresh](/power-bi/refresh-scheduled-refresh).  

The apps are designed to work with data from any company in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. When you install the Power BI app, you specify one or more parameters to connect to your [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

> [!NOTE]
> You can also build your own reports and dashboards in Power BI based on your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] data. For more information, see [Connecting Your Business Data to Power BI](across-how-use-financials-data-source-powerbi.md). 

## Prerequisites

Power BI apps require permissions to the tables where data is retrieved and the web services used to retrieve data. The following table lists the web services required for each Power BI app:
    
|App|Web services |

    ![Select Dynamics 365 Business Central  and select Get it now.](./media/across-how-to-connect-powerbi-d365-content-packs/powerbi-workspace-dashboard-report-dataset.png)

## Fixing problems

The Power BI dashboard relies on the published web services that are listed above. It shows data from the demonstration company or your own company if you import data from your current finance solution. However, if something goes wrong, this section provides a workaround for the most typical issues.  

### You don't have a Power BI account

A Power BI account hasn't been set up. You must have a license to get a valid Power BI account. Also, you must have previously signed into Power BI to create your Power BI workspace.  

### Message: There are no enabled reports. Select report to see a list of reports that you can display.

This message appears if the default report failed to deploy to your Power BI workspace. Or the report deployed but didn't successfully refresh. If this problem happens, navigate to the report in your Power BI workspace, select **Dataset**, **Settings**, and then manually update the credentials. Once the dataset successfully refreshes, navigate back to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and manually select the report from the **Select Reports** page.

### You need a Power BI Pro license to install the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app in Power BI

You need a [Power BI Pro license](/power-bi/service-features-license-type) to share your content, and the people you share it with do too. The content must be in a workspace in a [Premium capacity](/power-bi/service-premium-what-is). For more information, see [Ways to share your work in Power BI](/power-bi/service-how-to-collaborate-distribute-dashboards-reports).  

### "Parameter validation failed, please make sure all parameters are valid"

This error indicates that one more of the parameters aren't valid.

- The specified environment parameter doesn't match any existing [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] production or sandbox environment.
- The specified company parameter doesn't match any existing [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] companies. Verify the company name in the **Companies** page in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].
- If connecting to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, you entered a URL that isn't valid. You can verify the URL in the **Web Services** page in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]  
- A port isn't open to allow the request through your firewall.

### Can't sign in

If you get a "login failed" error after using your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] user credentials to sign in, then you're probably experiencing one of the following issues:

- The account that you're using doesn't have permissions to retrieve the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] data from your account. Verify that you have permissions to the required data in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and try again.
- You've selected an authentication type other than Basic, if connecting to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises.
- You haven't entered a valid user name or password.

### Message: Your data source can't be refreshed because the credentials are invalid. Please update your credentials and try again

For [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, the problem might be that the OData URL is only exposed to the local network.

### Incorrect company name

A common mistake is to enter the company display name instead of the company name. To find the company name search for **Companies**. Then use the **Name** field when entering your company name.

### The key didn't match any rows in the table

If you enter a non-valid company name during the connection process, you may get the error message "The key didn't match any rows in the table". Provide the correct company name and try connecting again.

### Historical data appears to be missing

Once the Power BI app installs and your data show in Power BI, you notice that not all your data displays. The datasets are filtered to only return the previous 365 days of data. This default is in place to help make the reports faster.  

### I only see data for a single company

The Power BI app will only display data from the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] company that was defined when the Power BI app was installed. Data from additional companies can be added to the reports by adding new queries that use different companies as the data source.  

### What now?

- Try [asking a question in the Q&A box](/power-bi/service-q-and-a-tips) at the top of the dashboard.
- [Change the tiles](/power-bi/service-dashboard-edit-tile) in the dashboard.  
- [Select a tile](/power-bi/service-dashboard-tiles) to open the underlying report.  
- By default, your dataset isn't scheduled to refresh. You can change the refresh schedule or try refreshing it on demand using **Refresh Now**. For more information, see [Configuring scheduled refresh](/power-bi/refresh-scheduled-refresh).

# Warehouse management overview

There are two things that are important to all businesses that physically move goods in and out of their warehouse:

* They have an overview of inventory levels and item placement in the warehouse.
* They can quickly and accurately receive, pick, and ship items.

To help businesses achieve those things, warehouse features in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] add the following capabilities to inventory management:

* Bins
* Warehouse shipments
* Inventory picks
* Movement worksheet

Implement these features in different combinations to tailor your warehouse processes for your business. Allow for increasing complexity as your company grows and your processes change.

## Overview of different configuration options

You can configure warehouse features in various ways. It's important to choose options that improve your processes without causing overhead. The following table gives an overview of typical configurations for dealing with physical goods.

|Complexity Level|Description|Settings|Bin Code|Example of Inbound Flow|Example of Outbound Flow|Example of Internal Flow|  
|---|----------------|----------|---------|------------------|------------------|------------------|
|No dedicated warehouse activity.|Posting from orders and journals.||Optional. Controlled by the **Bin Code is Mandatory** toggle.|Purchase order|Sales order| Production order -> Consumption journal|  
|Basic|Consolidated receive/ship posting for multiple orders.|**Require Receipt**<br>**Require Ship**.|Optional. Controlled by the Bin Code is Mandatory toggle|Purchase Orders -> Warehouse Receipt|Sales Order -> Warehouse Shipment|Same as above.|
|Basic|Order-by-order.|Purchase, Sales, Service & Transfer: Require Put-away or Require Pick. </br><br/> Production, Assembly, Projects: Inventory Picks, Inventory Movement, Inventory Put-Away </br></br>**NOTE**: You can still post receipts, shipments, consumption, output directly from the source documents at locations where you activated these settings.|Optional. Controlled by the **Bin Code is Mandatory** toggle.|Purchase Order -> Inventory Put-away|Sales Order -> Inventory Pick|Production Order -> Inventory Pick|
|Advanced|Consolidated receive/ship posting for multiple orders.<br /><br />Consolidated pick/put-away activities for multiple source documents.|Purchase, Sales, Service & Transfer: Require Receive + Require Put-away,</br> Require Ship + Require Pick</br></br> Production, Assembly, Projects: Warehouse Picks |Optional. Controlled by the Bin Code is Mandatory toggle|Purchase Orders -> Warehouse Receipt -> Warehouse Put-away|Sales Orders -> Warehouse Shipments -> Pick Worksheet -> Warehouse Picks| Production order -> Pick Worksheet -> Warehouse Picks -> Consumption journal|
|Advanced|Same as above + Directed pick/put-away activities|Directed Pick and Put-away (dependent toggles are enabled automatically)|Mandatory|Same as above.|Same as above.| Production order -> Pick Worksheet -> Warehouse Picks Consumption journal|

Complexity increases with the size of your organization and how many departments and people are involved. A process can be simple, for example, when the same person creates and posts a sales document. Processes can also be more complex, and involve several steps and people. The following steps are an example of a more complex process:

1. An order processor creates a sales order.
1. A warehouse manager creates pick instructions.
1. A warehouse employee finishes the flow by posting the warehouse shipment.

The types of documents you use in your warehouse activities also affect the level of complexity. For example, you can use warehouse receipt and warehouse put-away documents for your inbound flow, but use inventory pick documents for your outbound flow.

Another factor that impacts complexity is how your physical warehouse is represented in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Learn more at [Modeling the physical warehouse](#modeling-the-physical-warehouse).

## Modeling the physical warehouse

You have several options for representing the real-world setup of your warehouse in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Your choices determine how you work with warehouse features.

The placement of items can be shelves, locations, or bins, and there are pros and cons for each option.

### Locations and bins

To handle physical goods, you must have at least one location. You can use multiple locations or use bins to model your warehouse and organizational structure.

Typically, locations are the preferred way to organize operations that are distributed across geographic areas. In some cases, however, you might want to create several locations that are located at the same place. Using locations has the following advantages:

* Grant access by using the **Warehouse Employee** and **Responsibility Centers** pages.
* Define calendars, routings, and inbound and outbound handling times for date calculation and planning. Learn more at [About Planning Functionality](production-about-planning-functionality.md).
* Specify default dimensions and use different inventory posting setups.
* Set up planning parameters. Learn more at [Planning parameters](production-about-planning-functionality.md#planning-parameters).  
* Use different warehouse features for each location.

### Shelves and bins

If you always store an item in the same place, you can use the **Shelf No.** field on the **Item Card** or **Stock-keeping Unit Card** pages. This field can be a basic manual storage system in environments without bins. The field's value is copied from the item card to document lines and reports, but it's only informational. The value isn't used in warehouse activities or availability calculations.

Bins represent the basic warehouse structure, and are used to make suggestions about the placement of items:

* One or more fixed bins for an item.
* Bins for specific operations, such as a shipping bin or a production output bin.
* Bin capacity and weight restrictions (for directed put-away and pick only).
* Bin rating (for directed put-away and pick only).

## Typical warehouse workflow

The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the articles that describe them.

|**To**|**See**|  
|------------|-------------|  
|In a basic flow on an order-by-order basis, use an inventory put-away to record the receipt of items at locations, including any over-receipt. Or, if you're consolidating multiple orders in the receipt, use a warehouse receipt.|[Inbound flow](design-details-inbound-warehouse-flow.md)|
|Record the shipment of items from warehouse locations. On an order-by-order basis, use an inventory pick. Or, if you're consolidating multiple orders in the shipment, use a warehouse shipment.|[Outbound flow](design-details-outbound-warehouse-flow.md)|
|Handle items within the warehouse location. For example, when you move components to production or do a physical inventory count.|[Internal flow](design-details-internal-warehouse-flows.md)|

Set up the warehouse processes that are right for your business. Learn more at [Setting Up Warehouse Management](warehouse-setup-warehouse.md).

## Terminology related to warehouse management

### Complexity levels

We use the terms "basic" and "advanced" to differentiate between levels of complexity. This simple differentiation covers several levels of complexity in location setups, each supported by different warehouse documents. The most advanced level of warehousing is referred to as "Directed put-away and pick." To use directed put-away and pick for a location, turn on the **directed put-away and pick** toggle on the **Location Card** page.

### Warehouse flows

* Inbound flow - Move items into the warehouse location and make them available, such as purchases and inbound transfers.
* Outbound flow - Pick and ship items to customers or other locations.
* Internal flow - Handle items within a location. For example, move components to production or count physical inventory.

### Basic documents  

The following documents are used in basic warehouse flows.

* Inventory Put-away
* Inventory Picks
* Inventory Movement
* Item Journal
* Item Reclassification Journal

### Advanced documents  

The following documents are used in advanced warehouse flows.

* Warehouse Receipt
* Put-away Worksheet
* Warehouse Put-away
* Pick Worksheet
* Warehouse Picks
* Movement Worksheet
* Warehouse Movement
* Internal Warehouse Picks
* Internal Warehouse Put-away
* Bin Creation Worksheet
* Bin Content Creation Worksheet
* Warehouse Item Journal
* Warehouse Item Reclassification Journal

### Pages and settings

This section describes the concepts behind the key pages and settings for warehousing.

#### Bins and bin content

A bin is a storage device designed to contain discrete parts. It's the smallest container unit in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Item quantities in bins are referred to as *bin contents*. A lookup from the **Item** field or **Bin Code** field on any warehouse-related document line displays the calculated availability of the item in the bin.  

Bin contents can be **Fixed**, **Dedicated**, or **Default** to define how to use the bin content. Bins with none of these properties are referred to as *floating* bins.  

A fixed bin holds items that are assigned to the bin code. The fixed bin property ensures that even if the bin is emptied, the bin content doesn't disappear. You can select the bin again as soon as its contents are replenished.  

A dedicated bin holds bin content that can only be picked for the dedicated resource that uses the bin. For example, a machine center. Other nonpick content, such as outbound quantities on a shipment posting, can be consumed from a dedicated bin. Only bin content considered by the **Create Pick** algorithm is protected in a dedicated bin.  

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses the **Default** bin property to suggest bins for warehouse activities. At locations that use directed put-away and pick, the default bin property isn't used. At locations where bins are required, the property specifies where to place items in inbound flows. In outbound flows, the property specifies where to take items from.  

> [!NOTE]  
> If outbound items are in several bins, items are taken from the nondefault bins to empty that bin content first. The remaining items are taken from the default bin.  

You can have one default bin per item per location.  

#### Bin type

Locations that use directed put-away and pick can use bin types. Bin types control the activities that you allow for a bin. 

The following types of bins are available:  

|Bin Type|Description|  
|------------------|---------------------------------------|  
|RECEIVE|Items that are received but aren't put away.|  
|SHIP|Items that are picked for warehouse shipment lines but aren't posted as shipped.|  
|PUT AWAY|Typically, items to store in large units of measure but that you don't want to access for picking purposes. These bins aren't used for picking, either for production orders or shipments, so their use might be limited. This type of bin is useful when you purchase a large quantity of items. The bins should always have a low bin-ranking, so that items with higher-ranking PUTPICK bins are put away first. Regularly replenish this type of bin so that their items are available in PUTPICK or PICK type bins.|  
|PICK|Items to be used for picking only. You can only use movements to replenishment of these bins, not put-aways.|  
|PUTPICK|Items in bins that are suggested for both put-aways and picks. Bins of this type probably have different bin rankings. Set up your bulk storage bins with lower bin rankings than ordinary pick bins or bins in your forward picking area.|  
|QC|This bin is used for inventory adjustments if you specify this bin on the location card in the **Adjustment Bin Code** field. You can also set up bins of this type for defective items and items being inspected. You can move items to this type of bin if you want to make them inaccessible to the usual item flow. **Note:**  Unlike all other bin types, the **QC** bin type has none of the item handling checkboxes selected by default. Content you place in a QC bin is excluded from item flows.|  

You can operate your warehouse with all of the eight possible bin types, or you can choose to operate with just the RECEIVE, PUTPICK, SHIP, and QC bin types. These four bin types enable suggestions to be made that support the flow of items and allow you to record inventory discrepancies.
With the exceptions of the PICK, PUTPICK, and PUTAWAY types of bins, the bin type defines the activity allowed for a bin. For example, you can only use a RECEIVE type of bin to receive items or pick items from.  

> [!NOTE]  
> You must use movements to move items to RECEIVE and QC bins. Similarly, use movements to move items from SHIP and QC bins.  

#### Bin ranking

In advanced warehousing, you can automate and optimize how to collect items in put-away and pick worksheets by ranking bins. Items are suggested for picks and put-aways based on the bin ranks.

Put-away processes are optimized according to bin ranking by suggesting higher-ranking bins before lower-ranking bins. Pick processes suggest items with the highest bin ranking from bin content first. Bin replenishment suggests lower-ranking bins before higher-ranking bins.  

Bin ranking and bin contents are the basic properties that guide warehouse employees in the warehouse.  

#### Bin setup

In advanced warehousing, you can specify the following capacity values to control how, and in which, bins you store items:

* Quantity
* Total cubage
* Weight  

You can assign a base unit of measure (UOM) to items. A base UOM might be pieces, pallets, liters, grams, or boxes. You can also create larger UOMs based on your base UOM. For example, if pieces are your base UOM, a pallet might equal 16 pieces.  

If an item has more than one UOM, set the maximum quantity for every UOM on the item card. If you handle an item in pieces and pallets, the **Max. Qty.** field on the **Bin Content** page for that item must also be in pieces and pallets. Otherwise, the allowed quantity for that bin isn't calculated correctly.  

Before you set capacity restrictions for bin contents on a bin, make sure that the UOM and dimensions of the item are set up on the item.  

> [!NOTE]  
> You can only use multiple UOMs at locations that use directed put-away and pick. In all other configurations, you can only use bin contents in the base UOM. In transactions with a UOM that's larger than the item's base UOM, the quantity is converted to the base UOM.  

#### Zone

In advanced warehousing, bins can be grouped in zones to manage how the workflow of warehouse activities is directed for locations.  

A zone could be a receiving zone or a stocking zone, and each zone can consist of one or more bins.  

Most properties assigned to a zone are assigned to the bins that are created for the zone.  

#### Warehouse class

In advanced warehousing, you can assign warehouse class codes to the following entities: 

* Items
* Bins
* Zones

Warehouse classes control where to store items. You can divide a zone into several warehouse classes. For example, you might store items in the receiving zone as frozen, hazardous, or another class.

When you work with warehouse classes and a default receiving/shipping bin, you must manually choose the appropriate bins in the warehouse receipt and shipment lines.  

In inbound flows, the class code is only highlighted on inbound lines where the item class code doesn't match the default receiving bin. If the correct default bins aren't assigned, then the quantity can't be received.  

#### Location

A location is a physical structure or place where inventory is received, stored, and shipped. A location can be a warehouse, service car, showroom, plant, or an area in a plant. Inventory is often organized in bins and zones.

#### First expired first out (FEFO)

If you select the **Pick According to FEFO** checkbox on the **Bin Policies** FastTab on the **Location Card** page, item-tracked items are picked at the location according to their expiration date. Items with the earliest expiration dates are picked first.  

Warehouse activities in all pick and movement documents are sorted according to FEFO, unless the items have serial or lot numbers assigned. If some, but not all, of the quantity on the line has serial or lot numbers assigned, the remaining quantity is sorted according to FEFO.  

When using FEFO, items that expire first are gathered in a temporary item tracking list based on the expiration date. If two items have the same expiration date, the item with the lowest lot or serial number is picked first. If the lot or serial numbers are the same, the item that was registered first is selected first. Standard criteria for selecting items in pick bins, such as Bin Ranking and Break Bulk, are applied to the temporary FEFO item tracking list.  

Learn more at [Enable Picking Items by FEFO](warehouse-picking-by-fefo.md).

#### Put-away template

Put-away templates specify a set of prioritized rules that apply when you create put-aways. For example, a put-away template can require you to place items in a bin with bin content that has the same UOM. If a similar bin with enough capacity can't be found, the item must be placed in an empty bin. You assign a put-away template to an item and a location.

# Exchanging Data Electronically
You can use the Data Exchange Framework to manage the exchange of business documents, bank files, currency exchange rates, and any other data files with your business partners.

In the standard version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the Data Exchange Framework is used in processes such as exchanging electronic documents, importing and exporting bank files, and updating exchange rates for currencies. For more information, see [About the Data Exchange Framework](across-about-the-data-exchange-framework.md).

As an administrator or Microsoft partner, you can use the framework in new integration features by specifying the data to exchange, and how to exchange it. For more information, see [Set Up Data Exchange Definitions](across-how-to-set-up-data-exchange-definitions.md).

The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the topics that describe them.

# Reserve items

You can reserve items for sales orders, purchase orders, service orders, assembly orders, transfer orders, and production orders. You can also reserve items in inventory or inbound on open document or journal lines.

Each line you open to reserve items displays information about one type of line (sales, purchase, or journal) or inventory entry. The lines describe how many items are available to be reserved from each type of line or entry.

> [!TIP]
> Based on the quantities you reserve in inventory, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] displays a status on the documents so that you’re quickly aware of the next step. For example, to indicate that you can ship a sales order or start to work on a project, assembly, or production order. The status also helps reduce the risk of accidental partial shipments or hold-ups due to missing stock for production and assembly orders.
>
> The **Reserved from stock** field can help you understand whether you can ship or pick for a specific order or order line. For lines, the Reserved from stock field is available on FactBoxes. To access the information for the entire order, the field is on the **Statistics** page.

## Reserve items for sales

The following procedure describes how to reserve items from a sales order. The steps are similar for purchase, service, transfer, and assembly orders.
  
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Orders**, then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the sales order.
3. On the **Lines** FastTab, choose the **Reserve** action. The **Reservation** page opens.  
4. Select the line you want to reserve the items from.  
5. Choose one of the following actions.  

    |**Action**|**Description**|
    |------------------|---------------------|  
    |**Auto Reserve**|Automatically reserve items on the **Reservation** page.|  
    |**Reserve from Current Line**|Reserve the items on the selected line.|  
    |**Cancel Reservation from Current Line**|Cancel reservation of the items on the selected line.|

> [!NOTE]  
> If there are item tracking lines for the sales order, the reservation system takes you through a few special steps. Learn more at [To reserve a specific serial or lot number](inventory-how-to-reserve-items.md#reserve-a-specific-serial-or-lot-number).  

## Reserve an item for a production order line

You can reserve items for production orders. You must distinguish between production order lines, meaning the parent item, and production order components.

In the following procedure, a firm planned production order is used.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Firm Planned Prod. Order**, then choose the related link.  
2. Open the firm planned production order you want to reserve parent items for.  
3. Select the relevant production order line.  
4. On the **Lines** FastTab, in the **Functions** group, choose the **Reserve** action.
5. On the **Reservation** page, select the Sales Line, Order Line, then choose the **Reserve from Current Line** action.  

The quantity you entered in the firm planned production order line is now reserved.

## Reserve items for production order components

You can reserve items for production orders. You have to distinguish between production order lines, meaning the parent item, and production order components.

In the following procedure, a firm planned production order is used.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Firm Planned Prod. Order**, then choose the related link.  
2. Open the firm planned production order you want to reserve component items for.  
3. Select the relevant production order line.  
4. On the **Lines** FastTab, choose **Line**, then choose **Components**.  
5. Select the relevant component line.  
6. On the **Lines** FastTab, choose the **Reserve** action.  
7. On the **Reservation** page, select a line, then choose the **Reserve from Current Line** action.  

The quantity you entered in the firm planned production component line is now reserved.

## Reserve items in bulk

Use the **Reservation Worksheet** page to reserve and allocate incoming goods in bulk. For example, bulk reservations can help ensure that quantities are available for your sales and production orders. You can have multiple batches for different purposes. For example, you might allocate production orders on a weekly basis but reserve daily for sales.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Reservation Worksheet**, then choose the related link.  
1. Choose the **Get Demand** action. The **Get Demand to Reserve** page opens.
1. On the **Get Demand to Reserve** page, specify the kind of demand you want to reserve from available inventory.
1. Fill in the filters as necessary. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
1. Optional: To allocate the items right away, choose the **Allocate** action.
1. On the **Allocation Policy** page, choose a policy for each step.

   |Allocation policy  |Description  |
   |---------|---------|
   |Basic (No Conflicts)     | Allocates stock to a demand if there are no conflicts and the demand can be fully covered. For example, you have sales order A with a quantity of 10, and a job with a quantity of 7. If you have 20 in stock, both demands receive full quantity. If your stock is 12, no stock is allocated. You must manually allocate the quantity.        |
   |Equally    | Distributes available stock to demand equally. For example, you have a sales order with a quantity of 10, and a job with a quantity of 7. If your stock level is 20, then both demands receive full quantity. If your stock is 12, both demands get 6.        |
   |By Customer Priority|Distribution based on the **Priority** field on the **Customer Card** page. In cases of low inventory quantities, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supplies higher-priority customers first.|

1. To reserve all lines where **Accept** is turned on, choose the **Make reservation** action.

## Change a reservation

You can change an item reservation.

1. On the document line you made the reservation from, on the **Lines** FastTab, choose the **Reserve** action.  
2. On the **Reservation** page, choose the **Reservation Entries** action.
3. On the **Reservation Entries** page, update the **Quantity** field on the line you want to change.
4. Confirm the subsequent message by choosing the **OK** button.

## Cancel a reservation

You can cancel an item reservation.

1. From the document line you want to cancel a reservation from, on the **Lines** FastTab, choose the **Reserve** action.  
2. On the **Reservation** page, choose the **Reservation Entries** action on the **Lines** FastTab.  
3. On the **Reservation Entries** page, choose the **Cancel Reservation** action.  
4. Confirm the subsequent message by choosing the **Yes** button.  

## Reserve a specific serial or lot number

From outbound documents for item-tracked items, such as sales orders or production component lists, you can reserve specific serial or lot numbers. For example, reserving specific serial or lot numbers can be useful in the following situations:

* You need production components from a specific lot to ensure consistency with earlier production batches.
* Because a customer requested a specific serial number.

Learn more at [Work with Serial and Lot Numbers](inventory-how-work-item-tracking.md).

This practice is referred to as a specific reservation, because you reserve from the quantity of item X that belongs to lot X. In contrast, if you reserve only from quantities of item X, then it's simply a normal, nonspecific, reservation. Learn more at [Design Details - Item Tracking and Reservations](design-details-item-tracking-and-reservations.md).

The following procedure is based on a sales order.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Orders**, and then select the related link.  
2. Create a sales order line for an item-tracked item.  
3. Assign serial and lot numbers to the sales order line. Learn more at [Work with Serial and Lot Numbers](inventory-how-work-item-tracking.md).
4. On the sales order line, choose the **Reserve** action.  
5. Choose the **Yes** button to reserve specific serial or lot numbers.  
6. On the **Item Tracking List** page, select the serial and lot number combination you assigned.  
7. Choose the **OK** button to open the **Reservation** page showing only supply with the specified item tracking number. If the line has nonspecific reservations on any of the item tracking numbers, you're informed of the quantity that is already reserved.  
8. Choose either the **Auto Reserve** or the **Reserve from Current Line** action to create the reservation of the specific item tracking numbers.

# Warnings and error messages

During your work day, you might see notifications in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] that something went wrong, or that it wasn't possible to post something, for example. In many cases, the notification makes it easy to resolve the matter, or to roll back any changes that you made. In other cases, you might not have the information that you need to get unblocked. This article provides tips on how to make progress.  

## In-product user assistance

The default version of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes descriptions for most fields, columns, and actions that can be accessed when you choose the name. In combination with teaching tips for important pages, descriptive captions, and instructional text, these tooltips, or callouts, are our current implementation of *embedded user assistance*, which is an important principle in today's world of software design.  

If you have a question about a field or another element of the user interface, choose the name to read a short description. Choose the **Ask Copilot** link if that isn't enough. You can also use the in-product Help pane to find answers to your questions.  

For more information, see [Dynamics 365 Business Central User Assistance Model](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/user-assistance) in the administration content for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

## Help and Support page

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the Help menu item (the question mark in the top right corner) gives you access to the **Help and Support** page, where you can find links to resources that can help you find answers to your questions. For more information, see [Resources for Help and Support](product-help-and-support.md).  

## Help others

If you're an administrator or superuser, you can help others by looking up error messages in the **Error Message Register** page or in the administration center. In many cases, the warning or error message is about setup or lack of permission and similar issues that the superuser or administrator can easily help with. In other cases, you might have to inspect pages to identify the cause. For more information, see [Finding technical information](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/manage-technical-support#finding-technical-information) in the administration content for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

## Share error details for faster assistance

To overcome obstacles and minimize downtime, apply the expertise of colleagues or subject matter experts. When an error blocks you, you can easily share the error details when you get assistance.

The details include the error message, error code, and other information that's helpful when troubleshooting an error. By sharing the error details, you can effectively communicate the specific issue you're facing, which helps your colleagues help you.  

You can copy details by choosing the **Share icon** in in-line validation dialogs, or the **Share details** menu in error dialogs.  

In addition to copying error details, you can also choose to share details through Microsoft Teams by choosing **Share details to Teams** to do the following:

* Copy the error details.
* Open the **Share to Teams** window, where you can paste the error details you copied and specify who you want to ask for help. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] adds a link to the page where you experienced the error to make troubleshooting easier.

You can also choose to share details by email by choosing **Share details via email** to do the following:

* Copy the error details.
* Open your default email editor, where you can paste the error details you copied and specify who you want to ask for help. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] adds a link to the page where you experienced.

## Help yourself

Error messages provide information and actions that make it easier to understand, go to, and resolve errors that come from the platform.

The error messages that the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] platform generates contain the full technical details, including field names, in the **Detailed error message** section. Select the **Copy details** icon on inline validation errors or in an error message to access the technical information.

Actions on error messages take you directly to the page where a field is causing the error. You don't have to take time to find the page or field yourself. To resolve the error, just choose the action in the error message and [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] takes you to the appropriate location.

The following video shows how to use actionable error messages to get unblocked.

### Tip for developers

If you're a developer, when you call the [TestField](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/methods-auto/record/record-testfield-joker-joker-errorinfo-method) method, but don't pass in the |`ErrorInfo` object, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically generates the link to a page where a user can correct the issue. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] first gets the lookup or drill-down page for the record, and then finds the card page or lookup page and adds a navigation link to that card page. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't add a link in the following situations:

* If the error is on the page that's currently open.
* If the user doesn't have permission to modify the underlying record.

# Configure service management processes

The following are some examples of the settings you can apply to service management processes:  
  
* Some overall settings for various processes, such as warnings, next service calculations for service items, the start-up fee to assess, the fault reporting level to use, and so on.  
* The types of information that technicians enter on service documents. For example, you can require them to specify the type of order, the start and/or end dates for the work, and the type of work that was done.  
* Some default settings for response times and warranties. These include a default response time for starting service, warranty discount percentages for parts and labor, and how long warranties are valid for.  
* Settings for contracts, such as the maximum number of days that you can use for contract service orders, whether to use reason codes when a contract is canceled, standard texts for descriptions, and contract values.  
* The number sequences to use for service-related documents and items.  

## To enter general and mandatory settings

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Management Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  

## Set up service invoice posting policies for users

Companies often have unique processes for invoices and shipments. For example, processes can vary from one person posting everything on a service order to multiple employees, each working with their own pages.

You can use posting policies to restrict users from posting service invoices, or require them to post invoices together with the related service shipment. To set up a posting policy, on the **User Setup** page, in the **Service Invoice Posting Policy** field, choose one of the following options:

* **Allowed** (Default): Keep the current behavior, where you can choose the posting options, such as **Ship**, **Invoice**, and **Ship and Invoice**.
* **Prohibited**: Prevent people from posting service invoices. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] shows a confirmation dialog that only provides the **Ship** option.
* **Mandatory**: Let people post invoices along with service shipments. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] shows a confirmation dialog that only provides the **Ship and Invoice** option.

This setting affects the following documents:

* Service orders
* Warehouse shipments
* Service invoices
* Service credit memos

The following table describes the effects on different documents.

|Document  |Allow<br>Displays a series of options   |Prohibited<br>Conformation dialog  |Mandatory<br>Confirmation dialog  |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|Service order     | * Ship<br>* Invoice<br>* Ship and Invoice<br>* Ship and Consume         |* Ship<br>* Ship and Consume  |Do you want to post the shipment and invoice?         |
|Warehouse Shipment     |* Ship<br>* Ship and Invoice         |Do you want to post the shipment?         | Do you want to post the shipment and invoice?        |
|Service invoice     | Do you want to post the invoice?         | Error: you cannot post.       |Do you want to post the invoice?         |
|Service credit memo     | Do you want to post the credit memo?         | Error: you cannot post.        |Do you want to post the credit memo?         |

> [!NOTE]
> When you post service invoices and credit memos, you don't have any posting options. The documents always post physical and financial transactions together. You can't partially post service invoices and credit memos.

## Send service documents to the right people

Your business probably deals with multiple customer and vendor contacts who are responsible for different areas of operation. For example, accountants, purchasers, and warehouse staff. Because their interests typically differ, you might want to generate and send different types of documents to them. You can save time when you send documents to different customer or vendor contacts by setting up specific contacts to use with specific documents. For example, send service invoices to accountant contacts and service orders to your customers' purchasers.

You can use the **Document Layouts** page to specify who to send service quotes, orders, invoices, and credit memos to for vendors and customers based on settings on the **Report Selection** page. To send specific documents to specific company contacts, choose the company contacts to use for specific document layouts. To learn more about document layouts, go to [Define document layouts for customers and vendors](ui-define-customer-vendor-document-layouts.md).

# Ad-hoc analyses in purchasing

This article explains how to analyze purchasing data from list pages and queries using the **Data Analysis** feature. The feature lets you analyze data directly from the page, without having to run a report or open another application, such as Excel. Data Analysis provides an interactive and versatile way to calculate, summarize, and examine data. Instead of running reports using options and filters, you can add multiple tabs that represent different tasks or views on the data. Some examples are "My vendors," or "Purchasing statistics," or any other view you can imagine. To learn more about how to use the **Data Analysis** feature, go to [Analyze list and query data with analysis mode](analysis-mode.md).

Use the following list pages for ad-hoc analysis of purchase processes:

- [Purchase Orders](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=9307&layout=analysis)
- [Purchase lines](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=518&layout=analysis)
- [Posted Purchase Invoices](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=146&layout=analysis)
- [Vendor Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=29&layout=analysis)
- [General Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=20&layout=analysis)

## Ad-hoc analysis scenarios for purchasing

Use the **Data Analysis** feature for quick fact checking and ad-hoc analysis:

- If you don't want to run a report
- If there isn't a report for your specific needs
- If you want to quickly iterate to get a good overview on a part of your business.

The following sections provide examples of purchasing scenarios in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## Data foundation for ad-hoc analysis on purchasing

When you post a purchase document, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] updates the vendor's account, general ledger (G/L), item ledger entries, and resource ledger entries:

- For each purchase document, a purchase entry is created in the **G/L Entry** table. An entry is also created in the vendor's account in the **Supplier Ledger Entry** table, and a G/L entry is created in the relevant payables account. In addition, posting the purchase might result in a value-added tax (VAT) entry and a G/L entry for the discount amount.

- For each purchase line, as applicable, entries are created in the:
  - **Item Ledger Entry** table, if the purchase line is of the Item type.
  - **G/L Entry** table, if the purchase line is of the G/L Account type.
  - **Resource Ledger Entry** table, if the purchase line is of the Resource type.
- In addition, purchase documents are always recorded in the **Purch. Recpt. Header** and **Purch. Inv. Header** tables.

# Trace item-tracked items

You can see where an item-tracked item was used, including how and when it was received or produced, transferred, sold, consumed, or returned. You can also find all current instances of a specific serial or lot number in the database. You do this by using the Item Tracing and the [Find Entries](ui-find-entries.md) features.  

These features can be useful in quality control when you need to find out which customers received products with a particular lot number or when you need to find out which lot a defective component came from.  

 On the **Item Tracing** page, you can trace forwards and backwards in a sequence of posted inventory transactions for the serial or lot number.  

 On the **Find Entries** page, you can't see the sequence of transactions, but you can see all records of the serial or lot number, both posted entries and open records.  

 The two features can be used in combination by transferring a traced serial or lot number to the **Find Entries** page to finish a complete trace scenario. <!-- For more information, see [Walkthrough: Tracing Serial-Lot Numbers](walkthrough-tracing-serial-lot-numbers.md).   -->

## To trace item-tracked items  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Item Tracing**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  In the filter fields at the top of the page, enter the specific item numbers or a filter on the item numbers that you would like to trace.  
3.  In the **Show Components** field, select whether to also see where the components for the items came from. The following table describes the options.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**No**|Don't show components.|  
    |**Item-tracked Only**|Show only components that have lot or serial numbers.|  
    |**All**|Show all components.|  

4.  In the **Trace Method** field, select the method to use for tracing the item. The following table describes the options.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Usage->Origin**|Trace the item from where it was used to where it came from. For instance, if a manufactured item was sold to a customer, the **Item Tracing** page shows this with the sales shipment line first, which you can then expand to see from which production order it came.|  
    |**Origin->Usage**|Trace the item from where it came into inventory to where it was used. For instance, if a manufactured item was sold to a customer, the **Item Tracing** page shows this with the finished production order first, which you can then expand to see the sale shipment lines where the item was used.|  

5.  Choose the **Trace** action to run the trace.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  Only applied transactions are shown. If you have received the same lot on multiple transactions, the **Item Tracing** page may not show all transactions.   

> [!NOTE]  
>  If additional transaction history under an item tracing line has already been traced by another line above it, then the **Already Traced** check box is selected. To provide a simpler view, such underlying lines are not shown.  
>   
>  To find the item tracing lines where the transaction history has already been traced, choose the **Go to Already Traced** button. The item tracing line in question is selected, and all underlying lines are expanded.  

## To find item-tracked items with Find Entries  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Find Entries**, and then select the related link.  
2. Choose **Search for item references**.
3. In the **Serial No.** and **Lot No.** fields, enter the item tracking numbers that you want to trace.  
4. Choose the **Find** action to find all instances of the serial or lot number in the database.

# Copilot data movement across geographies

Although Copilot in Business Central is available in all geographic areas where Business Central online is available, it requires Microsoft Azure OpenAI Service, which is available only in specific regions.  

Depending on where your environment is hosted, you might need to allow data to move outside of your primary data residency to an Azure OpenAI endpoint located in another geography. You provide consent in the **Copilot & agent capabilities** page. If you don't provide consent, Copilot won't be available to your organization. Learn how to provide consent in [Allow data movement across geographies](enable-ai.md#allow-data-movement-across-geographies).

Individual Copilot features might not be available in all geographies. Learn more about geographic and language availability at [Copilot international availability](https://aka.ms/bapcopilot-intl-report-external). Copilot and generative AI features from non-Microsoft publishers, such as those originating from customizations or AppSource apps you install, each define their own specific Azure OpenAI Service regions. Consult with the extension publisher to understand which regional Azure services are used by the extension.

## How data movement across geographies works

When you use Copilot, your inputs (prompts) and outputs (results), including any personal data, might move outside of your geography to the location where the Azure OpenAI Service endpoint is hosted. We might store prompt and output data for up to 24 hours to monitor for abuse, but we don't look at it unless our automated systems flag it for review. We don't use your data to train, retrain, or improve Azure OpenAI Service foundation models. Learn more at [Abuse Monitoring](/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/abuse-monitoring).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If your Business Central environment is hosted in the EU Data Boundary, we use an Azure OpenAI endpoint in the same boundary. Learn more: [EU Data Boundary countries and datacenter locations](/privacy/eudb/eu-data-boundary-learn#eu-data-boundary-countries-and-datacenter-locations)

The following table describes when and how data can move across geographies for Copilot in Business Central. 

| Azure&nbsp;region&nbsp;where&nbsp;your&nbsp;Business&nbsp;Central environment is hosted | Azure geography where Azure OpenAI Service is hosted |Consent required for data movement across geographies? |How to allow data to move across geographic areas|

# Set up work centers and machine centers

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] distinguishes between three types of capacities that are arranged in a hierarchy where each level contains subordinate levels.  

The top level is the work center group. Work centers are assigned to work center groups. Every work center can only belong to one work center group.

You can assign various machine centers to work centers. A machine center can only belong to one work center.  

The planned capacity of a work center consists of the availability of the corresponding machine centers and the planned availability of the work center. The planned availability of the work center group is, therefore, the sum of all corresponding availabilities of the machine centers and work centers. Availability is stored in calendar entries.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before you set up work or machine centers, you must set up shop calendars. For more information, see [Create Shop Calendars](production-how-to-create-work-center-calendars.md).

## To set up a work center

The following steps describe how to set up a work center. The steps to set up a machine center calendar are similar, except for the **Routing Setup** FastTab.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Work Centers**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
4. In the **Work Center Group Code** field, select the higher-level resource grouping that the work center is organized under, if relevant. Choose the **New** action in the drop-down list.  
5. In the **Alternate Work Center** field, select the work center to use if this work center isn't available or when demand exceeds its capacity. The alternate work center is for information only, and isn't automatically included in planning processes.
6. Select the **Blocked** field if you want to prevent the work center from being used in any processing. This means that output can't be posted for an item that is produced at the work center. For more information, see [Post Production Output](production-how-to-post-output-quantity.md).
7. In the **Direct Unit Cost** field, enter the cost of producing one unit of measure at this work center, excluding any other cost elements. This cost is often referred to as the *direct labor rate*.  
8. In the **Indirect Cost %** field, enter the general operation costs of using the work center as a percentage of the direct unit cost. This percentage amount is added to the direct cost in the calculation of the unit cost.  
9. In the **Overhead Rate** field, enter any nonoperational costs, for example maintenance expenses, of the work center as an absolute amount.  

    The **Unit Cost** field contains the calculated unit cost of producing one unit of measure at this work center, including all cost elements, as follows:  

    Unit Cost = Direct Unit Cost + (Direct Unit Cost x Indirect Cost %) + Overhead Rate.  

10. In the **Unit Cost Calculation** field, define whether the unit cost calculation should be based on the amount of time used or the number of units produced.  
11. Select the **Specific Unit Cost** field if you want to define the work center's unit cost on the routing line where it's being used. This setting might be relevant for operations with capacity costs that are different than what you would normally process at that work center.  
12. In the **Flushing Method** field, select whether manually or automatically calculate and post output at this work center using one of the following methods.

    |Option|Description|
    |------|-----------|
    |**Manual**| Manually post time used, output, and scrap in the output journal or production journal.|
    |**Forward**|Automatically post output when you release the production order.|
    |**Backward**|Automatically post output when you finish the production order.|

    > [!NOTE]
    > If necessary, the flushing method selected here can be overridden for individual operations by changing the setting on routing lines

13. In the **Unit of Measure Code** field, enter the time unit in which this work center's cost calculation and capacity planning are made.
    To be able to constantly monitor consumption, you must first set up a method of measure. The units you enter are basic units. For example, the processing time is measured in hours and minutes.

    > [!NOTE]  
    > If you use Days, remember that one day is 24 hours, and not an eight hour work day.

14. In the **Capacity** field, define whether the work center has more than one machine or person working at the same time. If your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't include the Machine Center functionality, then the value in this field must be **1**.  
15. In the **Efficiency** field, enter the percentage of the expected standard output that this work center actually outputs. If you enter **100**, it means that the work center has an actual output that is the same as the standard output.  
16. Turn on the **Consolidated Calendar** toggle if you're also using machine centers. This setting ensures that calendar entries are rolled up from machine center calendars.  
17. In the **Shop Calendar Code** field, select a shop calendar. For more information, see [Create Shop Calendars](production-how-to-create-work-center-calendars.md).  
18. In the **Queue Time** field, specify a fixed time span that must pass before assigned work can begin at this work center. 

> [!NOTE]
> Use queue times to provide a buffer between the time that a component arrives at a machine or work center and when the operation actually starts. For example, a part is delivered to a machine center at 10:00 but it takes an hour to mount it on the machine so the operation does not start until 11.00. To account for that hour, the queue time would be one hour. The value of the **Queue Time** field on a machine or work center card plus the sum of the values in the **Setup Time**, **Run Time**, **Wait Time**, and **Move Time** fields on the item routing line combine to give the production lead time of the item. This helps provide accurate overall production times.  

## Considerations about capacity

The capacity and efficiency for work and machine centers affect more than just the available capacity. The values also affect the overall production time that consists of the setup time and run time, which are both defined on the routing line.  

When you allocate a routing line to a work or machine center, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates:

- How much capacity is needed.
- How long the operation takes to complete.  

### Run time

To calculate the run time, the system allocates the exact time that is defined in the **Run Time** field of the routing line. Efficiency and capacity don't affect the allocated time. For example, if the run time is defined as 2 hours, then the allocated time is 2 hours, regardless of values in the efficiency and capacity fields in the work center.  

> [!NOTE]
> The capacity that is used in the calculations is defined as the minimal value between the capacity that is defined in the work or machine center and the concurrent capacity that is defined for the routing line. If a work center has a capacity of 100, but the concurrent capacity for the routing line is 2, then *2* will be used in the calculations.

The *duration* of an operation, on the contrary, considers both efficiency and capacity. Duration is calculated as *Run Time / Efficiency / Capacity*. The following list shows a few examples of the calculation of duration for the same run time, which is defined as 2 hours for the routing line:

- Efficiency 80% means you need 2.5 hours instead of two hours  
- Efficiency 200% means you can complete the work in one hour. You can dig the hole twice as fast if you have an excavator that is twice the size of the smaller one  

    You can get the same result if you use two smaller excavators instead of a large one. Use *2* as the capacity and *100%* as the efficiency  

Fractional capacity is tricky. We'll discuss it later in this article. 

### Setup time

Time allocation for the setup time depends on the capacity and is calculated as *Setup Time * Capacity*. For example, if the capacity is set to *2*, your allocated setup time doubles because you must set up two machines for the operation.  

*Duration* of setup time depends on efficiency and is calculated as *Setup Time / Efficiency*. 

- Efficiency 80% means you need 2.5 hours instead of two hours to set up.  
- Efficiency 200% means you can complete setup in 1 hour instead of 2 hours defined in the routing line.  

The fractal capacity is used only in specific cases.

### Work center processing multiple orders simultaneously

Let's use a paint-spraying booth as an example. It has the same setup and run times for each processed lot. But each lot can contain multiple individual orders that are painted simultaneously.  

In this case, the setup time and the concurrent capacity manage the cost allocated to orders. We recommend that you don't use run time in routing lines.  

The allocated setup time for each individual order will be in reverse order of the number of orders (quantities) that are executed simultaneously. Here are some more examples of the calculation of setup time when that is defined as two hours for the routing line:

- If there are two orders, then the concurrent capacity in the routing line should be set to 0.5.

    As a result, the allocated capacity for each is one hour, but the duration for each order remains two hours.
- If there are two orders with a quantity of one and four, respectively, then the concurrent capacity for the routing line of the first order is 0.2, and 0.8 for the second.  

    As a result, the allocated capacity for the first order is 24 min and 96 for the second one. The duration for both orders remains two hours.  

In both cases, the total allocated time for all orders is two hours.


### Efficient resource can dedicate only part of their work date to productive work

> [!NOTE]
> This scenario is not recommended. We recommend that you use efficiency instead. 

One of your work centers represents an experienced worker who works with 100% efficiency on tasks. But they can only spend 50% of their working time on tasks because the rest of the time they solve administrative tasks. While this worker is capable to complete a two hour task in exactly two hours, in average you must wait another two hours while the person is dealing with other assignments.  

The allocated run time is two hours, and the duration is four hours.  

Don't use setup time for such scenarios because [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] only allocates 50% of the time. If the setup time is set to *2*, the allocated setup time is one hour, and the duration is two hours.

### Consolidated calendar

When **Consolidated calendar** field is selected, then the work center has no capacity of its own. Instead, its capacity is equal to the sum of the capacities of all the machine centers that are assigned to the work center.  

> [!NOTE]
> The efficiency of the machine center is converted to the capacity of the work center.

For example, if you have two machine centers with an efficiency of 80 and 70, respectively, the consolidated calendar entry has:

- An efficiency of 100
- A capacity of 1.5
- A total capacity of 12 hours (eight hour shift * 1.5 capacity).

> [!NOTE]
> Use the **Consolidated Calendar** field when you structure your routings to schedule production operations at the machine center level, not the work center level. When you consolidate the calendar, the **Work Center Load** page and reports become an overview of the aggregate load in all machine centers that are assigned to the work center.

### Example - Different machine centers assigned to a work center

It's important to plan which capacities make up the total capacity when you set up machine centers and work centers.

If different machine centers (such as 210 Packing table 1, 310 Painting Cabin...) are assigned to a work center, the consideration of the single capacities of the machine centers is significant because the failure of one machine center can interrupt the entire process. The machine groups can be entered according to their capacity but they aren't included in planning. If you turn off the **Consolidated Calendar** toggle, only the capacity of the work center is assigned in the planning. The machine center capacity is excluded.

If, however, you combine identical machine centers (such as 210 Packing table 1 and 220 Packing table 2) in a work center, you can consider the work center as a sum of the assigned machine centers. Therefore, the work center is listed with zero capacity. If you turn on the **Consolidated Calendar** toggle, the common capacity is assigned to the work center.

If you don't want the capacities of work centers to contribute to the total capacity, specify **0** in the **Efficiency** field.

## To set up a capacity constrained machine or work center

You must set up production resources that you regard as critical and mark them to accept a finite load instead of the default infinite load that other production resources accept. A capacity-constrained resource can be a work center or machine center that's a bottleneck and would like to establish a limited, finite load for.

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't support detailed shop floor control. It plans for a feasible utilization of resources by providing a rough-cut schedule, but doesn't automatically create and maintain detailed schedules based on priorities or optimization rules.

On the **Capacity Constrained Resources** page, you can create a setup to prevent resources from becoming overloaded. The setup can also ensure that capacity isn't left unallocated if it could increase the turn-around time of a production order. In the **Dampener (% of Total Capacity)** field, you can add dampener time to resources to minimize operation splitting. This setting enables the system to schedule load on the last possible day by slightly exceeding the critical load percent. Exceeding the load percent can reduce the number of operations that are split.

When you plan with capacity-constrained resources, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] ensures that resources aren't loaded above their capacity (critical load). It assigns each operation to the nearest available time slot. If the time slot isn't large enough to complete the entire operation, the operation is split into two or more parts in the nearest available time slots.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Capacity Constrained Resources**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action.
3. Fill in the fields as necessary.

> [!NOTE]
> Operations on work centers or machine centers that are set up as constrained resources are always planned serially. This planning means that if a constrained resource has multiple capacities, those capacities must be planned in sequence. You can't plan them in parallel like they would be if the work or machine center wasn't set up as a constrained resource. For a constrained resource, the **Capacity** field on the work center or machine center is greater than **1**.

> In case of operation splitting, the setup time is only assigned one time because it's assumed that some manual adjustment is done to optimize the schedule.

# Set Up Complex Application Areas Using Best Practices
Entering the correct setup values from the start is important to the success of any new business software.  

 Whether you use Rapid Start to implement setup values or you manually enter them in the new company, you can support your setup decisions with some general recommendations for selected setup fields that are known to potentially cause the solution to be inefficient if defined incorrectly.  

 Help in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes best-practice information about how to set up key fields in the following application areas:

# Set up contact sync with Outlook for Business Central on-premises

[!INCLUDE[azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id](~/../shared-content/shared/azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id.md)]

In this article, you learn how to set up [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises to synchronize contacts in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with contacts in Outlook. For more information the feature, go to [Synchronize Contacts in Business Central with Contacts in Microsoft Outlook](admin-synchronize-outlook-contacts.md).

## Introduction

Contact synchronization requires using the OAuth 2.0 protocol for authentication with Exchange Online. Previously, basic authentication was also supported, but it's been deprecated and no longer supported with Exchange Online. You can read more about the deprecation at [Deprecation of Basic authentication in Exchange Online](/exchange/clients-and-mobile-in-exchange-online/deprecation-of-basic-authentication-exchange-online). This change means that contact synchronization in Business Central may have stopped working on your on-premises environment. This article will explain how to get it working again.

## Prerequisites

- Exchange Online, either a standalone version or through Microsoft 365 plan  
- Access to the Microsoft Entra tenant used by Exchange Online
- [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] users have a Microsoft 365 or Exchange Online email account, which is assigned to their accounts in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. You can check this setting in the **Microsoft 365 Authentication** section of user profile in the **Users** list. 

## Set up contact sync

Complete the following steps to set up contact sync. If you're running [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Spring 2019 (v.14), you'll have to do an extra step that either modifies application code or sets up a connection to Power BI.

1. <a name="registerapp"></a>Register an app for Exchange Online API in your Microsoft Entra tenant.

   In this step, you add a registered app in the Microsoft Entra tenant of your Microsoft 365 or Exchange Online plan. Like other Azure services that work with Business Central, Exchange Online requires a registered app in Microsoft Entra ID. The registered app provides authentication and authorization services between Business Central and Exchange Online.

   Follow the detailed instructions in the developer and IT pro help at [Register an application in Microsoft Entra ID](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/register-app-azure#register-an-application-in-azure-active-directory). As you go through the instructions, remember the following points:

   - If you've already registered an application as part of an integration with another Microsoft product, such as Power BI, then reuse that registered app. In this case, you'll just have to set up the app with the Office 365 Exchange Online permissions described in the next bullet.

   - Configure the registered app with the following delegated permissions to the Office 365 Exchange Online API:

     - Contacts.ReadWrite
     - EWS.AccessAsUser.All

2. For [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] version 14, do one of the following tasks:

   - Modify page 6700 by changing `FALSE` to `TRUE` in the following line of code in the `OnPageOpen` trigger:

     ```
     PasswordRequired := AzureADMgt.GetAccessToken(AzureADMgt.GetO365Resource,AzureADMgt.GetO365ResourceName,TRUE) = '';
     ```

   - Create new page with the following code on the OnPageOpen trigger:

     ```
     PasswordRequired := AzureADMgt.GetAccessToken(AzureADMgt.GetO365Resource,AzureADMgt.GetO365ResourceName,TRUE) = '';
     ```

   - Set up Power BI by following the instructions at [Set up Business Central on-premises for Power BI integration](across-working-with-business-central-in-powerbi.md).

   After the solution you choose is in place, ask users to either run the new/modified page or [connect to Power BI](across-working-with-powerbi.md#connect). They'll only need to do this step once.

# Manage and reconcile your bank accounts

A bank reconciliation should be completed at regular intervals for all your bank accounts to ensure that the company's cash records are correct. You do this by comparing and matching entries in your internal bank accounts with bank transactions at your bank, and then posting the balances to your internal bank accounts to make totals available to finance managers. Bank reconciliation is also a practical way to discover and resolve missing payments and bookkeeping errors.

You can perform the task on the **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** page where you match (reconcile) bank statement lines in the left-hand pane with your internal bank account ledger entries in the right-hand pane. Alternatively, you can perform this task on the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page as part of processing the payments that are represented on a bank statement. On both pages, you can fill in the bank statement information by importing a file or feed and you can use automatic matching suggestions.

> [!NOTE]  
> In the North American versions, you can also perform bank reconciliation on the **Bank Rec. Worksheet** page, which is better suited for checks and deposits but does not offer import of bank statement files. To use this page instead of the **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** page, deselect the **Bank Recon. with Auto. Match** field on the **General Ledger Setup** page. For more information, see [Reconcile Bank Accounts](LocalFunctionality/UnitedStates/how-to-reconcile-bank-accounts.md) under United States Local Functionality.

Before you can manage your bank accounts within [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you must set up each bank account as a bank account card. In addition, you must set up electronic services that you may use for bank statement import and payment file export. For more information, see [Setting Up Banking](bank-setup-banking.md).

The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the articles that describe them.

| To | See |
| --- | --- |
| Reconcile bank accounts as a separate task on the **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** page. |[Reconcile Bank Accounts](bank-how-reconcile-bank-accounts-separately.md) |
| Reconcile bank accounts in connection with payment processing on the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page. |[Applying Payments Automatically and Reconciling Bank Accounts](receivables-apply-payments-auto-reconcile-bank-accounts.md) |

> [!TIP]
> Use bank reconciliation to help verify that your books are up-to-date, and do not post the reconciliation until you are satisfied with the reconciliation.

# Displaying Lists in Different Ways
In the right corner of any list in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] you will find icons that let you choose how the list of records is displayed. A list can be displayed as detailed rows, which is ideal when you need to work with many fields or edit fields in the list. But you can also switch to display records as tiles, which is more compact and shows less fields on the specific record. This is very useful to gain an overview of several entries and is in particular useful on smaller devices, because it is compact and easier to tap.

## Item List
On the **Items** page, having pictures helps you get a quick overview of what you sell and switching to the tiles gives you an item catalogue to browse through. For lists that include pictures, such as the **Items** page, you have a third option to display as large tiles. This displays large pictures for each record but also shows few fields.

You can import item pictures, either one by one or for multiple items in one go. For more information, see [Import Multiple Item Pictures](inventory-how-import-item-pictures.md).

# Set up VAT statement templates and VAT statement names

Tax authorities can, and do, change their requirements for posting VAT. VAT Statement templates and VAT statement names can help you prepare for upcoming changes and make a smooth transition to the new requirements. You can use VAT statement templates to set up different Reports when choosing to print the statement. Each VAT Statement Template can have multiple Vat Statement names, which in turn define the calculations, and you can create a new VAT statement name when requirements change. For example, one name might calculate VAT for this year based on the current requirements, and another might calculate VAT based on requirements for next year. Names are also a way to keep a history of VAT statement formats, for example, so that you can look back to see how you calculated VAT in previous years.

## To define a VAT statement

VAT statements let you calculate your VAT settlement amount for a certain period, for example, a quarter.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Statements**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **Name** field, and then choose **New** on the **VAT Statement Names** page.
3. Fill in the required fields. Usually you want to have a setting for each VAT Bus. Posting Group / VAT Prod. Posting Group combination. For Row numbers it does make sense to use equivalent numbers or codes as in your official VAT Statement [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  

> [!Tip]
> You can filter the information that the statement will include, depending on what you choose in the **Type** field. **Account Totaling** is useful when you want the VAT from a specific account.
**VAT Entry Totaling** gets VAT from the accounts assigned to the selections in the **Gen. Posting Type**, **VAT Bus. Posting Group**, and/or the **VAT Prod. Posting Group** fields. **Row Totaling** lets you enter a value or quick filter criteria in the **Row Totaling** field. For more information, see [Searching, filtering, and Sorting Data](ui-enter-criteria-filters.md). **Description** is often used to add a note to the statement. For example, you could use it as a heading when you've used row totaling.

## To preview the VAT statement

After you define a VAT statement, you can preview it to make sure it meets your needs.
> [!Tip]
> It is best practice to have one section in the VAT Statement using **Type** **Vat Entry Totaling** and another section below using **Type** **Account Totaling** to reconcile the amounts based on the **VAT Entry** table compared to the amount on the **G/L Accounts**. You can also use the **G/L - VAT Reconciliation** Report for this purpose.

1. Choose **Preview**.
2. Enter a date filter to limit the statement to a specific period. For more information about how to customize the page to show the date filter, see [Searching, filtering, and Sorting Data](ui-enter-criteria-filters.md).
3. You can select various options to specify the type of VAT entries to include in the statement.
4. On the lines where the **Type** field contains **VAT Entry Totaling** you can see a list of VAT entries by choosing the amount in the **Column Amount** field.
5. You can use personalization to show more fields in the lines. For example the Unrealized Base Amount and Unrealized VAT Amount, if you're using unrealized VAT.

# About inventory costing
Managing inventory costs is concerned with recording and reporting business operating costs. It includes the reporting of manufacturing costs and inventory costs, that is, the value of items.  

 Central principles to understand are that costing methods define how items are valued when they leave inventory, that cost adjustment updates the cost of goods sold with related purchase costs posted after the sale, and that inventory values must be posted to dedicated G/L accounts at regular intervals.  

 The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the articles that describe them.

# Sales Demographics (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2025w1](includes/applies-to-2025w1.md)]

The **Sales Demographics** report provides a comprehensive analysis of sales performance across demographic segments. The report offers valuable insights into customer behavior and preferences that can help you optimize sales strategies.

:::image type="content" source="media/powerbi/sales/sales-demographics.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Sales Demographics report" lightbox="media/powerbi/sales/sales-demographics.png":::

## Use the report

Leadership and management teams use the report to to gain a deeper understanding of sales performance based on demographic factors. This report is helpful for analyzing sales metrics by item category, customer posting group, document type, and geographical location to identify trends and opportunities for growth.

As the CEO of a furniture company, you want to understand how demographic factors including item categories, posting groups or geographical regions impact sales performance.

By analyzing the report, you discover that domestic customers in urban areas account for 60% of your total sales. Also, the report uncovers that one region is underperforming compared to another, despite similar product offerings. Armed with this data, you decide to allocate more marketing budget and strategize a new promotional campaign to increase sales.

As a sales manager, you want to ensure that your team meets its revenue targets. You want to monitor sales performance across different customer segments and make data-driven adjustments to your sales strategy.

Using the report, you might find out that customers in the Corporate customer posting group are contributing significantly more to overall revenue than customers in Retail. Additionally, you might find that sales orders for ergonomic chairs are growing faster than leather office chairs. You use this information to direct your sales team to focus on up-selling ergonomic chairs to corporate clients.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The **Sales Demographics** report includes the following KPIs and measures:

- [Sales Amount](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#sales-amount)
- [Cost Amount](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#cost-amount)
- [Gross Profit](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#gross-profit)
- [Gross Profit Margin](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#gross-profit-margin)
- [No. of Customers](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#no-of-customers)

[!INCLUDE[click-on-a-kpi-link](includes/click-on-a-kpi-link.md)]

[!INCLUDE[powerbi-tip-track-kpis](includes/powerbi-tip-track-kpis.md)]

# Import payroll transactions

To account for salary payments and related transactions, you must import and post financial transactions made by your payroll provider to the general ledger. To do this, you first import a file that you receive from the payroll provider into the **General Journal** page. Then you map the external accounts in the payroll file to the relevant G/L accounts. Lastly, you post the payroll transactions according to the account mapping.

> [!NOTE]  
> To use this functionality, an extension for payroll import must be installed and enabled. The Ceridian Payroll and the Quickbooks Payroll File Import extensions are pre-installed in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For more information, see [Customizing [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Using Extensions](ui-extensions.md).

## To import a payroll file

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. In the relevant general journal batch, choose the **Import Payroll Transactions** action. An assisted setup guide opens.
3. Follow the steps on the **Import Payroll Transactions** page.

    > [!TIP]  
    >   In the step about mapping the external payroll records to your G/L accounts, the mappings that you make will be remembered next time the same records are imported. This will save you time as you do not have to manually fill in the **Account No.** field in the general journal every time you have imported recurring payroll transactions.   

    When you choose the **OK** button in the assisted setup guide, the **General Journal** page is filled with lines representing the transactions that the payroll file contains and with the relevant accounts prefilled in the **G/L Account** fields according to mappings you made in the guide.
4. Edit or post the journal lines as for any other general ledger transactions. For more information, see [Post Transactions Directly to the General Ledger](finance-how-post-transactions-directly.md).

# Set up the Envestnet Yodlee bank feeds service

You can import electronic bank statements from your bank to quickly fill on the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page so you can apply payments and reconcile the bank account. For more information, see [Applying Payments Automatically and Reconciling Bank Accounts](receivables-apply-payments-auto-reconcile-bank-accounts.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Due to the Payment Services Directive in Europe (PSD2), after September 14, 2019, you will no longer be able to automatically import bank statements from banks in the United Kingdom into [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. We are looking into the possibility of offering this feature again in the future.

> [!NOTE]
> The Envestnet Yodlee Bank Feeds service is only supported in the online version of Business Central. This functionality is not supported for on-premises versions of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], or for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] environments hosted on Embed ISV application services. To use this functionality on-premises, you must obtain a co-brand account from Envestnet, and you must add code to integrate with the Yodlee API.
>
> The Envestnet Yodlee Bank Feeds service is only supported in the United States and Canada.
> Only banks residing in these countries/regions are supported, even though banks from other countries/regions may appear in the Envestnet Yodlee Bank Feeds bank selection window in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For technical assistance with the Envestnet Yodlee functionality, contact Microsoft Support. Do not contact Envestnet Yodlee. For more information, see [Configuring Technical Support for Dynamics 365 Business Central](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/technical-support).

The Envestnet Yodlee Bank Feeds service is installed as an extension to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online and is ready to be enabled in the supported countries/regions. For more information, see [Customizing [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Using Extensions](ui-extensions.md).

After you enable the bank feed service, you must link a bank account to the online bank account that the feed will come from. You link bank accounts to online bank accounts in the following different scenarios:

* A bank account doesn't exist in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] for your online bank account. Therefore, you create the bank account by linking from the online bank account.
* A bank account exists in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], which you want to link to an online bank account.
* A linked bank account must be unlinked because you want to stop using the bank feed service for the account.
* Online bank accounts have changed and you want to update the information on bank accounts in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

When the bank feed service is enabled, you can set a bank account up to automatically import new bank statements into the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page every two hours. Transactions for payments that have already been posted as applied and/or reconciled on the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page won't be imported. For more information, see the “To enable automatic import of bank statements” section.

> [!NOTE]  
> If you use the Set Up Company assisted setup guide, some of the steps in the following procedures happen automatically when you get to the company bank account setup. For more information, see [Getting Ready for Doing Business](ui-get-ready-business.md).

## To enable the bank feed service

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Bank Accounts**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the bank account that you'll use for the bank feed service.
3. On the **Bank Account Card** page, in the **Bank Statement Import Format** field, select YODLEEBANKFEED.  

The bank feed service is enabled when you link a bank account to its related online bank account. See the next procedure.  

> [!NOTE]
> If you use the **Company Setup** assisted setup guide, then you enable the service by selecting the **Use a bank feed service** check box. For more information, see [Creating New Companies in Business Central](about-new-company.md).

## To create a new linked bank account

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Bank Accounts**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the relevant bank account, and then choose the **Create New Linked Bank Account**. The **Bank Account Linking** page opens after a few moments.

    > [!NOTE]  
    > This page shows the actual web page of the Envestnet Yodlee Bank Feeds service. Terminology and functionality on the page may not match instructions provided in this topic.  
3. On the **Online Bank Account Linking** page, in the **Link Account** pane, use the Search function to find the bank where you have one or more online bank accounts.
4. Choose the bank name. The **Log In** pane opens.
5. Enter the username and password that you use to sign in to the online bank, and then choose the **Next** button.  
6. The bank feed service prepares to link the first online bank account at the specified bank to a new bank account in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

    > [!NOTE]  
    > If you have more than one online bank account at the bank, you must create additional bank accounts in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] for them. See steps 8 through 10.  

    After the process completes, the bank name will appear in the **My Accounts** pane on the **Linked** tab. The number in brackets indicates how many online bank accounts were linked.  
7. Choose the **OK** button.

    If you're only linking one online bank account, the **Bank Account Card** page opens and displays the name of the online bank account. In this case, the bank account linking task is completed. All that's left to do is to set up the bank account. For more information, see [Set Up Bank Accounts](bank-how-setup-bank-accounts.md).

    If you're linking more than one online bank accounts, the **Bank Account Linking** page opens and lists the online bank accounts that aren't yet linked to bank accounts in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. In that case, follow the next step.  
8. On the **Bank Account Linking** page, select the line for an online bank account, and then choose the **Link to New Bank Account** action.  

    The **Bank Account Card** page for a new bank account opens and displays the name of the online bank account.

    If a bank account already exists in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] that you want to link the additional online bank account to, follow the next step.  
9. On the **Bank Account Linking** page, select the line for an online bank account, and then choose the **Link to Existing Bank Account** action.
10. On the **Bank Account List** page, select the bank account that you want to link to, and then choose the **OK** button.

2. Select the line for a bank account that isn't linked to an online bank account, and then choose the **Link to Online Bank Account** action. The **Online Bank Account Linking** page opens with the name of the bank prefilled in the **Link Account** pane.
3. Choose the bank name. The **Log In** pane opens.
4. Enter the username and password that you use to sign in to the online bank, and then choose the **Next** button.  

    The bank feed service prepares to link your bank account in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to the related online bank account.  

    When the process has completed successfully, the bank name will appear in the **My Accounts** pane on the **Linked** tab. If the bank has more than one bank account, only the bank account that you selected in step 2 is linked.  
5. Choose the **OK** button.

On the **Bank Account List** page, the **Linked** check box is selected.

## To edit the credentials for an online bank account

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Bank Accounts**, and then choose the related link.

title: Data ownership models for synchronization
description: Companies are both a legal and business constructs, and they are used to secure and visualize business data.
author: brentholtorf
ms.topic: article
ms.devlang: al
ms.search.keywords: CDS, Dataverse, integration, sync

# Data ownership models for synchronization

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] requires that you specify an owner for the data you store. For more information, see [Types of tables](/powerapps/maker/data-platform/types-of-entities) in the Power Apps documentation. When you set up integration between [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] you must choose the **User or team** ownership for records that are synchronized. Actions that can be performed on these records can be controlled on a user level. <!--We recommend the Team ownership model because it makes it easier to manage ownership for multiple people.NO LONGER TRUE IN DATAVERSE-->

## Team Ownership
In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], a company is a legal and business table that offers ways to secure and visualize business data. Users always work in the context of a company. The closest that [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] comes to this concept is the business unit table, which does not have legal or business implications.

Because business units lack legal and business implications, you cannot force a one-to-one (1:1) mapping to synchronize data between a company and a business unit, either one-way or bi-directional. To make synchronization possible, when you enable synchronization for a company in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the following happens in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)]:

* We create a company table that is equivalent to the company table in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The name of the company is suffixed with "BC Company ID." For example, Cronus International Ltd. (93555b1a-af3e-ea11-bb35-000d3a492db1).
* We create a default business unit that has the same name as the company. For example, Cronus International Ltd. (93555b1a-af3e-ea11-bb35-000d3a492db1).
* We create separate owner team with the same name as the company and associate it with the business unit. The name of the team is prefixed with "BCI -." For example, BCI - Cronus International Ltd. (93555b1a-af3e-ea11-bb35-000d3a492db1).
* Records that are created and synchronized to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] are assigned to the "BCI Owner" team that is linked to the business unit.

> [!NOTE]
> If you rename a company in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the names of the company, business, and team that we create automatically in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] are not updated. Because only the company ID is used for integration, this does not affect synchronization. If you want the names to match you must update the company, business unit, and team in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)].

The following image shows an example of this data setup in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)].

![The root business unit is on top, the teams are in the center, and then the companies are at the bottom.](media/cds_bu_team_company.png)

In this configuration, records that are related to the Cronus US company will be owned by a team that is linked to the Cronus US business unit in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)]. Users who can access that business unit through a security role that is set to business unit–level visibility in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] can now see those records. The following example shows how to use teams to provide access to those records.

* The Sales Manager role is assigned to members of the Cronus US Sales team.
* Users who have the Sales Manager role can access account records for members of the same business unit.
* The Cronus US Sales team is linked to the Cronus US business unit that was mentioned earlier. Members of the Cronus US Sales team can see any account that is owned by the Cronus US user, which would have come from the Cronus US company table in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

However, the 1:1 mapping between business unit, company, and team is just a starting point, as shown in the following image.

![The security role controls data visibility.](media/cds_bu_team_company_2.png)

In this example, a new EUR (Europe) root business unit is created in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] as the parent for both Cronus DE (Gernamy) and Cronus ES (Spain). The EUR business unit is not related to synchronization. However, it can give members of the EUR Sales team access to account data in both Cronus DE and Cronus ES by setting the data visibility to **Parent/Child BU** on the associated security role in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)].

Synchronization determines which team should own records. This is controlled by the **Default owning team** field on the BCI row. When a BCI record is enabled for synchronization we automatically create the associated business unit and owner team (if it doesn't already exist), and set the **Default owning team** field. When synchronization is enabled for an table, administrators can change the owning team, but a team must always be assigned.

> [!NOTE]
> Records become read-only after a company is added and saved, so be sure to choose the correct company.

## Choosing a different business unit
You can change the business unit selection if you are using the Teams ownership model. If you use the Person ownership model, the default business unit is always selected. 

If you choose another business unit, for example, one that you created earlier in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)], it will keep its original name. That is, it will not be suffixed with the company ID. We will create a team that does use the naming convention.

When changing a business unit, you can choose only the business units that are one level below the root business unit.

## Person Ownership
If you choose the Person ownership model you must specify each salesperson who will own new records. The business unit and team are created as described in the [Team Ownership](admin-cds-company-concept.md#team-ownership) section.

The default business unit is used when the Person ownership model is chosen, and you cannot choose another business unit. The team that is associated with the default business unit will own records for common tables, such as the Product table, that are not related to specific salespersons.

When you couple salespersons in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to users in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)], [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will add the user to the default team in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)]. You can verify that users are added by looking at the **Default Team Member** column on the **Users - Common Data Service** page. If the user is not added, you can add them manually by using the **Add Coupled Users to Team** action. For more information, see [Synchronizing Data in Business Central with Dataverse](admin-synchronizing-business-central-and-sales.md).

# Purchases Overview (Power BI report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Purchases Overview** report gives a clear picture of your purchasing activities. It highlights important metrics such as

- Total purchase amounts
- Outstanding liabilities
- Invoiced purchases

The report breaks down purchase quantities by location and item category, and provides vendor information to help with financial analysis, budget management, and compliance.

:::image type="content" source="media/purchases/purchases-overview.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Purchases Overview Power BI report" lightbox="media/purchases/purchases-overview.png":::

## Use the report

The report helps leadership and management teams track actual spending on purchasing activities, manage budgets, and evaluate vendor performance.

CEOs can use the report to keep track of purchasing activities. This report gives a clear picture of your total purchase amount, outstanding liabilities, and invoiced purchases. By analyzing purchase quantities by location and item category, and reviewing vendor information, you can gain valuable insights into your financial performance. With this information, you can make informed decisions about budget management and vendor relationships.

Purchasing managers can identify where you might be overspending or underspending. For example, you might notice that your organization spent a lot on a specific item category, but the quantity of purchases was lower than expected. You might review vendor contracts, find alternative vendors with better prices, or negotiate better terms with existing vendors. By taking these actions, you can optimize purchasing activities, reduce costs, and comply with the overall budget.


## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The *Purchases Overview* report includes the following KPIs and measures: 

- [**Purchase Amount**](purchases-powerbi-kpis.md#purchase-amount)
- [**Outstanding Amount (excluding VAT)**](purchases-powerbi-kpis.md#outstanding-amount-excl-vat)
- [**Amount Received but Not Invoiced (excluding VAT)**](purchases-powerbi-kpis.md#amt-rcd-not-invd-excl-vat)
- [**Invoiced Amount**](purchases-powerbi-kpis.md#invoiced-amount)
- [**Purchase Quantity**](purchases-powerbi-kpis.md#purchase-quantity)
- [**No. of Outstanding Purchase Orders**](purchases-powerbi-kpis.md#no-of-outstanding-purchase-orders)
- [**No. of Received Not Invd. Purchase Orders**](purchases-powerbi-kpis.md#no-of-received-not-invd-purchase-orders)
- [**No. of Purchase Invoices**](purchases-powerbi-kpis.md#no-of-purchase-invoices)

# The Sales and Inventory Forecast extension

Inventory management is a trade-off between customer service and managing your cost. On one hand, a low inventory requires less working capital, but, on the other hand, stock-outs potentially lead to missed sales. The Sales and Inventory Forecast extension predicts potential sales using historical data and gives a clear overview of expected stock-outs. Based on the forecast, the extension helps create replenishment requests to your vendors and saves you time.  

## Setting up forecasting

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the connection to [Azure AI](https://azure.microsoft.com/overview/ai-platform/) is already set up for you. But you can configure the forecast to use a different type of period to report by, such as changing from forecasting by month to forecasting by quarter. You can also choose the number of periods to calculate the forecast by, depending on how granular you want the forecast to be. We suggest that you forecast by month and with a 12 month horizon for the forecast.

> [!TIP]  
> Consider the length of the periods that the service will use in its calculations. The more data you provide, the more accurate the predictions will be. Also, watch out for large variances in periods. They will also impact predictions. If Azure AI does not find enough data, or the data varies a lot, the service will not make a prediction.

## Use the forecasts

The extension uses Azure AI to predict future sales based on your sales history to help you avoid inventory shortage. For example, when you choose an item on the **Items** page, the chart in the **Item Forecast** pane shows the estimated sales of this item in the coming period. This way you can see if you're likely to run out of stock of the item soon.  

You can also use the extension to suggest when to stock up on inventory. For example, you might create a purchase order for Fabrikam to buy their new desk chair. The Sales and Inventory Forecast extension might suggest that you also restock on the LONDON swivel chair that you usually buy from this vendor. The extension can forecast that you'll soon run out of stock of the LONDON swivel chair, so you might order more chairs already now.  

## Design details

Subscriptions for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] come with access to several predictive web services in all regions where [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is available. For more information, see the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central Licensing Guide. The guide is available for download on the [Business Central](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/en-us/business-central/overview/) website.

These web services are stateless, meaning they use data only to calculate predictions on demand. They don't store data.

> [!NOTE]  
> You can also use your own predictive web service instead of ours. For more information, see [Create and use your own predictive web service for sales and inventory forecasts](#AnchorText). 

### Data required for forecast

To make predictions about future sales, the web service requires quantitative data about past sales. That data comes from the **Posting Date**, **Item No**, and **Quantity** fields on the **Item Ledger Entries** page, where:

- The entry type is "Sale."
- The posting date is between the date that is calculated based on the values in the **Historical Periods** and **Period Type** fields on the **Sales and Inventory Forecast Setup** page and the work date.

Before is uses the web service, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] compresses transactions by **Item No.** and **Posting Date** based on the value in the **Period Type** field in the **Sales and Inventory Forecast Setup** page.

## <a name="AnchorText"> </a>Create and use your own predictive web service for sales and inventory forecasts

For [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, the model is published by Microsoft and connected to the Microsoft subscription. For other deployment options, you must create Machine Learning resources in your own Azure subscription. You can find sample steps in the [sample repo](https://github.com/microsoft/BCTech/tree/master/samples/MachineLearning). The purpose of this task is to get the API URI and API key.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales and Inventory Forecast Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Expand the **General** FastTab, and then fill in the API URL and API key fields.

> [!NOTE]
> You can always switch back to resources managed by Microsoft by removing values from API URL and API Key fields.  

## Limitations of the Sales and Inventory Forecast extension

The Sales and Inventory Forecast extension produces aggregated forecast for all locations and variants. If you have multiple locations, for example, that represent different stores, you can't get a forecast for each location. You must distribute amounts afterwards.

Regarding throughput, we estimate that [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can process approximately 50000 items in 12 hours, which is defined as the *Max Execution Timeout*. The exact number depends on the data and settings for extensions. For more information about report limits in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and how they're configured in the online service, see [Report limits in Business Central](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/operational-limits-online#Reports).

The Sales and Inventory Forecast extension doesn't support filtering, means you can't split items into separate batches.

# Set Up Service Contracts
Before you can work with contracts, you must set up the following: 

* **Service contract groups**, which gather service contracts that are related in some way.
* **Service contract account groups**, which are used to group the service contract accounts together for service invoices created for service contracts. You assign these groups to service contracts.  
* **Contract templates** that define contract layouts of contracts that include the most commonly used service contract details. When you create service contract quotes, you can create them by using templates. When you create a contract quote, the fields automatically contain the contents of the template fields.
* **Customer templates** that let you create quotes for contacts or potential customers who are not registered as customers in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

## To set up a service contract group  
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Contract Groups**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

# Use item charges to account for extra trade costs

To ensure correct valuation, your inventory items must carry any added costs, such as freight, physical handling, insurance, and transportation that you incur when purchasing or selling the items. For purchases, the landed cost of a purchased item consists of the vendor's purchase price and all other direct item charges that can be assigned to individual receipts or return shipments. For sales, knowing the cost of shipping sold items can be as vital to your company as knowing the landed cost of purchased items.

In addition to recording the added cost in your inventory value, you can use item charges for the following tasks:

* Identify the landed cost of an item for making more accurate decisions on how to optimize the distribution network.
* Break down the unit cost or unit price of an item for analysis purposes.
* Include purchase allowances into the unit cost and sales allowances into the unit price.

Before you can assign item charges, you must set up item charge numbers for the different types of item charges. The numbers include to which G/L accounts to post costs related to sales, purchases, and inventory adjustments. An item charge number contains a combination of general product posting group, tax group code, VAT product posting group, and item charge. When you enter the item charge number on a purchase or sales document, the G/L account is retrieved. The account retrieved is selected based on the setup of the item charge number and the information on the document.

For both purchase and sales documents, you can assign an item charge in two ways:

* On the document that lists the items that the item charge relates to. Typically, you use this method for documents that aren't yet fully posted.
* On a separate invoice by linking the item charge to a posted receipt or shipment where the items that the item charge relates to are listed.

> [!NOTE]  
> You can assign item charges to orders, invoices, and credit memos, for both sales and purchases. The following procedures describe how to work with item charges for a purchase invoice. The steps are similar for all other purchase and sales documents.

## Example

This video shows how to handle an extra shipping cost as part of inventory costing.

> [!Video https://learn-video.azurefd.net/vod/player?id=35aa5336-39c8-46a2-b8eb-9ac925a17802]

## To set up item charge numbers

You use item charge numbers to distinguish between the different kinds of item charges.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Item Charges**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Item Charges** page, choose the **New** action to create a new line.
3. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

## To assign an item charge directly to the purchase invoice for the item

If you know the item charge when you post a purchase invoice for the item, follow this procedure.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Invoices**, and then choose the related link.
2. Create a new purchase invoice. For more information, see [Record Purchases](purchasing-how-record-purchases.md).
3. Make sure the purchase invoice has one or more lines of type Item.
4. On a new line, in the **Type** field, select **Charge (Item)**.
5. In the **Quantity** field, enter the units of the item charge that you're invoiced for.
6. In the **Direct Unit Cost** field, enter the amount of the item charge.
7. Fill in the remaining fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

    Do the following steps to perform the actual assignment. Until the item charge is fully assigned, the value in the **Qty. to Assign** field is in red font.
8. On the **Lines** tab, choose the **Item Charge Assignment** action.

    The **Item Charge Assignment** page opens showing one line for each line of type Item on the purchase invoice. To assign the item charge to one or more invoice lines, you can use a function that assigns and distributes it for you or you can manually fill in the **Qty. to Assign** field. The following steps describe how to use the Suggest Item Charge Assignment function.

9. On the **Item Charge Assignment** page, choose the **Suggest Item Charge Assignment** action.
10. If there are more than one invoice lines of type Item, choose one of the four distribution options.  

If the item charge is fully assigned, the value in the **Qty. to Assign** field on the purchase invoice is zero.

The item charge is now assigned to the purchase invoice. When you post the receipt of the purchase invoice, the items' inventory values are updated with the cost of the item charge.  

## To assign an item charge from a separate invoice to the purchase invoice for the item

If you received an invoice for the item charge after you posted the original purchase receipt, follow this procedure.

1. Repeat steps 1 through 8 in [To assign an item charge directly to the purchase invoice for the item](payables-how-assign-item-charges.md#to-assign-an-item-charge-directly-to-the-purchase-invoice-for-the-item).
2. On the **Item Charge Assignment** page, choose the **Get Receipt Lines** action.
3. On the **Purch. Receipt Lines** page, select the posted purchase receipt for the item that you want to assign the item charge to, and then choose the **OK** button.
4. Choose the **Suggest Item Charge Assignment** action.

The item charge on the separate purchase invoice is now assigned to the item on the posted purchase receipt. The item's inventory value updates with the cost of the item charge.

## Handle item charges for partial receipts

Let's explore an example of how to handle item charges for a partial receipt.

You have a purchase order with three lines:

* Two lines are for items.
* One line captures item charges allocated across the items by amount.

When the items are delivered, you find that one of the items is missing, so you can't mark that line as received. You can receive and post the purchase invoice for the second item only, and deal with the missing item later.

To handle the item cost for the partial receipt, on the **Item Charge Assignment** page, enter **0** in the **Quantity to Handle** field on the line for the missing item. Then, copy the value from the **Item Charge Qty. to Handle** field to the **Quantity to Invoice** field on the purchase order lines.

When you're ready to handle the item that was missing, update the **Quantity to Handle** field and post the order.

# Design details: planning parameters

This article describes the planning parameters that you can use in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

How the planning system controls item supply is determined by various settings on the **Item Card**, **SKU**, and **Manufacturing Setup** pages. The following table explains how planning uses these settings.  

|Purpose|Settings|
|-------------|---------------|
|Define whether the item is planned|Reordering Policy = Blank|
|Define when to reorder|Time Bucket<br /><br /> Reorder Point<br /><br /> Safety Lead Time|
|Define how much to reorder|Safety Stock Quantity<br /><br /> Reordering Policy:<br /><br /> - Fixed Reorder Qty. plus Reorder Quantity<br />-   Maximum Qty. plus Maximum Inventory<br />- Order<br />- Lot-for-Lot|
|Optimize when and how much to reorder|Rescheduling Period<br /><br /> Lot Accumulation Period<br /><br /> Dampener Period|
|Modify the supply orders|Minimum Order Quantity<br /><br /> Maximum Order Quantity<br /><br /> Order Multiple|
|Delimit the planned item|Manufacturing Policy:<br /><br /> - Make-to-Stock<br />- Make-to-Order|

## Define whether the item is planned  

To include an item or SKU in the planning process, you must assign it a reordering policy. Otherwise, it must be planned manually, for example, by using the **Order Planning** page.  

## Define when to reorder  

Reorder proposals are typically released only when the projected available quantity is equal to or below a given quantity. The reorder point defines the quantity. Otherwise, it's zero. Zero can be adjusted by entering a safety stock quantity. If you define a safety lead time, the proposal is delivered in the period before the required due date.  

The **Time Bucket** field is used by reorder point policies (**Fixed Reorder Qty.** and **Maximum Qty.**). The inventory level is checked after each time bucket. The first time bucket begins on the planning start date.  

> [!NOTE]  
> When planning calculates time buckets, it ignores working calendars that are defined in the **Base Calendar Code** field on the **Company Information** and **Location Card** pages.  

On the **Manufacturing Setup** page, you should set the default safety lead time to at least one day. The due date of the demand might be known, but not the due time. The planning schedules backward to meet gross demand. If you don't define a safety lead time, the goods might arrive too late to meet the demand.  

The **Rescheduling Period**, **Lot Accumulation Period**, and **Dampener Period** fields also play a role in defining when to reorder. To learn more, go to [Optimize When and How Much to Reorder](design-details-planning-parameters.md#optimize-when-and-how-much-to-reorder).  

## Define how much to reorder

If the planning system detects the need to reorder, the reordering policy determines when, and how much, to order.  

Independent of the reordering policy, the planning system usually follows this logic:  

1. Calculate the quantity of the order proposal to meet the minimum inventory level of the item, usually the safety stock quantity. If nothing is specified, the minimum inventory level is zero.  
2. If the projected available inventory is below the safety stock quantity, a backward-scheduled supply order is suggested. The order quantity refills the safety stock quantity. Gross demand can increase it within the time bucket according to the reordering policy and the order modifiers.  
3. If the projected inventory is on or below the reorder point (calculated from aggregated changes within the time bucket) and above the safety stock quantity, a forward-scheduled exception order is suggested. Both the gross demand to be met and the reordering policy determine the order quantity. At a minimum, the order quantity meets the reorder point.  
4. If more gross demand is due before the ending date of the forward-scheduled order proposal, and this demand brings the currently projected available inventory below the safety stock quantity, the order quantity is increased to make up the deficit. The suggested supply order is then scheduled backward from the due date of the gross demand that exceeded the safety stock quantity.  
5. If the **Time Bucket** field isn't filled in, only the gross demand on the same due date is added.  

### Reordering policies  

The reordering policies in the following table affect the reorder quantity. To learn more about reordering policies, go to [Design Details: Handling Reordering Policies](design-details-handling-reordering-policies.md).  

|Reordering policy|Description|  
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------|  
|**Fixed Reorder Qty.**|At a minimum, the order quantity is equal to the reorder quantity. You can increase the quantity to meet the demand or the desired inventory level. This reordering policy is often used with a reorder point.|  
|**Maximum Qty.**|The order quantity is calculated to meet the maximum inventory. If quantity modifiers are used, then maximum inventory can be violated. We don't recommend that you use the time bucket together with maximum quantity. The time bucket is often overruled. This reordering policy is often used with a reorder point.|  
|**Order**|The order quantity is calculated to meet each single demand event, and the demand-supply set remains linked until execution. No planning parameters are considered.|  
|**Lot-for-Lot**|The quantity is calculated to meet the sum of the demand that becomes due in the time bucket.|  

## Optimize when and how much to reorder  

A planner can fine-tune planning parameters to limit rescheduling suggestions, accumulate demand (dynamic reorder quantity), or to avoid insignificant planning actions. The following fields help optimize when and how much to reorder.  

|Field|Description|  
|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
|**Rescheduling Period**|This field determines whether the action message should reschedule an existing order or cancel it and create a new order. The existing order will be rescheduled within one rescheduling period before the current supply and until one rescheduling period after the current supply.<br><br>**Note:** This parameter only works with the **Lot-for-Lot** reordering policy.|  
|**Lot Accumulation Period**|With the reordering policy Lot-for-Lot, this field is used to accumulate multiple supply needs into one supply order. From the first planned supply, the system accumulates all supply needs in the following lot accumulation period into one supply, which is placed on the date of the first supply. Demand outside the lot accumulation period isn't covered by this supply.|  
|**Dampener Period**|This field is used to avoid minor rescheduling of existing supply out in time. Changes from the supply date until one dampener period from the supply date don't generate action messages.<br /><br /> The dampener period specifies a period of time during which you don't want the planning system to propose to reschedule existing supply orders forward. This setting limits the number of insignificant rescheduling of existing supply to a later date if the rescheduled date is within the dampener period.<br /><br /> As a result, a positive delta between the suggested new supply date and the original supply date is always larger than the dampener period.|  

> [!NOTE]
> With the reordering policy Lot-for-Lot, the value of the **Lot Accumulation Period** field must be equal to or larger than the value of the **Dampener Period** field. Otherwise, the dampener period is reduced during the planning routine to match the lot accumulation period.  

The timing of rescheduling period, dampener period, and lot accumulation period is based on a supply date. The time bucket is based on the planning start date, as shown in the following illustration.  

:::image type="content" source="media/supply_planning_5_time_bucket_elements.png" alt-text="Time bucket elements.":::

In the following examples, the black arrows represent existing supply (up) and demand (down). Red, green, and orange arrows are planning suggestions.  

**Example 1**: The changed date is outside the rescheduling period, which causes the existing supply to be canceled. A new supply is suggested to cover the demand in the lot accumulation period.  

:::image type="content" source="media/supply_planning_5_recheduling_period_lot_accumulation_period.png" alt-text="Rescheduling and lot accumulation periods.":::

**Example 2**: The changed date is in the rescheduling period, which causes the existing supply to be rescheduled. A new supply is suggested to cover the demand outside the lot accumulation period.  

:::image type="content" source="media/supply_planning_5_recheduling_period_lot_accum_period_reschedule.png" alt-text="Rescheduling period, lot accumulation period, and reschedule.":::

**Example 3**: There's a demand in the dampener period and the supply quantity in the lot accumulation period matches the supply quantity. The next demand is uncovered and a new supply is suggested.  

:::image type="content" source="media/supply_planning_5_dampener_period_lot_accumulation_period.png" alt-text="Dampener period and lot accumulation period.":::

**Example 4**: There's a demand in the dampener period and the supply remains on the same date. However, the current supply quantity doesn't cover the demand in the lot accumulation period. A change quantity action for the existing supply order is suggested.  

:::image type="content" source="media/supply_planning_5_dampener_period_lot_accum_period_change_qty.png" alt-text="Dampener period, lot accumulation period, and change quantity.":::

**Default values:** The default value of the **Time Bucket** field and the three reorder period fields is blank. For all fields, except the **Dampener Period** field, this means 0D (zero days). If the **Dampener Period** field is blank, the global value in the **Default Dampener Period** field on the **Manufacturing Setup** page is used.  

## Modify the supply orders  

When the quantity of the order proposal is calculated, one or more of the order modifiers can adjust it. For example, the maximum order quantity is larger than or equal to the minimum order quantity, which is larger than or equal to the order multiple.  

The quantity is decreased if it exceeds the maximum order quantity. Then, it increases if it's below the minimum order quantity. Finally, it rounds up so that it matches a specified order multiple. Any remaining quantity uses the same adjustments until the total demand is converted to order proposals.  

## Delimit the item  

The **Manufacturing Policy** field on the **Item Card** page defines which other orders the MRP calculation proposes.  

If the **Make-to-Stock** option is used, the orders concern only the item.  

If the **Make-to-Order** option is used, the planning system analyzes the production BOM of the item and creates linked order proposals for those lower-level items that are also defined as make-to-order. This pattern continues as long as there are make-to-order items in the descending BOM structures.

## Use low-level codes to manage derived demand

Use low-level codes to make derived demand for components progress through to the lower levels of the BOM. To learn more about low-level codes, go to [Item Priority / Low-Level Code](design-details-central-concepts-of-the-planning-system.md#item-priority--low-level-code).

You can assign a low-level code to each part in the product structure or the indented BOM. The top final assembly level is denoted as level 0 - the end item. The higher the low-level code number, the lower the item is in the hierarchy. For example, end items have low-level code 0, and the item parts that go into the assembly of the end item have low-level codes 1, 2, 3, and so on. The result is the planning of component parts coordinated with the requirements of all higher-level part numbers. When you calculate a plan, the BOM is exploded in the planning worksheet, and the gross requirements for level 0 are passed down the planning levels as gross requirements for the next planning level.

On the **Manufacturing Setup** page, use the **Dynamic Low-Level Code** toggle to specify whether to immediately assign and calculate low-level codes for each component in the product structure. If you have large amounts of data, this function can have negative effects on the program's performance, for example during automatic cost adjustment. This function isn't retroactive, so it's a good idea to consider the use of this feature beforehand.

As an alternative to the automatic calculation that occurs dynamically if the field is selected, you can run the **Calculate Low-Level Code** batch job from the **Manufacturing** menu by clicking **Product Design**, **Calculate Low-Level Code**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you don't turn on the **Dynamic Low-Level Code** toggle, you must run the **Calculate Low-Level Code** batch job before you calculate a supply plan (the **Calculate Plan** batch job).  

> [!NOTE]
> Although you turn on the **Dynamic Low-Level Code** field selected, the low-level codes of component items aren't changed dynamically if a parent BOM is deleted or set to noncertified. This case might make it difficult to add new items to the end of the product structure because it might exceed the maximum number of low-level codes. Therefore, for large product structures that reach the low-level code limit, you can run the **Calculate Low Level Code** batch job frequently to maintain the structure.

# Privacy Notices Status in [!INCLUDE[prod_long](includes/prod_long.md)]

This article discusses what a privacy notice is and explains the purpose of the **Privacy Notices Status** page in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. You'll also learn how administrators can use this page.

## Privacy notice

A privacy notice states the data collection, data processing, and data privacy policies followed by the organizations's data controller. It's a document that describes what data is collected and for what purposes, how the user's data is processed, how it's being stored, and who to contact if a user wants to ask something about their data. 

## Privacy Notices Status page

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], if users want to integrate their data with Microsoft Exchange, Microsoft OneDrive, and Microsoft Teams, they must accept the privacy notice for each entity. Or an admin can approve the privacy notices on their behalf. Admins can see the status of privacy notices on the **Privacy Notices Status** page. You can find the **Privacy Notices Status** page in the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] by typing the name of the page in the search bar.  

On that page, you'll find a table with approval options for each of the services mentioned above. 

| Column | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- | 
| **Integration Name** | Name of the service, such as Microsoft OneDrive. |
| **Agree for All** | An admin approves the privacy notice for all users. |
| **Disagree for All** | An admin does not approve the privacy notice for all users. |
| **Let User Decide** | Users decide to approve the privacy notice for the service or not. |

> [!NOTE]
> You can only view the status of privacy notices on the main **Privacy Notices Status** page. To edit the responses, go to **Edit List** on the action bar of the page where options are now clickable and not greyed out.

## Privacy Notice Approvals

Admins can see individual approvals and manage them on the **Privacy Notice Approvals** subpage. Go to the *Action* bar of the **Privacy Notices Action** page, under *Actions*, to find the *Show individual approvals* option. This option goes to the **Privacy Notice Approvals** page.<br>

On that page, you'll find a table with approval options. 

| Column | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- | 
| **Integration Name** | Name of the service, such as Microsoft OneDrive. |
| **User Name** | The user who holds this approval. If *Organization* is written in the User Name column, approval belongs to the whole organization. 
| **Agree** | The user approves the privacy notice. |
| **Disagree** | The user does not approve the privacy notice. |
| **Approver User Name** | The one who approves the privacy notice. |

# Searching for Customers, Vendors, and Other Contacts from Microsoft Teams

[!INCLUDE [online_only](includes/online_only.md)]. Introduced in 2021 release wave 1.

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] has a comprehensive business contact management system that is essential for users in sales, operations, or other departmental roles. If you're a user in one of these roles, you'll often need to look up, meet, or start a conversation with your vendors, customers, and other contacts. With the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams, you can do these tasks directly from Teams, without having to switch to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. From within Teams, you can:

- Look up [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] contacts from the Teams command box or from the message compose area. Contacts can include prospects, vendors, customers, or other business relationships.
- Share a contact as a card in a Teams conversation.
- View details about the contact, interaction history, and other insights like outstanding payments or open documents.

## Prerequisites

- You have access to Microsoft Teams.
- You've installed the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app in Teams. Learn more in [Install the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] App for Microsoft Teams](across-install-app-for-teams.md)
- You've got a [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] account with access to contacts in at least one company.

> [!NOTE]
> Whether you searching from the command box or message compose box, you may be asked to sign in or set up the app the first time. This step is necessary to search for contacts in the right Business Central company. Learn more about setting up the app to choose your company in [Changing Company and Other Settings in Teams](across-teams-settings.md).

## Look up contacts from the command box

The command box is at the top of every screen in Teams. It lets you search, take quick actions, or launch apps, like the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app. Searching from the command box is great for quickly looking up contacts and their related data for your own use. For example, suppose you want to look up an email address of a vendor to set up a calendar meeting. Or maybe you want to look up interaction history during a meeting with a customer.

1. In the command box, type **/Business Central**, then select the Business Central app from the results.

    ![Open Business Central app  to search for contacts from command box.](media/teams-contacts-command-1b.png)

2. In the **Business Central** box, start typing search text, like a name, address, or phone number.

    As you type, matching results will appear.

    ![Search Business Central contacts from command box in Teams.](media/teams-contacts-command-3.png)
3. Select a contact from the results.

    The contact card appears beneath the command box.

4. If you want to add the contact card into a conversation, go to the upper right corner of the card, select **... (More options)** > **Copy**. Then, paste the copy in the message compose box of a conversation.  

Learn more about the Teams command box at [Teams - Use the command box](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/use-the-command-box-13c4e429-7324-4886-b377-5dbed539193b).

## Look up contacts from the message compose box

The advantage of using the message compose box is that you can add a contact card directly to a conversation, for others to see.

1. Next to the message compose box, select **+** and then select **Business Central** from the list to launch the app.

    ![Open Business Central app to search for contacts from message box.](media/teams-contacts-message-box-2.png)

2. In the **Business Central** box, start typing search text, like a name, address, or phone number.

    As you type, matching results will appear.

    ![Search for Business Central contacts from message box.](media/teams-contacts-6.png)
3. Select a contact from the results.

    The contact card appears in the message compose box.

> [!NOTE]
> The contact card isn't sent to the conversation right away for others to see. You have the opportunity to review the contents of the card, and add text before or after it as you like. Then, send your message to the chat when ready.

## Viewing contact card details

The contact card in Teams gives you a quick overview of the customer, vendor, or contact. The card is interactive&mdash;meaning you can view more information or even modify a contact by using the **Details** or **Pop-out** buttons.

The **Details** button opens a window within Teams that displays more information about the contact, but not as much as you'd see in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. To see all the information about a contact in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], select **Pop-out**.

The contact card works just like cards for records, like items, customers, or sales orders. Learn more in [View card details](across-working-with-teams.md#view-card-details).

> [!NOTE]
> All participants in a Teams conversation will be able to view cards for Business Central contact that you submit to a conversation. But to view more details about records, by using the **Details** or **Pop out** buttons on a card, they'll need access to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Learn more in [Managing Microsoft Teams Integration](admin-teams-integration.md#minimum-requirements-1).

# Set Up Locations to Use Bins

Bins represent the basic warehouse structure, and you use them to suggest where to place items. After you create your bins you define their contents, or let them serve as floating bins without specific contents.

To use the bin functionality at a location, turn on the **Bin Mandatory** toggle on the **Location** card. After you turn on the toggle, the **Bin Code** and **Zone Code** fields are available on the following documents:

* Warehouse receipt header
* Warehouse receipt lines
* Warehouse put-away lines
* Warehouse shipment header
* Warehouse shipment lines
* Warehouse put-away lines

The next step is to design the item flow at the location by specifying bin codes in setup fields that represent the different flows.  

> [!NOTE]  
> You must create bin codes before you can specify them for the location. For more information, see [Create Bins](warehouse-how-to-create-individual-bins.md).  

## To set up a location to use bins

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Locations**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the location where you want to use bins.  
3. Choose the **Edit** action.  
4. On the **Warehouse** FastTab, select the **Bin Mandatory** checkbox.  
5. If you aren't using directed put-away and pick for the location, in the **Default Bin Selection** field, choose the method you want [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to use to assign a default bin to an item.  
6. Open the card for the location that you want to set up bins for.
7. On the **Bins** FastTab, select the bins to use as the default for receipts, shipments, inbound, outbound, and open shop floor bins.  

    The bin codes you specify appear automatically on the headers and lines of various warehouse documents. The default bins define all starting or ending placements of items in the warehouse.  
8. If you're using directed put-away and pick, select a bin for warehouse adjustments. The bin code in the **Adjustment Bin Code** field defines the virtual bin in which to record discrepancies in inventory:

    * When you observe differences registered in the warehouse item journal
    * Differences calculated when you register a warehouse physical inventory  
9. Optional: Fill in the fields on the **Bin Policies** FastTab. The most important fields are **Bin Capacity Policy**, **Allow Breakbulk**, and **Put-away Template Code** fields.  
10. On the **Warehouse** FastTab, fill in the **Outbound Whse. Handling Time**, **Inbound Whse. Handling Time**, and the **Base Calendar Code** fields. To learn more, go to [Set Up Base Calendars](across-how-to-assign-base-calendars.md).

## Fill in the consumption bin

The following flow chart shows how the **Bin Code** field on production order component lines is filled in according to your location setup.

# Responsible AI FAQ for Autofill (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]

These frequently asked questions (FAQ) describe the AI impact of Copilot’s Autofill feature in Business Central.

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-note-d365.md)]

<!--[!INCLUDE [preview-note](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/production-ready-preview-dynamics365.md)]-->

## What is Autofill?

Manually entering data can be time-consuming and error-prone, both for casual users of Business Central and expert users who are tasked with entering records throughout their workday.  

Microsoft Copilot is an AI-powered assistant that sparks creativity, boosts productivity, and eliminates tedious tasks. Copilot uses AI to suggest and fill out field values automatically on your page, instead of typing or looking up things across screens. You can choose to keep or discard the suggestions. 

## What are the capabilities of Autofill?

When you ask Copilot to autofill fields on a page in Business Central, it suggests values for all fields within a field group (FastTab). These suggestions aren't always AI-generated. Copilot uses various mechanisms described in the following table to provide suggestions for each field, indicating the most appropriate mechanism.

Regardless of whether the suggested value is AI-generated, Copilot always uses AI to determine the appropriate mechanism for a field.

|Mechanism|Description|
|-|-|
|Most Frequently Used |The value most frequently assigned to records in your company. The suggested value isn't computed using AI and comes directly from your Business Central data. |
|Most Recently Used |For fields that reference another table, the most recently used reference, or most recently viewed record for that table. The suggested value isn't computed using AI and comes directly from your Business Central data. |
|Lookup selection |For fields that reference another table and have a short list of possible choices, AI is used to intelligently select from the possible values.|
|AI-generated |AI is used to intelligently generate the suggested value. |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Copilot runs under your user context. It only has access to data that you already have access to. Your assigned permissions and all other security and compliance controls also apply when you use Copilot.

## What is the intended use of Autofill? 

Autofill is an assistive feature intended to help people enter data into Business Central. It isn't designed to run autonomously and enter data on behalf of others. Since the suggestions aren't automatically saved to Business Central, you must review and accept each field for it to be saved. 

When you choose to keep a suggestion, you're saving the change to Business Central as if you entered that value yourself without the assistance of Copilot.

When you leave the page or record, any suggestions that you didn't choose to keep are automatically discarded. 

Suggested values are displayed directly within the field editing experience, making it easy for you to review each suggestion and choose to keep, discard, or replace the suggestion. 

## How was Autofill evaluated? What metrics are used to measure performance? 

This feature is built in accordance with Microsoft's Responsible AI Standard. Learn more about responsible AI from Microsoft in [Empowering responsible AI practices](https://aka.ms/RAI).

The feature underwent extensive AI testing using Business Central's demonstration data and other fictitious business data. Testing covered various fields and pages from Business Central. Copilot’s output was evaluated for accuracy of suggested values, selection of the appropriate mechanism to suggest a value, grounding of suggested values in database data, and other metrics.

To ensure customer safety and data protection, this feature underwent rigorous testing to detect and deflect harmful content, jailbreaks, and other risks.

## How does Microsoft monitor the quality of generated content? 

Microsoft has various automated systems in place to ensure that output from Copilot is of the highest quality. Automated systems also detect abuse, and ensure safety for our customers and their data by filtering harmful content. 

Microsoft might disable the Copilot features for selected customers if abuse of the functionality is detected. 

Users have the opportunity to provide feedback to every Copilot response and report inaccurate or inappropriate content to help Microsoft improve this feature. If you encounter inappropriate content, report it to Microsoft by using this feedback form: [Report abuse](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2249810). We analyze user feedback on the feature and use it to help us improve responses.

You provide feedback by using the **like** (thumbs up) or **dislike** (thumbs down) icon in the information about an individual suggestion or for all suggestions in the group of fields.

## What are the AI limitations of Autofill? How can users minimize the impact of the limitations when using the system?

- **General AI limitations**

# Update currency exchange rates

If you trade in different currencies, you need to keep track of the changes in currency exchange rates. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] helps you manage and update the exchange rates manually or automatically and set up a currency exchange rate service.

## Currencies

> [!TIP]  
> In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can find real-time information about foreign exchange (FX) rates or historical rates under the term currency. To learn more, go to [Set Up an Additional Reporting Currency](finance-how-setup-additional-currencies.md).

[!INCLUDE [finance-currencies-def](includes/finance-currencies-def.md)]

You can specify the currency codes in the **Currencies** list, including extra information and settings that are necessary for each currency code. To learn more, go to [Currencies](finance-set-up-currencies.md#curr)

### Example of a receivable currency transaction

[!INCLUDE [finance-currencies-example](includes/finance-currencies-example.md)]

## Exchange rates

The exchange rates are the tool to calculate the local currency value (LCY) of each currency transaction. The **Currency Exchange Rates** page includes the following fields:

|Field|Description|  
|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
|**Starting Date**|The date when the currency rate was effective.|  
|**Currency Code**|The currency code related to this exchange rate.|  
|**Relational Currency Code**|If this currency is part of a triangular currency calculation, then you can set up the related currency code here.|  
|**Exchange Rate Amount**|The exchange rate amount is the rate for the currency code selected on the line. Normally 1 or 100.|  
|**Relational Exch. Rate Amount**|The relational exchange rate amount relates to the rate to use for the relational currency code.|  
|**Adjustment Exch. Rate Amount**|The rate for the currency code selected on the line for the use of the **Adjust Exchange Rates** batch job.|  
|**Relational Adjmt Exch. Rate Amt**|The rate for the currency code selected on the line for the use of the **Adjust Exchange Rates** batch job.|  
|**Fix Exchange Rate Amount**|Specifies if the currency's exchange rate can be changed on invoices and journal lines.|  

In general, the values of the **Exchange Rate Amount** and **Relational Exchange Rate Amount** fields are used as the default currency rate on all new receivables and payables documents that are created going forward. The currency rate is assigned to the document according to the current working date.  

> [!Note]
> The actual currency rate is calculated using this formula:
>
> `Currency Amount = Amount / Exchange Rate Amount * Relational Exch. Rate Amount`

The adjustment exchange rate amount, or the relational adjustment exchange rate amount, updates all open bank, receivables, or payables transactions.  

> [!Note]
> The actual currency rate is calculated using this formula:
>
> `Currency Amount = Amount / Adjustment Exch. Rate Amount * Relational Adjmt Exch. Rate Amt`

## Adjust exchange rates

Because exchange rates fluctuate constantly, you need to adjust other currency equivalents periodically. If you don't, amounts you converted from foreign (or other) currencies and posted to the general ledger in local currency can be incorrect. Also, you need to update daily entries posted before you enter a daily exchange rate.

You can use the **Adjust Exchange Rates** batch job to manually adjust the exchange rates for posted customer, vendor, and bank account entries. The batch job can also update other reporting currency amounts on G/L entries.  

> [!TIP]
> You can use a service to update exchange rates automatically. To learn more, go to [To set up a currency exchange rate service](finance-how-update-currencies.md#set-up-a-currency-exchange-rate-service). However, this doesn't adjust exchange rates on already posted transactions. To update exchange rates on posted entries, use the **Exchange Rates Adjustment** batch job.

You can also specify how the adjustment handles dimensions for unrealized gains and losses postings by choosing one of the following options in the **Dimension Posting** field:  

* **Source Entry Dimensions**: Transfer dimension values for G/L entries for unrealized gains and losses from the entry you're adjusting.  
* **No Dimensions**: Don't transfer dimension values for unrealized gains and losses to G/L entries. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] still uses default dimension settings, for example, **Code Mandatory**, **Same Code**, or **No Code**. If the source transaction entries have dimension values, the adjustment creates entries without dimension values.  
* **G/L Account Dimensions**: Transfer dimension values from the unrealized gains and losses G/L account's dimension settings source entry to G/L entries.

> [!NOTE]
> This capability isn't available in the Swiss version right now, but it's coming soon. We're working on it.

> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't consider dimensions for individual entries when you adjust exchange rates for additional reporting currencies. Dimensions aren't copied to the G/L entries if you set up the **Exchange Rate Adjustment** batch job with:
>
> * The **Adjust G/L Accounts for Add.-Reporting Currency** toggle turned on.
> * **Source Entry Dimensions** selected in the **Dimension Posting** field.

## Preview the effect of an adjustment

You can preview the effect that an exchange rate adjustment has on posting before you actually post by choosing the **Preview Posting** action on the **Exch. Rates Adjustment** report (Report 596) request page. On the request page, you can specify what to include in the preview:

* Get a detailed posting to the general ledger by entry.
* Get a summarized posting by currency. Just pick the **Adjust per entry** field on the **Exch. Rates Adjustment** report.

### Effect on customers and vendors

For customer and vendor accounts, the batch job uses the exchange rate that was valid on the posting date specified for the batch job to adjust the currency. The batch job calculates the differences for the individual currency balances and posts the amounts to the general ledger account that is specified in the **Unrealized Gains Acc.** field or the **Unrealized Losses Acc.** field on the **Currencies** page. Balancing entries are automatically posted to the receivables/payables account in the general ledger.

The batch job processes all open customer ledger entries and vendor ledger entries. If there's an exchange rate difference for an entry, the batch job creates a new detailed customer or vendor ledger entry. The new entry reflects the adjusted amount on the customer or vendor ledger entry.

#### Dimensions on customer and vendor ledger entries

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] assigns the dimensions from the customer or vendor ledger entries to the adjustment entries, and posts adjustments for each combination of dimension values.

### Effect on bank accounts

For bank accounts, the batch job adjusts the currency by using the exchange rate that is valid on the posting date specified in the batch job. The batch job calculates the differences for each bank account that has a currency code and posts the amounts to the general ledger account that is specified in the **Realized Gains Acc.** field or the **Realized Losses Acc.** field on the **Currencies** page. Balancing entries are automatically posted to the general ledger bank accounts that are specified in the bank account posting groups. The batch job calculates one entry per currency per posting group.

#### Dimensions on bank account entries

The bank account's default dimensions are assigned to the adjustment entries for the bank account's general ledger account and the gain/loss account.

### Effect on G/L accounts

If you post in another reporting currency, the batch job can create new general ledger entries for currency adjustments between the local currency and the other reporting currency. The batch job calculates the differences for each general ledger entry. It adjusts the general ledger entry depending on the contents of the **Exchange Rate Adjustment** field for each general ledger account.

#### Dimensions on G/L account entries

Adjustment entries are assigned the default dimensions from the accounts they posted to.

> [!Important]
> Before you can use the batch job, enter the adjustment exchange rates that are used to adjust the foreign currency balances. You do so on the **Currency Exchange Rates** page.<br><br>  

> [!Video https://learn-video.azurefd.net/vod/player?id=e871f958-fe42-4cf3-bb8a-e97f4c7658de]

## Set up a currency exchange rate service

You can use an external service to keep your currency exchange rates up to date.

> [!NOTE]
> Most exchange rate services provide data that is compatible with the import process in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. However, sometimes the data is formatted differently and you need to customize your import process. You can use the data exchange framework to do that by adding your own codeunit. You might need some help from a developer to do that. To learn more, go to [Set Up Data Exchange Definitions](across-how-to-set-up-data-exchange-definitions.md).

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Currency Exchange Rate Services**, and then select the related link.
2. Select the **New** action.
3. On the **Currency Exchange Rate Service** page, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
4. Map the fields from the XML file to the currency exchange rates table in the source field.
5. Apply any necessary transformation rules.
6. Turn on the **Enabled** toggle to enable the service.

> [!NOTE]
> The following video shows how you can connect to a currency exchange rate service, using the European Central Bank as an example. In the segment that describes how to set up field mappings, the setting in the **Source** column for the **Parent Node for Currency Code**  only returns the first currency found. The setting should be `/gesmes:Envelope/Code/Code/Code`.

<br><br>  
  
> [!Video https://learn-video.azurefd.net/vod/player?id=76914b80-c36a-4d74-95fa-0cdf5c5c0bfa]

## Update currency exchange rates through a service

Follow the steps given to update the currency exchange rates through a service:

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Currencies**, and then select the related link.
2. Select the **Update Exchange Rates** action.

## Correct mistakes

Every now and then, you might need to correct a mistake in a payment transaction for adjustments to foreign currency gains and losses. You can use the **Reverse transaction** action on the **Bank Account Ledger Entries**, **Customer Ledger Entries**, and **Vendor Ledger Entries** pages to unapply and reverse the payment transaction.

> [!NOTE]
> When you unapply and reverse a payment for an entry that had exchange rate adjustments, the reversal posts reversal entries for the adjustments. You might have to run the currency exchange rate adjustment again to get the correct current balance.

# Sustainability value chain overview

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This set of features is available as a _public preview_ in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], starting from **2025 release wave 1**. Read carefully, and be sure to understand which features we currently support.  

The sustainability value chain features are a comprehensive tool designed to streamline the collection and use of data from your value chain partners. This feature empowers organizations to accurately calculate Scope 3 emissions, enabling better sustainability reporting and compliance with environmental standards.  

## Introduction to value chain for Scope 3 emissions calculation

The sustainability value chain enables you to use data you from your value chain partners to calculate your scope 3 emissions. A value chain in general is a vendor you do business with and from whom you collect inbound emission data. After you collect emissions or carbon data from your vendors, you can use the data to calculate your Scope 3 emissions in your business processes. You can also calculate other emissions for other types of item handling, such as transfers, production, and so on. These calculations help give you accurate information about embedded emissions for items you plan to sell.

The sustainability value chain helps businesses:

- Achieve a higher level of accuracy in sustainability reporting.
- Provide better communication with customers related to emissions in their products.
- Better align with regulatory demands.
- Actively contribute to reducing their environmental footprint.  

## How the system keeps sustainability value chain data

To track the sustainability value chain, record and use transactions from the **Sustainability Value Entries** page.  

> [!NOTE]
> The sustainability value chain process works only with the CO2e (carbon equivalent).

The **Sustainability Value Entry** page is an important component for managing and tracking the value of the embedded carbon footprint in items. It records all changes in the CO2e emissions of inventory items, including purchases, location transfers, production, sales, and so on. This page helps ensure accurate CO2e (carbon equivalent) valuation and provides detailed insights into the emissions effect of inventory transactions.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The sustainability value chain uses only the average method of CO2e emission calculation per item. An item's **CO2e per Unit** is calculated as the average **CO2e per Unit** at each point in time after a purchase.

# Analyze data by dimensions

In financial analysis, a dimension is data you add to an entry as a kind of marker to group entries with similar characteristics. For example, dimensions often group entries for customers, regions, products, and salespeople. The groups let you easily retrieve data about them for analysis. You can use dimensions on entries in journals, documents, and budgets.

Each dimension describes the focus of analysis. So, a two-dimensional analysis, for example, would be sales per area. By using more than two dimensions when you create an entry, you can carry out a more complex analysis. An example of a complex analysis is exploring sales per sales campaign per customer group per area. That gives you greater insight into your business, such as how well your business is operating, where it is or isn't thriving, and where you should allocate more resources. That insight helps you make more informed business decisions. Learn more at [Work with Dimensions](finance-dimensions.md).

> [!TIP]
> As a quick way to analyze transactional data by dimensions, you can filter totals in the chart of accounts (COA) and entries in all **Entries** pages by dimensions. Look for the **Set Dimension Filter** action.

> [!NOTE]
> If you discover that an incorrect dimension value was used on posted general ledger entries, you can correct it and update your analysis views. To learn more, go to [Troubleshooting and Correcting Dimensions](finance-troubleshooting-correcting-dimensions.md#changing-dimension-assignments-after-posting).

## Set up an analysis view

An analysis by dimensions uses a selected combination of dimensions. You store, retrieve, and update that dimension set by creating an **Analysis View** card.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Analysis Views**, then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Analysis View List** page, choose the **New** action.
3. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
4. To add other dimension codes in addition to the four on the **Dimensions** FastTab, choose the **Filter** action, fill in the fields, then choose the **OK** button.  
5. To update the view, choose the **Update** action.

## Analyze by dimensions

Use analysis views you've already set up with the **Analysis by Dimensions** matrix to view the amounts in your general ledger.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Analysis Views**, then choose the related link.  
2. Select the relevant analysis view, then choose the **Analysis by Dimensions** action.
3. On the **Analysis by Dimensions** page, fill in the fields to define what data to show, and how.
4. Choose the **Show Matrix** action to open the matrix page for the analysis view.
5. To access details of an amount in the matrix page, choose the amount.  

- The columns on the left contain information based on what you've selected in the **Show as Lines** field in the header.  
- The columns on the right contain information based on what you've selected in the **Show as Columns** field in the header.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> You can't select a period length that's shorter than the period specified for the date compression on the **Analysis View** card. The **Next Set** and **Previous Set** actions aren't available if you've selected **Period** in either the **Show as Lines** or **Show as Columns** fields.  

> [!NOTE]  
> You can use the **Dimensions - Detail** report to display a detailed classification of how dimensions have been used on entries over a selected period. You can use the **Dimensions - Total** report to display only the total amounts.  

> [!TIP]  
> You can also change the view by changing the contents of the **Show as Lines** and **Show as Columns** fields. To reverse a view setting, choose the **Reverse Lines and Columns** action.

## Update an analysis view

The amounts on the **Analysis by Dimensions** page give you a picture of the company's state at the time of the last update. To get the current state, run the update action to update the analysis view.

Use the following procedure to update an analysis view from the **Analysis by Dimensions** page. The steps are similar to those for updating the **Analysis View Card** and **Analysis View List** pages.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Analysis Views**, then choose the related link.
2. Select the relevant analysis view, then choose the **Analysis by Dimensions** action.
3. On the **Analysis by Dimensions** page, choose the **Analysis View Code** field.  
4. Select the line with the relevant analysis view.  
5. On the **Analysis Views** page, select the analysis view, then choose the **Update** action.  

> [!TIP]  
> If you select the **Update on Posting** checkbox on an analysis view card, the view automatically updates when someone posts an associated transaction.

> [!NOTE]  
> To update some or all analysis views at the same time, use the **Update Analysis Views** batch job.

# The WorldPay Payments Standard extension

> [!CAUTION]
> The WorldPay Payments Standard extension will be deprecated. The code is marked as obsolete starting in 2023 release wave 2. The app will be active for the next three major releases and then it will be removed.

The WorldPay Payments Standard extension lets you offer customers a convenient alternative to making payments through bank transfers or credit cards. Not only that, payments made through payment services will typically land in your bank account more quickly.

If you enable the extension, when you send a sales invoice by email the document includes a link to the payment service in the email body and in the attached PDF document. A customer can choose the link, and then use the payment service to make the payment.

Enabling payment service extensions is free in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], however, you'll need to contact the payment service to get an account. For more information, see [Enable Customer Payment Through Payment Services](sales-how-enable-payment-service-extensions.md).

# Set up payment terms

Payment terms determine how you manage due dates and payment discounts. You can use date formulas to define the payment terms. When you first sign up for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the demonstration company provides a few payment methods that businesses often use. You can, however, add as many as you need.  

If you assign payment terms to customers and vendors, the same terms are always used on the sales and purchase documents you create for them. The document dates on sales and purchase documents, not their posting dates, are used to calculate due dates for payments. If needed, you can change the terms on the sales or purchase document. For example, if you want a particular customer to pay you within seven days rather than the default 14 days. Changing the terms on the document doesn't change the default payment term assigned to the customer. The same payment terms are available for sales and purchase documents.

When you post an invoice, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates the payment discounts based on the payment terms. The payment discount date is the last date that the customer can receive a discount. The date is also calculated when you post an invoice.  

Similarly, when you post a credit memo, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates payment discounts based on the payment terms. It calculates the discount on credit memos in the same way as discounts on invoices. When you apply a credit memo to an invoice, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] reduces the discount amount for the invoice by the credit memo's discount amount.  

If you want to send your customers reminders of overdue payments, you must set up reminder levels and terms. To learn more about reminders, go to [Set Up Reminder Terms and Levels](finance-setup-reminders.md).  

## To set up payment terms

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Payment Terms**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  

After you set up the payment terms, you assign them to customers and vendors. Optionally, assign payment terms to your payment methods.  

> [!TIP]
> In the base version of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], payment terms don't support partial payments. Instead, you must use the prepayments functionality. To learn more about prepayments, go to [Set Up Prepayments](finance-set-up-prepayments.md).
>
> In some countries/regions, you *can* set up payment terms with partial payments. To learn whether your country/region supports this capability, go to the **Local Functionality** section in the table of contents on the left side of a [Microsoft Learn](about-localization.md) article.

## Audit changes to payment terms

You can use the Change Log feature to capture changes users make to your payment terms setup. [!INCLUDE [include-audit-what-who-when](includes/include-audit-what-who-when.md)]

The following table lists the table for payment terms and its ID.

# Managing Segments
You create segments to select a group of contacts according to specific criteria. For example, a segment could be the industry that the contacts belong to or your business relationship with the contacts. You can create a segment to select the contacts you want to target with a campaign.

There are two main tasks in creating a segment:

* Enter general information about the segment. Before you can select the contacts within the segment, you must first create the segment.
* Select the contacts to be included within the segment.

The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the topics that describe them.

# Purchasing

You create a purchase invoice or purchase order to record the cost of purchases and to track accounts payable. If you need to control an inventory, purchase invoices are also used to dynamically update inventory levels so that you can minimize your inventory costs and provide better customer service. The purchasing costs, including service expenses, and inventory values that result from posting purchase invoices contribute to profit figures and other financial KPIs on your Role Center.

You must use purchase orders if your purchasing process requires that you record partial receipts of an order quantity. For example, because the full quantity wasn't available at the vendor. If you sell items by delivering directly from your vendor to your customer, as a drop shipment, then you must also use purchase orders. To learn more, go to [Make Drop Shipments](sales-how-drop-shipment.md). In all other aspects, purchase orders work the same way as purchase invoices.

You can have purchase invoices created automatically by using the OCR (Optical Character Recognition) service to convert PDF invoices from your vendors to electronic documents, which are then converted to purchase invoices by a workflow. To use this functionality, you must first sign up for the OCR service, and then perform various setups. To learn more, go to [Incoming Documents](across-income-documents.md).

Products can be both inventory items and services. To learn more, go to [Register New Items](inventory-how-register-new-items.md).

For all purchase processes, you can use an approval workflow, for example, to require that an accounting manager approves large purchases. To learn more, go to [Use Approval Workflows](across-how-use-approval-workflows.md).

The following sections describe a sequence of tasks, with links to the articles that cover them.

# Configuring OneDrive integration with Business Central on-premises

[!INCLUDE[azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id](~/../shared-content/shared/azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id.md)]

This article explains how to configure OneDrive for work or school (formerly known as OneDrive for Business) integration with Business Central on-premises. Unlike [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, the connection between Business Central and OneDrive isn't set up automatically. If the connection isn't configured, users can't use the features for OneDrive.

There are two tasks that need to be done to configure the OneDrive integration.

- The first task involves registering an application (app) on your Microsoft Entra tenant of your Microsoft 365 plan. The registered app is used for authentication purposes. This task is typically done in the Azure portal and in Business Central web client.
- The second task involves setting up the connection to the OneDrive URL and turning on the OneDrive features in the Business Central. This task in done in the Business Central web client. It's done differently for version 21 than for versions 19 and 20. Version 21 introduces a new **OneDrive Setup** that replaces the **SharePoint Connections Setup**.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises can only be connected to OneDrive hosted by Microsoft in the cloud. Connecting [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on premises to the My Sites repository of SharePoint Server isn't supported.

## <a name="registerapp"></a>Register an app in Microsoft Entra ID for OneDrive integration

In this task, you add a registered app for Business Central in the Microsoft Entra tenant of your Microsoft 365 plan. Like other Azure services that work with Business Central, OneDrive requires a registered app in Microsoft Entra ID. The registered app provides authentication and authorization services between Business Central and SharePoint, which is used by OneDrive.

For detailed steps for completing this step, see [Register an application in Microsoft Entra ID](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/register-app-azure#register-an-application-in-azure-active-directory) in the developer and IT pro help.

As you register the application, consider the following points:

- If you've already registered an application as part of an integration with another Microsoft product, such as Power BI, then you reuse that registered app. In this case, you'll just have to set the SharePoint permissions for the existing registered app.

- Be sure to configure the registered app with the following delegated permissions to the SharePoint API:

    - AllSites.FullControl
    - User.ReadWrite.All
    
    For Business Central 2021 release wave 2 (version 19), set these permissions instead:
    
    - AllSites.Write
    - MyFiles.Write
    - User.Read.All 

- If you're using Business Central version 19 or 20, copy the **Application (client) ID** and **client secret** used by the registered app. You'll need this information in the next task.

## <a name="url"></a>Get your OneDrive URL

[!INCLUDE[onedrive-url](includes/onedrive-url.md)]

## Set up the OneDrive connection in version 21 and later

Use this procedure if you're using Business Central 2022 release wave 2 (version 21) or later.

### Prerequisites

- Indirect, modify, and delete (imd) permission on table **Document Service Scenario** as a minimum

### Run OneDrive setup

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **OneDrive Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. The first time you run the assisted setup, you see the **Your privacy**. Read the information on the page, and if you agree to the terms choose **Agree** to continue.
3. On the **Configure file handling** page, you have the following options to choose from:

   [!INCLUDE[onedrive-feature-options](includes/onedrive-feature-options.md)]

4. On the **Configure Business Central** page, enter OneDrive's URL in the **OneDrive URL** field.

   [How do I find my OneDrive URL?](#url)
5. Choose **Test Connection** and wait for the results.
   - If the test succeeds, choose **Done**, then you're ready to go.
   - If the test fails, you get a message that describes the problem. Typically the problem has to do with the URL that you provided. Choose **OK** to return to the **Configure Business Central** page, verify the URL, and try again.
   - If you haven't already set up the Microsoft Entra ID registered app, the **Set Up Microsoft Entra ID** guide opens.
6. When completed, the privacy notice for OneDrive integration is agreed for all users. If you want to change it so users must agree or disagree for themselves, then go the **Privacy Notices Status** page and select **Let User Decide** for the OneDrive integration. Users will then be prompted to agree or disagree with the privacy notice the first time they use the OneDrive features. Learn more in [Privacy Notices](privacy-notices-status.md).

## Set up the connection in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] version 19 and 20

Use this procedure if you're using Business Central 2022 release wave 1 (version 20) or 2021 release wave 2 (version 19).
> [!IMPORTANT]
> By configuring this feature, you also enable legacy features that send files to OneDrive.  
>
>* The Open in Excel feature will automatically copy the Excel file to OneDrive, then open it in Excel Online. 
>* Exporting any report to a file will automatically copy the file to OneDrive, then open it in Excel Online, Word Online or OneDrive. 
>* Other features may also automatically open in OneDrive.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Microsoft SharePoint Connection Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. In the **Description** field, enter a description for the connection, like **OneDrive**.
3. In the **Folder** field, enter **Business Central**.
4. In the **Location** field, enter the URL for your OneDrive.

   [How do I find my OneDrive URL?](#url)
5. In the **Client ID** field, enter the client ID from your registered app.
6. In the **Client Secret** field, enter the secret from your registered app. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The **SharePoint Connection Setup** page is used to configure multiple legacy features. The **General** section configures the connection to OneDrive, and the **Shared Documents** section redirects files to SharePoint instead. The  **SharePoint Connection Setup** has been deprecated and will be removed in coming release. We recommend that you do not configure the **Shared Documents** section. Learn more in [Deprecated Features in the Base App ](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/upgrade/deprecated-features-w1#microsoft-sharepoint-connection-setup).

## After upgrade to version 21

When you upgrade to version 21 or later, the existing connection to OneDrive that's configured on the **SharePoint Connection Setup** page will still work. But because the **SharePoint Connection Setup** page will be removed in version 23, we recommend that you switch to the new OneDrive integration, as described in the next section. Making this switch now make it easier when the **SharePoint Connection Setup** is eventually removed. Plus, it enables you to use the **OneDrive Setup** assisted setup guide to manage the OneDrive features that are accessible to users.

## Switching from legacy SharePoint to new OneDrive integration 

To switch to the new OneDrive integration, you run the **OneDrive Setup** assisted setup guide, which you can open directly or from the legacy **SharePoint Connection Setup** page. The **OneDrive Setup** assisted setup leads you through the transition, providing information about the changes being made along the way.

Before you get started with the switch or as you're doing it, refer to the next section to learn about some aspects and considerations about the process. 

### <a name="onedrivesetupmigration"></a>About switching to the new OneDrive integration

In addition to OneDrive integration, Business Central can also integrate with other services, like Power BI and Universal print. Integration with these other services also requires a registered Microsoft Entra app for authentication. The Microsoft Entra app used by these other services is configured in the **Set up your Microsoft Entra accounts** assisted setup. When you switch from the legacy SharePoint connection setup, the new **OneDrive Setup** assisted setup changes your OneDrive integration to also use the **Set up your Microsoft Entra accounts** assisted setup&mdash;so all integrations use the same Microsoft Entra app.

This change has implications when switching to the new OneDrive integration, depending on whether there's already a Microsoft app configured in the **Set up your Microsoft Entra accounts** assisted setup. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> After you switch to the new OneDrive setup, you can no longer use the **SharePoint Connection Setup** page to configure OneDrive integration.

#### How the changes affect the integration

The **OneDrive Setup** assisted setup will always use the app that's configured in the **Set up your Microsoft Entra accounts** assisted setup, if there's one. When you run the **OneDrive Setup** assisted setup, it compares the app configured in **Set up your Microsoft Entra accounts** with your current app configured in **SharePoint Connection Setup**.

> [!TIP]
> In the **SharePoint Connection Setup** page and **Set up your Microsoft Entra accounts** assisted setup, the Microsoft Entra app is identified by the **client ID**.

- If the app in **Set up your Microsoft Entra accounts** is different than the app in **SharePoint Connection Setup**, the OneDrive integration changes to use the app in **Set up your Microsoft Entra accounts**.

   In **OneDrive Setup** while making the switch, you get a message similar to the following text: 

   **The Microsoft Entra application used for authentication will be configured for all Business Central integrations. This means the client id will change to NNNNNNNNN-NNNN-NNNN-NNNN-NNNNNNNNNNNN, you may want to test it has the correct permissions.**

  `NNNNNNNNN-NNNN-NNNN-NNNN-NNNNNNNNNNNN` represents the client ID of the app in **Set up your Microsoft Entra accounts** that OneDrive integration has been switched to. 

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > For new OneDrive integration to work after you make the switch, you have to grant the app permission to the SharePoint API in Azure portal. You can do this step before or after you switch to the new OneDrive setup. Learn more in the section [Register an app in Microsoft Entra ID for OneDrive integration](#registerapp).

- If the app in **Set up your Microsoft Entra accounts** is the same as the app in **SharePoint Connection Setup**, the OneDrive integration uses the same app as before, except from the configuration in the **Set up your Microsoft Entra accounts** setup.

   In **OneDrive Setup** while making the switch, you get a message similar to the following text:

   **The Microsoft Entra application used for authentication will be configured for all Business Central integrations. This has already been configured with the same client id (aaaabbbb-0000-cccc-1111-dddd2222eeee).**

- If there's no app configured in the **Set up your Microsoft Entra accounts** setup, the OneDrive integration uses the same app as before.

   The **OneDrive Setup** assisted setup copies app configuration to the **Set up your Microsoft Entra accounts** setup, so it's used for other integrations in that might set up later.

   In **OneDrive Setup** while making the switch, you get a message similar to the following text:

   **The Microsoft Entra application used for authentication will be configured for all Business Central integrations.**

### Run OneDrive setup to switch to the new OneDrive integration

1. Open either the **OneDrive Setup** page or the **SharePoint Connection Setup** page.
2. If you're using the **SharePoint Connection Setup** page, choose **Go to new OneDrive setup** in the notification at the top of the page.
3. Follow the **OneDrive Setup** assisted setup guide.
4. When you get to the **Configure file handling** page, choose one of the following options for turning on features:

   [!INCLUDE[onedrive-feature-options](includes/onedrive-feature-options.md)]

5. The **Configure Business Central** page shows the same URL that's used by the existing OneDrive integration. You can change the URL as needed.
6. Select **Test Connection** and follow the instructions.

   If the test succeeds, select **done**, and you're ready to go. Otherwise, use the messages on the page to help you fix the problem.

# Create routings

Manufacturing companies use routings to visualize and direct the manufacturing process.

The routing is the basis of process scheduling, capacity scheduling, scheduled assignment of material needs, and manufacturing documents.  

As for production bills of material (BOMs), the routings are assigned to the manufacturing end item. A routing holds master data that captures the process requirements of a given produced item. After a production order is created for an item, its routing governs the scheduling of operations as represented on the **Prod. Order Routing** page under the production order.  

Before you can set up a routing, the following setups must be in place:  

- Item cards are created for parent items that take part in manufacturing. To learn more, go to [Register New Items](inventory-how-register-new-items.md).
- Production resources are set up. To learn more, go to [Set Up Work Centers and Machine Centers](production-how-to-set-up-work-and-machine-centers.md).

## To create a routing

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Routings**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
4. In the **Type** field, select one of the following options:
   - **Serial** to calculate the production routing according to the value in the **Operation No.** field.  
   - Select **Parallel** to calculate the operations according to the value in the **Next Operation No.** field.  
5. To edit the routing, set the **Status** field to **New** or **Under Development**.  

    Proceed to fill in the routing lines.
6. In the **Operation No.** field, enter the number of the first operation, for example,  **10**.  
7. In the **Type** field, specify which kind of resource is used, for example, **Work Center**.  
8. In the **No.** field, select the resource to be used, or type it in the field.  
9. In the **Routing Link Code** field, enter a code to connect the component to a specific operation. For more information, see [To create routing links](production-how-to-create-routings.md#to-create-routing-links).
10. In the **Run Time** and **Setup Time** fields, enter the process times needed to perform the operation.

     > [!NOTE]
     > Setup time is calculated per production order, whereas run time is calculated per produced item.  

11. In the **Concurrent Capacities** field, specify how many units of the selected resource are used to perform the operation. For example, allocating two people to one packing operation halves the run time.  
12. Continue to fill in lines for all operations involved in producing the item in question.  
13. To copy lines from an existing routing, choose the **Copy Routing** action to select existing lines.  
14. To activate the routing, in the **Status** field, choose **Certified**.  
15. You can now attach the new routing to the card of the production item in question, by filling in the **Routing No.** field. To learn more, go to [Register New Items](inventory-how-register-new-items.md).  

> [!NOTE]  
> Remember to recalculate the item's standard cost from the **Item** card. Choose the **Production** action, the **Calc. Production Std. Cost** action, and then choose the **All Levels** action.  You can also calculate and update the standard cost for one or many items on the **Standard Cost Worksheet** page. Learn more at [Update Standard Costs](finance-about-calculating-standard-cost.md#updating-standard-costs-with-standard-cost-worksheet).  


## To create routing links

You can create routing links to connect components to specific operations to retain their relationship even though the production BOM or routing is modified. Routing links also facilitate just-in-time flushing of components, namely when the specific linked operation starts, not when the complete production order is released. To learn more, go to [Flush Components According to Operation Output](production-how-to-flush-components-according-to-operation-output.md).  

Another important benefit is that linked components and operations display in a logical process structure when you use the **Production Journal** page to post output and consumption.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Routings**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the routing that contains the operations that you want to link.  

    Make sure the routing status is **Under Development**.  

3. On the relevant routing line, in the **Routing Link Code** field, select a code.  
4. Add different routing link codes to other operations in the routing, if relevant.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > You shouldn't use the same routing link code in different operations on a routing because you might incorrectly link a component to two different operations, so that it is consumed two times.  
    >
    > It's a good idea to name the routing link code after the operation to ensure operation-specific routing links.

5. Set the routing status to **Certified**.  

    Routing link codes are now assigned to operations. Next, you must create the actual link by assigning the same codes to specific components in the relevant production BOM.  

6. Open the **Production BOM** that contains the components that you want to link to the above operations. To learn more, go to [Create Production BOMs](production-how-to-create-production-boms.md).
7. Make sure the BOM status is **Under Development**.  
8. On the relevant production BOM line, in the **Routing Link Code** field, select the code that you assigned to the operation.  
9. Proceed to add routing link codes to other components according to the unique operations where they're used.  
10. Set the production BOM status to **Certified**.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > To enable the routing links on an existing production order, you must refresh the production order. To learn more, go to [Create Production Orders](production-how-to-create-production-orders.md).  

The selected components are now linked to the selected operations when you create or refresh a production order using the production BOM and routing. This link is visible on the **Prod. Order Components** page under the production order. You can remove and add the routing link codes at any time.

## To assign personnel, tools, and quality measures to routing operations

If you require personnel with qualifications, special knowledge, or special authorization for an operation, you can assign these personnel to the operation. In addition, you can assign tools and quality requirements to the operation. This procedure describes how to assign personnel. The steps are similar for other types of operation information.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Routings**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the relevant routing.  
3. On the **Lines** FastTab, select the line that you want to process, choose the **Operations** action, and then choose the **Personnel** action.  
4. Fill in the fields on the **Routing Personnel** page.  
5. Choose the **OK** button to exit the page. The entered values are copied and assigned to the operation.  

## To create a new version of a routing

The version principle enables you to manage several versions of a routing. The structure of the routing version corresponds to the structure of the routing consisting of the routing version header and the routing version lines. The starting date defines the basic difference.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Routings**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the routing to copy, and then choose the **Versions** action.  
3. On the **Routing Versions** page, choose the **New** action.
4. In the **Version Code** field, enter the unique identification of the version. You can use any combination of numbers and letters.  

    The newly created version is automatically assigned the status **New**.  
5. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](../archive/SetupAndAdministration/includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
6. To create operation lines, select the first blank line, and then fill in the **Operation No.** field according to the sequence of operations.

    The operation lines are in ascending order by operation numbers. To be able to make changes later, we recommend that you select adequate step widths. The **Next Operation No.** field refers to the next operation in the routing.

7. When you're done setting up the routing version, in the **Status** field, choose **Certified**.

# Work with blanket sales orders or blanket purchase orders

A blanket sales order represents a framework for a long-term agreement between you and your customer. Similarly, you use blanket purchase orders to manage long-term agreements between you and your vendor.

A blanket order is typically made when a customer has committed to purchasing large quantities that are to be delivered in several smaller shipments over a certain period of time. Often blanket orders cover only one item with predetermined delivery dates. The main reason for using a blanket order rather than a sales order is that quantities entered on a blanket order don't affect item availability and thus can be used as a worksheet for monitoring, forecasting, and planning purposes.

On the blanket order, each separate shipment can be set up as an order line, which can then be converted into a sales order at the time of shipping.

An example of when a blanket sales order could be used is if a customer calls and places an order of 1000 units of an item and they want the items to be delivered in 250 units every week over the next month.

> [!NOTE]
> Blanket purchase orders work in a similar way as blanket sales orders. This documentation covers blanket sales orders only.

## To create a blanket sales order

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Blanket Sales Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
4. Leave the **Order Date** field blank. When the separate sales orders are created from the blanket order, the order date of the sales order is set to equal the actual work date.
5. On the **Lines** FastTab, create separate lines for each shipment. For instance, if your customer wants 1000 units split out equally between four weeks, you would enter four separate lines of 250 units each.  

## To create a sales order from a blanket sales order  

1. To create an order for any of the lines in the blanket sales order, remove the quantity in the **Qty. to Ship** field on all the lines that you don't wish to ship at this time.  
2. When you're ready to create orders, choose the **Make Order** action, and then choose **Yes**. A message appears informing you that the blanket order has been assigned an order number. Note that the blanket order hasn't been deleted.  
3. Choose the **OK** button.  
4. To see the results of the preceding steps, choose the **Line** action, choose the **Unposted Lines** action, and then choose the **Orders** action.  
5. On the **Sales Lines** page, select the appropriate sales order, choose the **Line** action, and then choose the **Show Document** action.  

The following applies to sales orders after they have been created from blanket sales orders:  

- After the blanket order is converted into a sales order, the sales order contains all the lines from the blanket order. The lines where the quantity in the **Qty. to Ship** field was deleted appear, but with blank **Quantity** fields. You may choose to leave, edit, or delete the lines.  
- It's important to remember that the sales order line quantity must not exceed the quantity of the associated blanket order line. Otherwise, posting of the sales order won't be possible.  
- When the sales order is posted as shipped and/or invoiced, the **Quantity Shipped** and **Quantity Invoiced** fields are updated on the related blanket order.  
- The blanket order number and line number are recorded as properties of the sales lines when created from a blanket order.  
- When sales orders aren't created directly from the blanket order but still relate to it, a link between a sales order and a blanket order can be established by entering the associated blanket order number in the **Blanket Order No.** field on the sales order line.  
- After the sales order has been created for the total quantity of a blanket order line, no other sales order can be created for the same line. Users are prevented from entering a quantity in the **Qty. to Ship** field. If, however, additional quantities need to be added to a blanket order, the value in the **Quantity** field can be increased and additional orders can then be created.  
- The invoiced blanket sales order remains in the system until it's deleted, either by deleting individual blanket orders or by running the **Delete Invoiced Blanket Sales Orders** batch job.  
- If a customer is also recorded as a contact in the Marketing application area, and if you have specified an interaction template code for blanket sales order on the **Marketing Setup** page, an interaction is recorded in the Interaction Log Entry table when you select **Print** to print the blanket sales order.

## To view the status of a blanket sales order

You can see the status of a blanket sales order on the **Sales Blanket Order Statistics** page. This might be relevant when you start to invoice the order that is created from the blanket sales order.  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Blanket Sales Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Select a blanket sales order, and then choose the **Statistics** action.  
3.  On the **Sales Blanket Order Statistics** page, on the **General** FastTab, you can see summary information about the entire order based on the total quantity in the various **Quantity fields** on the blanket sales order lines.  

- On the **Invoicing** FastTab, you can see summary information based on the total quantity in the **Qty. to Invoice** fields on the sales blanket order lines.  
- On the **Shipping** FastTab, you can see summary information based on the total quantity in the **Qty. to Receive** fields on the sales blanket order lines.  
- On the **Prepayment** FastTab, you can see summary information about any prepaid amounts.  
- On the **Vendor** FastTab, you can see certain basic information about the vendor.

## To view unposted and posted blanket sales order lines

The link between the blanket sales order and the originating sales order, and any other sales document, is retained after posting as a list of posted and unposted sales order invoice lines.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon enter **Blanket Sales Orders**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the blanket sales order you want to view.
3. To view unposted entries, select the line in question, choose the **Line** action, and then choose the **Unposted Lines** action. Choose one of the following options.  

|Option|Description|
|--|--|
|**Orders**|Specifies open orders associated with the selected line.|
|**Invoices**|Specifies open invoices that have been associated with the selected line. Open invoices are manually associated with a blanket order by entering the blanket order number on the sales invoice line.|
|**Return Orders**|Specifies open return orders that have been associated with the selected line.|
|**Credit Memos**|Specifies open credit memos that have been associated with the selected line.|

4. To view posted entries, select the line in question, choose the **Line** action, and then choose the **Posted Lines** action. Choose one of the following options.  

|Option|Description|
|---|----|
|**Shipments**|Posted shipments associated with the selected line.|
|**Invoices**|Posted invoices associated with the selected line.|
|**Return Receipts**|Posted return receipts that have been associated with the selected line.|
|**Credit Memos**|Posted credit memos that have been associated with the selected line.|

5. On the **Sales Lines** page, choose the **Show Document** action to view the entry.

# Correct or cancel unpaid purchase invoices

You can correct or cancel a posted purchase invoice. This is useful if you want to correct a typing mistake, or if you want to change the purchase early in the order process.

If you have already paid for products on the posted purchase invoice, you can't correct or cancel it from the posted purchase invoice itself. Instead, you must manually create a purchase credit memo to reverse the purchase, optionally managed with a purchase return order. The same applies if you want to modify a posted purchase invoice that was based on combined purchase receipts. For more information, see [Process Purchase Returns or Cancellations](purchasing-how-process-purchase-returns-cancellations.md).

On the **Posted Purchase Invoice** page, you can choose the **Correct** button or the **Cancel** button. When you correct or cancel a posted purchase invoice, the corrective purchase credit memo is applied to all general ledger and inventory ledger entries that were created when the initial purchase invoice was posted. This reverses the posted purchase invoice in your financial records and leaves the corrective posted purchase credit memo for your audit trail. The video describes the use of **Correct** and **Cancel**.

## To correct a posted purchase invoice

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Posted Purchase Invoices**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the posted purchase invoice that you want to correct.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >   If the **Canceled** check box is selected, then you cannot correct the posted purchase invoice because it has already been corrected or canceled.
3. On the **Posted Purchase Invoice** page, choose **Correct**.

    A new purchase invoice with the same information is created where you can make the correction. For more information, see [Record Purchases](purchasing-how-record-purchases.md). The **Canceled** field on the initial posted purchase invoice is changed to **Yes**.

    A purchase credit memo is automatically created and posted to void the initial posted purchase invoice.
4. Choose **Show Corrective Credit Memo** to view the posted purchase credit memo that voids the initial posted purchase invoice.

## To cancel a posted purchase invoice

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Posted Purchase Invoices**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the posted purchase invoice that you want to cancel.

    > [!NOTE]  
    >   If the **Canceled** check box is selected, then you cannot cancel the posted purchase invoice because it has already been canceled or corrected.
3. On the **Posted Purchase Invoice** page, choose **Cancel**.

    A purchase credit memo is automatically created and posted to void the initial posted purchase invoice. The **Canceled** field on the initial posted purchase invoice is changed to **Yes**.
4. Choose **Show Corrective Credit Memo** to view the posted purchase credit memo that voids the initial posted purchase invoice.

### Partial invoice posting also supported

If the cancellation is related to a partial invoice posting, then the originating purchase order line is updated to reflect the canceled invoiced quantity. The **Qty. to Invoice** and **Quantity Invoiced** fields on the related purchase order line are reset to the values before the partial posting.

# About cost accounting

Cost accounting can help you understand the costs of running a business. Cost accounting information is designed to analyze:  

- What types of costs your business incurs.  
- Where the costs occur.
- Who bears the costs.

In cost accounting, you allocate actual and budgeted costs of operations, departments, products, and projects to analyze the profitability of your company.  

## Workflow in cost accounting

Cost accounting has the following main components:  

- Cost types, cost centers, and cost objects  
- Cost entries and cost journals  
- Cost allocations  
- Cost budgets
- Cost reporting  

The following diagram shows the workflow in cost accounting.  

![Cost Accounting overview.](media/costaccountingoverview.png "CostAccountingOverview")  

## Cost types, cost centers, and cost objects

You define cost types, cost centers, and cost objects to analyze what the costs are, where the costs come from, and who should bear the costs.  

First, you define a chart of cost types with a structure and functionality that resembles the general ledger chart of accounts. You can create your own chart of cost types or do so by transferring the general ledger income statement accounts.  

Cost centers are departments and profit centers responsible for costs and income. Often, there are more cost centers set up in cost accounting than in any dimension that is set up in the general ledger. In the general ledger, typically only the first level cost centers for direct costs and the initial costs are used. In cost accounting, more cost centers are created for extra allocation levels.  

Cost objects are products, product groups, or services a company offers. These objects are the "finished goods" that carry the costs.  

You can link cost centers to departments and cost objects to projects in your company. Through the general ledger, you can link cost centers and cost objects to any dimensions and supplement that information with subtotals and titles.  

## Cost entries and cost journals

Operational costs can be transferred from the general ledger. You can automatically transfer the cost entries from the general ledger to cost entries with each posting. You can also use a batch job to transfer general ledger entries to cost entries based on daily or monthly summary posting.  

In cost journals, you can post cost and activities that don't come from the general ledger or aren't generated by allocations. For example, you can post pure operational costs, internal charges, allocations, and corrective entries between cost types, cost centers, and cost objects individually, or on a recurring basis.  

## Cost allocations

Allocations move costs and revenues between cost types, cost centers, and cost objects. Overhead costs are first posted to cost centers and later charged to cost objects. An example would be a sales department that sells several products at the same time. The department's overhead costs, such as salaries, supplies, and travel expenses, are initially assigned to the sales cost center. The costs are then allocated between the different products (cost objects) sold, together with the materials purchased (direct cost).

The allocation base and the accuracy of the allocation definition influence the results of cost allocations. The allocation definition allocates costs first from so-called precost centers to main cost centers, and then from cost centers to cost objects.  

Each allocation consists of an allocation source and one or more allocation targets. You can allocate actual values or budgeted values using the static allocation method based on a definite value. For example, square footage, or an established allocation ratio of 5:2:4. You can also allocate actual values or budgeted values by using the dynamic allocation method with nine predefined allocation bases and 12 dynamic date ranges.  

## Cost budgets

Similar to budgeting in the general ledger, you can create budgets to plan for costs during a certain period (a fiscal year, for example), which can be applied to a cost center (company department), or a cost object (product or service). You can create as many cost budgets as you need. You can then copy the cost budget to the general ledger budget and vice versa. And you can transfer budgeted costs as actual costs.

## Cost reporting

Most reports and statistics are based on the posted cost entries. You can set the sorting of the results and use filters to define which data must be displayed. You can create reports for cost distribution analysis. In addition, you can use the standard financial reports to define how your reports for the chart of cost types are displayed.

# Managing OneDrive Integration with Business Central

This article provides an overview of what an administrator can do to control OneDrive for Business integration with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online customers benefit from automatic integration with no extra setup required to use the open and share in OneDrive features. With the **OneDrive Setup** assisted setup guide, you can give users access to even more OneDrive features, like opening Excel file in OneDrive&mdash;or even turn off all features.  

## Configure OneDrive for integration with Business Central

This section discusses requirements that must be met in OneDrive for Business to configure the integration with Business Central and task you can do to manage the integration.

### Minimum requirements

* Each user must have a license for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and OneDrive as part of a Microsoft 365 plan.
* OneDrive must be set up for each user.

### Managing privacy

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you've chosen to deploy Business Central and OneDrive to different countries or regions, the files generated by Business Central and placed in OneDrive may cross data residency boundaries. Make sure to confirm your organization's policies and government compliance requirements for data residency before enabling the connection to OneDrive.

Administrators and end users control the content stored in OneDrive, and this data is owned solely by your organization. For more information, see [How SharePoint and OneDrive safeguard your data in the cloud](/sharepoint/safeguarding-your-data). You can also visit our [Microsoft Privacy Statement](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=521839)<!--(https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/privacystatement)-->, which explains the data that Microsoft processes, how Microsoft processes it, and for what purposes.

By enabling this service connection, you agree:

(a) to share data from Dynamics 365 Business Central with the service provider, who will use it according to its terms and privacy policy; (b) the compliance levels of the service provider may be different than Dynamics 365 Business Central; and (c) Microsoft may share your contact information with this service provider if needed for it to operate and troubleshoot the service.

## Configure Business Central

With Business Central online, the connection between Business Central and OneDrive is automatically configured for you, and the OneDrive features are readily available to users by default. If you want to turn off some or all of the features off, you can use the **OneDrive Setup** assisted setup guide in the Business Central client.

Configuring Business Central on-premises is different because the connection between Business Central and OneDrive isn't configured for you. You'll have to do it manually. For more information, see [Configuring OneDrive Integration with Business Central On-premises](admin-onedrive-integration-onpremises.md).

### About multiple environments

OneDrive integration is configured per environment, that is, your settings will apply to all companies in that environment. If your organization has more than one environment, you'll have to configure OneDrive integration for each.

### Prerequisites

- Indirect, modify, and delete (imd) permission on table **Document Service Scenario** as a minimum

### Configure OneDrive using OneDrive Setup

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **OneDrive Setup**, and then choose the related link. 
2. The first time you run the assisted setup, you'll see the **Your privacy**. Read the information on the page, and if you agree to the terms choose **Agree** to continue.
3. On the **Configure OneDrive file handling** page, you have the following options to choose from:

   [!INCLUDE[onedrive-feature-options](includes/onedrive-feature-options.md)]
4. Choose **Next**>**Done**.

### Switching to new OneDrive integration after upgrade

The **OneDrive Setup** assisted setup was introduced in 2022 release wave 2, version 21.0. Previously, the OneDrive integration used the **SharePoint Connection Setup**, which has been deprecated and will be removed in 2023 release wave 2, version 23.0. After you've upgraded to version 21, OneDrive will still work as before. But we recommend that you switch to the new OneDrive integration. Making this switch now will make it easier when the **SharePoint Connection Setup** is eventually removed. Plus, it will enable you to use the **OneDrive Setup** assisted setup guide to manage the OneDrive features that are accessible to users. The **OneDrive Setup** assisted setup makes the transition from the legacy SharePoint setup easy and seamless.

To switch, just open and run the **OneDrive Setup** assisted setup directly, or open the **SharePoint Connection Setup** page and choose **Go to new OneDrive setup** in the notification at the top of the page. Follow the setup guide as described in the previous section.

## Restoring OneDrive and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]

As part of a disaster recovery exercise, administrators might need to restore a [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online environment to a backup from a time in the past, and synchronize OneDrive storage to that same point in time. OneDrive provides recovery various tools, such as restoring a user’s OneDrive to a previous time, restore a previous version of an individual file, or restore deleted files. For more information, see the following articles:

* For [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], see [Restoring an Environment in the Admin Center](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/tenant-admin-center-backup-restore).
* For OneDrive, see [Restore your OneDrive](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/restore-your-onedrive-fa231298-759d-41cf-bcd0-25ac53eb8a15?ui=en-us&rs=en-us&ad=us)

## Governance

The SharePoint admin center provides extensive control over policies that govern the use of OneDrive throughout the organization. Users who have at least the [SharePoint administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#sharepoint-administrator) role can set up policies that determine who can access OneDrive, where data resides, the content lifecycle, and much more. The following links provide information about often-used features and settings that may enhance your integration with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. 

* [Manage sharing settings](/sharepoint/turn-external-sharing-on-or-off)
* [Use information barriers with SharePoint](/sharepoint/information-barriers)
* [Learn about data loss prevention](/microsoft-365/compliance/dlp-learn-about-dlp)

# Use Allocation Keys in General Journals
You can allocate an entry in a general journal to several different accounts when you post the journal. The allocation can be made by quantity, percentage, or amount.

## To set up allocation keys
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Recurring General Journal**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **Batch Name** field to open the **General Journal Batches** page.
3. You can either modify allocations on an existing batch in the list or create a new batch with allocations.
   * To create a new batch, choose the **New** action, and go to the next step.
   * To change the allocations of an existing journal, select the journal and go to step 7.    
4. In the **Name** field, enter a name for the batch, such as CLEANING. In the **Description** field, enter a description, such as Cleaning Expenses Journal.
5. When you are done, close the page. A new, empty recurring journal opens.
6. Fill in the fields on the line.
7. Choose the **Allocations** action.
8. Add a line for each allocation. You must fill in either the **Allocation %**, **Allocation Quantity**, or **Amount** field. You must also fill in the **Account No.** field and, if you are allocating the transaction among global dimensions, the global dimension fields.
9. If you enter a percentage on a line, the amount in the **Amount** field is calculated automatically. These amounts have the opposite sign from the total amount in the **Amount** field in the recurring journal.
10. After entering the allocations lines, choose **OK** to return to the **Recurring General Journal** page. The **Allocated Amt. (USD)** field is filled in and matches the **Amount** field.

# Design details: Non-deductible VAT

Non-deductible value-added tax (VAT) is the VAT that's payable by a purchaser, but that isn't deductible from the purchaser's own VAT liability. Because it can be difficult to know where and how an item is used, you must contact the local tax authorities in your country or region to determine whether a specified percentage of the VAT is deductible. Even when you know that a specific percentage of the VAT isn't deductible, there are different models for handling non-deductible amounts as they are related to **items** and **fixed assets**.

## Prerequisites for using non-deductible VAT

To use and post non-deductible VAT, follow these steps.

1. On the **VAT Setup** page, select **Enable Non-Deductible VAT** to enable the feature.
2. On the **VAT Posting Setup** page, select which VAT posting groups can use non-deductible VAT.

## Examples

For the following examples, non-deductible VAT is enabled, and the following setup is completed:

- The **VAT Product Posting Group** field is set to **NDVAT**.
- On the **VAT Posting Setup** page:

    - **NDVAT** is set as the VAT product posting group, and **DOMESTIC** is set as the VAT business posting group.
    - The **VAT Identifier** value must be unique.
    - The **VAT %** field is set to **25**.
    - The **Allow Non-deductible VAT** field is set to **Allow**.
    - The **Non-deductible VAT %** field is set to **100**.
    - The **VAT Calculation Type** field is set to **Normal VAT**.
    - Only the sales VAT account and purchase VAT account are configured.

All the examples use items and fixed assets where the VAT product posting group is **NDVAT**.

### Items

A new item has **NDVAT** set as the VAT product posting group. In the purchase document, **Quantity** = **1** and **Direct Unit Cost Excl. VAT** = **1,000.00**.

Regardless of the option that's used, the results in the **VAT entry** are the same.

| Document Type | Type | Base | Amount | Non-Deductible VAT Base | Non-deductible VAT Amount |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Invoice | Purchase | 0.00 | 0.00 | 1,000.00 | 250.00 |

The details are shown in the **Value Entries**.

> [!NOTE]
> You can enable the **Use for Item Cost** field on the **VAT Setup** page.

#### Use for Item Cost isn't enabled

| Item Ledger Entry Type | Entry Type | Cost Amount (Actual) | Item Ledger Entry Quantity |
|---|---|---|---|
| Purchase | Direct Cost | 1,000.00 | 1 |

#### Use for Item Cost is enabled

| Item Ledger Entry Type | Entry Type | Cost Amount (Actual) | Item Ledger Entry Quantity |
|---|---|---|---|
| Purchase | Direct Cost | 1,250.00 | 1 |

### Fixed assets

A new fixed asset has the acquisition cost account set to use **NDVAT** as the VAT product posting group. In the purchase document, **Quantity** = **1** and **Direct Unit Cost Excl. VAT** = **1,000.00**.

Regardless of the option that's used, the results in the **VAT entry** are the same.

| Document Type | Type | Base | Amount | Non-Deductible VAT Base | Non-deductible VAT Amount |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Invoice | Purchase | 0.00 | 0.00 | 1,000.00 | 250.00 |

The details are shown in the **Fixed Asset Ledger Entries**.

> [!NOTE]
> You can enable the **Use for Fixed Asset Cost** field on the **VAT Setup** page.

#### Use for Fixed Asset Cost isn't enabled

| Document Type | FA Posting Type | Amount | VAT Amount |
|---|---|---|---|
| Invoice | Acquisition Cost | 1,000.00 | 250.00 |

#### Use for Fixed Asset Cost is enabled

| Document Type | FA Posting Type | Amount | VAT Amount |
|---|---|---|---|
| Invoice | Acquisition Cost | 1,000.00 | 250.00 |
| Invoice | Acquisition Cost | 250.00 | 0.00 |

# Create a demand forecast

You can create sales and production forecasts with the **Demand Forecasts** list page. Then, for each forecast, you specify various settings for that forecast in the **Demand Forecast Overview** page.  

Forecasting functionality is used to create anticipated demand; actual demand is created from sales and production orders. During creation of the Master Production Schedule (MPS), the forecast is netted against the sales and production orders. The **Forecast Type** field on the forecast determines which type of requirements to take into consideration in the netting process. If the forecast is for a *sales item*, only sales orders net the forecast. If it is for *components*, only dependent demand from production order components net the forecast.  

Forecasting allows your company to create "what if" scenarios and efficiently and cost-effectively plan for and meet demand. Accurate forecasting can make a critical difference in customer satisfaction levels with regard to order promising dates and on-time delivery.  

You can also define the right level of details in the **Forecast by Location** and **Forecast by Variant** fields in the **Demand Forecast Overview** page. Filters and other settings are stored in the **Demand Forecast Name** table, so you can easily stop and continue your work later. 

## Sales forecasts and production forecasts

The forecasting functionality in application can be used to create sales or production forecasts, in combination or independently. For example, most make-to-order companies do not carry finished goods inventory, because each item is produced when it is ordered. Anticipating orders (sales forecasting) is critical for a reasonable turnaround time on the finished goods (production forecasting). As an example, component parts with lengthy delivery times, if not on order or on inventory, can delay production.  

- The sales forecast is the sales department's best guess at what will be sold in the future, and is specified by item and by period. However, the sales forecast is not always adequate for production.  
- The production forecast is the production planner's projection of how many end items and derived subassemblies to produce in specific periods to meet the forecasted sales.  

In most cases, then, the production planner modifies the sales forecast to fit the conditions of production, yet still satisfies the sales forecast.  

You create forecasts manually on the **Demand Forecast** page. Multiple forecasts can exist in the system, and are differentiated by name and type. Forecasts can be copied and edited as necessary. 

> [!NOTE]
> Only one forecast is valid for planning purposes at any time.

The forecast consists of a number of records each stating item number, forecast date, and forecasted quantity. The forecast of an item covers a period, which is defined by the forecast date and the forecast date of the next (later) forecast record. From a planning point of view, the forecasted quantity should be available at the start of the demand period.  

You must designate a forecast as *Sales Item*, *Component*, or *Both*. The forecast type *Sales Item* is used for sales forecasting. The production forecast is created using the *Component* type. The forecast type *Both* is only used to give the planner an overview of both the sales forecast and the production forecast. With this option, the forecast entries are not editable. By designating these forecast types here, you can use the same worksheet to enter a sales forecast as you do a production forecast, and use the same sheet to view both forecasts simultaneously. Note that the system treats the different inputs (sales and production) differently when calculating planning, based on item, manufacturing, and production setup.  

## Component forecast

The component forecast can be seen as an option forecast in relation to a parent item. This can, for example, be useful if the planner can estimate the demand for the component.  

Because the component forecast is designed to define options for a parent item, the component forecast should be less than or equal to the sales item forecast quantity. If the component forecast is higher than the sales item forecast, the system treats the difference between these two types of forecasts as independent demand.  

## Forecasting periods

The forecast period is valid from its starting date until the date the next forecast starts. The time interval page gives you multiple choices to insert the demand at a specific date in a period. It is therefore recommended not to change the forecast period scope unless you want to move all forecast entries to the starting date of this period.  

## Forecast by locations

On the **Manufacturing Setup** page you can specify whether you want to consider the locations that are defined on forecasts when you calculate plans. 

### Use forecast by locations

If you turn on the **Use Forecast by Location** toggle, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] respects any location codes that are specified for each demand forecast entry and calculate the remaining forecast for each location.  

Consider this example: Your company purchases and sells items on two locations: EAST and WEST. For both locations, you have configured a lot-to-lot reordering policy. You create a forecast for the two locations:

- 10 pieces for location EAST
- 4 pieces for location WEST

Then, you create a sales order with a quantity of 12 on location WEST. The planning system will suggest that you do the following:

- Replenish 10 pieces for location EAST, based on data from the forecast.  
- Replenish 12 pieces for location WEST, based on the sales order. The four pieces that were specified in the forecast are fully consumed by the actual demand of the sales order. For more information, see [Forecast Demand is Reduced by Sales Orders](design-details-balancing-demand-and-supply.md#forecast-demand-is-reduced-by-sales-orders).  

> [!NOTE]  
> If location-based forecasts are viewed in isolation, the overall forecast might not be representative.

### If you don't use forecast by locations

If you turn off the **Use Forecast by Location** toggle, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] ignores the location codes that are specified for each demand forecast entry and aggregate the forecasts into a forecast for empty locations.  

Consider this example: Your company purchases and sells items on two locations: EAST and WEST. For both locations, you configured a lot-to-lot reordering policy. You create a forecast for the two locations:

- 10 pieces for location EAST
- 4 pieces for location WEST

Then, you create a sales order with a quantity of 12 on location WEST. The planning system suggests that you do the following:

- Replenish 12 pieces for location WEST, based on the sales order.  
- Replenish 2 pieces for the empty location. The 10 and 4 pieces that were specified in the forecast are partially consumed by the actual demand of the sales order. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] ignored the location codes that were specified by the user and uses a blank location instead.  

> [!NOTE]  
> You can set a filter by locations, but location-based results might not match planning results without filters.

## To create a demand forecast

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Demand Forecast**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **General** FastTab, select a forecast in the **Demand Forecast Name** field. Multiple forecasts can exist and are differentiated by name and forecast type.  
3. In the **Location Filter** field, select the location to which this forecast will apply.
4. In the **View by** field to change the period that is displayed in each column. You can select from the following intervals: **Day**, **Week**, **Month**, **Quarter**, **Year**, or the **Accounting Period** as set up in your finance area.

> [!NOTE]  
> You should consider which time interval that you want to use for future forecasts so that the time interval is consistent throughout. When you enter a forecast quantity, it is valid on the first day of the time interval that you select. For example, if you select a month, enter the forecast quantity on the first day of the month. If you select a quarter, enter the forecast quantity on the first day of the first month in the quarter.

5. In the **View as** field, select how the forecast quantities are shown for the time interval. If you select **Net Change**, then the net change in balance is displayed for the time interval. If you select **Balance at Date**, then the page displays the balance as of the last day in the time interval.  
6. In the **Forecast Type** field, select **Sales Item**,  **Component**, or **Both**. If you select **Sales Item** or **Component**, then you can edit the quantity by period. If you select **Both**, then you cannot edit the quantity, but you can choose the drop-down arrow button and view the demand forecast entries.  
7. Specify a **Date Filter** if you want to limit the amount of data displayed.  
8. On the **Demand Forecast Matrix** FastTab, enter the forecasted quantities by typing a quantity in the cell representing an item on a particular date or period. Note that in empty cells, the lookup button opens an empty page indicating that you must enter a value manually.   

> [!NOTE]  
> You can also edit an existing forecast. On the **Demand Forecast Matrix** page, choose the **Copy Demand Forecast** action and populate the **Demand Forecast** page with an existing forecast. You can then edit quantities as appropriate.

# Changing your language and region settings

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is available in many markets and languages, and [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers features to help companies comply with local regulatory requirements. You can use [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in different languages, and can change the language for display texts. If you change your language setting, sign out and sign in again to apply the change. The new setting applies only to you, and not to everyone else in your company.  

[!INCLUDE [about-ui-learn](includes/about-ui-learn.md)]

For example, you're using the Canadian version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. You can use [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in English, German, French, or another language, but it's still the Canadian version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. It isn't the same as [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in Germany, where features are adapted for German requirements.  

To change the language of the user interface, go to the **My Settings** page. To learn more, go to [Change Basic Settings](ui-change-basic-settings.md#language).

> [!NOTE]  
> The choice of languages resets to your setting on your Microsoft 365 profile if your administrator synchronizes users from Microsoft 365 to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

You can't change the texts that are stored as application data. Examples of such texts are the names of items in inventory, or the comments for a customer. In other words, these types of text aren't translated.  

> [!NOTE]  
> [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] only supports a single character set for data. Some characters might not be supported in your environment. You might experience problems when you try to view data that was entered using a different character set. For instance, your environment might support only English and Russian characters. In this case, if you enter data in a different language, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] might not store it correctly. Contact your system administrator to make sure you understand which languages are supported by your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

## Changing your region setting

Region is different from both language and legal requirements in local markets. Region determines how your data presents itself, such as the decimal separator, and how text aligns to the left or right. The region also determines some of the system elements in the browser, such as the action to create a new item in a list.  

You can change the region in the browser tab that you're using to work in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The change applies only to you and not to the other users in your company. The choice of region is reset to your setting on your Microsoft 365 profile if your administrator synchronizes users from Microsoft 365 into [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> When you change the region, you'll see a long list of languages and regions. However, the language isn't influenced by the choice of region.  

To change the region, go to the **My Settings** page. To learn more, go to [Change Basic Settings](ui-change-basic-settings.md).  

## Changing the region setting for customers, contacts, and vendors

Some businesses use an external service that validates address information in their country or region. However, when you need to update address information, the structured approach that these services use might not always be what's right for some scenarios. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers a more flexible means of entering address details.

On the **General Ledger Setup** page, if you turn on the **Require Country/Region Code in Address** toggle, changes to the **Country/Region Code** field on addresses for customers, contacts, or vendors resets the values in other address fields.

## Custom address formats for countries/regions

The countries and regions in which you do business might have different formats for addresses. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] lets you customize the format in which postal addresses show for each region. To define a custom format, on the **Countries/Regions** page, choose the **Custom Address Format** action. You can adjust the order of the address information by using the **Move Up** and **Move Down** actions. To change the field on a line, in the **Field ID** field, choose :::image type="content" source="media/assist-edit-icon.png" alt-text="The assist edit icon.":::, and then choose the field.

In some cases, you might need to add multiple fields on a line. By default, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] lets you combine the city, postal code, and country. To add multiple fields on a line, enter **0** in the **Field ID** field, and then choose the value in the **Line Format** field to open the **Custom Address Format Lines** page. Add a new line for each piece of information.

## Application version

In the **Help and Support** page, you can see the version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] that your company is based on. If you want to base a company on a different version, your administrator can create a new production environment. For more information, see [Create a new production environment](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/tenant-admin-center-environments#create-a-new-production-environment) in the developer- and IT Pro content.  

## Languages of the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Help

The Help content for the default version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] publishes to Microsoft Learn. The content is available in different languages. If you access the documentation while you're using [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the content displays in your language. By default, if a particular page isn't available in your language yet, it shows in English.

### How do I change the language of the Microsoft Learn site?

Scroll to the bottom of the browser page and choose the globe symbol in the bottom left corner.

> [!NOTE]  
> The list shows all languages that are supported by the Microsoft Learn site. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is available in a limited number of countries/regions, and the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Help content is not available in all languages that the Microsoft Learn site supports.

# Managing receivables

A regular step in any financial rhythm is to reconcile bank accounts. To close sales invoices and purchase credit memos as paid, you apply incoming payments to customer or vendor ledger entries.

While most customers in B2B environments pay some time after delivery, leaving the posted sales invoices open for the Accounts Receivable department to close (apply) when payment is received, some sales invoices can be paid immediately, for example with PayPal. Such invoices are immediately applied as paid when they're posted and, therefore, don't appear as payments to be processes in AR. For more information, see, for example, [Invoice Sales](sales-how-invoice-sales.md).  

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], one of the fastest ways to register payments is with the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page by importing a bank statement file or feed. The payments are applied to open customer or vendor ledger entries based on data matches between payment text and entry information. You can review and change the matches before you post the journal, and close bank account ledger entries for ledger entries when you post the journal. The bank account is reconciled when all payments are applied.

Other pages exist where you can either apply payments or reconcile bank accounts:

* The **Bank Account Reconciliations** page, where you reconcile bank accounts by matching imported bank statement lines with your system bank account ledger entries. Here, you can also reconcile check payments. For more information, see [Reconcile Bank Accounts](bank-how-reconcile-bank-accounts-separately.md). Here, you can't apply payments.
* The **Payment Registration** page, where you can manually apply payments received as cash, check, or bank transaction against a generated list of unpaid sales documents. This functionality is available only for sales documents. Here, you can't apply outgoing payments, and you can't reconcile bank accounts.
* The **Cash Receipt Journal** page, where you manually post receipts to the relevant general ledger, customer, or other account by entering a payment line. You can either apply the receipt or refund to one or more open entries before you post the cash receipt journal, or from the customer ledger entries. Here, you can't reconcile bank accounts.

The **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page uses automatic matching logic that you can set up on the **Payment Application Rules** page. For more information, see [Set Up Rules for Automatic Application of Payments](receivables-how-set-up-payment-application-rules.md).  

Other aspects of managing receivables include to collect outstanding balances, including finance charges and reminders, and to set bank accounts up to allow customers' payments to be withdrawn from their account automatically.

# Chat with Copilot (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]

This article explains how to chat with Copilot to get answers about your company data and assistance with tasks and subject matters related to Business Central.​

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/production-ready-preview-dynamics365.md)]

## About chat with Copilot

Microsoft Copilot is an AI-powered assistant that helps spark creativity, boost productivity, and eliminate tedious tasks. By chatting with Copilot in Business Central, you can ask questions and find business data using natural language. Here's what you can do:

- Find business data for your company in Business Central. Use chat to look up and open data about entities or records related to business processes, such as customers, vendors, sales orders, and items. For example, ask: "Show me the latest sales order for Adatum".

  Copilot can also organize data for you. Just ask it to group records or do calculations like adding or averaging, and it generates an analysis tab, displaying the results.

- Get explanations or step-by-step guidance on various tasks. For example, ask: "Help me understand dimensions" or "How do I post a sales order". Learn more about prompting in [Prompting for aggregating data on analysis tabs](#prompting-for-aggregating-data-on-analysis-tabs).
- Know the purpose and use of each field. When you choose **Ask Copilot** in a tooltip for a field, chat opens with an Explain prompt for the field name and Copilot provides information about it. Copilot links to the articles it referenced, so it's easy to verify the description.
  
Using chat with Copilot streamlines your workflow by bypassing traditional navigation and product help. Watch [Work smarter with Copilot in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2250609) to learn more.

Copilot's source responses are generated from the official [Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central documentation](/dynamics365/business-central/) page.

## Prerequisites

- For Business Central update 25.3 through 25.5, Chat with Copilot feature must be enabled on the **Feature Management** page by an administrator. Learn more in [Enabling Upcoming Features Ahead of Time](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/feature-management).
- The **Chat** capability is activated by an administrator. Learn more in [Configuring Copilot and agent capabilities](enable-ai.md).

## Get started using chat with Copilot

1. In the upper-right corner of the screen, select the ![Shows the icon for chat with Copilot](media/chat-copilot-icon.png) **Copilot** icon ![Shows cllour number 1](media/callout-number-1.svg).

   The **Copilot** pane appears as shown in the image:

    ![Shows the icon for chat with Copilot pane with callouts](media/chat-with-copilot-pane.svg)

1. In the **Ask a question** box at the bottom ![Shows callout number 2](media/callout-number-2.svg), enter your question, and then select the arrowhead or press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to get an answer.

   Your input, known as a *prompt*, can be a question, statement, or command.

   > [!TIP]
   > Copilot includes a couple of features that can help you write questions:
   > - To help formulate questions, select one of the prompt guides&mdash;**Find**, **Explain**, or **Guide**&mdash;available at the top of the pane ![Shows callout number 3](media/callout-number-3.svg) or from the ![Shows prompt guide icon](media/prompt-guide-icon.png) **View Prompts**  icon above **Ask a question** box ![Shows callout number 4](media/callout-number-4.svg). Prompt guides are predefined short phrases that begin a question or prompt. They save you time, guide Copilot's responses toward a category of answers, and help you learn how to phrase questions to get the best responses.
   > - Select the prompt suggestions above the **View prompts** button ![Shows callout number 5](media/callout-number-5.svg) to automatically ask a predefined question to see how the questions and answers work. Prompt suggestions are only available when you're using the CRONUS demonstration company.

1. Review the answers displayed in the Copilot pane ![Shows callout number 6](media/callout-number-6.svg).

   The answers you receive depend on your question—it could include text, links to pages in Business Central, or helpful articles from Microsoft Learn.

   To assist you better, Chat might ask for more details about your prompt and give you a few options to choose from. In some instances, Chat follows an answer with related prompt suggestions for you to choose from ![Shows callout number 5](media/callout-number-5.svg).

1. Ask another question to refine the answer.

   Chat remembers the context, which means that you don't have to repeat key points from the original question.

## Clear chat to start over

To switch to a different topic with Copilot, select the ![Shows the clear chat icon](media/clear-chat-icon.png) **Start a new Copilot chat session**  icon at the bottom of the Copilot pane, just above the question box. This clears Copilot's memory of your last few messages. Starting over is often helpful after a lengthy conversation and it can help Copilot deliver more accurate answers.

The chat also clears if you close or sign out of Business Central.

## Tips for better questions

### Basic techniques to improve the answers

Here are some ways you can improve the answers you get from Copilot:

- Ask clear and specific questions.
- Be concise and avoid long sentences or multiple sentences.
- Ask one question at a time. <!--Avoid asking about multiple questions in one message.-->
- Use natural language, expressing the questions in a friendly and conversational manner.
- Use keywords, phrases, and terms that you know are used in Business Central, either in the app or documentation.
- Ask follow-up questions or rephrase the last question if the initial response doesn't fully answer your questions.
- Clear the current chat session to start over if you're asking a question on a different subject matter than the previous question.

### Prompting for aggregating data on analysis tabs

If you prompt using phrases related to data aggregation, chat creates an analysis tab that you can open from a link it replies with in the Copilot pane. For example, the following figure illustrates an answer you could get for the prompt: "In which countries are my top customer?":

![Shows a link tot ana analysis tab in the chat with Copilot pane](media/chat-analysis-tab.png)

To generate this type of response, use common words and phrases related to data aggregation and analysis, like "group", "pivot", "sum", "average", "most", and "least", in different variations. For example:

`show me customers grouped by their country and zipcode`  
`which customers got most discounts`  
`group the current records by name and location`  

Learn more about analysis tabs in [Analyze data in lists with help from Copilot](analysis-assist.md).

### Example prompts

Your questions to Copilot vary depending on your role, current task, the processes that your organization follows, and how you express yourself in words. Here are some examples to show different ways to ask questions in the chat pane to help inspire you to write your own based on your situation.

Prompt: `Find the Item with Description 'ATHENS Desk'`

In this example, you give clear instructions for Copilot to locate a single record. For example, you hint that the record is found in the Item list. You indicate the field 'Description' must be a specific text that you typed using quotes and with correct capitalization. Copilot usually responds accurately when given a few precise hints, but you can also use more casual language as in the next example.

Prompt: `Give me the latest invoice for adatum`

In this example, you ask Copilot to locate a record, but the question is less precise and might result in a less accurate answer. Copilot can often understand, or guess, that the invoice you're looking for isn't a purchase invoice but a sales invoice from the Posted Sales Invoice list. Copilot would also need to match `adatum` with `Adatum Corporation` that is the full and precise name for the sell-to Customer name associated with the invoice.

Prompt: `Show me customer ledger entries for Adatum from about three weeks ago`

In this example, you ask Copilot to solve a common date puzzle that typically requires you to open a calendar for reference, or to use advanced date range filters. Copilot can usually understand common expressions and business terms.

Prompt: `How does I save my filterrings for later?`

In this example, you ask Copilot for guidance on how to perform some task in Business Central. Copilot can usually understand the intent of your question, even if there are a few grammatical errors, spelling mistakes or abbreviations.

## Provide feedback on answers

You can rate the answers you get from Copilot by using the like (thumbs up) button for good rating or the dislike (thumbs down) button for a poor rating. When you select the dislike button, you can choose a reason, including inaccurate, inappropriate, or other. This information can help us improve suggestions.

# Row definitions in Financial Reporting

Row definitions in financial reports provide a place for calculations that can't be made directly in the chart of accounts. For example, you can create subtotals for groups of accounts and then include that total in other totals. You can also calculate intermediate steps that aren't shown in the final report.

## Create a new row definition

To create a new row definition, follow these steps:

1. On the **(Financial Report) Row Definitions** page, choose the **New** action.
1. Enter a unique name for the definition.
1. In the **Description/* field, enter a descriptive name for the definition. This description provides context when you use the definition, but doesn't show on the report.
1. Enter an internal description for the definition.

## Edit the content of a row definition

To edit the content of a row definition, follow these steps:

1. On the **(Financial Report) Row Definitions** page, select the relevant definition, and then choose the **Edit Row Definition** action.
1. Choose the **Insert G/L Accounts**, **Insert CF Accounts**, and **Insert Cost Types** actions to create a row for each financial element you want to analyze. For example, you might have one row for current assets and another row for fixed assets. For inspiration, explore the financial reports in the CRONUS demonstration company.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The **Row No.** field shows the first 10 characters of an identifier, such as an account number. You use these identifiers for calculated rows in the **Totalling** field. If needed, you can manually edit the identifiers after you insert the elements.

   > [!NOTE]
   > The columns you define in a column definition represent columns three and up on the **Financial Report** page. The first two columns, **Row No.** and **Description**, are fixed.  

1. To format the rows, choose the **Bold**, **Italic**, **Underline**, and **Double Underline** checkboxes. To learn more about formatting, go to [Format your financial reporting](#format-rows-in-your-financial-reports).

## Working with row formulas

A powerful feature in Financial Reporting is that you can use values computed in previous rows in row formulas defined in subsequent rows. Set the **Totaling Type** to **Formula**, and then write your calculation in the **Totalling** field on the same row.

The following excerpt of a row definition illustrates how row formulas work. Your chart of accounts structure might differ from the accounts shown.

| Row No. | Description | Totaling Type | Totaling | ... | Show |
| ------- | ------|-------- | -------- | --- | ---- |
|         | ## Revenue calculation start | Formula      |                              | | No   |
| R      | Product Revenue | Posting Accounts      | 40000..40209                 | | Yes |
| R      | Discounts and Returns | Posting Accounts | 40910..40919 \| 40940..49999 | | Yes |
| F1      | Total Revenue    | Formula               | R                            | | Yes |
|         | ## Revenue calculation end   | Formula      |                              | | No   |
| L       | Total liabilities  | Account Category     | Liabilities                  | | Yes |
|         | Revenue to liabilities | Formula      | F1 / L                          | | Yes |

The example illustrates some different tips and tricks:

* You can use a formula row as a code comment. Remember to set the **Show** option to **No**.
* The formula in row F1 summarizes all numbers from rows with **R** in the **Row No.** field (the Row No. setting doesn't have to be unique).
* You can use results from previous calculations in new row formulas.

## Built-in row definitions

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides sample row definitions that can help you quickly get started setting up finance reports that suit your needs.

<!-- update this when we release the new templates in 24.1
| Row definition code | Description | How to use this row definition | 
| ------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------ | 
| TBA 1 | TBA 1 | TBA 1 |
| TBA 2 | TBA 2 | TBA 2 |
| TBA 3 | TBA 3 | TBA 3 |
| TBA 4 | TBA 4 | TBA 4 | 
-->

> [!NOTE]
> The sample finance reports in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] aren't ready to use out of the box. Depending on how you set up your G/L accounts, dimensions, G/L account categories, and budgets, adjust the sample row and column definitions and the finance reports that use them to match your setup.

## Format rows in your financial reports

On the **Row Definition** page, you can format the rows in a row definition to provide visual cues that make it easier to find key information quickly. For example, lines that calculate totals often use bold font.

The following table describes the different formatting options on a row:

| Formatting property | How the row is displayed | On-screen | PDF/Print |
| ------------------- | ------------------------ | --------- | --------- |
| Bold                | The row header is formatted in bold. | Yes | Yes |
| Italic              | The row header is formatted in italics. | No | Yes |
| Underline           | The columns in the report are formatted with an underline. Typically used rows that display a subtotal. | No | Yes |
| Double Underline    | The columns in the report are formatted with a double underline. Typically used for rows that display a total. | No | Yes |
| New Page            | If you want to make a report with different sections separated by page breaks in the report output (for PDF or print), use this property on a row. This setting inserts a page break after the row.  | No | Yes |
| Show Opposite Sign  | The data in columns is formatted with the opposite sign from how they're calculated. Typically used to show debits in reports as negative amounts with a minus sign and credits as positive amounts. | Yes | Yes |

> [!NOTE]
> Some of the formatting options don't carry over to reports when you use the Export to Excel action. If you often export reports to Excel, you might just use the tools that Excel provides rather than row definitions.

## Adding empty lines in your financial reports

If you want to add an empty line to a financial report, you can add a row and set the **Totalling Type** field.

The following table describes the different formatting options for a row that define an empty line:

| Value of the Totalling Type property | How the row is displayed | On-screen | PDF/Print |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------ | --------- | --------- |
| Formula (with empty Totalling value)     | The row is empty. | Yes | Yes |
| Underline           | The columns on the row are empty and are formatted with an underline. Typically used for rows that display a section. | No | Yes |
| Double Underline    | The columns on the row are empty and are formatted with a double underline. Typically used for rows that display the final part of a section. | No | Yes |

## Conditionally display rows in your financial reports

On the **Row Definition** page, the **Show** setting on rows defines whether they show in the report output for PDF or print.

The following table describes the different display options on a row:

| Value of the Show setting | Whether the row displays |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| Yes | Row always shows. |
| No | Row never shows. Use this setting for rows that are only used in calculation steps. |
| If any column not zero | If any column in the report has a nonzero value, the row shows. Otherwise, it doesn't show. |
| When positive balance | If column data in the report has positive values, the row shows. Otherwise, it doesn't show. |
| When negative balance | If column data in the report has negative values, the row shows. Otherwise, it doesn't show. |

## Use G/L account categories to change the layout of your financial statements

You can use G/L account categories to change the layout of your financial statements. For example, after you set up your account categories on the **G/L Account Categories** page, you can choose the **Generate Financial Reports** action and update the underlying financial reports for the core financial reports. The next time you run one of these reports, such as the **Balance Statement** report, new totals, and subentries are added.

Another benefit of using G/L account categories over the G/L accounts in your row definitions is that a change in your chart of accounts structure doesn't affect your financial reports.

The following excerpt of a row definition illustrates how you can use account categories. Your chart of accounts structure and use of account categories might differ from the example.

| Row No. | Description                | Totaling Type    | Totaling    | ... | Show |
| ------- | -------------------------- | ---------------- | ----------- | --- | ---- |
|         | // Worlds smallest balance sheet | Formula          |             |     | No   |
| A       | Total assets                     | Account Category | Assets      |     | Yes  |
| L       | Total liabilities                | Account Category | Liabilities |     | Yes  |
|         |                                  | Underline        |             |     | Yes  |
|         | Balance                          | Formula          | A+L         |     | Yes  |
|         |                                  | Double underline |             |     | Yes  |

> [!NOTE]
> The top-level account categories, such as the **Liabilities** node, are fixed, and you can't add your own. However, you can delete and add account categories at lower levels and define how the related financial report displays.
>
> You should create and structure your own lower-level G/L account categories from scratch, in a hierarchy if needed, rather than try to rearrange the existing ones. For example, you can restructure the **Liabilities** node to contain a new **Equity** node followed by the **Current Liabilities** and **Long Term Liabilities** nodes. Learn more at [Mapping general ledger accounts to account categories](finance-general-ledger.md#account-categories).

## Find the reports that use a row definition

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/introduced_in_2025rw1.md)]

Before you change a row definition, it can be helpful to know which reports use it so that you understand the effect of your change. To find out which reports use a row definition, follow these steps:

1. On the **(Financial Report) Row Definitions** page, select the definition, and then choose the **Edit Row Definition** action.
1. To open a list of reports that use the definition, choose the **Where-Used** action.

## Best practices for working with row definitions

Row definitions aren't versioned. When you change a row definition, the old version is replaced when your change saves to the database. The following list contains some best practices for working with row definitions:

* If you add row definitions, choose a good code and fill in the description field with a meaningful text while you still know what you use the row definition for. This information helps your coworkers (and your future self) to work with financial reporting and perhaps changing the row definition.
* Use the **Where-Used** action to learn where a row definition is used before you make any changes to it.
* Before you change a row definition, consider taking a copy of it as a backup, just in case your change doesn't work as expected. You can either just copy the definition (give it a good name), or export it. To learn more, go to [Import or export row definitions](#import-or-export-financial-reporting-row-definitions).
* If you need a fresh copy of a definition that [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides, an easy way to get one is to create a new company that only contains setup data. Then, export the definition and import it in the company where the definition needs a refresh.

## Import or export financial reporting row definitions

You can import and export financial row definitions as RapidStart configuration packages. For example, configuration packages are useful for sharing information with other companies. The package is created in a RAPIDSTART file that compresses the contents.

> [!NOTE]
> When you import row definitions, the records replace existing records with the same names. It doesn't overwrite existing row or column definitions that the report definition uses.

To import or export financial report row definitions, follow these steps:

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 4.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Row Definitions**, then choose the related link.
1. Choose the row definition, then choose the **Import Row Definition** or **Export Row Definition** action, depending on what you want to do.

# Delivering Service
[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides features to help you deliver service according to the contracts that you have created and the service orders that you have committed to fulfilling. Your service technicians or dispatcher will find outstanding service orders easy to locate when they use the **Dispatch Board**. At a glance, the **Dispatch Board** shows which orders are in progress and which orders are complete.  
  
Another way to review pending service orders is to use the **Service Tasks** page. In this view of your service obligations, you can see where in your service workflow an order is and change that status to reflect interactions with your customer.  
  
The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the topics that describe them.   

A service management application must interface with a customer request for service. That service request usually is translated into a service order. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides tools to create an order both directly in response to a customer request or as part of the contract process, if that is how your application is set up.  
  
If needed, you can manage a loaner program for your customers. You can also determine your pricing structure, put service pricing offerings into logical groupings, and create price adjustments.  
  
The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the topics that describe them.

# Design details: accounts in the general ledger

To reconcile inventory and capacity ledger entries with the general ledger, the related value entries are posted to different accounts in the general ledger. For more information, see [Design Details: Reconciliation with the General Ledger](design-details-reconciliation-with-the-general-ledger.md).  

## From the Inventory Ledger  

The following table shows the relationship between different types of inventory value entries and the accounts and balancing accounts in the general ledger.  

|**Item Ledger Entry Type**|**Value Entry Type**|**Variance Type**|**Expected Cost**|**Account**|**Balancing Account**|  
|--------------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------|---------------------------|  
|Purchase|Direct Cost||Yes|Inventory  (Interim)|Invt. Accrual Acc. (Interim)|  
|Purchase|Direct Cost||No|Inventory|Direct Cost Applied|  
|Purchase|Indirect Cost||No|Inventory|Overhead Applied|  
|Purchase|Variance|Purchase|No|Inventory|Purchase Variance|  
|Purchase|Revaluation||No|Inventory|Inventory Adjmt.|

|Assembly Output|Variance|Capacity Overhead|No|Inventory|Cap. Overhead Variance|  
|Assembly Output|Variance|Manufacturing Overhead|No|Inventory|Mfg. Overhead Variance|  
|Assembly Output|Rounding||No|Inventory|Inventory Adjmt.|  

## From the Capacity Ledger  

 The following table shows the relationship between different types of capacity value entries and the accounts and balancing accounts in the general ledger. Capacity ledger entries represent labor time consumed in assembly or production work.  

|**Work Type**|**Capacity Ledger Entry Type**|**Value Entry Type**|**Account**|**Balancing Account**|  
|-------------------|------------------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------|---------------------------|  
|Assembly|Resource|Direct Cost|Direct Cost Applied|Inventory Adjmt.|  
|Assembly|Resource|Indirect Cost|Overhead Applied|Inventory Adjmt.|  
|Production|Machine Center/Work Center|Direct Cost|WIP Account|Direct Cost Applied|  
|Production|Machine Center/Work Center|Indirect Cost|WIP Account|Overhead Applied|  

## Assembly costs are always actual  

 As shown in the table above, assembly postings are not represented in interim accounts. This is because the concept of work in process (WIP) does not apply in assembly output posting, unlike in production output posting. Assembly costs are only posted as actual cost, never as expected cost.  

 For more information, see [Design Details: Assembly Order Posting](design-details-assembly-order-posting.md).  

## Calculating the amount to post to the general ledger  

 The following fields in the **Value Entry** table are used to calculate the expected cost amount that is posted to the general ledger:  

- Cost Amount (Actual)  
- Cost Posted to G/L  
- Cost Amount (Expected)  
- Expected Cost Posted to G/L  

The following table shows how the amounts to post to the general ledger are calculated for the two different cost types.  

|Cost Type|Calculation|  
|---------------|-----------------|  
|Actual Cost|Cost Amount (Actual) – Cost Posted to G/L|  
|Expected Cost|Cost Amount (Expected) –  Expected Cost Posted to G/L|

# Process purchase returns or cancellations

If you want to return items to your vendor or cancel services you purchased, you can create and post a purchase credit memo that specifies the requested change to the original purchase invoice. To include the correct purchase invoice information, you can create the purchase credit memo directly from the posted purchase invoice or you can create a new purchase credit memo with copied invoice information.

If you need more control of the purchase return process, such as warehouse documents for the item handling or better overview when shipping back items from multiple purchase documents with one purchase return, then you can create purchase return orders. A purchase return order automatically issues the related purchase credit memo. Learn more at [To create a purchase return order based on one or more a posted purchase documents](purchasing-how-process-purchase-returns-cancellations.md#to-create-a-purchase-credit-memo-from-a-posted-purchase-invoice).

> [!NOTE]  
> If a posted purchase invoice isn't paid, you can use the **Correct** or **Cancel** actions on the posted purchase invoice to automatically reverse the transactions. These actions only work for unpaid invoices, and they don't support partial returns or cancellations. Also, you can't correct or cancel purchase invoices that were posted with receipts from more than one purchase order. Learn more at [Correct or Cancel Unpaid Purchase Invoices](purchasing-how-correct-cancel-unpaid-purchase-invoices.md).

Typically, you create a purchase credit memo or purchase return order in reaction to a credit memo sent to you by a vendor. You can use purchase credit memos or purchase return orders to document your credit memo process. For example, they're useful for accounting purposes or to control the shipping of the items.

The change might relate to all or only some of the products on the original purchase invoice. Accordingly, you can partially return received items or ask for partial reimbursement of received services. In that case, you must edit the information on the purchase credit memo or purchase return order.

In addition to the original posted purchase invoice, you can apply the purchase credit memo or purchase return order to other purchase documents. For example, another posted purchase invoice because you're also returning items delivered with that invoice.

The credit memo posting also reverts item charges that were assigned to the posted document, so that the item's value entries are the same as before you assigned the item charge.

## Inventory costing

To keep inventory valuation correct, you typically want to pick return items from inventory at the unit cost that they were purchased at, not at their current unit cost. This process is referred to as exact cost reversing.

There are two actions that assign exact cost reversing automatically.  

|Function|Description|  
|------------------|---------------------------------------|  
|**Get Posted Document Lines to Reverse** action on the **Purchase Return Order** page|Copies lines of one or more posted documents to be reversed into the purchase return order. Learn more at [To create a purchase return order based on one or more posted purchase documents](purchasing-how-process-purchase-returns-cancellations.md#to-create-a-purchase-return-order-based-on-one-or-more-posted-purchase-documents).|  
|**Copy from Document** action on the **Purchase Credit Memo** and **Purchase Return Order** pages|Copies both the header and lines of one posted document to reverse.<br /><br /> Requires that the **Exact Cost Reversing Mandatory** checkbox is selected on the **Purchases & Payables Setup** page.|

To assign exact cost reversing manually, choose the **Appl.-from Item Entry** field on any type of return document line, and then select the number of the original purchase entry. This setting links the purchase credit memo or purchase return order to the original purchase sales entry. It also ensures that the item is valued at the original unit cost.

Learn more at [Design Details: Inventory Costing](design-details-inventory-costing.md).

## To create a purchase credit memo from a posted purchase invoice

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Posted Purchase Invoices**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Posted Purchase Invoices** page, select the posted purchase invoice that you want to reverse, and then choose the **Create Corrective Credit Memo** action.

    Most fields on the purchase credit memo header are filled with the information from the posted purchase invoice. You can edit all the fields, for example with new information that reflects the return agreement.
3. Edit information on the lines according to the agreement, such as the number of items returned or the amount to be reimbursement.
4. Choose the **Apply Entries** action.
5. On the **Apply Vendor Entries** page, select the line with the posted purchase document that you want to apply the purchase credit memo to, and then choose the **Applies-to ID** action. The number of the purchase credit memo is inserted in the **Applies-to ID** field.
6. In the **Amount to Apply** field, enter the amount that you want to apply if smaller than the original amount.

    At the bottom of the **Apply Vendor Entries** page, you can see the total amount to apply to reverse all involved entries, namely when the value in the **Balance** field is zero.
7. Choose the **OK** button. When you post the purchase credit memo, it's applied to the specified posted purchase documents.
8. Choose the **Post** action.

The posted purchase invoices that you apply the credit memo to are now reversed. If you already paid the original invoice, the vendor should now refund the payment to you. If the credit memo is only for part of the product on the original invoice, you might only pay the remaining amount on the original purchase invoice to close it.

The purchase credit memo is removed and replaced with a new document in the list of posted purchase credit memos.

## To create a purchase credit memo by copying a posted purchase invoice

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Credit Memos**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action to open a new empty purchase credit memo.
3. In the **Vendor** field, enter the name of an existing vendor.
4. Choose the **Copy from Document** action.
5. On the **Copy Purchase Document** page, in the **Document Type** field, select **Posted Invoice**.
6. Choose the **Document No.** field to open the **Posted Purchase Invoices** page, and then select the posted purchase invoice that contains lines that you want to reverse.
7. Select the **Recalculate Lines** check box if you want the copied posted purchase invoice lines to be updated with any changes in item price and unit cost since the invoice was posted.
8. Choose the **OK** button. The copied invoice lines are inserted in the purchase credit memo.
9. Complete the purchase credit memo as explained in [To create a purchase credit memo from a posted purchase invoice](purchasing-how-process-purchase-returns-cancellations.md#to-create-a-purchase-credit-memo-from-a-posted-purchase-invoice).

## To create a purchase return order based on one or more posted purchase documents

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Return Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. Fill in the fields on the **General** FastTab as necessary.
4. On the **Lines** FastTab, fill the lines manually, or copy information from other documents to fill the lines automatically:

    - Use the **Get Posted Document Lines to Reverse** action to copy one or more posted document lines from one or more posted documents. This action always exactly reverses the costs from the posted document line.
    - Use the **Copy from Document** action to copy an entire existing document to the return order. It can be either a posted or unposted document. This action only enables exact cost reversing when the **Exact Cost Reversing Mandatory** checkbox is selected on the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page.  

5. Choose the **Get Posted Document Lines to Reverse** action.
6. At the top of the **Posted Purchase Document Lines** page, select the **Show Reversible Lines Only** checkbox if you only want lines that have quantities that aren't yet returned. For example, if a posted purchase invoice quantity was already returned, you might not want to include that quantity on a new purchase return document.

    > [!NOTE]  
    > This field only works for posted receipts and posted invoice lines. It doesn't work for posted return or posted credit memo lines.  

    The left side of the page lists the different document types. The number in brackets shows the number of documents available of each document type.

7. In the **Document Type Filter** field, select the type of posted document lines you want to use.  
8. Select the lines that you want to copy to the new document.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > If you use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd> to select all lines, all lines within the filter you set are copied, but the **Show Reversible Quantity Only** filter is ignored. For example, suppose you filtered the lines to a particular document number with two lines, and one of which was already returned. Even if the **Show Reversible Quantity Only** field is selected, if you select <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd> to copy all lines, both lines are copied, instead of only the one that isn't reversed.  

9. Choose the **OK** button to copy the lines to the new document.  

    The following processes occur:  

    - For posted document lines of the type **Item**, a new document line is created as a copy of the posted document line, with the quantity that isn't reversed yet. The **Appl.-to Item Entry** field shows the number of the item ledger entry of the posted document line.  

    - For posted document lines that aren't of the type **Item**, such as item charges, a new document line is created as a copy of the original posted document line.  

    - Calculates the **Unit Cost (LCY)** field on the new line from the costs on the corresponding item ledger entries.  

    - If the copied document is a posted shipment, posted receipt, posted return receipt, or posted return shipment, the unit price is calculated automatically from the item.  

    - If the copied document is a posted invoice or credit memo, the unit price, invoice discounts, and line discounts from the posted document line are copied.  

    - If the posted document line contains item tracking lines, the **Appl.-to Item Entry** field on the item tracking lines is filled with the appropriate item ledger entry numbers from the posted item tracking lines.  

     When you copy from a posted invoice or posted credit memo, you copy the invoice discounts and line discounts that were valid at the time the document posted. Be aware, however, that if the **Calc. Inv. Discount** toggle on the **Purchases & Payables Setup** page is turned on, the invoice discount recalculates when you post the new document line. The amount for the new line might therefore be different than the line amount for the posted document line, depending on the new calculation of the invoice discount.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > If part of the quantity of the posted document line is reversed, sold, or consumed, a line is created for the quantity that remains in inventory or that wasn't returned. If the full quantity of the posted document line was already reversed, a new document line isn't created.  
    >
    > If the flow of goods in the posted document is the same as the flow of goods in the new document, a copy of the original posted document line in the new document is created. The **Appl.-from Item Entry** field isn't filled in because exact cost reversing isn't possible. For example, if you use the **Get Posted Document Lines to Reverse** action to get a posted purchase credit memo line for a new purchase credit memo, only the original posted credit memo line is copied to the new credit memo.  

10. On the **Purchase Return Order** page, in the **Return Reason Code** field on each line, select the reason for the return.
11. Choose the **Post** action.

## To create a replacement purchase order from a purchase return order

You might agree with your vendor that they compensate you for a purchased item by replacing the item. The replacement item can be the same or it can be different. This situation could occur if the vendor mistakenly shipped the wrong item.  

1. On the **Purchase Return Order** page for an active return process, on an empty line, make a negative entry for the replacement item by entering a negative amount in the **Quantity** field.  
2. Choose the **Move Negative Lines** action.  
3. On the **Move Negative Purchase Lines** page, fill in the fields as necessary.
4. Choose the **OK** button. The negative line is deleted from the purchase return order, and a new purchase order is created. Learn more at [Record Purchases](purchasing-how-record-purchases.md).  

## To create a purchase allowance

If you receive items that what you want, for example, the items are damaged, the wrong color, or the wrong size, the vendor might offer you a purchase allowance.  

You can post this reduced purchase cost as an item charge on a credit memo or return order and link it to the posted receipt. The following steps describe it for a purchase return order, but the same steps apply to a purchase credit memo.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Credit Memos**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action to open a new empty purchase credit memo.  
3. Fill in the credit memo header with information about the vendor who sent you the purchase allowance.  
4. On the **Lines** FastTab, in the **Type** field, select **Charge (Item)**.  
5. In the **No.** field, select the appropriate item charge value.  

    You might want to create a special item charge number to cover purchase allowances.  
6. In the **Quantity** field, enter **1**.  
7. In the **Direct Unit Cost** field, enter the amount of the purchase allowance.  
8. Assign the purchase allowance as an item charge to the items in the posted receipt. For more information, see [Use Item Charges to Account for Additional Trade Costs](payables-how-assign-item-charges.md). After you assign the allowance, return to the **Purchase Credit Memo** page.

When you post the purchase return order, the purchase allowance is added to the relevant purchase entry amount. In this way, you can maintain accurate inventory valuation.  

## To combine return shipments

If you want to return items covered by different purchase return orders to the same vendor, you can use the **Combine Return Shipments** action.  

When you ship the items, you post the related purchase return orders as shipped, which creates posted purchase return shipments.  

When you're ready to invoice these items, instead of invoicing each purchase return order separately, you can create a purchase credit memo and automatically copy the posted purchase return shipment lines to it. Then you can post the purchase credit memo and invoice all the open purchase return orders at the same time.  

When return shipments are combined on a credit memo and posted, then a posted purchase credit memo is created for the invoiced lines. The **Quantity Invoiced** field on the originating purchase return order is updated based on the invoiced quantity. However, the original purchase return order isn't deleted, even if it was fully received and invoiced. You must delete the purchase return order manually.

> [!NOTE]  
> The following procedure assumes that there are several purchase return orders for the vendor, and that they're posted as shipped.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Credit Memos**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. On the **General** FastTab, fill in the fields as necessary.  
4. Choose the **Get Return Shipment Lines** action.  
5. Select multiple return shipment lines that you want to include in the invoice.  

    If an incorrect return shipment line was selected or you want to start over, you can just delete the lines on the purchase credit memo and then use the **Get Return Shipment Lines** action again.  
6. Choose the **Post** action.  

### To remove open purchase return orders after combined return shipment posting  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Delete Invoiced Purchase Return Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary, and then choose the **OK** button.  
3. Alternatively, delete the individual purchase return orders manually.

# Enable Customer Payments Through Payment Services

As an alternative to collecting payments through bank transfer or credit cards, your customers can pay you through their account with payment services, such as PayPal or WorldPay.  

After you enable a payment service in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], a link to the service is available on sales documents that you send by email to your customers. Customers can use the link to go to the payment service and pay the bill, directly from the sales document. If you don't want to include the link, for example, if a customer will pay with cash, you can remove the payment service from the invoice before posting.  

The PayPal Payments Standard and WorldPay Payments Standard extensions are installed in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], and are ready for you to enable.  

> [!CAUTION]
> The WorldPay Payments Standard extension will be deprecated. The code is market as obsolete starting in 2023 release wave 2. The app will be active for the next three major releases and then it will be removed.   

## To enable a payment service in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Payment Services**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Payment Services** page, choose the **New** action.

# (Obsolete) Create and modify custom report layouts

[!INCLUDE[legacy-custom-layouts](includes/legacy-custom-layouts.md)]

By default, reports have a built-in layout. The report layout can be either an RDLC (report definition language client side) report layout, a Microsoft Word report layout, or both. And while you can't modify built-in layouts, you can create custom layouts. A report can have multiple custom report layouts.

> [!NOTE]  
> In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the term "report" also covers externally facing documents, such as sales invoices and order confirmations you send to customers as PDF files.

To create a custom layout, either copy an existing custom layout or add a new custom layout. Custom layouts are often based on a built-in layout. When you add a new custom layout, you can choose to add either an RDLC or a Word report layout type, or both. The new custom layout is based on the built-in layout for the report, if one is available. If there's no built-in layout for the report type, a new blank layout is created. You modify and design this blank layout from scratch. Learn more about RDLC, Word, built-in, and custom layouts in [Manage Report Layouts](ui-manage-report-layouts.md).  

> [!TIP]
> Use financial reports to get insight into the financial data stored in your chart of accounts. Learn more at [Prepare Financial Reporting with Financial Data and Account Categories](bi-how-work-account-schedule.md).

After you define your custom report layouts, you can select them on the customer card and vendor card pages. The layouts are then used when you create documents for the customer or vendor. Learn more at [Define Document Layouts for Customers and Vendors](ui-define-customer-vendor-document-layouts.md).

You can also use custom report layouts to add content to email messages. Report layouts can save time and help ensure consistency by reusing the same content when you communicate with your customers. To use custom report layouts with email, the file type for the layout must be Word. You can't use the RDLC file type. Learn more in [Set Up Reusable Email Texts and Layouts](admin-how-setup-email.md#set-up-reusable-email-texts-and-layouts).

## Create a custom layout

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Report Layout Selection**, and then choose the related link.

    The **Report Layout Selection** page lists all the reports available in the company specified in the **Company Name** field at the top of the page.
1. In the **Company Name** field, choose the company you want to create the report layout for.
1. Select the row for the report you want to create the layout for, and then choose the **Custom Layouts** action.  

   The **Custom Report Layouts** page appears and lists all the custom layouts available for the selected report.
1. If you want to create a copy of an existing custom layout, select the existing custom layout in the list, then choose the **Copy** action.  

   The copy of the custom layout appears on the **Custom Report Layouts** page and has the words *Copy of* in the **Description** field.
1. If you want to add a new custom layout based on a built-in layout, follow these steps:  
   1. Choose the **New** action. The **Insert Built-in Layout for a Report** page appears with the **ID** and **Name** fields automatically filled in.
   1. Turn on the **Insert Word Layout** toggle to add a custom Word report layout type OR turn on the **Insert RDLC Layout** toggle to add a custom RDLC report layout type.
   1. Choose the **OK** button.  

    The new custom layout now appears on the **Custom Report Layouts** page. If a new layout is based on a built-in layout, then the words **Copy of a Built-in Layout** appear in the **Description** field. If there was no built-in layout for the report, then the new layout has the words **New Layout** in the **Description** field, which means that custom layout is blank.
1. By default, the **Company Name** field is blank and the custom layout is available for reports by all companies. To make the custom layout available to a specific company only, choose **Edit**, then set the **Company Name** field to the company you want.

The custom layout is created and you can modify it as you like.

> [!TIP]
> You can export the report results to a Microsoft Excel file to view the full dataset, including all columns, but without the layout. The Excel file can help you validate the report returns the expected data or diagnose problems. Learn more at [Analyzing Report Data with Excel](report-analyze-excel.md).

## <a name="ModifyCustomLayout"></a>Modifying a custom layout

To modify a custom report layout, you must first export the report layout as a file to a location on your computer or network. Then, open the exported document and make the changes. When you're finished making the changes, you import the report layout.

### Modify a custom layout

1. Export a custom layout from the **Custom Report Layouts** page. If that page isn't already open, search for and open the **Report Layout Selection** page, select the report that has the layout you want to modify, then choose the **Custom Layouts** action.  
1. On the **Custom Report Layouts** page, select the layout you want to modify, choose the **Export Layout** action, then choose **Save** or **Save As** to save the report layout document to a location on your computer or network.  
1. Open the report layout document you saved and make changes.

   If you're changing a Word layout, open the layout document in Word. Learn more about editing Word reports at [Work with Word Layouts](ui-how-add-fields-word-report-layout.md)<!--the next section [Making Changes to the Report Layout](ui-how-create-custom-report-layout.md#MakeChangesToLayout)-->.

   RDLC report layouts are more advanced than Word report layouts. Learn more about modifying an RDLC report layout at [Designing RDLC Report Layouts](/dynamics-nav/Designing-RDLC-Report-Layouts).

   Remember to save your changes when you're done.

1. Return to the **Custom Report Layouts** page, select the report layout you exported and modified, then choose the **Import Layout** action.  
1. In the **Import** dialog box, select **Choose** to find and select the modified report layout document, then choose **Open**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Remember to import the report layout document that you modified. Otherwise, the new report layout isn't available.

<!--
##  <a name="MakeChangesToLayout"></a> Create and modify custom report layouts

To make general formatting and layout changes, such as changing text font, adding and modifying a table, or removing a data field, just use the basic editing features of Word like you do with any Word document.

If you're designing a Word report layout from scratch or adding new data fields, then start by adding a table that includes rows and columns that will eventually hold the data fields.

> [!TIP]  
> Show the table gridlines so that you see the boundaries of table cells. Remember to hide the gridlines when you're done editing. To show or hide table gridlines, select the table, and then under **Layout** on the **Table** tab, choose **View Gridlines**.

### Embedding fonts in Word layouts for consistency

To ensure that reports always display and print with the intended fonts, wherever users open or print the reports, you can embed the fonts in the Word document. However, embedding fonts can significantly increase the size of the Word files. Learn more about embedding fonts in Word at [Embed fonts in Word, PowerPoint, or Excel](https://support.office.com/article/Embed-fonts-in-Word-PowerPoint-or-Excel-cb3982aa-ea76-4323-b008-86670f222dbc).

###  <a name="RemoveField"></a> Removing label and data fields in Word layouts

 Label and data fields of a report are contained in content controls in Word. The following figure illustrates a content control when it's selected in the Word document.  

 ![Content control for field in Word report layout.](media/nav_wordreportlayouts_contentcontrol.png "NAV_WordReportLayouts_ContentControl")  

 The name of the label or data field name displays in the content control. In the example, the field name is CompanyAddr1.  

### To remove a label or data field  

1. Right-click the field you want to delete, then choose **Remove Content Control**.  

     The content control is removed, but the field name remains as text.  

2. Delete the remaining text as needed.  

### Adding data fields

Adding data fields from a report dataset is more advanced and requires some knowledge of the report dataset. Learn more about adding fields for data, labels, and images at [Add Fields to a Word Report Layout](ui-how-add-fields-word-report-layout.md).  -->

title: Create business contacts
description: Outlines the tasks needed to create contacts and define your business relationships on the Contact Card.

# Create contacts

When you develop a business relationship with someone in another company, add them as a contact in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Then, add any information about them, or their company, that could be useful in future communications. You can create the following types of contacts on the **Contact Card** page:

* **Person** – Use this when you've had direct contact with someone and have their contact details.
* **Company** – Use this for a contact that is not an individual person but rather an entity such as a contractor or a bank.

The information that's relevant for each type of contact differs, so the available fields and actions are different. For example, you can only assign job responsibilities to a person, and an industry group to a company.

You can change the value of the **Type** field later. Alternatively, use the fields on the **Inheritance** FastTab on the **Marketing Setup** page to specify the data to share between a person and their company. Learn more at [Setting Up Contacts](marketing-setup-contacts.md).

When you convert a contact to a customer, vendor, or employee, for example, the contact person or contact company becomes the name of the customer. The record for the contact is kept, and you can link the contact and the customer so their data synchronizes going forward.

## To create a contact manually

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Contacts**, then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action.
3. In the **No.** field, enter a number for the contact.

   Alternatively, if you have a number series for contacts on the **Marketing Setup** page, you can select <kbd>Enter</kbd> to insert the next available contact number.
4. Fill in the remaining fields as required. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

## To create a contact from a customer, vendor, or bank account

If you have existing customers, vendors, and bank accounts you want to create contact cards for, you can use the **Create Contacts from** batch jobs. When you create a contact this way, the contact information is later synchronized with the related customer, vendor, or bank account information. Learn more at [Synchronizing Contacts with Customers, Vendors, Employees, and Bank Accounts](marketing-create-contact-companies.md#synchronizing-contacts-with-customers-vendors-employees-and-bank-accounts).

> [!NOTE]  
> Before you can create contacts based on existing data, you must specify a business relation code for customers, vendors, or bank accounts on the **Interactions** FastTab on the **Marketing Setup** page. Learn more at [Set up Contacts](marketing-setup-contacts.md).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter one of the following that matches the entity you want to create contacts from, then choose the related link.
   * **Create Contacts from Customers**
   * **Create Contacts from Vendors**
   * **Create Contacts from Bank Accounts**
2. On the request page that opens, in the **Customer**, **Vendor**, or **Bank Account** section, set filters if you want to create contacts from specific customers, vendors, or bank accounts.
3. Choose **OK** to start creating contacts.

The next contact numbers in the number series are assigned to the new contacts. The business relation code specified on the **Marketing Setup** page is assigned to the newly created contacts.

> [!TIP]  
> You can also do this the other way around, namely by creating a customer, vendor, employee, or bank account from a contact. Learn more in the [To create a customer, vendor, employee, or bank account from a contact](marketing-create-contact-companies.md#to-create-a-customer-vendor-employee-or-bank-account-from-a-contact) section.

## To create a customer, vendor, employee, or bank account from a contact

If you have a customer, vendor, employee, or bank account for the company you want to create a contact for, use the **Create as** action. When you create a contact this way, the contact information is later synchronized with the related customer, vendor, employee, or bank account information. Learn more at [Synchronizing Contacts with Customers, Vendors, and Bank Accounts](marketing-create-contact-companies.md#synchronizing-contacts-with-customers-vendors-employees-and-bank-accounts).

> [!NOTE]  
> Before you can create customers, vendors, employees, or bank accounts from contacts, you must specify a business relation code on the **Marketing Setup** page on the **Interactions** FastTab. Learn more at [Setting up Contacts](marketing-setup-contacts.md).
>
>Also, you must also have at least one template set up for each of them. For example, to create a customer from a contact, you must have a customer template.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Contacts**, then choose the related link.
2. Select the contact you want to create as a customer, vendor, employee, or bank account.
3. Choose the **Create as** action, then choose either **Customer**, **Vendor**, **Bank**, or **Employee**.
4. Choose **OK**.

The contact information is transferred from the contact card to a new customer, vendor, employee, or bank account card. You may want to add specific information to each of the cards, such as invoicing and payment details. For an example, see [Register New Customers](sales-how-register-new-customers.md).

## To link a contact to an existing customer, vendor, employee, or bank account

If you have a contact and either a customer, vendor, employee, or bank account for the same company, you can link the two entities to synchronize data.

1. Open the contact you want to link.
2. Choose the **Link with existing** action, then choose the **Customer**, **Vendor**, **Bank**, or **Employee** action.
3. On the page that opens, select the customer, vendor, employee, or bank account to link to.
4. In the **Current Master Fields** field, specify the fields to prioritize if there is conflicting information in fields common to both the existing contact and the customer, vendor, employee, or bank account. So, if the salesperson code differs between the contact and customer, you can choose to keep the one on the contact card by selecting **Contact**.
5. Choose **OK**.

## To remove a link between a contact and an existing customer, vendor, employee, or bank account

If you linked a contact with a customer, vendor, employee, or bank account that you didn't intend to, remove the link between the entities so the data no longer synchronizes.

1. Open the contact that has the wrong link.  
2. Choose the **Business Relations** action.  
3. On the page that opens, select the customer, vendor, employee, or bank account to remove the link from.  
4. Choose the **Delete** action.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Do not use the **Business Relations** window to change existing relations. Instead, remove the relation and use the **Link with existing** action. Learn more in the [To link a contact to an existing customer, vendor, employee, or bank account](marketing-create-contact-companies.md#to-link-a-contact-to-an-existing-customer-vendor-employee-or-bank-account) section.

## Synchronizing contacts with customers, vendors, employees, and bank accounts

If some of your contacts are also customers, vendors, employees, or bank accounts, you can synchronize them with data from the contact and gain the following benefits:

* You only have to update information in one place. So, if you modify the phone number on the contact, the phone number for the customer, vendor, employee, or bank account is automatically updated.
* If you have specified a number series for contacts, when you create a customer, vendor, employee, or bank account card, a contact is automatically created.
* You can create sales quotes and orders, and purchase quotes and orders, from the contact.
* You can record your interactions, such as printing orders, blanket orders, creating sales service orders, sending e-mails, and so on.
* If you delete a contact linked to a customer, vendor, employee, or bank account, only the contact is removed. The customer, vendor, employee, or bank account remains.
* Likewise, if you delete a customer, vendor, employee, or bank account that is linked to a contact, the contact remains.

> [!NOTE]  
> Certain details, such as invoicing and posting details, are not available for contacts. When you create contacts as customers, vendors, employees, or bank accounts, you may want to add that information manually.

There are three ways to enable data synchronization between contacts and customers, vendors, employees, or bank accounts:

* When you create contacts from customers, vendors, or bank accounts. Learn more in the [To create a contact from a customer, vendor, or bank account](marketing-create-contact-companies.md#to-create-a-contact-from-a-customer-vendor-or-bank-account) section.
* When you create customers, vendors, employees, or bank accounts from contacts. Learn more in the [To create a customer, vendor, employee, or bank account from a contact](marketing-create-contact-companies.md#to-create-a-customer-vendor-employee-or-bank-account-from-a-contact) section.
* When you link contacts to existing customers, vendors, employees, or bank accounts from the contact card. Learn more in the [To link a contact to an existing customer, vendor, employee, or bank account](marketing-create-contact-companies.md#to-link-a-contact-to-an-existing-customer-vendor-employee-or-bank-account) section.

## To view which customer, vendor, employee, or bank account a contact is related to

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Contacts**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the line for a contact, choose the **Related Information** action, and then choose the **Customer/Vendor/Bank Account/Employee** action.

# Delivery date calculation for sales

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically calculates the earliest possible date that an item on a sales order line can be shipped.

* If the customer has requested a specific delivery date, then the date on which the items must be available to pick to meet that delivery date is calculated.
* If the customer doesn't request a specific delivery date, then the date on which the items can be delivered is calculated. The calculation starts from the date on which the items are available for picking.

## Calculating a requested delivery date

If you specify a requested delivery date on the sales order line, that date becomes the starting point for the following calculations.

- *requested delivery date - shipping time = planned shipment date*
- *planned shipment date - outbound whse. handling time = shipment date*

If the items are available to pick on the shipment date, then the sales process can continue. Otherwise, a stock-out warning is displayed.

> [!NOTE]
> If your process is based on backward calculation, for example, if you use the requested delivery date to get the planned shipment date, we recommend you use date formulas with fixed durations, such as "5D" for five days or "1W" for one week. Date formulas without fixed durations, such as "CW" for current week or CM for current month, can result in incorrect date calculations. Learn more about date formulas at [Work with Calendar Dates and Times](ui-enter-date-ranges.md).

## Calculating the earliest possible delivery date

If you don't specify a requested delivery date on the sales order line, or if the requested delivery date can't be met, then the earliest date on which the items are available is calculated. That date is then entered in the **Shipment Date** field on the line, and the date on which you plan to ship the items and the date on which they'll be delivered to the customer are calculated using the following formulas.

- *shipment date + outbound whse. handling time = planned shipment date*
- *planned shipment date + shipping time = planned delivery date*

# Why a Page is Locked from Personalization

There are two conditions that prevent you from personalizing a page. Either the page is locked (as indicated by the ![Personalize Lock.](media/personalization-lock-icon.png "Personalize lock")) icon or it's blocked (as indicated by the ![Personalization blocked.](media/personalization-blocked-icon.png "Personalization blocked") icon).

## Locked from Personalizing

If there's a ![Personalize Lock.](media/personalization-lock-icon.png "Personalize lock") icon in the **Personalizing** banner when you open a page, you're currently prevented from making any more personalization changes to the page.

<!-- This is because we changed the way personalization works behind the scenes since the last time that you personalized the page. Unfortunately, the old way and new of doing things do not work together.

The page currently includes the last personalization changes that you made. If you want to continue personalizing the page, then you can choose the lock icon and then **Unlock**. Just be aware that if you choose to unlock the page, the current personalization of the page will be cleared, and you will have to start from scratch.
-->

There can be two reasons:

1. You've personalized the page before, but it was done using an earlier version of the product. We changed the way personalization works behind the scenes since the last time that you personalized the page. Unfortunately, the old way and new way of doing things don't work together.

2. Until now, you've only used the bow deprecated [!INCLUDE[nav_windows_md](includes/nav_windows_md.md)] to personalize the page.

### Unlocking the Page

If you want to unlock a page and continue personalizing it, choose the ![Personalize Lock](media/personalization-lock-icon.png "Personalize lock") icon, and then choose the **Unlock** action.  

> [!CAUTION]
> The current personalization of the page will be cleared. The page will go back to its original layout, and you'll have to start from scratch.  

## Blocked from Personalizing

If there's a ![Personalization blocked](media/personalization-blocked-icon.png "Personalization blocked") icon in the **Personalizing** banner, you're blocked from doing any personalization to the page.

<!-- Only text is translated, so removing this image for non-English UX reasons.  ![Personalize blocked.](media/personalization-blocked.png "Personalize lock") -->

The reason is that the Role Center or role that is currently associated with your user account modifies this page specifically for your role. Contact your administrator for assistance. Alternatively, try switching to a Role Center that does include role-tailoring for this page. For more information, see [Change Basic Settings](ui-change-basic-settings.md).

# Changing from a QuickBooks app to Dynamics 365 Business Central

More growing businesses are changing from finance apps like QuickBooks Desktop and QuickBooks Online, which are designed for startups and other small businesses, to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], which also supports larger, more complex organizations. 

As they transition, companies typically want to bring their business data with them so they don't start from scratch. To help transfer data, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers built-in extensions that migrate data such as customers, vendors, inventory items, and general ledger accounts. The following extensions are installed and ready to go as an integrated part of the **Data Migration** assisted setup guide:

* QuickBooks Data Migration 
* QuickBooks Online Data Migration

For more information, read about the extension that suits your QuickBooks app:   

* [The QuickBooks Desktop Data Migration Extension](ui-extensions-quickbooks-data-migration.md)
* [The QuickBooks Online Data Migration Extension](ui-extensions-quickbooks-online-data-migration.md)

## Ready now?

If you're ready to get started now, choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Assisted Setup**, and then choose the related link. Choose **Migrate business data**, and then follow the steps in the guide.

# Income Statement by Month (Power BI report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Income Statement by Month** report provides a detailed, month-to-month view of net changes across all income statement accounts, organized in a hierarchy for intuitive navigation. You can explore specific details by drilling down to the **Income Statement Drill-Through** report, which provides access to the underlying ledger entries.

This report is for senior management and finance administrators, offering a profit and loss overview that supports financial analysis, performance tracking, and informed decision-making.

:::image type="content" source="media/finance/income-statement-by-month-report.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Income Statement by Month report" lightbox="media/finance/income-statement-by-month-report.png":::

## Use the report

CFOs use the report to analyze monthly profitability trends for the fiscal year. For example, you might review the month-to-month changes in both operating expenses and revenue to identify drivers in overall profitability.

Finance administrators use the report to manage and review the operating expenses by a Department dimension. For example, if you spot an unexpected rise in costs, you could filter the report by department to identify the department responsible for the increased expenditure. This information can help you investigate and realign the department budget, if needed.


## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The report includes the following KPIs and measures: 

- [**Net Change**](finance-powerbi-kpis.md#net-change)

[!INCLUDE[click-on-a-kpi-link](includes/click-on-a-kpi-link.md)] 

[!INCLUDE[powerbi-tip-track-kpis](includes/powerbi-tip-track-kpis.md)]

## Data used in the report

The *Income Statement by Month* report use data from the following tables in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]

- G/L Entry
- G/L Account

# Chat with Copilot FAQ

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]

This article answers some common questions about chatting with Copilot in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For questions related to AI and chat, consult [Responsible AI FAQs for chat with Copilot](faqs-chat-with-copilot.md).

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/production-ready-preview-dynamics365.md)]

## Can admins grant or deny permission to individual users to get access to chat?

Starting in 2025 release wave 1 (update 26.0), admins can control precisely who has access to Chat with Copilot. Learn more in [Configure Copilot and agent capabilities](enable-ai.md#granting-user-access).

## Can Copilot answer questions about any records? 

When you chat with Copilot about records and pages, Copilot searches your company data within [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on your behalf and can only access the data you have permission to access. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]'s extensive security, privacy, and compliance controls also apply to Copilot. For example, you can't ask Copilot to show masked or secret fields or retrieve records controlled by record-level security.

## Is chat available on tablet, phone, or other form factors?

No, the chat pane is only available on the [!INCLUDE[web_client](includes/web_client.md)].

## In which countries or regions can I chat with Copilot?

Starting in update 25.4, chat is available in all [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] countries and regions. If you're unable to access the chat pane, find the answer in [What can I do if the chat pane doesn't show?](#what-can-i-do-if-the-chat-pane-doesnt-show)

## I don't use Business Central in English. What are my options?

As of January 2025, chat is available no matter which language you use in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

[!INCLUDE[copilot-language-support-en-only](includes/copilot-language-support-en-only.md)]

## Does chat work with my customizations?

It depends on the type of question you ask Copilot. For example:

- If you ask questions to find records, it can find records in your custom tables that use custom fields.
- If you ask Copilot for an explanation or guidance, it doesn't have access to any information about your customizations or documentation for your add-ons.

Learn how to improve Copilot output as a developer in [Influencing Copilot and agents without extending them](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/copilot-and-agents-influence-without-extending).

## How does Copilot locate records? 

When you ask to find a single record, multiple records, or a field from a record, Copilot uses various mechanisms to search for this information. Copilot generates the appropriate sorting and filtering on list pages and their corresponding source tables. It uses the fields on the page and fields on the underlying tables as part of these operations and in its responses.

## Does Copilot have access to all fields on a table? 

No. Copilot has access to most but not all fields when finding records. For example, it excludes fields that might contain passwords or other secrets. Learn which field data types are excluded in [Influencing Copilot and agents without extending them](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/copilot-and-agents-influence-without-extending).

Similarly, when you ask Copilot to show a specific field from a record, some fields are excluded and might not be part of Copilot’s response. For example, if your admin hasn't given you permission to personalize Business Central, Copilot shows only the fields typically displayed by default on the list pages.

## How do I open a record or page from chat?

When you ask Copilot to find records in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], it shows any records it finds as selectable tiles or links in the chat pane. While in preview, Copilot doesn't automatically navigate to any page.

## Why do I get different answers from Copilot for the same question?

Copilot might occasionally answer in different ways. Answers aren't always identical.

## How do I use the Copy function on chat messages?

You can use the Copy button to copy a message from earlier in your conversation with Copilot, paste it into the input box to try again or try a variation of your message to Copilot.

## Can I customize or extend chat?

While in preview, the chat pane and Copilot's responses can't be modified directly through customization, add-ins, tools, or personalization. 
Learn about how to influence Copilot output as a developer in [Influencing Copilot and agents without extending them](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/copilot-and-agents-influence-without-extending).

## Does Copilot search for data in other companies or environments?

Copilot only searches for records in the company you're currently signed into. It doesn't search for data across multiple environments or companies.

## How does chat treat data residency? 

The chat feature relies on Azure OpenAI Service for AI and Microsoft Learn for online documentation. Learn more about data residency and Azure OpenAI Service in [Azure OpenAI Service and Business Central data](azure-openai-data.md) and [Copilot data movement across geographies](ai-copilot-data-movement.md).

Microsoft Learn online service endpoints are available in the US, Switzerland, and Europe Azure geographies. For EU customers, this means their data never leaves the EU Data Boundary, and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] always connects to endpoints in Switzerland or Europe Azure geographies.

If your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] environment is deployed to any other Azure geography, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] connects to the Microsoft Learn online service outside your environment's geographic region or compliance boundary. When you use chat to ask for explanations on how to do things in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], only a few search keywords derived from your message to Copilot are sent to the Microsoft Learn online service in a different Azure geography. They're processed and not stored for more than one day.

To prevent chat from connecting to the Microsoft Learn online service, deactivate the chat feature using the **Copilot & agent capabilities** page. Learn more in [Configure Copilot and agent capabilities](enable-ai.md#activate-features).

## What can I do if the chat pane doesn't show?

- Make sure your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is version 25.4 or later.
- For Business Central versions 25.4 to 25.5, make sure the entry for "Chat with Copilot" is enabled for all users in the **Feature Management** page.
- Make sure you have permission to chat with Copilot. Learn more in [Configure Copilot & agent capabilities](enable-ai.md#granting-user-access).
- For Business Central version 26 and later, make sure **Chat** is active in the **Copilot & agent capabilities** page. In some countries and regions, Chat with Copilot isn't active by default. Learn more in [Configure Copilot & agent capabilities](enable-ai.md).

## How is Microsoft improving chat with Copilot?

We're continually working on improving reliability and response time. We announced the next expansion of chat where Copilot can answer questions about how to use installed add-on apps. Learn more in [Chat with Copilot to learn how to use installed add-on apps](/dynamics365/release-plan/2025wave1/smb/dynamics365-business-central/chat-copilot-learn-use-installed-add-on-apps).

We encourage administrators to try out experimental features on sandbox environments. To experience the latest improvements to chat, enable the **Feature: Enables advanced navigation (not data) search capabilities by utilizing semantic similarity search on application metadata.** key on the **Feature Management** page. This feature uses superior AI technology to match user inquiries with the names of pages, fields, and tables. Learn more in [Use semantic search to find pages and reports with Copilot chat](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/semantic-search-feature-key).

We look forward to getting your feedback about how Copilot can provide better assistance to your workday.

## Why does Copilot only show three records in the chat pane?

When you ask Copilot to find records, the way you phrase the question determines how Copilot identifies and applies filters on pages to find what you are looking for. To keep answers concise, the chat pane displays a maximum of three record tiles, even when Copilot finds more relevant records.

## Why does Copilot give incorrect answers to calculations?

While in preview, chat with Copilot can help you find records, explain concepts, and guide you to how to complete tasks in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Other use cases aren't supported, such as adding up a field across records or calculating the average monthly amount. We hope to add basic mathematics abilities to Copilot in the future.

## Can I use speech instead of typing my prompts?

You can chat with Copilot by using voice typing to talk instead of type your words in the chat pane. Voice typing uses online speech recognition and is available with Windows. To use voice, activate the chat message box, then use the <kbd>Windows</kbd>+<kbd>H</kbd> shortcut and start speaking. Learn more at [Use voice typing to talk instead of type on your PC](https://support.microsoft.com/windows/use-voice-typing-to-talk-instead-of-type-on-your-pc-fec94565-c4bd-329d-e59a-af033fa5689f).

# How to use banking and payment formats in Business Central

Banking and payment formats can change over time and vary by country/region and bank. To help you connect to your bank and handle transactions in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], Microsoft works with partners who provide apps that support different formats and integrations. 

In some countries/regions, Microsoft also provides built-in imports and export options. However, these options aren't adapted to newer versions of the formats, unless the bank requires it. Also, there will be no development of new banking and payment-related formats. This affects the country/region localizations of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] that Microsoft releases. For a list of local versions, see [list of localizations here](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/compliance/apptest-countries-and-translations). 

## Frequently Asked Questions about supported banking and payment formats

### Will [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] discontinue these import/export options and the current formats?  

No, there are no plans to remove the current formats and import/export options. You can still use them, and partners, and customers can still build integrations for them.  

### How can I find banking and payment apps for my country/region?

You can find ISV banking solutions that support banking and/or payment-related functionality on the **Banking Apps** page or on [AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com/)

Make sure to check the features of each app to see if they match your business needs and your bank requirements. 

> [!NOTE]
> There's one exception. The Envestnet Yodlee Bank Feeds and AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals apps aren't impacted and still supported. 

### Is there no plan to support banking connectivity in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in the future?  

Yes, Microsoft wants to enable you to connect to your bank and perform fundamental tasks in a modern and secure manner. This is why Microsoft supports partners who create apps for this purpose.

# Ad-hoc analysis of finance data

This article explains how to use the **Data Analysis** feature to analyze finance data directly from list pages and queries. You don't have to run a report or switch to another application, such as Excel. The feature provides an interactive and versatile way to calculate, summarize, and examine data. Instead of running reports using options and filters, you can add multiple tabs that represent different tasks or views on the data. Some examples are "Total assets over time", "Accounts Receivable", "Accounts Payable," or any other view you can imagine. To learn more about how to use the **Data Analysis** feature, go to [Analyze list and query data with analysis mode](analysis-mode.md).

Use the following list pages to start doing ad-hoc analysis of finance processes:

- [General Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=20&layout=analysis)
- [G/L Registers](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=116&layout=analysis)
- [Customer Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=25&layout=analysis)
- [Vendor Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=29&layout=analysis)

## Ad-hoc analysis scenarios in finance

Use the **Data Analysis** feature for quick fact checking and ad-hoc analysis:

- If you don't want to run a report.
- If a report for your specific need doesn't exist.
- If you want to quickly iterate to get a good overview on a part of your business.

The following sections provide examples of finance scenarios in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## Data foundation for ad-hoc analysis on finance

When you post journals, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates entries in the **G/L Entry** table. Therefore, ad-hoc analysis on general finance is typically done on the [General Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=20) page. For accounts receivable and payable, you can analyze [Customer Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=25) and [Vendor Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=29), respectively.

# Setting Up Relationship Management

Before you get started working with your contacts and marketing interests, there are a few decisions and steps that you should take to set up how the marketing area manages certain aspects of your contacts. For example, you can decide whether to synchronize the contact card with the customer card, vendor card, and bank account card, how number series are defined, or what the standard salutation should be when writing to your contacts.

Managing your contacts and having a strategy in place to identify, attract, and retain customers will help optimize your business and increase customer satisfaction. Using a good contact management system will also help you create and maintain relationships with your customers. Communication is the key to these relationships. Being able to tailor communication with potential and existing customers, vendors, and business partners according to their needs, is necessary for companies to succeed. Establishing a strategy and defining how your company uses contact information is a primary step. This information will be viewed by many different groups in your company, so having a good system in place will help everyone be more productive.

You set up the marketing and contact management from the **Marketing Setup** page. To open the **Marketing Setup** page, choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Marketing Setup**, and then choose the related link.

## Automatically Copying Specific Information from Contact Companies to Contact Persons
Some information about contact companies is identical to the information about the contact persons working within these companies, for example, the address details. In the **Inheritance** section of the **Marketing Setup** page, you can set the application to automatically copy specific fields from the contact company card to the contact person card each time you create a contact person for a contact company. For example, you can select to copy the salesperson code, address details (address, address 2, city, post code, and county), communication details (fax number, telex answer back, and phone number), and more.

When you modify one of these fields on the contact company card, application will automatically modify the field on the contact person card (unless you have manually modified the field on the contact person card).

For more information, see [Create Contacts](marketing-create-contact-companies.md).

## Use Predefined Defaults on New Contacts
You can decide that the application automatically assigns a specific language code, territory code, salesperson code, and country/region code as defaults to each new contact you create. You can also enter a default sales cycle code that application automatically assigns to each new opportunity you create.

The inheritance of fields overwrites the default values you have set up. For example, if you have set up English as the default language, but the contact company's language is German, application will automatically assign German as the language code for the contact persons recorded for that company.

<!--You can also setup a default salutation that application automatically assigns to your contacts. You can use these salutations in your interaction template attachments (for example, Microsoft Word documents). When setting up a default salutation, you can enter a salutation text and a salutation format. For example, if the salutation text is Dear, and the salutation format is Salutation Text + Title + Name, application will automatically enter Dear Mr. John Smith as a salutation for a contact called John Smith.-->

## Automatically Recording Interactions
[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can automatically record sales and purchase documents as interactions (for example, orders, invoices, receipts, and so on), as well as emails, phone calls, and cover sheets.

For more information, see [Automatically Record Interactions with Contacts](marketing-auto-record-interactions.md).

## Synchronizing Contacts with Customers and More
In order to synchronize the contact card with the customer card, the vendor card and the bank account card, you must select a business relation code for customers, vendors, and bank accounts. For example, you can only link a contact with an existing customer if you have selected a business relation code for customers on the **Marketing Setup** page.

For more information, see [Synchronizing Contacts with Customers, Vendors, and Bank Accounts](marketing-create-contact-companies.md#synchronizing-contacts-with-customers-vendors-employees-and-bank-accounts).  

## Assigning a Number Series to Contacts and Opportunities
You can set up a number series for contacts and opportunities. If you have set up a number series for contacts, when you create a contact, and select <kbd>Enter</kbd> in the No. field on the contact card, application automatically enters the next available contact number.

For more information about number series, see [Create Number Series](ui-create-number-series.md).

## Searching for Duplicate Contacts when Contacts are Created
You can choose to have application automatically search for duplicates each time you create a contact company, or you can choose to search manually after you have created contacts. You can also choose to have application update the search strings automatically each time you modify contact information or create a contact. You can decide the search hit percentage, that is, the percentage of identical strings two contacts must have for application to consider them as duplicates.

# Business Central for multi-site and international organizations

Organizations that have multiple sites often use a hub-and-spoke business model where a parent company, or headquarters, manages the overall operations of the business while each site functions as a single, standalone entity. Sites are often geographically distributed and have different needs for sharing information with the headquarter company. Additionally, sites typically don't need the same level of complexity, and often lack the resources to maintain a large system.

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] gives small and mid-sized businesses a business management solution that's easy-to-use and maintain at a low cost of ownership.

This article introduces some of the ways in which [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports a hub-and-spoke business model.

## Integrating the headquarter company and the sites

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can integrate with the headquarter company's accounting system while meeting the varying needs of different sites, regardless of size, location, or type of business.

The following diagram is an example of different sites integrated with a headquarter company.

![Diagram Description automatically generated.](media/multisite-headquarter-sites.png)

## Meet the Needs of Domestic and International Sites

Business needs at sites often differ based on industry, business methods, or their relationship to the headquarter company. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can be easily adapted and extended for various types of businesses and locales. Microsoft AppSource offers a wealth of apps from Microsoft and our partners, and partners can quickly deploy [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with minimal disruption to daily operations.

For multi-national organizations, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports local legal requirements and business practices.

* For online versions, there are more than [40 localized country/region versions](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/compliance/apptest-countries-and-translations?toc=/dynamics365/business-central/toc.json) that you can install as extensions from Microsoft AppSource.  
* For on-premises versions, [country/region versions](/azure/architecture/solution-ideas/articles/business-central) are available either as Microsoft-localized versions or partner-led add-on localizations.

A network of more than 4,000 Microsoft partners world-wide provides local expertise.

## Consolidate financial data

A core facet of the hub-and-spoke business model is the ability for the headquarter company and sites to exchange financial data. This requirement must be met, even when the headquarter company and sites use different systems, accounting structures, languages, and currencies.

# Set up a sequence of workflow users

Before you can create approval workflows, you must set up the users who can submit requests and their approvers. For example, you can specify who receives a notification to act on a workflow step. You set up approval workflow participants on the **Approval User Setup** page. Learn more at [Set Up Approval Users](across-how-to-set-up-approval-users.md).

On the **Workflow User Groups** page, you can specify where a participant engages in an approval workflow by entering a number in the **Sequence No.** field. For example, you can specify that users engage in a sequential order, such as a chain of approvers. You can also specify a flat list of approvers by entering the same number. In the latter case, only one of the approvers must approve a request.

[!INCLUDE [workflow-requestor-approver](includes/workflow-requestor-approver.md)]

## To set up a workflow user group

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Workflow User Groups**, then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action. The **Workflow User Group** page opens.  
3. In the **Code** field, enter a maximum of 20 characters to identify the workflow.  
4. In the **Description** field, describe the workflow.  
5. On the **Workflow User Group Members** FastTab, fill in the fields on the first line, as described in the following table.  

   |Field|Description|
   |-----|-----------|
   |**User Name**|Specify the user who takes part in a workflow.<br /><br /> The user must exist on the **User Setup** page. Learn more at [Assign Permissions to Users and Groups](ui-define-granular-permissions.md).|
   |**Sequence No.**|Specify the order in which the workflow user engages in a workflow relative to other users. This field can specify, for example, when the user approves relative to other approvers by setting up the **Workflow User Group** option in the **Approver Type** field on the related workflow response.|

   > [!NOTE]
   > Typically, sequence numbers are sequential for users in a workflow user group. However, multiple users can have the same sequence number. When that's the case, only one of the users must approve a request before the workflow goes to the next step. For example, if user A and user B are both number two in the sequence, the workflow goes to the step three when when either user A or user B approves the request.
6. Repeat step 5 to add more workflow users to the workflow user group.

# Print the picking list

You can print an inventory picking list directly from a sales order and other documents that initiate the shipment of items.

This report is typically used in companies without dedicated functionality for warehouse management, so that an inventory worker can view or print the picking list from the related sales document. In companies with higher volume or more complex processes, shipping and picking are planned and performed in dedicated warehouse documents. Learn more at [Outbound Warehouse Flow](design-details-outbound-warehouse-flow.md).

## To print a picking list from a sales order

The following procedure is based on a sales order. The steps are similar for all other documents that can be used to initiate shipment of items, such as a transfer order.

1. Choose the ![Search for Page or Report.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Sales Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the sales order that you want to pick items for.  
3. Choose the **Report** action, and then choose the **Picking List by Order** action.  
4. Choose the **Print** button to print the picking list or choose the **Preview** button to view it on the screen.

You can also save the picking list as a document, for example, to send to someone or to add as an attachment to the sales order. Learn more at [Manage Attachments, Links, and Notes on Cards and Documents](ui-how-add-link-to-record.md).

> [!NOTE]
> If you used the **Explode BOM** function on the sales order, then only the components of the related assembly item are shown in the report. Learn more at [Work with Bills of Material](inventory-how-work-BOMs.md).

## To print a single set of pick instructions for multiple sales documents

You can use filters to consolidate picking for several sales documents into a single set of pick instructions.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Orders**, and then choose the related link.
1. Choose the **Pick Instruction** action.
1. In the **Document Type** field, choose the type of document you're working with.
1. In the **No.** field, enter a filter to identify the documents. The following are examples of ways to filter.

   * To filter on a consecutive series of document numbers, enter the first and last document numbers separated by **..**. For example, **10000..10010**.
   * To filter on specific documents, enter each document number separated by a **|**. For example, **10000|10005|10010**.

To learn more about filter criteria and operators, go to [Enter filter criteria](ui-enter-criteria-filters.md#enter-filter-criteria).

# Import Multiple Item Pictures
You can import multiple item pictures in one go. Simply name your picture files with names corresponding to your item numbers, compress them to a zip file, and then use the Import Item Pictures page to manage which item pictures to import.

All common file formats are supported.

## To name picture files by the item names and prepare the ZIP file
1. At the location where your item pictures are stored, name each files according to the number of the related item. For example:

    |Item No.|File Name|
    |-|-|
    |1000|1000.bmp|
    |1001|1001.bmp|
    |1002|1002.bmp|

2. Collect all the files in a ZIP file. For example, in Windows Explorer, select the files, and then choose **Send to**, **Compressed (zipped) folder**.     

## To import item pictures
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Inventory Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **Import Item Pictures** action.
3. In the **Select a ZIP file** field, select the relevant ZIP folder, and then choose the **Open** button.

    A line for each item and picture is created on the **Import Item Pictures** page.

    > [!NOTE]
    > For item cards that already have a picture, the **Picture Already Exists** check box is selected. If you do not want any existing pictures to be replaced, deselect the **Replace Pictures** check box. If you do not want individual existing pictures to be replaced, delete the lines in question.

3. Choose the **Import Pictures** action.

The **Import Status** field is updated to show if the picture import was skipped or completed.

# Set Up Incoming Documents

If you create general journal lines from incoming document records, you must specify on the **Incoming Documents Setup** page which journal template and batch to use.

When the **Incoming Documents** feature is set up, you can use different functions to review expense receipts, manage OCR tasks, and convert incoming document files, manually or automatically, to the relevant documents or journal lines. The external files can be attached at any process stage, including to posted documents and to the resulting vendor, customer, and general ledger entries. For more information, see [Create Incoming Documents Records](across-how-create-income-document-records.md).

## To set up the Incoming Documents feature

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Incoming Document Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

As part of the setup, you must decide if you want to require approval of incoming documents. To require approval, you must [set up approvers and approval workflows](#to-set-up-approvers-of-incoming-document-records). If your organization doesn't intend to require approval, you can skip the next section.

Finally, if you use an OCR service to convert PDF or image files representing incoming documents, [you must it set up](#to-set-up-an-ocr-service). Otherwise, you can also skip that section.

## To set up approvers of incoming document records

If you don't want users to create invoices or general journal lines from incoming document records unless the documents are first approved, set up an approval process for the incoming documents. Approvers of incoming documents must be set up as approval workflow users.

Before you can create workflows that involve approval steps, you must set up the workflow users who are involved in approval processes. On the **Approval User Setup** page, you also set amount limits for specific types of requests and define substitute approvers to whom approval requests are delegated when the original approver is absent. For more information, see [Set Up Approval Users](across-how-to-set-up-approval-users.md).

## To set up an OCR service

To turn PDF and image files into electronic documents that you can convert to invoices, credit memos, or journal lines, set up the OCR feature. Alternatively, you can create entries manually to represent the external documents.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **OCR Service Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

# Set Up Pricing and Additional Costs for Services
You can use the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] pricing features to set up and customize your application so that you apply and adjust pricing on service items, repairs, and orders. These pricing decisions are then easily transmitted to the invoicing process.  
  
As your implementation requires, you can set up pricing groups and map them to specific time periods, customers, or currency. You can set up fixed, minimum, or maximum pricing, depending on the service contracts that you have with customers. Finally, as you adjust your prices, you can view and approve the changes before committing them to the ledger.  

## To set up a service price group
You can set up groups containing service items that you want to receive the same special service pricing. You assign service price groups to service items on service item lines. You can also assign service price groups to service item groups.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Price Groups**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Create a new service price group.  
3. Fill in the **Code** and **Description** fields.  
4. Choose the **Setup** action.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  

 > [!Tip]
 > The **Adjustment Type** and **Amount** fields work together to specify whether an adjustment concerns a fixed amount, or applies only when the total service price exceeds or is lower than the amount in the **Amount** field.  

## To set up a service price adjustment group  
You can set up price adjustment groups to adjust service pricing of service items. For example, you can set up price adjustment groups that adjust price of freight or spare parts.  
  
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Price Adjustment Groups**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Create a new service price adjustment group.  
3. Fill in the **Code** and **Description** fields.  
4. In the **Type** field, enter the type of the entry that you want to adjust.  
  
    * To adjust only one specific entry, enter the number of this entry in the **No.** field. When you leave this field blank, your adjustment group will adjust all entries of the type defined in the **Type** field.  
    * To adjust service prices related to only one specific service, fill in the **Work Type** field. When you leave this field blank, it will just be ignored.  
  
5. In the **Description** field, enter a short description of the service price adjustment.  
6. To adjust service prices related to only one specific general product posting group, fill in the **Gen. Prod. Posting Group** field.

> [!Tip]
> You can choose **Details** to add additional information about the adjustment group. For example, you can specify which item belongs to the service price adjustment group, and whether this is an item, a resource, a resource group, or a service charge.  

## To set up additional costs for services
When you work with service items and service orders, you may need to register additional costs, such as travel costs to particular service zones or starting fees. When you create a service order, you can insert these costs and a line with the type **Cost** will be added to the order. Alternatively, if you want to apply the cost to all service orders, you can set up a default cost. For example, if you always want to apply a starting fee.
  
### To set up service costs
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Costs**, and then choose the related link. 
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  

### To specify a default cost for service orders
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Setup**, and then choose the related link. 
2. In the **Service Order Starting Fee** field, choose the appropriate service cost.

# Sales analytics

Businesses capture lots of data during daily activities that supports business intelligence (BI) for sales managers:

- Opportunities
- Sales quotes
- Sales orders
- Sales invoices

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides features to help you gather, analyze, and share your organization's sales data:

- Power BI reports for sales
- Ad-hoc analysis on lists
- Ad-hoc analysis of data in Excel (using Open in Excel)
- Built-in sales analytics tools
- Built-in sales reports

Each of these features has its advantages and disadvantages, depending on the type of data analysis and the role of the user. To learn more, go to [Analytics, business intelligence, and reporting overview](reports-bi-reporting.md).

This article introduces how you can use these analytical features to gain sales insights.

## Analytics needs in sales

When you think about the analytics needs in sales management, it might help to use a persona-based model that describes different analytics needs at a high-level.

:::image type="content" source="/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/media/analytics-personas.svg" alt-text="Illustration of different personas for analytics" lightbox="/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/media/analytics-personas.svg":::

People in different roles have different needs when it comes to data, and they use the data in different ways. For example, people in asset management and finance interact with data differently than people in sales.

:::image type="content" source="/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/media/analytics-personas-scenarios.svg" alt-text="Illustration of how different personas have different analytics needs." lightbox="/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/media/analytics-personas-scenarios.svg":::

| Role              | Data aggregation  | Typical ways to consume data                          | 
|-------------------|-------------------| ----------------------------------------------------- |
|CCO / CFO / CEO    | Performance data  | KPIs <br> Dashboards <br> Financial reports           |
|Sales Manager      | Trends, summaries | Built-in managerial reports <br> Ad-hoc analysis      | 
|Account Manager / Sales Person | Detailed data     | Built-in operational reports <br> On-screen task data |

<!-- 
## Sales KPIs

A key performance indicator (KPI) is a measurable value that shows how effectively you’re meeting your goals. In sales management, people often use the following KPIs to monitor their organization's sales performance:

- TODO  
-->

## Using Power BI to monitor sales KPIs

A key performance indicator (KPI) is a measurable value that shows how effectively you’re meeting your goals. In sales, people often use the following KPIs to monitor their sales organization's performance:

- Gross Profit
- Gross Profit Margin
- Sales by period
- Sales vs. budget
- Number of new customers
- Period-over-Period Sales Amount Growth
- Sales by item/customer/location/sales person

:::image type="content" source="media/powerbi/sales/sales-overview.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Sales Overview Power BI report" lightbox="media/powerbi/sales/sales-overview.png":::

These sales KPIs, and more, are available in the Power BI Sales app for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. To learn more, go to [Power BI sales app](sales-powerbi-app.md).

[!INCLUDE [power-bi-sales-app](includes/power-bi-sales-app.md)]

## Use financial reporting to produce financial statements and KPIs related to sales

The **Financial Reporting** feature gives you insights into the financial data shown on your chart of accounts (COA). You can set up financial reports to analyze figures in general ledger (G/L) accounts, and compare general ledger entries with budget entries. Specifically for sales management, you can set up financial reports on the general ledger (G/L) accounts that you use to track sales postings.

Dimensions play an important role in business intelligence. A dimension is data that you add to an entry as a parameter. Dimensions let you group entries that have similar characteristics, such as customers, regions, products, and salesperson. Among other purposes, use dimensions when you define analysis views and create financial reports. To learn more, go to [Work with Dimensions](finance-dimensions.md).

To learn more about financial reports, go to [Prepare Financial Reports with Financial Data and Account Categories](bi-how-work-account-schedule.md).

## Finance reporting across business units or legal entities related to sales

Some organizations use [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in multiple business units or legal entities. Others use [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in subsidiaries that report to parent organizations. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] gives accountants tools that help them transfer general ledger entries from two or more companies (subsidiaries) into a consolidated company. Specifically for sales management, you might want to consolidate general ledger entries for your sales accounts to be able to track sales KPIs across business units or legal entities.

To learn more, go to [Company consolidation](finance-consolidated-company-reporting.md).

## Ad-hoc analysis of sales data

Sometimes, you just need to check whether the numbers add up correctly, or quickly confirm a figure. The following features are great for ad-hoc analyses:

- Data analysis on ledger list pages
- Open in Excel

The Data Analysis feature lets you open almost any list page, such as **General Ledger Entries**, **Customer Ledger Entries**, **Item Ledger Entries**, or **Posted Invoices**, enter analysis mode, and then group, filter, and pivot data as you see fit.

:::image type="content" source="media/data-analysis-customer-ledger-entries.png" alt-text="Example of how to do data analysis on the Customer Ledger Entries page." lightbox="media/data-analysis-customer-ledger-entries.png":::

Similarly, you can use the **Open in Excel** action to open a list page, optionally filter the list to a subset of the data, and then use Excel to work with the data. For example, by using features such as Analyze Data, What-If Analysis, or Forecast Sheet.

:::image type="content" source="media/open-in-excel-customer-ledger-entries.png" alt-text="Example of how to do data analysis on the Customer Ledger Entries data using Excel." lightbox="media/open-in-excel-customer-ledger-entries.png":::

> [!TIP]
> If you configure OneDrive for system features, the Excel workbook opens in your browser.

To learn more about how to do ad-hoc analysis on sales data, go to [Ad hoc analysis of sales data](ad-hoc-analysis-sales.md).

## Built-in reports for sales

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes several built-in reports, tracing functions, and tools to help sales organizations report on their data.

[!INCLUDE [sales_reports_report_explorer](includes/sales-reports-report-explorer-include.md)]

## On-screen sales analytics

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] has several pages that give you sales overviews and tasks to do. Here are some examples to get you started:

- [Open the Sales Quotes list](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=9300)
- [Open the Sales Orders list](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=9305)
- [Open the Posted Sales Invoices list](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=143)
- [Open the Sales Return Orders list](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=9304)
- [Calculate order promising dates](sales-how-to-calculate-order-promising-dates.md)
- [Calculate delivery dates for sales orders](sales-date-calculation-for-sales.md)
- [Track packages](sales-how-track-packages.md)
- [View the Availability of Items](inventory-how-availability-overview.md)
- [Blanket sales order status](sales-how-to-create-blanket-sales-orders.md#to-view-the-status-of-a-blanket-sales-order)
- [View unposted and posted blanket sales order lines](sales-how-to-create-blanket-sales-orders.md#to-view-unposted-and-posted-blanket-sales-order-lines)

### Show sales-related general ledger entries and balances from the Chart of Accounts page

The **Chart of Accounts** page shows all general ledger accounts with aggregated numbers posted to the general ledger. From this page, you can do things like:  

- View reports that show general ledger entries and balances.  
- Review a list of posting groups for that account.
- View separate debit and credit balances for a single account.

Specifically for sales, you can create a view that only shows the accounts you use for posting sales entries.

:::image type="content" source="media/chart-of-accounts-page.png" alt-text="Example of how the Chart of Accounts page shows finance insights" lightbox="media/chart-of-accounts-page.png":::

To learn more, go to [Understand the Chart of Accounts](finance-general-ledger.md#the-chart-of-accounts).

### Analyze data by dimensions (related to sales)

Dimensions are values that categorize entries so you can track and analyze them on documents, such as sales orders. Dimensions can, for example, indicate the project or department an entry came from.  

So, instead of setting up separate general ledger accounts for each department or location, you can use dimensions as a basis for analysis and avoid having to create a complicated chart of accounts structure.

To learn more, go to [Analyze Data by Dimensions](bi-how-analyze-data-dimension.md).

# Use Word templates for bulk communication

Microsoft Word templates can make it easier to mass communicate in print or by email with contacts, customers, and vendors. For example, you can create:

* Brochures to alert customers about a sales campaign
* Letters to inform vendors about a new purchasing policy
* Invitations to attract contacts to an upcoming event

> [!NOTE]
> When you set up Word templates, you must use a device with Microsoft Word 2019 or newer and have the Windows operating system installed.

## Set up the source of data

Use entities in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] as the source of data for the template, and add merge fields to personalize documents for each entity. The merge fields come from the entity in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. When you apply a Word template to an entity, data from the merge fields is inserted in the document.

On the **Word Templates** page, when you create a new template an assisted setup guide helps you through the following steps:

1. Choose one or more entities to use as the source of the data. For example, if you want to create a brochure for a sales campaign, you'd probably choose the Customer entity as the source.
2. Choose other entities as extra sources of data. Learn more at [Add Entries that are Related or Unrelated to the Source Entity](#add-entries-that-are-related-or-unrelated-to-the-source-entity).
3. Download a blank template. You can set up the template in Word right away, or you can upload the blank template and finish the guide. When your template's ready, use the **Upload** action on the **Word Templates** page to replace the blank template with your finished template. Learn more at [Set Up the Template in Word](#set-up-the-template-in-word).
4. Upload the template you prepared.
5. Enter a code and a name that identifies the template.

When you download a template, you get a .zip file that includes two files.

|File  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|DataSource.xlsx     | The data source file provides the fields that you can use in the template. Don't edit the data source file. You can only use the Word template and data source files that you download and you must store the files in the same location.     |
|Word template     | A .docx file to use as the template.        |

To learn about setting up a template in Word, go to [Set Up the Template in Word](#set-up-the-template-in-word).

## Add entries that are related or unrelated to the source entity

You can also merge data from other entities. To add other entities as data sources, use one of the following actions on the **Word Templates** page or when you're using the assisted setup guide:

|Action  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|**Add related entity**  | Use data from entities that are related to the source entity. For example, for the Customer entity you can also merge data from the Contact entity. Entities are related when a field on one entity refers to another. A field on the Customer entity refers to a field on the Contact entity, so they're related. The shared field is often an identifier such as a name, code, or ID.        |
|**Add unrelated entity**| Use data from entities that aren't related to the source entity. For example, you're creating a template for the Customer entity. You might add the Company Information entity so you can include your contact details. A key benefit is that if you change your contact information, it automatically updates in your template. After you add an unrelated entity, you can add entities that are related to it.         |

For unrelated entries, you choose a specific record. Because you can only add an entity one time, to use a different record you must delete the entity and add it again with the new record.

You can create a hierarchy of entities, both related and unrelated. The relation is shown as a tree structure. The **Entity relation** field also shows information about the relation. For unrelated entities, the field shows the record that creates the relation.

When you add entities, use the **Field Prefix** field to specify a prefix for the field names. Later, when you add fields to the template, the prefix helps distinguish between fields from the source and other entities.

### Select the fields to include

For each entity, you can specify the fields that you want to be available for the template. Choose the number in the **Number of Selected fields** column to access a list of fields that are available. On the **Field Selection** page, use the **Include** checkbox to specify the fields. For some entities, fields that businesses typically use are included by default. You can edit the list, for example, to remove the default fields. Your changes apply only to the template you're working on.

> [!NOTE]
> The total number of fields that you can add from all entities is 250.

> [!NOTE]
> You or your Microsoft partner can add custom fields to entities. When you do, we prefix the name of the fields with **CALC** and give them the field type **Calculated**. The field type is called calculated to indicate the field can show different types of values, such as text, numbers, dates, and so on.

## To create a Word template in Business Central

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Word Templates**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose **New**, then **Create a Template**, and then follow the steps in the assisted setup guide. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

> [!TIP]
> You can also create a template directly from the page for an entity by choosing the **Apply Word Template** action to open the assisted setup guide, and then **New Template**. When you do, the data source is chosen for you based on the type of entity.

## Set up the template in Word

When you're setting up a template in Word, on the **Mailings** tab you can add merge fields by choosing **Insert Merge Field**. The merge fields come from the data source file that you downloaded for the entity. They act as placeholders that tell Word where in the document to put the information about the entity.

:::image type="content" source="media/word-tmpl-merge-field.PNG" alt-text="Adding merge fields in Microsoft Word":::

## Apply a template

When your Word template is ready, on the **Word Templates** page you can choose **Apply** to generate the documents. When you apply a Word template to an entity, data from the merge fields is inserted in the document. You can either create one document that contains sections for each entity, or choose **Split** to create a new document for each entity.

You can use the **Apply Word Templates** action to apply templates to one or more of the same type of entity, such as a customer, directly in the context of the page for the entity. For example, the **Customer** or **Vendor** pages.

## Use Word templates with email

You can use Word templates to add content to email messages. When you compose an email, you can choose the **Use Word Template** action to apply the content of a template to the message. You must already have templates for the entity. You can use one template at a time, and when you switch between templates the message changes to reflect the content from the chosen template.

Additionally, you can use the **Add File from Word Template** action to attach the content of the template to the email as a file. The file uses the format you specified for the template output.

:::image type="content" source="media/email-word-tmpl.PNG" alt-text="Options for using content from a Word template in an email":::

## Edit a Word template

You can make the following changes to your Word templates:

* To edit the body text or merge fields included in the template, use the **Download** action, make your changes, and then use the **Upload** action
* To change the sources of data, use the **Edit related entities** action
* To replace the Word template with a new template, use the **Upload** action
* Delete the template

# Design details: average cost

The average cost of an item is calculated with a periodic weighted average. The average is based on the average cost period you have specified in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

The valuation date is set automatically.  

## Setting up average cost calculation

The following table describes the two fields on the **Inventory Setup** page that must be filled to enable average cost calculation.  

|Field|Description|  
|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
|**Average Cost Period**|Specifies which period the average cost is calculated in. The following options exist:<br /><br /> - **Day**<br />- **Week**<br />- **Month**<br />- **Accounting Period**<br /><br /> Inventory decreases that are posted in the average cost period get the average cost calculated for that period.|  
|**Average Cost Calc. Type**|Specifies how the average cost is calculated. The following options exist:<br /><br /> - **Item**<br />- **Item, Variant, and Location**<br /> With this option, the average cost is calculated for each item, for each location, and for each variant of the item. The average cost of this item depends on where you store it and the variant you select, such as color.|  

> [!NOTE]  
> You can only use one average cost period and one average cost calculation type in a fiscal year.  
>
> The **Accounting Periods** page shows which average cost period and which average cost calculation type is in effect during that period, for each accounting period.  

## Calculating average cost

 When you post a transaction for an item that uses the Average costing method, an entry is created in the **Avg. Cost Adjmt. Entry Point** table. This entry contains the transaction’s item number, variant code, and location code. The entry also contains the **Valuation Date** field, which specifies the last date of the average cost period in which the transaction was posted.  

> [!NOTE]  
> This field should not be confused with the **Valuation Date** field in the **Value Entry** table, which shows the date when the value takes effect and is used to determine the average cost period in which the value entry belongs.  

 The average cost of a transaction is calculated when the item’s cost is adjusted. For more information, see [Design Details: Cost Adjustment](design-details-cost-adjustment.md). A cost adjustment uses the entries in the **Avg. Cost Adjmt. Entry Point** table to identify which items (or items, locations, and variants) to calculate average costs for. For each entry with a cost that hasn't been adjusted, the cost adjustment uses the following to determine the average cost:  

- Determines the cost of the item at the start of the average cost period.  
- Adds the sum of the inbound costs that were posted during the average cost period. These include purchases, sales returns, positive adjustments, and production and assembly outputs.  
- Subtracts the sum of the costs of any outbound transactions that were fixed-applied to receipts in the average cost period. These typically include purchase returns and negative outputs.  
- Divides by the total inventory quantity for the end of the average cost period. Excludes inventory decreases that are being valued.  

 The calculated average cost is then applied to the inventory decreases for the item (or item, location, and variant) with posting dates in the average cost period. For inventory increases that are fixed-applied to inventory decreases in the average cost period, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] forwards the calculated average cost from the increase to the decrease.  

### Example: average cost period = day

The following example shows the effect of calculating average cost based on an average cost period of one day. The **Average Cost Calc. Type** field on the **Inventory Setup** page is set to **Item**.  

The following table shows item ledger entries for the sample average-cost item, ITEM1, before you run the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job.  

| **Posting Date** | **Item Ledger Entry Type** | **Quantity** | **Cost Amount (Actual)** | **Entry No.** |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| 01-01-23 |   Purchase | 1 | 20.00 | 1 |
| 01-01-23 |   Purchase | 1 | 40.00 | 2 |
| 01-01-23 |   Sale | -1 | -20.00 | 3 |
| 02-01-23 |   Sale | -1 | -40.00 | 4 |
| 02-02-23 |   Purchase | 1 | 100.00 | 5 |
| 02-03-23 |   Sale | -1 | -100.00 | 6 |

> [!NOTE]  
> Because cost adjustment has not yet occurred, the values in the **Cost Amount (Actual)** field of the inventory decreases corresponding to the inventory increases that they are applied to.  

 The following table shows the entries in the **Avg. Cost Adjmt. Entry Point** table that apply to the value entries that result from the item ledger entries in the preceding table.  

| **Item No.** | **Variant Code** | **Location Code** | **Valuation Date** | **Cost is Adjusted** |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| ITEM1 |  | BLUE | 01-01-23 |   No |
| ITEM1 |  | BLUE | 02-01-23 |   No |
| ITEM1 |  | BLUE | 02-02-23 |   No |
| ITEM1 |  | BLUE | 02-03-23 |   No |

 The following table shows the same item ledger entries after you run the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job. The average cost per day is calculated and applied to the inventory decreases.  

| **Posting Date** | **Item Ledger Entry Type** | **Quantity** | **Cost Amount (Actual)** | **Entry No.** |
|--|--|--|--|--|--|
| 01-01-23 |   Purchase | 1 | 20.00 | 1 |
| 01-01-23 |   Purchase | 1 | 40.00 | 2 |
| 01-01-23 |   Sale | -1 | -30.00 | 3 |
| 02-01-23 |   Sale | -1 | -30.00 | 4 |
| 02-02-23 |   Purchase | 1 | 100.00 | 5 |
| 02-03-23 |   Sale | -1 | -100.00 | 6 |

### Example: average cost period = month

 This example shows the effect of calculating the average cost based on an average cost period of one month. The **Average Cost Calc. Type** field on the **Inventory Setup** page  is set to **Item**.  

 If the average cost period is one month, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates one entry for each combination of item number, variant code, location code, and valuation date.  

 The following table shows item ledger entries for the sample average-cost item, ITEM1, before you run the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job.  

| **Posting Date** | **Item Ledger Entry Type** | **Quantity** | **Cost Amount (Actual)** | **Entry No.** |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| 01-01-23 |   Purchase | 1 | 20.00 | 1 |
| 01-01-23 |   Purchase | 1 | 40.00 | 2 |
| 01-01-23 |   Sale | -1 | -20.00 | 3 |
| 02-01-23 |   Sale | -1 | -40.00 | 4 |
| 02-02-23 |   Purchase | 1 | 100.00 | 5 |
| 02-03-23 |   Sale | -1 | -100.00 | 6 |

> [!NOTE]  
> Because cost adjustment has not occurred yet, the values in the **Cost Amount (Actual)** field of the inventory decreases corresponding to the inventory increases that they are applied to.  

The following table shows the entries in the **Avg. Cost Adjmt. Entry Point** table that apply to the value entries that result from the item ledger entries in the preceding table.  

| **Item No.** | **Variant Code** | **Location Code** | **Valuation Date** | **Cost is Adjusted** |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| ITEM1 |  | BLUE | 01-31-23 |   No |
| ITEM1 |  | BLUE | 02-28-23 |   No |

> [!NOTE]  
> The valuation date is set to the last day in the average cost period, which in this case is the last day of the month.  

The following table shows the same item ledger entries after you run the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job. The average cost per month is calculated and applied to the inventory decreases.  

|**Posting Date** | **Item Ledger Entry Type** | **Quantity** | **Cost Amount (Actual)** | **Entry No.** |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| 01-01-23 | Purchase | 1 | 20.00 | 1 |
| 01-01-23 | Purchase | 1 | 40.00 | 2 |
| 01-01-23 | Sale | -1 | -30.00 | 3 |
| 02-01-23 | Sale | -1 | -65.00 | 4 |
| 02-02-23 | Purchase | 1 | 100.00 | 5 |
| 02-03-23 | Sale | -1 | -65.00 | 6 |

The average cost of entry number 3 is calculated in the average cost period for January. The average cost for entries 4 and 6 is calculated in the average cost period for February.  

To get the average cost for February, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] adds the average cost of the item received in inventory (100.00) to the average cost at the beginning of the period (30.00). The sum (130.00) is then divided by the total quantity in inventory (2). This calculation gives the resulting average cost of the item in the February period (65.00). The average cost is assigned to the inventory decreases in the period (entries 4 and 6).  

## Setting the valuation date

 The **Valuation Date** field in the **Value Entry** table determines the average cost period in which an inventory decrease entry belongs. This setting also applies to work in process (WIP) inventory.  

 The following table shows the criteria that are used to set the valuation date.  

| Scenario | Posting Date | Valued Quantity | Revaluation | Valuation Date |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| 1 |  | Positive | No | Posting date of item ledger entry |
| 2 | Later than the latest valuation date of applied value entries | Negative | No | Posting date of item ledger entry |
| 3 | Earlier than the latest valuation date of applied value entries | Positive | No | Latest valuation date of the applied value entries |
| 4 |  | Negative | Yes | Posting date of the revaluation value entry |

### Example

The following table of value entries illustrates the different scenarios.  

| Scenario | Posting Date | Item Ledger Entry Type | Valuation Date | Valued Quantity | Cost Amount (Actual) | Item Ledger Entry No. | Entry No. |
|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|
| 1 | 01-01-20 | Purchase | 01-01-20 | 2 | 20.00 | 1 | 1 |
| 2 | 01-15-20 | (Item Charge) | 01-01-20 | 2 | 8.00 | 1 | 2 |
| 3 | 02-01-20 | Sale | 02-01-20 | -1 | -14.00 | 2 | 3 |
| 4 | 03-01-20 | (Revaluation) | 03-01-20 | 1 | -.4.00 | 1 | 4 |
| 5 | 02-01-20 | Sale | 03-01-20 | -1 | -10.00 | 3 | 5 |

> [!NOTE]  
> In entry number 5 in the preceding table, the user has entered a sales order with a posting date (02-01-20) that comes before the latest valuation date of applied value entries (03-01-20). If the corresponding value in the **Cost Amount (Actual)** field for this date (02-01-20) were used for this entry, then it would be 14.00. This would give a situation where the quantity on inventory is zero, but the inventory value is –4.00.  
>
> To avoid such a quantity-value mismatch, the valuation date is set to equal the latest valuation date of the applied value entries (03-01-20). The value in the **Cost Amount (Actual)** field becomes 10.00 (after revaluation), which means that the quantity on inventory is zero, and the inventory value is also zero.  

> [!CAUTION]  
> Because the **Inventory Valuation** report is based on posting date, the report will reflect any quantity-value mismatches in scenarios as in the above example. For more information, see [Design Details: Inventory Valuation](design-details-inventory-valuation.md).  

If the quantity on inventory is less than zero after you post the inventory decrease, the valuation date is set to the posting date of the inventory decrease. You can change this date when the inventory increase is applied, according to the rules described in the note earlier in this section.  

## Recalculating average cost

Valuing inventory decreases as a weighted average would be straightforward in several scenarios:

- Purchases are always invoiced before sales.
- Postings are never backdated.
- You never made mistakes.

However, the reality is different.  

As the examples in this article illustrate, the valuation date is defined as the date from which the value entry is included in the average cost calculation. This setting lets you do several things for items with the Average costing method:  

- Invoice the sale of an item before you invoice its purchase.  
- Backdate a posting.  
- Recover an incorrect posting.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Another reason for this flexibility is fixed application. For more information about fixed application, see [Design Details: Item Application](design-details-item-application.md).  

Because of this flexibility, you might have to recalculate the average cost after posting. For example, if you post an inventory increase or decrease with a valuation date that's before an inventory decrease. The recalculation of the average cost occurs automatically when you run the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job, manually or automatically.  

You can change the inventory valuation base within an accounting period by changing the values in the **Average Cost Period** and **Average Cost Calc. Type** fields. However, we recommend that you use caution and consult your auditor.  

### Example of recalculated average cost

This example shows how [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] recalculates the average cost when you post on a date that's before an inventory decrease. The example is based on an average cost period of **Day**.  

The following table shows the value entries that exist for the item before the posting is introduced.  

| Valuation Date | Quantity | Cost Amount (Actual) | Entry No. |
|--|--|--|--|
| 01-01-20 | 1 | 10.00 | 1 |
| 01-02-20 | 1 | 20.00 | 2 |
| 02-15-20 | -1 | -15.00 | 3 |
| 02-16-20 | -1 | -15.00 | 4 |

The user posts an inventory increase (entry number 5) with a valuation date (01-03-20) that's before an inventory decrease. To balance the inventory, the average cost must be recalculated and adjusted to 17.00.  

The following table shows the value entries that exist for the item after entry number 5 is introduced.  

| Valuation Date | Quantity | Cost Amount (Actual) | Entry No. |
|--|--|--|--|
| 01-01-20 | 1 | 10.00 | 1 |
| 01-02-20 | 1 | 20.00 | 2 |
| 01-03-20 | 1 | 21.00 | 5 |
| 02-15-20 | -1 | -17.00 | 3 |
| 02-16-20 | -1 | -17.00 | 4 |

# Entering data

Many general features help you enter data easier, faster, and more precisely. The basic principles and advanced features for entering data are described in this article.  

[!INCLUDE [about-ui-learn](includes/about-ui-learn.md)]

The examples in this article use demonstration data.

## Work with editable fields

Fields in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] may contain different editable data, such as text or currency amounts. Editable fields typically display an input box where you can type or choose a value. Non-editable fields are typically displayed with a gray background.

Some editable fields provide a picker to help you specify a value.  

<!-- TODO: Add illustrations or images of each picker -->
|**Picker**        |**How it helps you specify a value**|
|------------------|------------------------------------|
|Date picker       |This picker displays a calendar that is based on your current regional settings. It helps you choose a single date.|
|Dropdown          |Dropdowns provide a choice of fixed values or reference records from another table.|
|Switch or Checkbox|Some fields provide a simple choice of *Yes* or *No* values. The switch is used to specify this value, and is always displayed as a checkbox in lists.|
|Assist edit       |Some fields provide custom pickers that are suited to looking up and choosing the best value for that field, such as a pop-up window.|

### Modifying a field value

To modify the value of a field, you must first set focus to that field. You set focus by doing the following actions:

- Use the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key. The action selects the entire value.
- Left-click your mouse or similar input device. This action will only select the entire field value if the field is in a list.  

When you interact with fields in the user interface, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] typically favors selecting the entire field value to make it easier for you to replace that value.

When the entire field value is selected:

- Replace the value by just typing to specify a new value. If the field offers a picker, you can activate it using the <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Down Arrow</kbd> keyboard shortcut.
- Use the <kbd>Delete</kbd> or <kbd>Backspace</kbd> key to clear the value.

Select the <kbd>F2</kbd> key to toggle between selecting the entire field value or placing the cursor after the field's value. Placing the cursor at the end of the value makes it easier for you to append to the existing value.

When the cursor is shown at the end of the field value:

- Add to the value by just typing.
- Use the <kbd>Home</kbd>, <kbd>End</kbd>, <kbd>Left Arrow</kbd>, and <kbd>Right Arrow</kbd> keys to move the cursor within the value. If you're editing a field in a list, selecting the <kbd>Left Arrow</kbd> key again when the cursor is at the beginning of the value will set the focus to the previous field. Similarly, selecting the <kbd>Right Arrow</kbd> key again when the cursor is at the end of the value will set the focus to the next field.

> [!NOTE]
> After you specify a value, Business Central will only check that it's valid after you click outside the field or set focus to another element, such as the next field.

## Use Copilot's autofill feature to assist in filling in fields (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner-section.md)]

When drafting a new record or editing an existing record, Copilot can suggest values for editable fields on the page. Learn more in [Autofill fields with Copilot (preview)](autofill-fields-with-copilot.md).

## Keyboard shortcuts

Several keyboard shortcuts let you work "mouse-free" and speed up your data entry. These keyboard shortcuts are especially useful with large-scale entries and repetitive typing tasks.

For more information about shortcuts, go to [Keyboard shortcuts](keyboard-shortcuts.md). A few of the keyboard shortcuts are discussed in this article.

## <a name="QuickEntry"></a>Accelerating Data Entry Using Quick Entry

Quick Entry is a feature designed for data entry when using the keyboard. Quick Entry works on fields (like on card pages) and in lists (rows and columns). It's beneficial when doing repetitive typing tasks that require creating multiple records in sequence. Examples include a batch of sales orders or registering new items.

You can use the Tab key to navigate from one field on a page to the next editable field. A disadvantage of using Tab is that it always goes sequentially to the next field. <!-- even if the field is non-editable or seldom filled it in.-->Quick Entry lets you change this path. With Quick Entry, you use the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key to navigate through only those fields that you're interested in. Quick Entry skips non-editable fields and fields that you typically don't fill in. You might have already noticed this behavior on some pages. This behavior is because the fields to include when pressing **Enter** and the ones to skip have been predefined. You can customize Quick Entry by personalizing your workspace and optimizing how you enter data on each page.

### How Quick Entry works

Every field can be marked as either *included in Quick Entry* or *excluded from Quick Entry*. Fields that are included in Quick Entry will be included in the path when you select <kbd>Enter</kbd>. Fields that are excluded from Quick Entry won't.

When you're finished entering data in a field, you simply select <kbd>Enter</kbd> to confirm the changes and go to the next field. If you want to reverse direction and go the previous field, select <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd>. For more information about shortcuts, go to [Quick Entry shortcuts for fields](keyboard-shortcuts.md#QuickEntry).

#### Tips and tricks

The following list provides helpful information about using Quick Entry:

- It's available for any editable fields.
- It works across columns and rows.
- It doesn't prevent accessing other elements of a page, such as actions. These elements are still accessible by using <kbd>Tab</kbd> and <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd>.  
- It's not required that FastTabs are expanded for Quick Entry to work. If the next Quick Entry field is located in a collapsed FastTab, that FastTab will automatically expand and focus on the chosen field. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will remember that the FastTab should be expanded next time you visit the page.  
- Quick Entry works no matter whether fields are mandatory, so it's good to ensure that mandatory fields are included in Quick Entry.
- By default, most fields are automatically included in Quick Entry, so initially your task will most likely be excluding fields from Quick Entry.

### To change Quick Entry fields

To set up Quick Entry on fields, you use personalization.

1. Start personalization by selecting the ![Settings.](media/ui-experience/settings_icon_small.png "Settings icon for role center") icon, and then the **Personalize** action.
2. Select a field that you want to change. In lists, select the corresponding column heading. Then, choose either **Include in Quick Entry** or **Exclude from Quick Entry**.

For more information about personalization, go to [Personalize your workspace](ui-personalization-user.md).

## Mandatory fields

When you enter data on pages, certain fields are marked with a red asterisk. The red asterisk means the field must be filled in to complete a certain process. An example is when you post a transaction that uses the value in the field.  

Although a field is mandatory, you aren't required to fill in the field before you continue to other fields or close the page. The red asterisk only serves as a reminder that you'll be blocked from completing a certain process.  

## Finding data as you type

When you start to type characters in a field, you'll see a dropdown list that shows possible field values. The list changes as you type more characters, and you can select the correct value when it's displayed.  

Many fields have a down arrow button that you can choose. You choose the arrow to get a list of data that's available to enter in the field. The button has two functions depending on the type of field:  

- **Lookup**: Displays information from another table that you can enter in the field. You can select one piece of data at a time.  

- **Dropdown**: Displays the set of options that exist for the field. You can select only one of the options.  

## Copying and pasting FAQ fields and lines

You can copy one or more rows from a list or a single field on a page. Then paste what you copied into the same page, another page, or an external document. You could, for example, paste into a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet or an Outlook email. In short, to copy, select <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> (cmd+C in macOS) on your keyboard. To paste, select <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>V</kbd> (or <kbd>cmd+V</kbd> in macOS).

In a list, to copy the field in the same column of the row above and paste it into the current row, select <kbd>F8</kbd>.

For more information, go to [Copy and paste FAQ](faq-copy-paste.yml).

## Filtering line items

To start filtering, select ![Filter pane icon](media/open-filter-pane-icon.png "Filter pane icon") at the top of the list or select <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>F3</kbd> to open the filter pane. You work with the filter pane as you do on any other list. For more information, go to [Filtering](ui-enter-criteria-filters.md#filtering).

Filtering is especially helpful when viewing and analyzing longer documents. Imagine you open a posted sales invoice. Then, you filter the line items to display all line items that have an individual discount above 5 percent. Or, you filter to display only bike accessories with 'pro' in the name.

## <a name="Focus"></a>Focusing on line items

When working on documents that include a line items part, you can switch your view to focus only on the line items. Example documents are sales order or invoice page. The line items part expands so that it occupies almost the entire workspace. It hides other parts of the page except the actions area at the top. This layout gives you a better overview of the line items, and provides more room to work on them.

You'll benefit particularly when you work with large line item lists and you want to enter data fast. This feature also provides advanced filtering capability. Like on other lists, browsing and searching through line items becomes even easier.

### Switching the focus on and off

To focus on line items, select anywhere in the line items part, and then choose ![Focus Mode icon.](media/focus-mode.png "Focus mode icon") in the upper right corner, or select <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>F12</kbd>.

To switch back to the normal view, choose ![Focus Mode icon.](media/focus-mode.png "Focus mode icon") or select <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>F12</kbd> again.

## Multitasking across multiple pages

You can open a card or document page in a new window. Opening a new window lets you:

- Work on multiple tasks at the same time.
- Manage interruptions to the current task, such as taking an incoming call.
- Keep a window open for an ongoing task while you start or complete another task in windows.

To open the current card or document in a new window, choose ![Open New Window.](media/open-new-window-icon.png "Open new window icon") in the upper right corner, or select <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>W</kbd>.

<!--
When working on multiple tasks at a time or when managing interruptions to the current task, such as taking an incoming call, you can open a card or document page in a new window. This allows you to keep a window open for an ongoing task while you start or complete another task in one or more other windows.
-->

> [!NOTE]
> When you open other pages from a card or document that is opened in a new window, those pages will open in a new window even though you don't choose ![Open New Window.](media/open-new-window-icon.png "Open new window icon").

> [!NOTE]
> If you work in the Safari browser, a pop-up blocker may prevent the new window from opening. In this case, specify the product URL as an allowed website. For more information, go to [Change preferences in Safari](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=2102965).<br /><br />
> The same may happen in other browsers, such as Firefox. For more information, go to [Pop-up blocker settings in Firefox](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=2116400).  

Another way to multitask is to open [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on two or more browser tabs. When you do it this way, you should create a new tab and then copy/paste the URL of the original tab into the new tab. This creates a new session.   

> [!NOTE]
> Don't use the **Duplicate** function of the browser to create the new tab as this may cause actions on one tab to block actions on other tabs because they are part of the same session.

## Entering quantities by calculation

When entering numbers into quantity fields, such as the **Quantity** field on an item journal line, you can enter the formula instead of the sum quantity.  

### Examples  

- If you enter 19+19, the field is calculated to 38.  

- If you enter 41-9, the field is calculated to 32.  

- If you enter 12*4, the field is calculated to 48.  

- If you enter 12/4, the field is calculated to 3.  

## Entering negative numbers

You can enter negative numbers in two ways. The number -20.5 can be entered as:  

- -20.5  

  or
- 20.5-  

In both cases, the amount will be recorded as -20.5.  

If the last character of the expression is a **+** or a **-**, the entire expression will be recorded with that sign. As an example, **10-20+** will result in 10 and not -10.  

## Entering dates and times

You can enter dates and times in all the fields that are assigned to dates (date fields). You can enter dates with or without separators.

> [!NOTE]  
> How you enter dates and times depends on your **Region** settings. For more information, go to [Change basic settings](ui-change-basic-settings.md).  

### Entering dates

You can either use the data picker to select a date from a calendar, or you can enter dates manually. This section provides a brief overview of how to enter dates. For more information, go to [Work with calendar dates and times](ui-enter-date-ranges.md).

For manual date entry, you can enter two, four, six, or eight digits:  

- Two digits are interpreted as the day. It will add the month and the year of the work date.  

- Four digits are interpreted as the day and month. It will add the year of the work date.  

- If the date you want is in the range 01/01/1950 through 12/31/2049, enter the year with two digits. Otherwise, enter the year with four digits.

  > [!NOTE]
  > If you're using [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, the two-digit year range may be different. Administrators can change the range by modifying the **CalendarTwoDigitYearMax** setting of the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] server. For more information, go to [Configure Business Central Server](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/configure-server-instance#General).

You can also enter a date as a weekday followed by a week number. Or, you can enter a year. For example, Mon25 or mon25 means Monday in week 25.  

Instead of entering a specific date, you can enter one of these codes.  

|Code|Result|  
|--------------|----------------|  
|t|Specifies today's date (the system date for the computer).|  
|p|Specifies an accounting period, where p means the first accounting period, p2 means the second accounting period, and so on. |
|w|Specifies the work date that is set up in the application. To change the work date, go to [Change basic settings](ui-change-basic-settings.md). You may want to use a work date if you have many transactions with a date other than today's date.|
|c|Specifies that the date after c is a closing date—for example, C123101.|  

## Entering times

When you enter times, you can insert any separator sign that you want between the units, but it isn't required. You don't have to write minutes, seconds, or AM/PM.  

The following table lists the various ways in which times can be entered and how they're interpreted.  

|Entry|Interpretation|  
|---------------|------------------------|  
|5|05:00:00|  
|5:30|05:30:00|  
|0530|05:30:00|  
|5:30:5|05:30:05|  
|053005|05:30:05|  
|5:30:5,50|05:30:05.5|  
|053005050|05:30:05.05|  

You enter two digits for each unit of time if you don't enter a separator.  

## Entering combined datetimes

[!INCLUDE [datetimes](includes/datetimes.md)]

## Entering duration

You enter a duration as a number followed by its unit of measure.  

Here are some examples.  

|Duration|Unit of measure**|  
|------------------|-------------------------|  
|2h|2 hrs|  
|6h 30 m|6 hrs 30 mins|  
|6.5h|6 hrs 30 mins|  
|90m|1 hr 30 mins|  
|2d 6h 30m|2 days 6 hrs 30 mins|  
|2d 6h 30m 56s 600ms|2 days 6 hrs 30 mins 56 secs 600 msecs|  

You can also enter a number and it's automatically converted to a duration. The number you enter is converted according to the default unit of measure that has been specified for the duration field.  

To see the unit of measure used in a duration field, enter a number and see which unit of measure it's converted to.  

The number 5 is converted to 5 hrs if the unit of measure is hours.  

## <a name="decimal"></a>Setting the decimal separator used by numeric keyboards

When using the <kbd>Decimal Separator</kbd> key on a numeric keypad to enter data, the actual decimal separator that's entered in the field is determined by your region setting in Business Central. Most regions use the period (.) or comma (,) symbol as a separator for decimal values, as you would typically see in currency amounts. The decimal key on your keypad adapts to your region. It's often different from the period or comma keys on the rest of your keyboard. You set the region in Business Central on the **My Settings** page.

For example, suppose you're using a numeric keyboard that uses a period (.) as the <kbd>Decimal Separator</kbd> key. But you're entering data for a regional language that uses a comma (**,**) for the decimal separator, like French (France). So, you want decimals like "1.23" to be entered as "1,23". In this case, you can go to the **My Settings** page and set the **Region** to the target regional language of **French (France)**. For more information, go to [Change basic settings](ui-change-basic-settings.md#region).

> [!TIP]
> On occasion you may want to use the decimal separator to enter a period (.). For example, suppose you were entering a date range in a filter, like `01/01/2022..04/01/2022`, or anything that requires a period. To accommodate this, select the <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Decimal Separator</kbd> keys on the numeric keyboard. This key combination switches the decimal separator between outputting a period and the decimal separator as determined by the **Region** setting.

# Design Details: Assembly Order Posting
Assembly order posting is based on the same principles as when posting the similar activities of sales orders and production consumption/output. However, the principles are combined in that assembly orders have their own posting UI, like that for sales orders, while the actual entry posting happens in the background as direct item and resource journal postings, like that for production consumption, output, and capacity.  

Similarly to production order posting, the consumed components and the used resources are converted and output as the assembly item when the assembly order is posted. For more information, see [Design Details: Production Order Posting](design-details-production-order-posting.md). However, the cost flow for assembly orders is less complex, especially because assembly cost posting only occurs once and therefore does not generate work-in-process inventory.  

The following journal postings occur during assembly order posting:  

-   The item journal posts positive item ledger entries, representing output of the assembly item, from the assembly order header  
-   The item journal posts negative item ledger entries, representing consumption of assembly components, from the assembly order lines.  
-   The resource journal posts usage of assembly resources (time units), from the assembly order lines.  
-   The capacity journal posts value entries relating to the resource usage, from the assembly order lines.  

The following diagram shows the structure of item and resource ledger entries that result from assembly order posting.  

![Item, resource, and capacity ledger entries resulting from assembly order posting.](media/design_details_assembly_posting_1.png "Item, resource, and capacity ledger entries resulting from assembly order posting")  

> [!NOTE]  
>  Machine and work centers are included to illustrate that capacity ledger entries are created from both production and assembly.  

The following diagram shows how assembly data flows into ledger entries during posting:  

![Assembly-related entry flow during posting.](media/design_details_assembly_posting_2.png "AAssembly-related entry flow during posting")  

## Posting Sequence  
The posting of an assembly order occurs in the following order:  

1.  The assembly order lines are posted.  
2.  The assembly order header is posted.  

The following table outlines the sequence of actions.  

|Action|Description|  
|------------|-----------------|  
|Initialize Posting|1.  Make preliminary checks.<br />2.  Add posting number and modify the assembly order header.<br />3.  Release the assembly order.|  
|Post|<ol><li>Create the posted assembly order header.</li><li>Copy comment lines.</li><li>Post assembly order lines (consumption):<br /><br /> <ol><li>Create a status page to calculate assembly consumption.</li><li>Get the remaining quantity on which the item journal line will be based.</li><li>Reset the consumed and remaining quantities.</li><li>For assembly order lines of type Item:<br /><br /> <ol><li>Populate fields on the item journal line.</li><li>Transfer reservations to the item journal line.</li><li>Post the item journal line to create the item ledger entries.</li><li>Create warehouse journal lines and post them.</li></ol></li><li>For assembly order lines of type Resource:<br /><br /> <ol><li>Populate fields on the item journal line.</li><li>Post the item journal line. This creates capacity ledger entries.</li><li>Create and post resource journal line.</li></ol></li><li>Transfer field values from the assembly order line into a newly created posted assembly order line.</li></ol></li><li>Post the assembly order header (output):<br /><br /> <ol><li>Populate fields on the item journal line.</li><li>Transfer reservations to the item journal line.</li><li>Post the item journal line to create the item ledger entries.</li><li>Create warehouse journal lines and post them.</li><li>Reset the assembly quantities and remaining quantities.</li></ol></li></ol>|  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  Unlike for production output, which is posted at expected cost, assembly output is posted at actual cost.  

## Cost Adjustment  
 Once an assembly order is posted, meaning that components (material) and resources are assembled into a new item, then it should be possible to determine the actual cost of that assembly item, and the actual inventory cost of the components involved. This is achieved by forwarding costs from the posted entries of the source (the components and resources) to the posted entries of the destination (the assembly item). The forwarding of costs is done by calculating and generating new entries, called adjustment entries that become associated with the destination entries.  

 The assembly costs to be forwarded are detected with the Order Level detection mechanism. For information about other adjustment detection mechanisms, see [Design Details: Cost Adjustment](design-details-cost-adjustment.md).  

### Detecting the Adjustment  
The order Level detection function is used in conversion scenarios, production and assembly. The function works as follows:  

-   Cost adjustment is detected by marking the order whenever a material/resource is posted as consumed/used.  
-   Cost is forwarding by applying the costs from material/resource to the output entries associated with the same order.  

The following graphic shows the adjustment entry structure and how assembly costs are adjusted.  

![Assembly-related entry flow during cost adjustment.](media/design_details_assembly_posting_3.png "Assembly-related entry flow during posting")  

### Performing the Adjustment  
The spreading of detected adjustments from material and resource costs onto the assembly output entries is performed by the **Adjust Cost – Item Entries** batch job. It contains the Make Multilevel Adjustment function, which consists of the following two elements:  

-   Make Assembly Order Adjustment – which forwards cost from material and resource usage to the assembly output entry. Lines 5 and 6 in the algorithm below are responsible for that.  
-   Make Single Level Adjustments – which forwards costs for individual items using their costing method. Lines 9 and 10 in the algorithm below are responsible for that.  

![Summary of the cost adjustment algorithm for assembly posting.](media/design_details_assembly_posting_4.jpg "Summary of the cost adjustment algorithm for assembly posting")  

> [!NOTE]  
>  The Make WIP Adjustments element, in lines 7 and 8, is responsible for forwarding production material and capacity usage to the output of unfinished production orders. This is not used when adjusting assembly order costs as the concept of WIP does not apply to assembly.  

For information about how costs from assembly and production are posted to the general ledger, see [Design Details: Inventory Posting](design-details-inventory-posting.md).  

## Assembly Costs are Always Actual  
 The concept of work in process (WIP) does not apply in assembly order posting. Assembly costs are only posted as actual cost, never as expected cost. For more information, see [Design Details: Expected Cost Posting](design-details-expected-cost-posting.md).  

This is enabled by the following data structure.  

-   In the **Type** field on item journal lines, in the **Capacity Ledger Entry** and **Value Entry** tables, *Resource* is used to identify assembly resource entries.  
-   In the **Item Ledger Entry Type** field on item journal lines, in the **Capacity Ledger Entry** and **Value Entry** tables, *Assembly Output* and *Assembly Consumption* are used to identify the output assembly item entries and the consumed assembly component entries respectively.  

In addition, posting group fields on the assembly order header and assembly order lines are populated by default as follows.  

|Entity|Type|Posting Group|Gen. Prod. Posting Group|  
|------------|----------|-------------------|------------------------------|  
|Assembly Order Header|Item|Inventory Posting Group|Gen. Prod. Posting Group|  
|Assembly Order Line|Item|Inventory Posting Group|Gen. Prod. Posting Group|  
|Assembly Order Line|Resource||Gen. Prod. Posting Group|  

Accordingly, only actual costs are posted to the general ledger, and no interim accounts are populated from assembly order posting. For more information, see [Design Details: Accounts in the General Ledger](design-details-accounts-in-the-general-ledger.md)  

## Assemble to Order  
The item ledger entry that results from posting an assemble-to-order sale is fixed applied to the related item ledger entry for the assembly output. Accordingly, the cost of an assemble-to-order sale is derived from the assembly order that it was linked to.  

Item ledger entries of type Sale that result from posting assemble-to-order quantities are marked with **Yes** in the **Assemble to Order** field.  

Posting sales order lines where a part is inventory quantity and another part is assemble-to-order quantity results in separate item ledger entries, one for the inventory quantity and one for the assemble-to-order quantity.  

### Posting dates

In general, posting dates are copied from a sales order to the linked assembly order. The posting date in the assembly order is automatically updated when you change the  posting date in the sales order directly or indirectly, such as if you change the posting date in the warehouse shipment, inventory pick, or as part of a bulk posting.

You can change the posting date in the assembly order manually. However, it can not be later then posting date in the linked sales order. The system will keep this date unless you update the posting date in the sales order.

# Set up locations

Locations are places such as warehouses where you buy, store, or sell items. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses locations to help keep track of inventory in both simple and complex warehouse processes.

You can then create document lines for a specific location, view availability by location, and transfer inventory between locations. To learn more, go to [Manage Inventory](inventory-manage-inventory.md).
<br><br>  
  
> [!Video https://learn-video.azurefd.net/vod/player?id=fe5ed50e-2e5d-47d4-8616-92ae4639f400]

## Location cards

You specify information about a location, such as a warehouse or distribution center, on the **Location Card** page. You give each location a name and a code that represents the location. You can then enter the location code in other parts of the program when you want to record transactions for a given location.  

You can enter information about bins and warehouse policies for each location. Based on your warehouse policies, you can use the options on the **Bins** FastTab to specify the bins to use by default for transactions. If you're using directed put-away and pick, the options on the **Bin Policies** FastTab let you define how to use advanced warehousing features.  

Some option fields depend on settings in the **Location Card** page to restrict unsupported setup combinations.  

Choose the **Zones** or **Bins** actions to view information about zones and bins that are defined for the location.

### To set up a location

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Locations**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action.
3. On the **Location Card** page, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for every location where you want to keep inventory.

> [!NOTE]  
> Many fields on the Location Card page are related to the handling of items in inbound and outbound warehouse processes. These fields are not relevant for companies that do not require complex warehouse functionality. To learn more, go to [Setting Up Warehouse Management](warehouse-setup-warehouse.md).

You can change the configuration of a location as long as it doesn't have item ledger entries.  

If you have multiple locations, you can define transfer routes between locations. To learn more about transfer routes, go to [To create a transfer route](inventory-how-setup-locations.md#to-create-a-transfer-route).

### To create a transfer route

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Transfer Routes**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action.
4. On the **Location Card** page, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

You can now transfer inventory items between two locations. To learn more about transfers, go to [Transfer Inventory Between Locations](inventory-how-transfer-between-locations.md).

## Bins

Bins represent the basic warehouse structure and can suggest where to put items. Your bins can have contents, or be floating bins without specific contents.

To use the bin functionality at a location, on the **Location Card** page, on the **Warehouse** FastTab, turn on the **Bin Mandatory** toggle. You can design the item flow at the location by specifying bin codes in the fields for the warehouse processes on the **Bins** and **Bin Policies** FastTabs.

> [!NOTE]
> Before you can specify bin codes on a location, you must create bin codes. To learn more about bins, go to [Create Bins](warehouse-how-to-create-individual-bins.md) and [Set Up Bin Types](warehouse-how-to-set-up-bin-types.md).  

## Zones

If you want to structure your bins under zones, you can do that in the **Zones** page. When you assign a zone to bins, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] copies information from the zone to the bins. You can also choose to set up one zone and use bins alone to organize your warehouse. To learn more about zones, go to [Setting Up Warehouse Management](warehouse-setup-warehouse.md).  

## Default Dimensions for Locations

Dimensions are values that categorize entries so you can track and analyze them using various reporting tools. For example, dimensions can indicate the department or project an entry came from. Having default dimensions helps people avoid making mistakes and having to enter dimensions manually on the transaction level if all goods come from a single location and department.

You set default dimensions for a location on the **Location Card** page by choosing **Dimensions**. Afterward, the location's default dimensions are assigned to the following documents when you choose the location on a line.

* Transfer orders
* Physical inventory orders
* Inventory shipments
* Inventory receipts
* Item journals

If needed, you can delete or change the dimension on the line. In the **Value Posting** field, you can require people to specify dimensions for locations before they can post an entry. If you want to allow people to choose only certain dimension values, you can specify the values in the **Allowed Values Filter** field. You can also include location dimension values on the **Default Dimension Priorities** page, and for combinations of priority and dimension rules on the **Dimension Combinations** page.

Because transfer order documents and reclassification journals deal with more than one location, the order in which you enter data is important. Default dimensions are copied from the last location field (the in-transit location is ignored).

### Example of default dimensions on locations

The following examples illustrate how the default dimension is used.

You have the following dimension settings:

* Location EAST. Department dimension is ADM
* Location WEST. Department dimension is PROD

You specify the location on a transfer order as follows:

1. From Location = EAST
2. To Location = WEST

The PROD dimension will be copied from location WEST.

You fill in the fields in the opposite order, as follows:

1. To Location = WEST
2. From Location = EAST

The ADM dimension will be copied from location EAST.

# Database Wait Statistics in [!INCLUDE[prod_long](includes/prod_long.md)]

The administrators and developers can have insights into the database performance by looking at **Database Wait Statistics** in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The information presented by **Database Wait Statistics** can help to check the kind of resources that are being used and the kind of delays that are being faced by the database processes. By analyzing these wait statistics, you can find the root cause of the slow performance by your database and can eventually make better decisions for the application performance.

For more information about the database wait statistics, see [Database Wait Statistics in Dynamics 365 Business Central](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/database-wait-statistics).

# Manage storage by deleting documents or compressing data

A central role, such as the application administrator, must regularly deal with accumulating historic documents by deleting or compressing them.  

> [!TIP]
> Learn more about other ways to reduce the amount of data stored in a database by reading [Reducing Data Stored in Business Central Databases](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/database-reduce-data) in our Developer and IT pro documentation.

## Delete documents

In certain situations, you might need to delete invoiced purchase orders. However, you can't delete them unless you fully invoice and received the items in the purchase orders. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] helps you out by checking for that.

Businesses usually delete return orders after they're invoiced. When you post an invoice, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] transfers it to the **Posted Purchase Credit Memo** page. If you selected the **Return Shipment on Credit Memo** check box on the **Purchases & Payable Setup** page, the invoice is transferred to the **Posted Return Shipment** page. You can delete the documents using the **Delete Invd Purch. Ret. Orders** batch job. Before it deletes documents, the batch job checks whether the purchase return orders are fully shipped and invoiced.  

Blanket purchase orders aren't automatically deleted after you process and invoice all the related purchase orders. Instead, you can delete them with the **Delete Invoiced Blanket Purchase Orders** batch job.  

Businesses typically delete invoiced service orders automatically after they're fully invoiced. When an invoice is posted, a corresponding entry is created and can then be viewed on the **Posted Service Invoices** page.  

Service orders aren't deleted automatically, however, if the total quantity on the order was posted from the **Service Invoice** page rather than from service order itself. You might need to manually delete such invoiced orders by running the **Delete Invoiced Service Orders** batch job.  

## Compress data with date compression

You can compress data in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to save space in the database&mdash;which in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online can even save you money. The compression, based on dates and functions, combines several old entries into one new entry.

You can compress entries that meet all of the following conditions:

* They're from closed fiscal years.
* The **Open** field is set to **No**.
* They're at least five years old. If you want to compress data less than five years old, contact your Microsoft partner.

So, for example, vendor ledger entries from previous fiscal years can be compressed so there's only one credit and one debit entry per account per month. The amount in the new entry is the sum of all the compressed entries. The date assigned is the starting date for the compressed period, such as the first day of the month (if you compress entries by month). After compression, you can still see the net change for each account in the previous fiscal year.

The number of entries that result from a date compression depends on how many filters you set, which fields are combined, and which period length you choose. There's always at least one entry. When the batch job is finished, you can see the result on the **Date Compr. Registers** page.

You can compress the following data types using batch jobs.

* Finance entries - general ledger (G/L) entries, value added tax (VAT) entries, bank account ledger entries, G/L budget entries, customer ledger entries, and vendor ledger entries.
* Warehouse entries
* Resource entries
* Item budget entries
* Fixed asset (FA) ledger entries, FA maintenance ledger entries, and FA insurance ledger entries.

When you're defining criteria for the compression, you can keep the contents of certain fields using the options under **Retain Field Contents**. The available fields depend on the data you're compressing.

> [!NOTE]
> Before you can run date compression, your analysis views must be current. Learn more in the [Update an analysis view](bi-how-analyze-data-dimension.md#update-an-analysis-view) section.

After the compression, the contents of the following fields are always retained: **Posting Date**, **Vendor No.**, **Document Type**, **Currency Code**, **Posting Group**, **Amount**, **Remaining Amount**, **Original Amt. (LCY)**, **Remaining Amt. (LCY)**, **Amount (LCY)**, **Purchase (LCY)**, **Inv. Discount (LCY)**, **Pmt. Disc. Given (LCY)**, and **Pmt. Disc. Possible**.

## Posting compressed entries

Compressed entries are posted a little differently than standard posting. This difference is to reduce the number of new general ledger entries created by date compression, and is especially important when you keep information such as dimensions and document numbers. Date compression creates new entries as follows:

* On the **General Ledger Entries** page, new entries are created for the compressed entries. The **Description** field contains **Date Compressed** so the compressed entries are easy to identify. 
* On ledger pages, such as the **Customer Ledger Entries** page, one or more new entries are created. 

The posting process creates gaps in the number series for entries on the **General Ledger Entries** page. Those numbers are assigned to the entries on the ledger pages only. The number range assigned to the entries is available on the **G/L Register** page in the **From Entry No.** and **To Entry No.** fields. 

> [!NOTE]
> After you run date compression, you can't reverse vendor or bank ledger entries for any transactions that are affected by the compression.

The number of entries that result from a date compression depends on how many filters you set, which fields are combined, and the length of the time period you choose. There's always at least one entry.

> [!WARNING]
> Date compression deletes entries, so you should always make a backup copy of the database before you run the batch job.

### To run a date compression

1. Choose the ![Search for Page or Report](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Data Administration**, then choose the related link.
2. Do one of the following, depending on your needs:
    * To use an assisted guide to set up date compression for one or more types of data, choose **Data Administration Guide**.
    * To set up compression for an individual type of data, choose **Data Compression**, **Compress Entries**, then choose the data to compress.

   > [!NOTE]
   > You can only compress data more than five years old. If you want to compress data less than five years old, contact your Microsoft partner. They need to use the `OnSetMinimumNumberOfYearsToKeep` event in the "Date Compression" codeunit to set the threshold.

# Selling Inventory Items in Assemble-to-Order Flows

If the **Assembly Policy** field on the item card of an assembly item contains **Assemble-to-Order**, the sales order process assumes that the item isn't in inventory and must be assembled for sales orders. When you add the item to a line on a sales order, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates an assembly order that's linked to the sales order. To learn more about how to sell assemble-to-order items, go to [Sell Items Assembled to Order](assembly-how-to-sell-items-assembled-to-order.md). However, if some of the sales order quantity is already available in inventory, you can decrease the assembly order quantity by changing the **Qty. to Assemble to Order** field on the sales order line.  

It's relatively rare for businesses to sell inventory items as assemble-to-order items. Assemble-to-order items typically aren't standard. They're customized to meet specific customer requirements. However, you might have quantities of assemble-to-order items in inventory due to returns or order cancellations. Those quantities should be picked and sold before new ones are assembled.  

> [!NOTE]  
> To check whether whether assemble-to-order items are already available for assembly orders, use the **Sales Line Details** FactBox on the sales order.  

You can do similar things when you're selling assembly items from inventory and some or all of the quantity isn't available. You can supply the missing quantity through an assembly order. To learn more about selling inventory and assembly items, go to [Sell Assemble-to-Order Items and Inventory Items Together](assembly-how-to-sell-assemble-to-order-items-and-inventory-items-together.md).  

> [!NOTE]  
> There are rules that apply to the **Qty. to Ship** field on sales order lines that contain a combination of assemble-to-order quantities and inventory quantities. To learn more about the rules, go to [Combination scenarios](assembly-assemble-to-order-or-assemble-to-stock.md#combination-scenarios).  

In this procedure, you replace assemble-to-order quantities with inventory quantities on a sales order line. The following steps provide an overview:

1. Determine availability.
2. Reducing that quantity from the linked assembly order.
3. Reserve the inventory quantity to make sure that it's picked and shipped for the order.  

## To sell inventory items in assemble-to-order flows

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Create a sales order. To learn about creating sales orders, go to [Sell Products](sales-how-sell-products.md).  
3. On a sales order line that contains an assemble-to-order item, in the **Quantity** field, enter the quantity.  
4. In the **Sales Line Details** FactBox, determine whether some of all of the quantity is available.  
5. In the **Qty. to Assemble to Order** field, deduct the available quantity so that only the unavailable quantity is assembled to the order. The **Reserved Quantity** field is decreased accordingly to reflect that the order-to-order link, or reservation, only applies to the quantity to be assembled.  
6. On the **Lines** FastTab, choose **Functions**, and then choose the **Reserve** action.  
7. On the **Reservation** page, select the item ledger entry line or lines that contain the available quantities, choose the **Reserve from Current Line** action, and then choose the **OK** button.  

    On the **Sales Order** page, the **Reserved Quantity** field now shows that the full quantity for the order line is reserved. The **Qty. to Assemble to Order** field still reflects the quantity to assemble.  

8. Release the sales order to make the items available for picking and for assembly of the unavailable items. To learn more about assembling items, go to [Assemble Items](assembly-how-to-assemble-items.md).  

> [!CAUTION]  
> The **Bin Code** field on the sales order might contain the value from the **Assemble-to-Order Shpt. Bin Code** or **From-Assembly Bin Code** fields on the location card. If it does, the **Bin Code** field on the sales order line might be incorrect for this combination of assemble-to-order and assemble-to-stock quantities. It's a good idea to double-check that the bin in the **Bin Code** field works for all quantities. Alternatively, enter the two different quantities on separate sales order lines.

# Set up prices and discounts

> [!NOTE]
> In 2020 release wave 2, we released streamlined processes for setting up and managing prices and discounts. If you're a new customer using that version, you're using the new experience. If you're an existing customer, whether you're using the new experience depends on whether your admin enabled the **New sales pricing experience** feature update on the **Feature Management** page. To learn more, go to [Enabling Upcoming Features Ahead of Time](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/feature-management).

Price and discount strategies for the purchase and sale of items and services are fundamental tools for successful businesses. After you set up the items and services your company buys and sells, you can define what you pay or charge for them. When you select the item or service on sales and purchase documents, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] adds the amounts.

## Setting up prices and discounts

Before you create price lists, you must define your pricing and discount strategies on the **Sales & Receivables Setup** and **Purchase & Payables Setup** pages.

You can set up and use two types of discounts:

| Discount Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Line Discount** |A discount amount that is given for lines on sales and purchase documents. Typically, line discounts are based on a combination of customer, item, minimum quantity, unit of measure, or period of time that you define for sales and purchases on the **Sales & Receivables Setup** and **Purchase & Payables Setup** pages.|
| **Invoice Discount** |A discount percentage that is subtracted from sales and purchase document total if the sum of all lines on the document exceeds a certain minimum. |

Because sales prices and sales line discounts are based on a combination of item and customer, you can also set them up on the items to which the rules and values apply.

> [!TIP]  
> If an item should never be sold with a discount, leave the discount fields on the item empty, and don't include the item in any line discount setups.

## About price lists

Price lists are flexible and let you specify the business partner or activity that they apply to. For example, you can set up one price list that applies to all vendors and customers, or offer special prices or discounts for each business partner. Special prices or discounts are often based on a minimum quantity on purchase or sales orders, periods of time, or a certain combination of customer, item, minimum quantity, and unit of measure. The prices and discounts you define automatically apply to purchase and sales documents.

## Set up prices

These steps differ, depending on whether your admin turned on the **New sales pricing experience** feature update.

### [Current Experience](#tab/current-experience)  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customers**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the customer, and then choose the **Prices** action.
3. Fill in the fields on the line as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)] Fill a line for each combination that grants a special sales price to the customer.

### [New Experience](#tab/new-experience)  

You can add items and services manually for each line, or you can use the **Suggest Lines** action to create new prices for selected items, item discount groups, resources, and other product types. If you choose **Suggest Lines**, on the **Price Lines - Create New** page you can use filters to select the items or services to include on the price list. You can also specify whether to consider other factors, such as:

* A minimum quantity when calculating prices.
* The adjustment factor to apply for new price list lines.
* The rounding method to apply for prices.

[!INCLUDE [edit-in-excel-price-list](includes/edit-in-excel-price-list.md)]

By default, the status of new price lists is **Draft**. When you're ready to start using the list, you can change the status to **Active**.

To review price lists and prices that apply for specific customers or vendors, on the **Customer** or **Vendor** pages, choose either **Sales Price Lists** or **Purchase Price Lists** action. For items and resources, you can view price list lines by choosing **Sales Prices** or **Purchase Prices** on the **Item** and **Resource** pages.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customers**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the customer, and then choose the **Sales Price Lists** action.
3. Choose **New** to create a new sales price list.
4. On the **General** and **Tax** FastTabs, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
5. Add items to the list in one of the following ways:
   * To add many items, choose **Suggest Lines**, and then enter filter criteria to specify the types of items to add. Optionally, you can enter settings for the items that are specific to the price list. You can change the settings later, if needed.
   * To copy items from another price list, choose **Copy Lines**, and then choose the price list to copy.
   * To add items manually, in the **Product Type** field, choose the type of product that the price list is for. Depending on your selection, fill in the remaining fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
6. To start using the price list, in the **Status** field, choose **Active**.

> [!Note]
>
> To set up prices or line discounts for all customers, a customer price group, or a campaign, you must open the pages from an item card. Alternatively, for sales prices, use the **Sales Price Worksheet** page. To learn more, go to [To bulk update item prices](sales-how-record-sales-price-discount-payment-agreements.md#to-bulk-update-item-prices).  

### [New Experience](#tab/new-experience/)

## Work with invoice discounts and service charges

When you use invoice discounts, the size of the invoice amount determines the size of the discount that is granted. On the **Invoice Discounts** page, you can also add a service charge to invoices over a certain amount.

Before you can use invoice discounts with sales, you must enter certain information in application. You must decide which customers you want to grant this type of discount, and the discount percentages.  

If you want [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to automatically calculate invoice discounts, turn on the **Calc. Inv. Discount** toggle on the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page.  

For each customer, you can specify whether you grant invoice discounts if the requirement is satisfied (that is, if the invoice amount is large enough). You can define the terms of the invoice discount in local currency for domestic customers and in foreign currency for foreign customers.  

You link discount percentages to specific invoice amounts on the **Invoice Discounts** page. You can enter as many percentages as you need. Each customer can have their own page, or you can link several customers to the same page.  

In addition to (or instead of) a discount percentage, you can link a service charge amount to a specific invoice amount.  

> [!TIP]  
> Before you start entering this information, it's a good idea to prepare your discount structure beforehand, so it's easier to see which customers to link to the same invoice discount page. For more information about discounts in sales, see [Set up discounts for your customers](/training/modules/customer-discounts-dynamics-365-business-central/index).

### To set up an invoice discount for a customer

After you decide which customers are eligible for invoice discounts, enter the invoice discount code on the customer cards and set up the terms for each code.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customers**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the customer page for a customer that's eligible for invoice discounts.
3. In the **Invoice Disc. Code** field, select a customer for which you specified the invoice discount terms to use to calculate invoice discounts.

> [!NOTE]  
> Invoice discount codes are the discount term settings for a customer, which can save you time. You can quickly assign invoice discount terms to customers by reusing the settings from another customer.

Proceed to set up new the sales invoice discount terms.

1. On the **Customers** page, choose the **Invoice Discounts** action. The **Cust. Invoice Discounts** page opens.
2. In the **Currency Code** field, enter the code for a currency that the invoice discount terms on the line applies to. Leave the field blank to set up invoice discount terms in USD.
3. In the **Minimum Amount** field, enter the minimum amount that an invoice must have to be eligible for the discount.
4. In the **Discount %** field, enter the invoice discount as a percentage of the invoice amount.
5. Repeat steps 2 through 4 for each currency that the customer uses.

The invoice discount is now set up and assigned to the customer. When you select the customer code in the **Invoice Disc. Code** field on other customer cards, the same invoice discount is assigned to those customers.

These steps differ, depending on whether your administrator turned on the **New sales pricing experience** feature update.

### [Current Experience](#tab/current-experience/)

If you want to bulk update item prices, such as increase all item prices by some percentage, you must run the **Suggest Item Price on Wksh.** batch job. You can find a link to the batch job on the **Sales Price Worksheet** page.

### [New Experience](#tab/new-experience/)

To update prices for multiple items, you must create a new price list, and then copy the lines from an existing price list. When you copy the lines you can use filters to specify what to copy, and you can specify an integer or decimal number in the **Adjustment Factor** field to increase or decrease prices. The price list must be in the **Draft** status. If needed, you can then deactivate the old price list.

> [!NOTE]
> You can't have two lines that have the same settings but different prices. If that happens, a message displays when you activate a price list. You can choose the price to use by opening the list and deleting the incorrect price.

# Managing Marketing Campaigns
Having a strong marketing plan in place enables you to identify, attract, and retain customers. A marketing plan consists of various campaigns and other interactions in connection with your sales and marketing activities. While planning a campaign, you need to decide which contacts to target, what type of campaign (such as trade show or direct mail), and what salespeople will perform each task.

Each campaign consists of various activities or tasks. You can combine multiple task, for example tasks that each represent a step, in activities. Activity tasks are related to each other by a date formula. Individual tasks can only be assigned to salespeople. Activities can be assigned to opportunities, salespeople, groups of sales people, and contacts. For more information, see [Set Up Opportunity Sales Cycles and Cycle Stages](marketing-how-setup-opportunity-sales-cycles-stages.md).

## Defining individual campaigns
Before you can create a campaign, you must set up *campaign status codes*. Using these codes will help you manage your campaigns by assigning a status to the campaign. As you work through the stages of a campaign, you are able to see what step a campaign is at and what step comes next. You set up campaign status codes on the **Campaign Status** page.

You can create a campaign card for each campaign that you want to keep track of. You can also view these campaign cards to view general information about your campaigns.
You can delete campaign entries, such as if the entry records an action that has been canceled. Only canceled campaign entries can be deleted.

### Selecting the target audience
After you have created a campaign, you can start creating segments that specify the target audience of the campaign. For more information, see [Managing Segments](marketing-segments.md).

### Registering discount percentages
When you have set up your campaign, decided what segments you want the campaign to cover, and set the starting and ending dates, you register the discount percentage that the customer will receive on the individual items on the lines on the **Sales Line Discounts** page. You can also register the sales prices for the individual items on the lines on the **Sales Prices** page. You can access both pages from the campaign card.

 When you have set up the sales prices/line discounts and the segments on the campaign card, you must activate them so that the campaign prices/discounts will be reflected on the lines.

> [!NOTE]  
>   In order to activate the sales prices/line discounts, you must specify if the whole segment or only some contacts are targets of the campaign. If the sales prices/line discounts covers all the contacts in the segment, select the **Campaign Target** field on the **Campaign** FastTab of the **Segment** card.

If the sales prices/line discounts are not to be offered to all the contacts in the segment, you can clear the **Campaign Target** field for the relevant contacts. If you cannot see this field, you can add it to your view. For more information, see [Personalize Your Workspace](ui-personalization-user.md).

## Conducting campaigns
As a campaign runs, all interactions with your contacts, or segment, are recorded so that you can get statistics and other information about the costs and success rates of the campaign.

Campaigns are conducted by salespeople, and you must create activities to represent each task and assign them to the relevant salespeople. For more information, see [Set Up Opportunity Sales Cycles and Cycle Stages](marketing-how-setup-opportunity-sales-cycles-stages.md).
