# Enable Application of Ledger Entries in Different Currencies

If you purchase from a vendor in one currency and submit payment in another currency, you can apply the payment to the purchase.

Likewise, if you sell to a customer in one currency and receive payment in another currency, you can apply the payment to the sales invoice.

The following procedure describes how to set this up for vendor ledger entries on the **Purchases & Payables Setup** page. The setup is similar for customer ledger entries on the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page.

## To enable application of vendor ledger entries in different currencies

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchases & Payables Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. In the **Appln. between Currencies** field, select one of the following options.

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| None |Application between currencies is not allowed. |
| EMU |Application between EMU currencies is allowed. |
| All |Application between all currencies is allowed. |

## To set up G/L accounts for currency application rounding differences

If you apply entries in different currencies, you must set up the general ledger accounts to which you want to post rounding differences.  

> [!NOTE]  
> You must set up the general ledger accounts before you complete the task. For more information, see [Understanding the General Ledger and the Chart of Accounts](finance-general-ledger.md).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customer Posting Groups**, and then choose the related link.  
2. In the **Debit Curr. Appln. Rndg. Acc.** and **Credit Curr. Appln. Rndg. Acc.** fields, enter the relevant general ledger accounts to post rounding differences.  
3. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Vendor Posting Groups**, and then choose the related link.  
4. In the **Debit Curr. Appln. Rndg. Acc.** and **Credit Curr. Appln. Rndg. Acc.** fields, enter the relevant general ledger accounts to post rounding differences.

# Create prepayment invoices

If you require customers to pay before you'll ship their order, you can use the prepayment features. The same applies if your vendor requires you to pay before they ship an order to you.  

You can start the prepayment process when you create a sales or purchase order. The default prepayment percentage for an item on the order, or for the customer or vendor, will be included in the prepayment invoice. You can also specify a prepayment percentage to the entire document.

After you create a sales or purchase order, you can create a prepayment invoice for it. Either use the default percentages for each sales or purchase line, or adjust the amount. For example, you might specify a total amount for the entire order.  

The following procedure describes how to invoice a prepayment for a sales order. The steps are similar for purchase orders.  

## To create a prepayment invoice

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Create a new sales order for the relevant customer. For more information, see [Sell Products](sales-how-sell-products.md).  

    On the **Prepayment** FastTab, the **Prepayment %** field specifies the percentage to use to calculate the prepayment amount. If there's a default prepayment percentage on the customer card, the field is filled in automatically. You can change the percentage. <!--This percentage is applied to lines where the item on that line does not already specify a prepayment percentage. The prepayment percentage is only copied from the header to lines that do not copy the default prepayment percentage from the item.-->  

    Choose the **Compress Prepayment** field if you want to create lines on the prepayment invoice that combine lines from the sales order if:  

    - They have the same general ledger account for prepayments as determined by the general posting setup.  
    - They have the same dimensions.  

    If you want to specify a prepayment invoice with one line for each sales order line that has a prepayment percentage, don't choose the **Compress Prepayment** field.  

    The due date for the prepayment is calculated automatically based on the value of the **Prepmt. Payment Terms Code**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > When some lines on an invoice require 100% prepayment and other lines don't, and there's VAT on the prepayment account, the rounded amount might cause an error when you create a prepayment invoice. The error occurs because the prepayment invoice amount is higher than the amounts on the document lines. To fix the problem, change the amounts on one or all of the lines that require 100% prepayment. The change will recalculate the VAT amount rounding and use the accumulated rounding difference on the last modified line.
    >
    > Two more ways to fix the problem are:
    >
    > * Create a separate VAT product posting group and a VAT posting setup with a separate VAT identifier and use that for the items or lines that require 100% prepayment. Rounding is done for each VAT identifier, so separate rounding will be done for items that are assigned to the VAT product posting group.
    > * Use a separate invoice for the items or lines that do and don't require 100% prepayments.

3. Fill in the sales lines.  

    If you've specified a default prepayment percentage either for the customer or on the **Prepayment** FastTab on this document, this value is copied to each line. You can change the contents of the **Prepayment %** field on the line.  

    > [!TIP]
    > If you do not see the **Prepayment %** field, you can add it through personalization.  For more information, see [Personalize Your Workspace](ui-personalization-user.md).

4. To view the total prepayment amount, choose the **Statistics** action.

    If you want to adjust the total prepayment amount for the order, you can change the contents of the **Prepayment Amount** field on the **Sales Order Statistics** page.  

    If the **Prices Including VAT** field is selected, the **Prepayment Amount Incl. VAT** field is editable.  

    If you change the contents of the **Prepayment Amount** field, the amount will be distributed proportionately between all lines, except lines that have **0** in the **Prepayment %** field.  

5. To print a test report before posting the prepayment invoice, choose the **Prepayment** action, and then choose the **Prepayment Test Report** action.  
6. To post the prepayment invoice, choose the **Prepayment** action, and then choose the **Post Prepayment Invoice** action.  

    To post and print the prepayment invoice, choose the **Post and Print Prepmt. Invoice** action.  

You can issue other prepayment invoices for the order. To issue another invoice, increase the prepayment amount on one or more lines, adjust the document date if necessary, and post the prepayment invoice. A new invoice will be created for the difference between the prepayment amounts invoiced so far and the new prepayment amount.  

> [!NOTE]  
> If you are located in North America, you cannot change the prepayment percentage after the prepayment invoice has been posted. This is prevented in the North American version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] because the calculation of sales tax will otherwise be incorrect.  

 When you're ready to post the rest of the invoice, post it as you would post any invoice, and the prepayment amount will automatically be deducted from the amount due.  

## Update the status of prepaid orders and invoices automatically

You can speed up order and invoice processing by setting up job queue entries that automatically update the status of those documents. When a prepayment invoice is paid, the job queue entries can automatically change the document status from **Pending Prepayment** to **Released**. When you set up the job queue entries, the codeunits you'll need to use are **384 Upd. Pending Prepmt. Sales** and **384 Upd. Pending Prepmt. Purchase**. We recommend that you schedule the entries to run frequently, for example, every minute. For more information, see [Use Job Queues to Schedule Tasks](admin-job-queues-schedule-tasks.md).

# Move items in advanced warehouse configurations that use directed put-away and pick

You can move items between bins without a demand from a source document. For example, you might want to do that as part of the following activities:

* Reorganize your warehouse.
* Bring items to an inspection area.
* Take items out of the warehouse pick bins temporarily, perhaps to serve as demonstration models in a sales presentation.
* Move extra items to production area for components configured with some flushing methods.
* Move produced or assembled items from production or assembly area to warehouse.
* Move items from bulk storage area to bins you use for picking.

How you move items depends on how your warehouse is set up as a location. Learn more at [Setting Up Warehouse Management](warehouse-setup-warehouse.md).

In warehouse configurations where the **Directed Pick and Put-away** toggle is turned on for locations, you can register unplanned movements on the following pages:  

* Movement Worksheet
* Warehouse Internal Pick
* Warehouse Internal Put-away
* Warehouse Reclassification Journal

The **Movement Worksheet** , **Warehouse Internal Pick**, and  **Warehouse Internal Put-away** pages work in the same way. Use the pages to prepare warehouse activities for warehouse employees. The difference is in the advanced functionality associated with each page, and the different types of warehouse activities that are probably performed by different employees:

* Movement worksheet lets you fill up high-ranking pick bins with items from other bins
* Put-aways use put-away templates
* Picking uses bin ranking and availability

## Warehouse movement worksheet

### To move items with the warehouse movement worksheet

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Movement Worksheet**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields on the worksheet lines manually, or use one of the following actions to automatically fill in the lines:

    * **Get Bin Content** fills in the worksheet lines with the contents of the bin or bins you specify.
    * **Calculate Bin Replenishment** uses the bin rankings to suggest replenishment for high-ranking bins from low-ranking bins.

    > [!NOTE]  
    > If the item meets the criteria in the list below, the **From Zone** and **From Bin** fields will be blank. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates from where to move the items only when you use the **Create Movement** action.  
    >  
    > * The item has an expiration date.  
    > * The **Pick According to FEFO** toggle is turned on for the location.  
    > * You're using the **Calculate Bin Replenishment** feature.  

3. Choose the **Create Movement** action to create the movement. When the move is complete, you can register it.  

### To register the warehouse movement

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Movements**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the movement document to register.  
3. On **Place** lines, specify where, which, and by when to move the item by choosing values in the **Zone Code**, **Bin Code**, **Qty. to Handle**, or **Due Date** fields.  
4. On **Take** lines, in the **Qty. to Handle** field, specify the quantity of the bin content that you want to move. You can only edit this field on **Take** lines. 

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you must pick or place the items for one line in more than one bin, for example because the designated bin is full, use the **Split Line** action on the **Lines** FastTab. The action creates a line for the remaining quantity to handle.
 
5. To register all suggested quantities as specified in the **Quantity** field, choose the **Autofill Qty. to Handle** action.  
6. Choose the **Register** action.  

> [!NOTE]  
> For locations that use directed put-away and pick, you can't manually move items in bins of the type **RECEIVE** because they aren't yet considered as available inventory. You must put away the items in these bins before they're available for movements.

## Internal pick  

### To create an internal pick  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Whse. Internal Pick**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.
3. Fill in the **No.** field, **Location Code** field, and the **To Bin Code** field on the **General** FastTab. The **To Bin Code** field specifies the bin where you want to place the picked items. For production purposes, this bin would be the inbound production bin or the open shop bin. For other purposes, choose a bin code of a bin type that is not used for picking, most likely a staging, shipping, or special purpose bin.  
4. Select an item in the **Item No.** field, and fill in the quantities you want to pick.  
5. Choose the **Create Pick** action. A warehouse pick instruction is now ready for a warehouse employee to perform. Alternatively, choose the **Release** action and create warehouse picks using the **Pick Worksheet** page. To learn more about pick worksheets, go to [Create pick documents in bulk with the pick worksheet](warehouse-how-to-pick-items-for-warehouse-shipment.md#to-create-pick-documents-in-bulk-with-the-pick-worksheet).
6. When the pick is complete, you can register it.  

### To register the warehouse pick

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Picks**, and then choose the related link.  

    To work on a particular pick, select the pick from the list, or filter the list to find the picks that are assigned to you.  
2. If the **Assigned User ID** field is blank, enter your ID to identify yourself, if needed.  
3. Pick the items.  

    Because the warehouse is set up to use directed put-away and pick, bin ranking determines the bins to pick from. The bins are suggested on the pick lines. The instructions contain at least two separate lines for Take and Place actions.  

4. After you pick and place the items in the shipping area or shipping bin, choose the **Register Pick** action.  

## Internal put-away  

### To create an internal put-away  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Warehouse Internal Put-aways**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.
3. Fill in the **No.** and **Location Code** fields.
4. Fill in a line for each item to move to the warehouse. The **Item No.** and the **Quantity** fields are required.

    > [!NOTE]  
    > When you choose an item in the **Item No.** field, the **Bin Contents** page opens instead of the **Items** page. This page opens because you're putting away an item that is assigned to a particular bin - *bin content* - not just an item, and you already know the bin the item should be taken from. If you filled in the **From Bin Code** field, the bin content will be filtered by that value.

5. To fill the lines with the entire bin content or the filtered content of bins in the location, choose the **Get Bin Content** action.  
6. Choose the **Create Put-away** action. A warehouse put-away instruction is now ready for a warehouse employee. Alternatively, choose the **Release** action to create warehouse put-aways using the **Put-away worksheet** page. To learn more about put-away worksheets, go to [Create put-away documents in bulk with the put-away worksheet](warehouse-how-to-put-items-away-with-warehouse-put-aways.md#to-create-put-away-documents-in-bulk-with-the-put-away-worksheet).
6. When the put-away is complete, you can register it.  

### To register the warehouse put away

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Put-aways**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the warehouse put-away that's ready to handle.  
3. If required, enter your user ID when you start work on a put-away.  

    To optimize the put-away process, you can sort the put-away lines by various criteria. For example, by item, shelf number, or due date.
   
    * If the Take and Place lines for each receipt line don't immediately follow one another, and you want them to, sort the lines by selecting **Item** in the **Sorting Method** field.  
    * If the bin rankings reflect the physical layout of the warehouse, use the **Bin Ranking** sorting method to organize the work around the bin locations.

  > [!NOTE]  
  > Lines are sorted in ascending order by the selected criteria. If you sort by document, sorting is done first by document type based on the **Warehouse Activity Source Document** enum. If you sort by ship-to, sorting is done by destination type based on the **Warehouse Destination Type** field.

4. Perform the put-away.

    Each internal put-away line has become at least two lines in the warehouse put-away.  

    * The first line, with **Take** in the **Action Type** field, indicates where the items are located in the receiving area. You can't change the zone and bin on this line.  
    * The next line, with **Place** in the **Action Type** field, shows where to place the items in the warehouse. If you receive a large number of items on one receipt line, you might have to put the items away in several bins, so there's a Place line for each bin.  

5. When you have placed all the items in bins as instructed, choose the **Register Put-away** action.  

## To register a movement that has already happened

If you must register the fact that items has been already moved to other bins without a put-away, pick, or movement, you can use the **Whse. Reclassification Journal** page to register the movement.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Whse. Reclassification Journal**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the **Item No.**, **From Zone Code**, **From Bin Code**, **To Zone Code**, and **To Bin Code** fields.  
3. Choose the **Register** action.

# Validate VAT Registration Numbers

It is important that the VAT registration numbers you have for customers, vendors, and contacts are valid, if you use [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in a country/region that uses VAT. For example, companies sometimes change their tax liability status, and in some countries/regions tax authorities might ask you to provide reports, such as the **EC Sales List** report, that list the VAT registration numbers you use when you do business.

The European Commission provides the VIES VAT Number Validation service on its website, which is public and free. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can save you a step and let you use the VIES service to validate and track VAT numbers and other company information for customers, vendors, and contacts. The service in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is named **EU VAT Reg. No. Validation Service**. The service is available on the **Service Connections** page, and you can start using it right away. The service connection is free, and additional sign up is not required.

## Configure the service to verify VAT registration numbers automatically

To enable the **EU VAT Reg. No. Validation Service**, open the entry in the **Service Connection** page. If the **Service Endpoint** field is not already filled in, use the **Set Default Endpoint** action. Then set the **Enabled** field, and you are good to go.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To enable the validation service, you must have administrator permissions.

Optionally, set up templates for the types of VAT-related data that you want the service to also check. For more information, see the [Validation templates](#validation-templates) section.

When you use our service connection, we record a history of VAT numbers and verifications for each customer, vendor, or contact, in the **VAT Registration Log**, so you can easily track them. The log is specific to each customer. For example, the log is useful for proving that you have verified that the current VAT number is correct. When you verify a VAT number, the **Request Identifier** column in the log will reflect that you have taken action.

You can view the VAT Registration log on the Customer, Vendor, or Contact cards, on the **Invoicing** FastTab, by choosing the lookup button in the **VAT Registration No.** field.  

There are a couple of things to note about the VIES VAT Number Validation service:

* The service uses the http protocol, which means that data transferred through the service is not encrypted.  
* You may experience downtime for this service for which Microsoft is not responsible. The service is part of a broad EU network of national VAT registers.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> It is your responsibility to check that the data is valid. On occasion, data with errors is returned by the VIES VAT Number Validation service. If validation fails, validate the VAT registration numbers on the [web site](https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/vies/), print the result or save it to a shared location, and then add the link to the record for your customer, vendor, or contact. For more information, see [Manage Attachments, Links, and Notes on Cards and Documents](ui-how-add-link-to-record.md).

## Validation templates

You can use the VIES service to also check other company information, such as the address, as well as the VAT registration number. In the **VAT Reg. No. Validation Templates** page, create an entry for each country/region that you want to get further validation for, and then specify the information that you want to get validated automatically.  

For example, add an entry for Spain where you want to get validation for name, street, city, and post code, and then another entry for Germany where you just want validation for post code, for example. Then, in the **EU VAT Registration No. Validation Service Setup** page, specify the default template.  

> [!NOTE]
> Always make sure that the default template works for your needs. You can change the default to match your requirements, such as get validation for all fields or no fields.

The next time that you specify a VAT registration number, the service validates the number and any additional data as determined by your validation templates. If the specified values are different from the values that are returned by the service, you will see the details in the **Validation Details** page where you can accept or reset the values.

# Cross-Dock Items

Cross-dock items are items you receive and ship without putting them away. The put-away and pick processes require limited handling of items. You can cross-dock items for shipments and for production orders.

## Cross-dock bins and zones

If you're using bins, set up at least one cross-dock bin, and then specify the bin in the **Cross-Dock Bin Code** field on your locations. If you're using directed put-away and picks, set up a cross-dock zone.

When you prepare a shipment or pick items for production and you're using bins, the item is automatically picked from a cross-dock bin before any other bin. You must look in the cross-dock area to see whether the items you need are available there before you get the items in their usual storage area.  

If you've calculated cross-dock quantities, put-away lines to the cross-dock bin for cross-dock calculations are created when you post the receipt. Other put-away lines are created as usual.  

## Cross-dock select lines for a receipt

If you want to post the cross-dock items right away to make them available for picking, you must also register a put-away for the other items originating from the receipt line, namely those that need to be stored. If only some items on a receipt line are being cross-docked, you must therefore make an effort to put away the remaining items as quickly as possible. Alternatively, your warehouse policy could be to encourage cross-docking of entire receipt lines whenever possible.

In the put-away instruction, delete the Take and Place instruction lines for each receipt line for the items to put away. You can recreate the instruction lines later as put-away lines from the put-away worksheet or the posted receipt. After you delete the instruction lines you can put away and register the lines for cross-dock items.  

## About the Put-away Worksheet page

If you turn on the **Use Put-away Worksheet** toggle on the **Location Card** page, and post your receipt with calculated cross-docks, all receipt lines become available in the worksheet. The cross-dock information is lost and can't be recreated. Therefore, to use cross-dock functionality, you should relay lines to the put-away worksheet by deleting put-away instructions rather than using the automatic relay function provided in the **Use Put-away Worksheet** field.  

If you post the warehouse receipt and the **Use Put-away Worksheet** toggle is turned off, the cross-dock items become separate lines on the put-away instructions. The **Cross-Dock Information** field on each put-away line shows whether the line contains the following:

* Cross-dock items.
* All of the items from a receipt must be stored.
* Some items from a receipt must be stored, and some are to be cross-docked.

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't keep separate records for cross-docked items. It registers them as ordinary put-away instructions.  

## To set up the warehouse for cross-docking  

1. If you're using bins, set up at least one cross-dock bin. If you're using directed put-away and picks, set up a cross-dock zone.  

    A cross-dock bin has the **Cross-Dock Bin** field selected. To learn more about bins, go to [Create Bins](warehouse-how-to-create-individual-bins.md).  

    If you are using zones, create a zone for your cross-dock bins, and select the **Cross-Dock Bin Zone** field. If you are using directed put-away and picks, select bin type with **Pick** selected, for example you can use *PICK* or *PUTPICK*. To learn more about zones and bin types, go to [Set Up Locations to Use Bins](warehouse-how-to-set-up-locations-to-use-bins.md) and [Set Up Bin Types](warehouse-how-to-set-up-bin-types.md).  

2. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Location**, and then choose the related link.  
3. On the **Location** page, select the location that you want to set up the warehouse for cross-docking, and then choose the **Edit** action.  
4. On the **Warehouse** FastTab, turn on the **Use Cross-Docking** toggle and fill in the **Cross-Dock Due Date Calc.** field with the time to search for cross-dock opportunities.

    The **Use Cross-Docking** option is only available if the **Require Receipt**, **Require Shipment**, **Require Pick**, and **Require Put-away** fields are selected.  

5. If you're using bins, on the **Bins** FastTab, fill in the **Cross-Dock Bin Code** field with the code of the bin you would like to use as the default cross-dock bin.  
6. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Stockkeeping Unit**, and select the related link.  
7. For each item or stockkeeping unit that you want to be able to cross-dock, select the item, and then choose the **Edit** action.
8. On the **Stockkeeping Unit Card** page, select the **Use Cross-Docking** check box.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  Cross-docking is only possible if your location is set up to require warehouse receive and put-away processing.  

## To cross-dock items without viewing the opportunities  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Warehouse Receipts**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Create a warehouse receipt for an item that's arrived and can be cross-docked. To learn more about receiving, go to [Receive Items](warehouse-how-receive-items.md).  
3. Fill in the **Qty. to Receive** field, and then choose the **Calculate Cross-Dock** action.  

    Outbound source documents requesting the items that are scheduled to leave the warehouse within the date formula time period are identified. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates quantities so that you can cross-dock as much as possible and avoid having to put items away, without piling up too many items in the cross-dock area. The value in the **Qty. to Cross-Dock** field is the sum of all the outbound lines for the item within the look-ahead period minus the quantity that is already placed in the cross-dock area, or it is the value in the **Qty. to Receive** field on the receipt line, whichever is smaller. You can't cross-dock more than you have received.  

4. To cross-dock the quantity as suggested, post the receipt. You can also decide to change the quantity to cross-dock to a higher or lower value and then post the receipt.  

    The amounts to be cross-docked now appear as lines in the put-away instruction, assuming the **Use Put-away Worksheet** field is cleared. The quantities not cross-docked also become lines in the put-away instruction.  

    If you have bins, the cross-docked items have been assigned to the default cross-dock bin defined on the location card.  

5. Delete the **Take** and **Place** lines for items that you won't cross-dock.  
6. Print the put-away instruction for the remaining lines, and place the quantities of the receipt that need to be stored in the appropriate bins or in the appropriate area of the warehouse. Place the cross-dock items in the area or bin designated for them by warehouse policy. Sometimes, warehouse policy might require that you to just leave them in the receiving area.  
7. To register the cross-docked items as being put-away and available for picking, choose the **Register** action.  

## To cross-dock items after viewing the opportunities  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Warehouse Receipts**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Create a warehouse receipt for an item that has arrived and can be cross-docked.  

    You want to view the source document lines that are requesting the item before you post the receipt.  
3. Choose the **Calculate Cross-Dock** action.  

   On the **Cross-Dock Opportunities** page you can see the most important details about the lines requesting the item, such as type of document, quantity requested, and due date. This information might help you to decide how much to cross-dock, where to place the items in the cross-dock area, or how to group them.  

4. Choose **Autofill Qty. to Cross-Dock** action to show how the quantities on the receipt lines are calculated. When you change the number of items in the **Qty. to Cross-Dock** field on each line, the calculation updates. The update doesn't mean that the shipment or production order will actually receive the items being suggested for cross-docking. It's for testing purposes only. The process can be informative, however, if more than one unit of measure is involved.  
5. To reserve a quantity of the item for an order line, choose the line, and then choose the **Reserve** action. On the **Reservation** page, reserve available quantity of the item. The reservation is like any other reservation and doesn't have higher priority because it was created in connection with cross-docking. To learn more about reservations, go to [Reserve Items](inventory-how-to-reserve-items.md).   
6. When you're finished recalculating or reserving, choose the **OK** button to bring the calculation to the **Qty. to Cross-Dock** field on the receipt line, or choose the **Cancel** button to return to the warehouse receipt and calculate the cross-dock again.  
7. Post the receipt. You can continue in the put-away instruction as described in steps 3 through 7 in [To cross-dock items without viewing the opportunities](#to-cross-dock-items-without-viewing-the-opportunities).  

    [!INCLUDE [preview-posting-inventory](includes/preview-posting-inventory.md)]

    > [!NOTE]  
    > In the warehouse put-away, you can continue to change the quantities that are being put away in storage or cross-docked, as necessary. For example, you might decide to cross-dock an extra quantity to expedite the cross-dock registration.  

## To view cross-docked items in a shipment or pick worksheet  

If you're using bins, when you open a shipment or the pick worksheet the quantity of each item in the cross-dock bins updates. When the item is available in the cross-dock bin, you can create a pick for the items on the shipment. In the pick worksheet, you can edit the lines as needed.  

When a production order is released, the lines are available in the pick worksheet and the **Qty. on Cross-Dock Bin** field shows whether the items have arrived and are in the cross-dock bins. When you create a pick instruction, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] suggests that you pick the cross-docked items first. Items in storage bins are suggested afterward.  

If you aren't using bins, remember to check the cross-dock area from time to time, or rely on notifications from receipts that items for production have arrived.

# Post service orders and credit memos

After you create a service order, when you're ready you can post it. The order must contain at least one service item line and one service line. If the order has more than one service line, all lines post at the same time.  

If you have a large number of service orders, you can save time by using a batch job to post them. You can run the batch job from any service order.

> [!Tip]
> Before you post a service document, it's a good idea to use the **Test Report** action to to check for errors or missing information. If there are errors, you must correct the problem. You can print a new test report to verify the fix, and then post the document.

## To post a service order

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the service order.  
3. On the **Service Order** page, choose one of the following actions.  

    |**Action**|**Result**|  
    |------------------|----------------|  
    |**Test Report** | Checks all parts of the document and presents the result in a report. If the report indicates any errors or a lack of information, you must correct the problem. You can then print a new test report.|  
    |**Post** | Posts the order without printing a shipment or an invoice.|  
    |**Post and Print** | Posts the order and prints a shipment (if you ship the order without invoicing it) or an invoice (if you invoice the order).|  
    |**Post Batch** | Posts multiple service orders at one time once.|  

4. For the **Post** action, there are several options that control what happens.  

    |**Posting Option**|**Result**|  
    |------------------------|----------------|  
    |**Ship** | Posts shipment of the items.|  
    |**Invoice** | Invoices items that have already been shipped.|  
    |**Ship and Invoice** | Invoices and ships the items.|  
    |**Ship and Consume** | Posts shipment and consumption on the order. It updates the relevant quantities on the service lines of the order and on the previously posted service shipment document.|  

You can post consumption only if the line contains a quantity that shipped but isn't invoiced or consumed.  

When you post the order, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates the corresponding ledger entries and posted documents and updates the service order.  

## To batch post service orders

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **Post Batch** action.  
3. You can set a filter to select specific service order numbers or an interval of order numbers for the batch job to process.  
4. Choose **OK** to start the batch job.  

## To post a service credit memo  

After you create a service credit memo, you can post it when you're ready. If there are errors or a lack of information on the credit memo while posting, an error message displays and stops the process.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Credit Memos**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Create a new service credit memo. Choose the **New** action.  
3. Fill in the necessary fields.  
4. Choose the **Post** action. If you want to print the credit memo at the same time as your post, choose the **Post and Print** action instead.  
5. To test credit memos before you post them, choose **Test Report**. When you run the report, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] verifies the posting dates in the document.  
6. To post several service credit memos at the same time, run the **Batch Post Service Cr. Memos** batch job. Using the batch job is helpful when you have to post a lot of credit memos.  

> [!NOTE]  
> It is important to enter all the necessary information on the credit memos before you batch post them. Otherwise, it is possible that they will not be posted. When the batch job finishes, a message shows how many of the service credit memos it posted.  

## To post consumption from a service order  

The following procedure describes how to post the items, resource hours, and costs used for a specific service operation for which you won't charge your customer. You can post consumed items, hours, or costs only for a posted shipment that has no posted invoices or consumption.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the service order to post consumption for.  
3. Choose the service item. Choose the **Service Lines** action.  
4. Find the required entries, and specify the quantities for which you'll post consumption in the **Qty. to Consume** field. The quantity can't be larger than the quantity already shipped and the quantity remaining but not invoiced after partial invoicing of this shipment.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > To register consumption for a project, fill in the **Project No.**, **Project Task No.**, and the **Project Line Type** fields on the service line.  

5. Choose the lines to post, and then choose the **Post** action. On the page that opens, select **Ship and Consume**.  

The service is posted as either partially or fully consumed, depending on the value in the **Qty. to Consume** field, and the relevant ledger entries are created. Also, previously posted service shipment documents are updated chronologically with the consumed quantities. The relevant quantities are updated on the service lines of the order.  

## To post shipments from service orders  

After you specify the details of a service, you can adjust and post the quantities of items used, time spent, and costs incurred. As a result, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] makes the necessary changes to reflect the new state of your inventory and current status of the specific order processing.  

The following procedure shows how to post shipment of service line items in locations that aren't set up to require warehouse handling.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Order**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the service order, and then choose the **Service Lines** action.  
3. On the **Service Lines** page, find the required entries and then specify the quantity to post in the **Qty. to Ship** field.  

   > [!NOTE]  
   > The quantity to ship value depends on whether you want to fully or partially post the shipment. If you choose to ship fully, the value in the **Qty. to Ship** field must be equal to the value in the **Quantity** field. When you post a partial shipment, you must specify the quantity you want to ship initially. If you already shipped part of the service on the order, make a note of the value in the **Quantity Shipped** field. The maximum quantity you can enter in the **Quantity to Ship** field is the number of units that haven't shipped.  

4. Choose the **Post** action, and then choose **Ship**.

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates ledger entries (in the warranty ledger, item ledger, service ledger, or G/L), produces the posted service shipment document, and updates the relevant fields on the service lines of the service order.  

If the location is set up to require warehouse handling, shipping and moving service line items works in the same way as they do for other source documents. The only difference is that service line items can be consumed either externally or internally, and therefore require two different release functions. To learn more about shipping service line items in advanced warehouse configurations, go to [Picking Items for Warehouse Shipments](warehouse-how-to-pick-items-for-warehouse-shipment.md).  

## Combine shipments from multiple service orders into a single service invoice

If needed, you can gather posted shipments that you haven't invoiced in a single invoice. For example, combining shipments can reduce the overall number of invoices to process, which can lower administrative costs and save time for your bookkeeping team. To learn more, go to [Combine shipments on a single invoice](sales-how-to-combine-shipments-on-a-single-invoice.md).

## To undo posted consumption  

You can cancel the consumption on the service orders. For example, because it was posted by mistake.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Posted Service Shipments**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the posted service shipment for which the erroneous consumption was posted.  
3. Choose the **Service Shipment Lines** action.  
4. Choose the lines that contain the incorrect consumption, and then choose the **Undo Consumption** action.  

 A balancing service shipment line is inserted with negative values in the quantity fields for the selected lines.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
> You can't undo service consumption if:  

> * The service order has been closed.  
> * It was posted to a project, so there are project ledger entries linked to it.  

## To post service lines  

If you have to work on a service order for a considerable time without posting it, you might want to post some of the service lines linked to it as a way, for example, of keeping your inventory updated. You can post by specifying the relevant quantities on the lines to be posted. You might choose to post the lines one by one or by selecting several lines at a time.  

The following procedure describes shipment posting directly from a service order in locations without warehouse handling set up. If the location is set up to require warehouse handling, then shipment posting happens in a different warehouse document, depending on the location setup.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the service order, and then choose the **Service Lines** action.  
3. On the lines you're going to post, fill in the **Qty. to Ship**, **Qty. to Invoice**, and **Qty. to Consume** fields, depending on how you post the lines.  
4. Choose the **Post** action.

# View the Status of Synchronization Jobs


Use the **Coupled Data Synchronization Errors** page to view the status of synchronization jobs that have been run for coupled records in a Dataverse or [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] integrations. This includes jobs that were run from the job queue and manual synchronization jobs that ran on records from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For example, viewing their status is helpful when troubleshooting because it gives you access to details about errors related to coupled records. Typically, these types of errors are caused by user actions, for example, when:  

* Two people made a change to the same data in both business apps.
* Someone deleted data in one of the apps, but not both.

> [!Note]
> The **Coupled Data Synchronization Errors** page shows information about jobs related to coupled records. If you resolve all of the errors but records are still not synchronizing, it might have something to do with a setting for the integration. Typically, your administrator will need to resolve those types of errors.   

## Example
This video shows an example of how to troubleshoot errors that happened while synchronizing with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)]. The process will be the same for all integrations. 

> [!VIDEO https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2097304]


## To view and resolve synchronization errors for coupled records
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Coupled Data Synchronization Errors**, and then choose the related link.
2. The **Coupled Data Synchronization Errors** page shows issues that occurred when you synchronized coupled records. The following table includes actions that you can use to resolve issues one by one:

|Action|Description|
|----|----|
|**Remove Coupling**|Uncouples the records and they will no longer synchronize. To restart the synchronization you must couple them again. |
|**Retry** and **Retry All**|For each record where an error is found, synchronization is skipped unless you fix the issue. Retry will include the selected record in the next synchronization, and **Retry All** includes all of the records.|
|**Synchronize**|The app will try to resolve a conflict where data was changed in both business apps. You can choose the data to use.|
|**Restore Records** and **Delete Records**|These are useful when a record was deleted in one of the business apps. Delete Records deletes the record or row in the app where it still exists. Restore Records recreates the record or row in the business app where it was deleted.|

> [!NOTE]
> To reduce the number of conflicts you need to resolve, you can set up your integration table mappings to apply these actions automatically. For more information, [Mapping Integration Tables](admin-how-to-modify-table-mappings-for-synchronization.md#mapping-integration-tables).

## To view the synchronization log for a specific (manually synchronized) record
1. Open, for example, a customer, item or any other record that is synchronizing data between [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and Dataverse or [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)].
2. Choose the **Synchronization Log** action to view the synchronization log for a selected record. For example, a specific customer you synchronized manually.

## Remove Couplings Between Records
When something goes wrong in your integration and you need to uncouple records to stop synchronizing them, you can do so for one or more records at a time. You can uncouple one or more records from list pages or the **Coupled Data Synchronization Errors** page by choosing one or more lines and choosing **Delete Coupling**. You can also remove all couplings for one or more table mappings on the **Integration Table Mappings** page. 

If an entity with a unidirectional coupling is deleted in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you must manually delete the broken coupling. To do that, on the **Coupled Data Synchronization Errors** page, choose the **Find for Deleted** action, and then delete the couplings.

# Add extended text

Use extended texts to communicate additional information for items, stock-keeping units, general ledger accounts, project planning lines, and resources. For example, the extra details might be about special prices, terms, or handling instructions. Provide the information by adding extra lines as extended text. You can also set up conditions for use of the extra lines.  

The following section describes how to add extended text to a description of an item. The same steps apply to stock-keeping units, general ledger accounts, project planning lines, and resources.  

## To define extended text for a description

1. Open the card for an item that you want to add extended text to, and then choose the **Extended Text** action.
2. Fill in the **Code** and **Description** fields.
3. Choose the **New**.
4. Fill in the **Language Code** field, or turn on the **All Language Codes** toggle if you use language codes.
5. Fill in the **Starting Date** and **Ending Date** fields if you want to limit the dates on which the extended text is used.
6. On the **Lines** FastTab, in the **Text** field, enter the extended text.
7. On the **Sales**, **Purchases**, and **Service** FastTabs, turn on the toggles for the documents you want to include the extended text.
8. Close the page.

You can now add this extended text to documents. The following procedure explains how to add extended text to a sales order, but the same steps apply to any other document that you specified for the extended text.  

## To add an extended item text on a sales order line

1. Open a sales order that has a sales line for an item with extended text. To learn more, go to [Sell Products](sales-how-sell-products.md).
2. Select the line, and then choose the **Insert Ext. Text** action.

# Block customers
You can block a customer, for example because of insolvency, so that the customer can't be added to sales documents or so that no transactions can be posted for the customer.

In addition to blocking a customer, you can set receivable transactions for the customer to be on hold in connection with reminders. For more information, see [Collect Outstanding Balances](receivables-collect-outstanding-balances.md).   

The following table describes the options for blocking customers.  

|Option|Description|  
|--------------------|------------|  
|**Blank**|Transactions are allowed for this customer.|
|**Ship**|New orders and new shipments can't be created for this customer. Existing shipments not yet invoiced can be invoiced.|  
|**Invoice**|New orders, new shipments, and new invoices can't be created for this customer. Existing shipments not yet invoiced can't be invoiced. You can still send reminders and finance charge memos to the customer.|  
|**All**|No transaction is allowed for this customer, including payments.|  

## To block a customer  
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customers**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select a customer, and then choose the **Edit** action.
3. In the **Blocked** field, choose what to block, as described in the table above.

# Troubleshoot Microsoft Teams Integration with [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]

[!INCLUDE[azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id](~/../shared-content/shared/azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id.md)]

[!INCLUDE [online_only](includes/online_only.md)]

This article provides information on how to identify and fix problems you might experience when using Microsoft Teams with [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], as a typical user or administrator.

## The sign-in link doesn't work

If you try to sign in to the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams immediately after installing the app, and the sign-in link doesn't react, the app might not be fully installed. To try to fix the issue, sign out of your Teams client and then sign in again.

## The Settings page is empty

You must first sign in to reach your settings. To sign into the app, either paste a link to a [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] record, or try to search for contacts. Both of these actions will lead you through a sign-up experience, after which you can use the **Settings** page.

## I changed company but it didn't seem to work

After you change the company on the **Settings** page, you might notice that the command box drop-down indicates you're still searching the previous company. This issue happens when you open the **Settings** page directly from the command box. In this case, the company was successfully changed, and you'll in fact search the company you switched to. The problem is that the command box drop-down hasn't updated yet. Close or unpin [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] from the command box, and then open the app again to ensure that the drop-down accurately reflects the company you're searching for. 

## "Something went wrong" error when searching for contacts

You might experience this error when you search in a company that isn't initialized or is in an unresponsive state. For example, you can't search in a new trial company that hasn't yet accepted the terms of use. To resolve this issue, try to sign in to the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] Web client, and act on or dismiss any initial dialogs that appear.

## "Cannot find the contact/contact summary API" error when searching for contacts

This problem can be caused by customizations or industry solutions that affect or modify [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)], or they don't provide a contact or contact summary API. If the problem continues, contact your administrator or supporting partner.

## None of my links expand into a card 

If you're experiencing this problem, here are a few things to try:

1. First, make sure that the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams is installed.

    To check, sign in to the Teams desktop app or Teams in the browser. Then, on the left side, select **Apps**, and search for **[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]**. When you find the **[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]** app, select it to open the app details page. If the **Add** button is shown, then the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app isn't installed. Learn more in [Install the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] App for Microsoft Teams](across-install-app-for-teams.md).

    > [!NOTE]
    > Guest users can't immediately install apps. Learn more in [FAQ about collaborating with guests](teams-faq.md?tabs=collaborating#language). 

2. Next, check that you've signed in with the correct identity.

    In Teams, go to any chat, and under the message compose box, right-click the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] icon, then choose **Settings**. The window that appears states the user account that you’re signed in as. Verify that it’s the correct user account.

3. Make sure codeunit 2718 **Page Summary Provider** is published as a web service.

    Teams connects to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] using an endpoint to this codeunit on the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] service. Learn more in [Publish a Web Service](across-how-publish-web-service.md).

4. Your organization can also restrict you from pasting links that expand into cards. Contact your administrator to understand the Teams organizational policies that apply to you.

## My link sometimes doesn’t expand into a card 

A link won't expand into a card in the following situations:

- The link targets a page that (at a technical level) isn't connected to a source table in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. You can check whether a page has a source table by using the page inspection pane in the Web client in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Learn more about page inspection Learn more in [Inspecting Pages](across-inspect-page.md).
- Teams doesn't support link previews in some of its features. For example, when you pop out a chat, or you're a guest to another organization.
- Network issues cause Teams to silently abandon trying to display the card after 15 seconds, for example.
- Teams might not expand the link if you've already pasted a link into the same message compose box and deleted the card.
- When using Teams in some browsers such as Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox, the link isn't automatically detected as soon as you paste it into the compose box. You might need to add a space after the link or press <kbd>Enter</kbd> for Teams to recognize the link and expand it into a card.

The link must also contain all the necessary information to locate the record and display the corresponding card. This information includes:

- The environment name, by including it in the URL path. If you don't specify the environment name, Teams assumes you're attempting to reach the environment named "Production".
- The company name, by using the *company=* parameter
- The page identifier, by using the *page=* parameter
- The bookmark to the record, by using the *bookmark=* parameter

For example:

`https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?environmentname=Production&company=CRONUS%20USA%2C%20Inc.&page=21&dc=0&bookmark=21%3bEgAAAAJ7BTEAMAAwADAAMA%3d%3d`

Learn more about [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] URLs in [Web Client URL](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-web-client-urls) in the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Developer and IT Pro Help.

## The details window opens, but shows an error before details are shown

This problem can be caused by a couple of things: lack of permissions in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] or browser settings (when using Teams in the browser).

1. Verify your permissions in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

    To view details for a card, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] checks your license and permissions to view that specific record and page in the specific company and environment. If you aren't authorized for any of these things, standard [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] error messages about permissions appear in the details window. 

    Learn more in [Assign Permissions to Users and Groups](ui-define-granular-permissions.md).

2. Check your browser settings if using Teams in the browser.

    - Your browser's pop-up blocker must be either turned off or set to allow pop-ups from the *businesscentral.dynamics.com* or *bc.dynamics.com* domains. Learn more in about allowing pop-ups for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in [Setting Up Your Browser](across-browser-settings.md#popup).
    - Your browser must have access to local browser storage for cookies and preferences as you work.
    - Avoid using guest or private browsing unless necessary, because they discard or block certain content in some browsers.

   Learn more about minimum browser requirements in [Minimum Requirements for Using [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]](product-requirements.md#browsers).

## I'm having problems with the camera or location in Teams

When using [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] features in the details window that require access to your location or device camera, you must first give your consent for Teams to access these device capabilities.  

- For Teams in the browser, make sure that your browser settings allow access to camera and location for [https://teams.microsoft.com](https://teams.microsoft.com).

- For Teams for iOS or Android, make sure that your device settings allow access to camera and location for the Teams mobile app. 

Learn more about changing these settings at [My camera isn't working in Teams](https://support.microsoft.com/office/my-camera-isn-t-working-in-teams-9581983b-c6f9-40e3-b0d8-122857972ade?ns=msftteams&version=16&ui=en-us&rs=en-us&ad=us) on Microsoft Support.

The [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app doesn't support location in the Teams desktop app. Learn more in [Teams FAQ](teams-faq.md#location).

Some browsers, such as the new Microsoft Edge, allow you to choose which device camera to use when your device supports multiple cameras. 

## Teams displays mixed languages for my cards and card details

For cards and card details to display consistently in the same language in Teams, the language of your Teams client and the language you use in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Web client must match.

- Learn more about changing the language in Teams in [Change settings in Teams](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/change-settings-in-teams-b506e8f1-1a96-4cf1-8c6b-b6ed4f424bc7) on Microsoft Support. 

- Learn more about changing the language in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] [Change Basic Settings - Language](ui-change-basic-settings.md#language).

Learn more about how languages work between Teams and [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in [Teams FAQ](teams-faq.md#language).

## I edited a field in the details window, but my change wasn't saved

Changes you make to a field in the details windows are automatically saved when you leave the field. Before you close the window after changing a field, be sure to select the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key or click/tap outside the field.

## A new tile appeared in the App Launcher. How do I remove it?

When you view your apps on the Office 365 home page (https://home.office.com) or in the app launcher, a new tile named "Business Central Teams Integration Service Connector" will appear after installing the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams. This tile provides no value in itself and can be safely hidden.

As an administrator, who has Microsoft Entra admin permissions, you can hide the tile by doing the following steps:

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com/).
2. Select **Enterprise apps**, then select **Business Central Teams Integration Service Connector**.
3. Select **Properties**, then set the **Visible To Users** switch to **No**.
4. Select **Save**.

> [!NOTE]
> It will be a while before this change takes effect.

## Duplicate text in the Share to Teams window

When you paste text into the message box in the **Share to Teams** window, the text is duplicated. This problem is known to Microsoft and will be addressed in a later update. 

## Unable to sign in to the Share to Teams window 

This problem can be caused by a various reasons. For example, the identity you are using to sign in must have access to Microsoft Teams, such as through a Microsoft 365 subscription.

## Can't pin a card to tab

Pinning is no longer available in Microsoft Teams.

## Someone added a tab, but the tab doesn’t show up for me

This problem is because you don’t have the BC app for Teams installed. Only those with the app installed will see Business Central tabs.

## Others see a different sorting or column layout than what the tab author sees

This problem is likely because you shared a list view that is a personal view. In this case, work with your administrator to create either role-specific list views that covers the different roles in the channel/chat, or create this view for the whole organization so that everyone can get a consistent view.

# Set Up Warehouse Employees

You must set up each user who performs warehouse activities as a warehouse employee and assign them to a default location. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] filters warehouse activities to the employee's default location. They can only perform the warehouse activities at the location. You can also assign a user to other locations. They can access but not perform activities at those locations.

## To set up warehouse employees  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Warehouse Employees**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. Select the **User ID** field, and then select the user to be added as a warehouse employee. Choose the **OK** button.  
4. In the **Location Code** field, enter the code of the location where the user will be working.  
5. Turn on the **Default** toggle to specify that this is the only location where the employee can perform warehouse activities.  
6. Repeat these steps to assign other employees to locations or assign other locations to existing warehouse employees.  

> [!TIP]
> You can also use the **Add me as warehouse employee** action to quickly add yourself to the list of warehouse employees. For example, this is useful when you're testing the capabilities.

# Pick items with inventory picks

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you pick and ship items using one of four methods, as described in the following table.

|Method|Outbound Process|Require Pick|Require Shipment|Complexity Level (Learn more at [Warehouse Management Overview](design-details-warehouse-management.md))|  
|------|----------------|-----|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
|A|Post the pick and shipment from the order line|||No dedicated warehouse activity.|  
|B|Post the pick and shipment from an inventory pick document|Turned on||Basic: Order-by-order.|  
|C|Post the pick and shipment from a warehouse shipment document||Turned on|Basic: Consolidated receive/ship posting for multiple orders.|  
|D|Post the pick from a warehouse pick document, and post the shipment from a warehouse shipment document|Turned on|Turned on|Advanced|  

Learn more at [Outbound Warehouse Flow](design-details-outbound-warehouse-flow.md).

This article refers to method B in the table.

When your location is set up to require pick processing but not shipment processing, use the **Inventory Pick** page to record and post picking and shipping information for your source documents. Outbound source documents can be sales orders, purchase return orders, and outbound transfer orders.

> [!NOTE]
> Production and assembly order component needs also represent outbound source documents. To learn more about handling production and assembly orders for internal processes, go to [Design Details: Internal Warehouse Flows](design-details-internal-warehouse-flows.md).
>
> Although service orders are also outbound source documents, they don't support the basic, order-by-order level of complexity.
>
> When picking and shipping sales line quantities that are assembled to the order, there are rules you must follow when you create inventory pick lines. Learn more at [Handling Assemble-to-Order Items with Inventory Picks](#handling-assemble-to-order-items-with-inventory-picks).  

You can create an inventory pick in three ways:

* Create the inventory pick directly from the source document.  
* Create inventory picks for multiple source documents at the same time by using a batch job.
* Request the pick in two steps by first releasing the source document, which acts as a signal to the warehouse that the source document is ready picking.

The inventory pick can then be created from the **Inventory Pick** page based on the source document.  

## To create an inventory pick from the source document

1. In the source document, which can be a sales order, purchase return order, or outbound transfer order, choose the **Create Inventory Put-away/Pick** action.
2. Select the **Create Invt. Pick** checkbox.  
3. Choose the **OK** button.

## To create multiple inventory picks with a batch job

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Create Inventory Put-away/Pick/Movement**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Warehouse Request** FastTab, use the **Source Document** and **Source No.** fields to filter on certain types of documents or ranges of document numbers. For example, you can create picks only for sales orders.  
3. On the **Options** FastTab, select the **Create Invt. Pick** checkbox.
4. Choose the **OK** button.

## To create the pick in two steps

### To request an inventory pick by releasing the source document

For sales orders, purchase return orders, and outbound transfer orders, you create the warehouse request by releasing the order. Releasing the order makes the items available for picking.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Orders**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the sales order that you want to release, and then choose the **Release** action.

### To create an inventory pick based on the source document

After you release an order, the warehouse employee can create an inventory pick.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Inventory Picks**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. In the **Source Document** field, select the type of document you're picking for.  
4. In the **Source No.** field, select the source document.  
5. Alternatively, choose the **Get Source Document** action to create a list of all outbound source documents that are ready for picking at the location.  
6. Choose the **OK** button to fill the pick lines according to the selected source documents.  

## To record inventory picks

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Inventory Pick**, and then choose the related link.  
2. In the **Bin Code** field on the pick lines, the bin that the items must be picked from is suggesting per the item's default bin. You can change the bin in this page if necessary.  
3. Perform the pick, and then enter the quantity that in the **Qty. to Handle** field.

    If you must pick the items for a line from more than one bin, for example because the full quantity isn't in the bin, use the **Split Line** action on the **Lines** FastTab. The action creates a line for the remaining quantity to handle.

4. Choose the **Post** action.  

    * Post the shipment of the source document lines that were picked.
    * If the location uses bins, posting also creates warehouse entries for the changes to the bin quantity.  

    [!INCLUDE [preview-posting-warehouse](includes/preview-posting-warehouse.md)]

## Handling assemble-to-order items with inventory picks

You can also use the **Inventory Pick** page to pick and ship for sales where items must be assembled before they can be shipped. Learn more at [Sell Items Assembled to Order](assembly-how-to-sell-items-assembled-to-order.md).

Assemble-to-order items aren't physically in a bin until they're assembled and posted as output to a bin. Picking assemble-to-order items from a bin for shipments follows a special flow.

1. Warehouse workers take the assembly items from bins to the shipping dock, and then post the inventory picks.
2. Inventory picks post the assembly output, the component consumption, and the sales shipment.

You can set up [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to automatically create an inventory movement when the inventory pick for the assembly item is created. Select the **Create Movements Automatically** field on the **Assembly Setup** page. Learn more at [Set Up Basic Warehouses with Operations Areas](warehouse-how-to-set-up-basic-warehouses-with-operations-areas.md).

Inventory pick lines for sales items are created in different ways, depending on whether you assemble to order none, some, or all of the sales line quantities. In scenarios where some of the quantity is assembled and some is picked from inventory, a minimum of two pick lines are created.

For sales where the full quantity on the sales order line is assembled to order, one inventory pick line is created for the quantity. The value in the **Quantity to Assemble** field is the same as the value in the **Qty. to Ship** field. The **Assemble to Order** field is selected on the line.

If you set up an assembly output flow for the location, the **Bin Code** field on the inventory pick line contains the value from the following fields, in the following order.

* ***Asm.-to-Order Shpt. Bin Code** <!-- not applicable for inv pick-->
* **From-Assembly Bin Code**

If a bin code isn't specified on the sales order line, and no assembly output flow is set up for the location, the **Bin Code** field on the inventory pick line is empty. The warehouse worker must open the **Bin Contents** page and select the bin where the assembly items are assembled.

In scenarios where a part of the quantity is assembled and another must be picked, a minimum of two pick lines are created.

* One pick line for the assemble-to-order quantity. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses the following fields, in this order, to determine the bin code: **Bin Code**, **Asm.-to-Order Shpt. Bin Code**, and then **From-Assembly Bin Code**. If these fields are blank, the warehouse employee must open the **Bin Contents** page and choose the bin where the items are assembled.  
* The other pick line depends on which bins can fulfill the remaining quantity. If the item is kept in multiple bins, multiple lines are created. The line for the take is based on the quantity in the **Qty. to Ship** field.

> [!NOTE]  
> If items are assembled to order, the inventory pick for the linked sales order creates an inventory movement for all of the assembly components.

# Manage AppSource apps
 
From inside [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can discover, view, sort, and filter available AppSource apps that integrate with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

On the **Microsoft AppSource Apps** page, you can filter available AppSource apps by name, publisher name, install state, popularity, average rating, number of ratings, and last modified date. You can also select a given app and see the details for that specific app.

To locate the page, in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Microsoft AppSource Apps**, and then choose the related link.

On the page, you find the following actions:

- **View AppSource** to open the online AppSource marketplace in a new browser window. 
- **View in AppSource** to open and view a selected app in the online AppSource Marketplace. 
- **Refresh list from Microsoft AppSource** to force a refresh of the list of all apps to AppSource marketplace content—for example, if you're looking for a newly submitted AppSource app.

As with other list pages, you get support for Analysis Mode, for example, so that you can group apps by publisher. Use Copilot to design an **Analysis Mode** view for you.

## Install and update AppSource apps

Install AppSource apps using the **Extension Management** page in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Learn more in [Customizing Business Central online using apps](ui-extensions.md).

# Automate reminders in collections

Make your collections more effective by automating the process of creating, issuing, and sending reminders to your customers. Automation can significantly reduce the time you spend on collections, provide a better overview of the process, and give you full control over each step.

On the **Reminder Automation** page, you define the individual actions (steps). You can combine the steps to create, issue, and send reminders, or you can create a separate automation for each step if that's better for your collection processes. Automations are based on reminder terms and reminder levels. To learn more, go to [Set Up Reminder Terms and Levels](finance-setup-reminders.md). You can set filters for reminder terms for an automation as a whole, and set filters for each action in the automation. You can also attach outstanding invoices to emails as PDF files.

Automation happens through a job queue entry. When you set up an automation, use the **Cadence** field to specify how and when it runs. If you choose **Manual**, the automation runs one time when you use the **Start** action. You can also choose **Weekly**, **Monthly**, or choose **Custom** to set up a more detailed cadence. If you choose **Custom**, you must enter a date formula. To learn more about entering a date formula, go to [Use Date Formulas](ui-enter-date-ranges.md#use-date-formulas). When you choose an option other than **Manual**, the automation runs until you pause it to put it on hold. If you want to be even more specific about when it runs, use the **Job queue entries** action to open the **Job Queue Entries** page and adjust the recurrence, for example to daily or a specific weekday.

## Automate the reminders flow

The following sections describe how to set up reminders to create, issue, and send automatically.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Reminders Automation**, and then choose the related link.
1. Choose **New**, and then fill in the fields on the **General** FastTab.
1. In the **Reminder Terms Filter** field, choose the reminder term or terms to use this automation for.
1. In the **Cadence** field, choose how often the automation runs.
1. On the **Actions** FastTab, choose **New**, and then choose whether the automation creates, issues, or sends reminders. Choose **OK**.
1. Depending on the type of action the automation performs, fill in the fields as necessary on the setup page. To learn more about the settings, go to [Settings for reminder actions](#settings-for-reminder-actions).
1. After you set up the actions for the automation, you can use the **Move up** and **Move down** actions to adjust the order in which they run.

## Settings for reminder actions

The setup settings differ for the Create, Issue, and Send reminder actions. The following sections describe how to use them.

### Create

* Set the highest level on all reminder lines.  
* Create reminders for entries that are on hold. For example, this setting is useful if you're in an ongoing dispute with a customer and want them to see the big picture.
* Create reminders for all unpaid invoices, and not just invoices that are overdue. The report displays overdue invoices and invoices that are unpaid but not overdue in separate sections.
* Set filters to make the reminder more specific.

### Issue

When you issue a reminder, you create entries in the customer ledger that contain the posting date and tax date. Use the settings on the **Issue Reminders Setup** page to specify whether to replace that information on the issued reminder with the information from the created reminder. For example, if you created the reminder yesterday, and issue it today, the due date moves one day.

### Send

> [!NOTE]
> The Send automation requires that you've set up email in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. To learn more about setting up email, go to [Set up email](admin-how-setup-email.md).

The content of the emails, such as attachment texts, email body texts, and language come from the setup for the reminder term. To learn more about email settings, go to [Set Up Reminder Terms and Levels](finance-setup-reminders.md).

Use the settings on the **Send Reminders Setup** page control the following:

* General settings, such as the description, and how many times you send the same reminder.
* Settings for what to include in the reminder.
* Settings for tracking the reminders you send by creating interactions, whether you print or send the reminder by email, and whether you want to attach overdue invoices only, all invoices, or no invoices. 

## Access the history of a reminder

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] keeps track of each time an automation runs. You can access the history by choosing the **Log entries** action. You can also use the **Issued Reminders** action to access a list of the reminders you've issued.

## Handle errors

On the **Actions** FastTab, for each action you can specify whether you want the automation to stop if the action has an error. If you do, the automation won't process the actions that come afterward. To turn this feature on or off, use the **Set stop on error** or **Clear stop on error** actions.

## Change action settings for an automation

You can change settings for an automation at any time. On the **Actions** FastTab, choose **Setup**, and then make your changes.

# Dimension Set Entries Overview
This topic describes how dimension set entries are stored and posted in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

## Dimension Sets  
A dimension set is a unique combination of dimension values. It is stored as dimension set entries in the database. Each dimension set entry represents a single dimension value. The dimension set is identified by a common dimension set ID that is assigned to each dimension set entry that belongs to the dimension set.  

The following example shows a dimension set that has three dimension set entries. The dimension set is identified by a dimension set ID, which is 108.  

|Dimension Set ID|Dimension Code|Dimension Value Code|Dimension Value Name|  
|----------------------|--------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|  
|108|AREA|70|America North|  
|108|BUSINESSGROUP|HOME|Home|  
|108|DEPARTMENT|SALES|Sales|  

## Dimension Set Entries  
Dimension sets are stored in the **Dimension Set Entry** table as dimension set entries with the same dimension set ID.  

![Flow of dimension set entries.](media/dimensionentrynav7.png "Flow of dimension set entries")  

When you create a new journal line, document header, or document line, you can specify a combination of dimension values. Instead of explicitly storing each dimension value in the database, a dimension set ID is assigned to the journal line, document header, or document line to specify the dimension set.  

When you edit and close the **Edit Dimension Set Entries** page, a check is performed to see whether the combination of dimension values exists as a dimension set in the table. If the combination occurs in the table, then the corresponding dimension set ID is assigned to the journal line, document header, or document line. Otherwise, a new dimension set is added to the table, and the new dimension set ID is assigned to the journal line, document header, or document line.

## Codeunit 408 Dimension Management
Codeunit 408, Dimension Management, is a function library that handles common tasks that are related to dimensions, such as copying from one table to another or from one document to another.

## Performance Improvement  
By storing dimension sets once in the database, database space is preserved and overall performance is improved.

# Set Up Shipping Agents
You can set up a code for each of your shipping agents and enter information about them.  

If you enter an Internet address for the shipping agent, and the agent provides package tracking services on the Internet, you can use the automatic package tracking feature. For more information, see [Track Packages](sales-how-track-packages.md).

When you set up shipping agents on your sales orders, you can also specify the services that each shipping agent offers.  
For each shipping agent, you can set up an unlimited number of services, and you can specify a shipping time for each service.  

When you have assigned a shipping agent service to a sales order line, the shipping time of the service will be included in the order promising calculation, for that line. For more information, see [Calculate Order Promising Dates](sales-how-to-calculate-order-promising-dates.md).

## To set up a shipping agent  
1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Shipping Agents**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)].  
3.  Choose the **Shipping Agent Services** action.
4. In the **Shipping Agent Services**, fill in the fields as necessary.

> [!NOTE]  
>  If you delete the shipping agent on the order line, the shipping agent service code is also deleted. The contents of fields that were based in part on the shipping agent service are recalculated.

# Correct or cancel unpaid sales invoices

You can correct or cancel an unpaid posted sales invoice, provided that it hasn't been fully shipped. This is useful if you make a mistake or if the customer requests a change before the shipment is complete. In all other scenarios, we recommend that you create a corrective sales credit memo directly. For more information, see [To create a sales credit memo from a posted sales invoice](sales-how-process-sales-returns-cancellations.md#to-create-a-sales-credit-memo-from-a-posted-sales-invoice).  

> [!NOTE]  
> After a posted sales invoice has been partially or fully paid, you cannot correct or cancel it from the posted sales invoice itself. Instead, you must manually create a sales credit memo to void the sale and reimburse the customer, optionally managed with a sales return order. For more information, see [Process Sales Returns or Cancellations](sales-how-process-sales-returns-cancellations.md).

The difference between canceling or correcting a posted sales invoice that isn't paid or shipped is described in the following table.

| Action | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Cancel** |The posted sales invoice is canceled. A corrective sales credit memo is automatically created and posted to void the initial posted sales invoice. On the initial posted sales invoice, the **Canceled** and **Paid** checkboxes are selected. |
| **Correct** |The posted sales invoice is canceled. A new sales invoice with the same information is created, unless the posted sales order was posted from a sales order. In that case, we suggest you cancel the posted sales invoice instead and then make the correction and continue the sales process from the original sales order. <br/><br/>The new sales invoice has a different number than the initial sales invoice. A corrective sales credit memo is automatically created and posted to void the initial posted sales invoice. On the initial posted sales invoice, the **Canceled** and **Paid** checkboxes are selected. |
|**Create Corrective Credit Memo**|A new sales credit memo is created with the same information. You can adjust the new sales credit memo before posting, and it will be applied to the original invoice when you post it. |

When you correct or cancel a posted sales invoice, the corrective sales credit memo is applied to all general ledger and inventory ledger entries that were created when the initial sales invoice was posted. This reverses the posted sales invoice in your financial records and leaves the corrective posted sales credit memo for your audit trail.  

> [!TIP]
> If you have posted a prepayment invoice for a sales invoice that you then correct or cancel, you must correct or cancel the prepayment as well. For more information, see [Correct Prepayments](finance-how-to-correct-prepayments.md).

## To cancel a posted sales invoice

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Posted Sales Invoices**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the posted sales invoice that you want to cancel.

    > [!NOTE]  
    > If the **Canceled** checkbox is selected, then you cannot cancel the posted sales invoice because it has already been canceled or corrected.
3. On the **Posted Sales Invoice** page, choose the **Cancel** action.

    A sales credit memo is automatically created and posted to void the initial posted sales invoice. The **Canceled** field on the initial posted sales invoice is changed to **Yes**.
4. Choose **Show Corrective Credit Memo** to view the posted sales credit memo that voids the initial posted sales invoice.

### Partial invoice posting also supported

If the cancellation is related to a partial invoice posting, then the originating sales order line is updated to reflect the canceled invoiced quantity. The **Qty. to Invoice** and **Qty. Invoiced** fields on the related sales order line are reset to the values before the partial posting.

## To correct a posted sales invoice

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Posted Sales Invoices**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the posted sales invoice that you want to correct.

    > [!NOTE]  
    >   If the **Canceled** checkbox is selected, you can't correct the posted sales invoice because it has already been corrected or canceled.
3. On the **Posted Sales Invoice** page, choose the **Correct** action.  

    > [!NOTE]
    > If the sales invoice was posted from a sales order, we recommend that you *cancel* this sales invoice and then process the correction from the original sales order. If the original sales order has been deleted, such as if it has been fully shipped, you can create a new sales order by using the **Copy Document** action. For more information, see [To create a sales credit memo by copying a posted sales invoice](sales-how-process-sales-returns-cancellations.md#to-create-a-sales-credit-memo-by-copying-a-posted-sales-invoice).
4. A new sales invoice with the same information is created where you can make the correction. The **Canceled** field on the initial posted sales invoice is changed to **Yes**.

    A sales credit memo is automatically created and posted to void the initial posted sales invoice.
5. Choose the **Show Corrective Credit Memo** action to view the posted sales credit memo that voids the initial posted sales invoice.

# Put away production or assembly output

How you put away your output from production depends on how your warehouse is set up as a location. Learn more at [Setting Up Warehouse Management](warehouse-setup-warehouse.md).  

In a basic warehouse configuration for the inbound flow (put-away), on the **Location Card** page for the location, activate following settings:

* For production, in the **Prod. Output Whse. Handling** field, select **Inventory Put-away**.
* Assembly processes don't support inventory put-aways. You post an assembly order to register output. If you use bins, you can move items between the bins later. Learn more at [Move Items Ad Hoc in Basic Warehouse Configurations](warehouse-how-to-move-items-ad-hoc-in-basic-warehousing.md).  
* For projects, put-away isn't applicable.

In advanced warehouse configurations where a location requires put-away, create an internal put-away, a movement, or a warehouse put-away to put away the output.  

## Put away production output with an inventory put-away

The first step to put away output is to create the inbound warehouse request. This request informs the warehouse that the production or assembly order output is ready to be put away.

### To create the inbound warehouse request  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Released Production Order**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the production order that's ready for put-away, and then choose the **Create Inbound Whse. Request** action.  

> [!NOTE]  
> You can also create the inbound warehouse request by choosing the **Create Inbound Request** field when you refresh the production order. Learn more at [Refresh or Replan Production Orders](production-how-to-replan-refresh-production-orders.md).  

### To put away output with an inventory put-away  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Inventory Put-away**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Create a new inventory put-away. Learn more at [Put Items Away with Inventory Put-aways](warehouse-how-to-put-items-away-with-inventory-put-aways.md).
3. To access the production order output, choose the **Get Source Documents** action, and then select the released production order.  
4. Fill in the put-away lines as needed.
5. When the lines are ready for posting, choose the **Post** action. Posting creates the warehouse entries and posts the output of the items.  

    [!INCLUDE [preview-posting-warehouse](includes/preview-posting-warehouse.md)]

You can also create an **Inventory Put-away** directly from the released production order. Learn more at [Put Items Away with Inventory Put-aways](warehouse-how-to-put-items-away-with-inventory-put-aways.md).  

When you post an inventory put-away, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] assumes that all the operations are posted according to the standard routing. That is, the output quantity is posted according to the last operation. You can use the output journal to post variances in the output quantity and the setup and run times. If you must post partially after you created the inventory put-away, you can do so on set-up times and quantities for all operations except the last one. The inventory put-away controls the last operation.  

If you only need to post the set-up or run time on the last operation, set the output quantity on the last operation to 0. You can choose not to post the last line at all by deleting it.

## To put away assembly and production output in advanced warehouse configurations

When you post output for a production or assembly order in advanced warehouse configurations, the output goes to the bin defined in the production or assembly order. To learn more about different ways to move items in the warehouse with advanced configurations, go to [Move Items in Advanced Warehouse Configurations](warehouse-how-to-move-items-in-advanced-warehousing.md#to-move-items-with-the-warehouse-movement-worksheet).

> [!NOTE]  
> You can't enter the number of the source document, such as the production order number, in internal put-away or movement documents for assembly or production output.  

You can also use warehouse put-aways for production outputs, which means you can use the same warehouse process for production outputs as you use for other receipts. Using the same process makes things easier because you don't have to switch between different types of document. Also, it's especially valuable for advanced configurations where Directed Put-Away and Pick is enabled because inventory put-away documents aren't available.

To use warehouse put-aways, on the **Location Card** page, in the **Prod. Output Whse. Handling** field, choose **Warehouse Put-away**.

> [!NOTE]
> For locations where Directed Put-away and Pick is enabled, make the field editable and allow the selection of **No warehouse handling** or **Warehouse put-away**. You can't select the **Inventory Put-away** option.
>
> You can't activate warehouse put-away if there are released production orders for the selected location.

When you post production output for a location where the **Prod. Output Whse. Handling** field is set to **Warehouse Put-away** on the **Location Card** page, the warehouse put-away document is either created automatically or you must use the **Warehouse Put-Away Worksheet** page.

If you delete a warehouse put-away, you can manually create a new one using the **Create warehouse put-away** action on the **Release Production Order** or **Finished Prod Order** pages.

> [!NOTE]
> You can't have production order lines with different locations with **Prod. Output Whse. Handling** set to **Warehouse Put-away**. To resolve this issue, use different production orders.
>
> You can't cancel output if there are outstanding or completed put-aways.

# Create number series

For each company that you set up, you need to assign unique identification codes to things such as general ledger accounts, customer and vendor accounts, invoices, and other documents. Numbering isn't only important for identification. A well-designed numbering system also makes the company more manageable and easier to analyze, and can reduce data entry errors.

> [!Important]
> By default, gaps aren't allowed in number series because the exact history of financial transactions must be available for auditing, by law, and therefore must follow an unbroken sequence with no deleted numbers.
>
> If you want to allow gaps in certain number series, consult with your auditor or accounting manager to ensure that you adhere to the legal requirements in your country/region. For more information, see the [Gaps in Number Series](#gaps-in-number-series) section.

> [!NOTE]  
> We recommend that you use the same number series codes as you see listed on the **No. Series List** page in the CRONUS demonstration company. Codes such as *P-INV+* might not make immediate sense to you, but [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] has a number of default settings that depend on these number series codes.

You create a numbering system by setting up one or more codes for each type of master data or document. For example, you can set up one code for numbering customers, another code for numbering sales invoices, and another code for numbering documents in general journals. After you set up a code, you must set up at least one number series line. The number series line contains information such as the first and last number in the series and the starting date. You can set up more than one number series line per number series code, with a different starting date for each line. Number series are consecutive, starting each series on the respective starting date.

> [!NOTE]
> The maximum length of a number in a number series is 20 characters. There are some situations where [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will append a number with a system-generated ID. For example, when documents such as invoices are used to apply transactions, such as payments, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] generates identifiers for the applied transactions. The identifier is comprised of a number from a number series and a six character system-assigned ID, such as -12345. If you expect to process more than 9999 documents in bank or GIRO journals, or cash receipt journals, set up number series for those types of documents to include fewer than 14 characters.

You typically set up your number series to automatically insert the next consecutive number on new cards or documents that you create. However, you can also set up a number series to allow you to manually enter a number. To manually enter numbers, turn on the **Manual Nos.** toggle.

If you want to use more than one number series code for one type of master data - for example, if you want to use different number series for different categories of items - you can use number series relationships.

## Get assistance from Copilot

The suggest number series with Copilot feature can help administrators create and maintain number series for all entities and documents in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] based on structured input or natural language. To learn more about this AI-based capability, go to [Suggest number series with Copilot](suggest-number-series-copilot.md).

## Gaps in number series

Not all records that you create in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] are financial transactions that must use sequential numbering. For example, you assign number series to customers, sales quotes, and warehouse activities, but they aren't subject to financial auditing and can be deleted. For such number series, you can select the **Allow Gaps in Nos.** checkbox on the **No. Series Lines** page. This setting can also be changed after creating the number series. For more information, see [To create a new number series](ui-create-number-series.md#to-create-a-new-number-series).

## Behavior of the No. field on documents and cards

On sales, purchase, transfer, and service documents, and on all cards, the **No.** field can be filled in automatically from a predefined number series, or you can add it manually. <!--However, under certain circumstances, the **No.** field is invisible to prevent you from editing it.-->

The **No.** field can be filled in three ways:

1. If only one number series for the type of document or card exists, and the **Default Nos.** field is selected and the **Manual Nos.** field isn't selected for that number series, then the field is automatically filled with the next number in the series.<!-- The **No.** field doesn't display on the card or document.-->  

    <!--Even if you define templates with various number series for customers, if the number series that is defined in the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page is set up in this way, the **No.** field doesn't display on the customer card, no matter which template you use. The same applies to other types of cards and documents.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > If the number series isn't working, for example because it's reached the last number defined for its range, the **No.** field displays so you can manually enter a number. You can resolve issues on the **No. Series** page.-->

2. If you have more than one number series for a type of document or card, and the **Default Nos.** checkbox isn't selected for the assigned number series, the **No.** field displays, and you can go to the **No. Series** page and select the number series you want to use. The next number in the series is then inserted in the **No.** field.

3. If you don't have a number series for a type of document or card, or if the **Manual Nos.** field is selected for the number series, the **No.** field displays and you must enter a number manually. You can enter up to 20 alphanumeric characters.

When you open a new document or card that a number series exists for, the **No. Series Setup** page opens so that you can set up a number series for that type of document or card and continue working.

> [!NOTE]  
> If you need to enable manual numbering on, for example, new item cards that were created with a data migration process that has hidden the **No.** by default, go to the **Inventory Setup** page and choose the **Item Nos.** field to open and set the related number series to **Manual Nos.**.
>
> The same is true if you're using service management features. To resolve that issue, go to the **Service Management Setup** page and choose the **Service Item Nos.** field to set the number series to **Manual Nos.**.

## To create a new number series

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **No. Series**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. On the new line, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  
4. Choose the **Lines** action.  
5. On the **No. Series Lines** page, fill in the fields to define the actual use and content of the number series that you created in step 2.  
6. Repeat step 5 for as many different uses of the number series that you need. The **Starting Date** field defines which number series line is active.  

> [!TIP]
> To allow users to specify numbers manually when they register a new customer or vendor, for example, choose the **Manual Nos.** field on the number series itself. To prevent manual numbering, clear the field.

You can assign number series to the templates that you set up for the different types of customers and vendors that your sales people and purchasers most often add. In that case, set up the relevant number series, link them through relationships, and then add the first number series in the relevant relationship to the relevant setup page. Then, when a user creates a customer, they choose the relevant template, and the new customer gets a number assigned from the number series that is defined for that template.  

## To create relationships between number series

If you set up more than one number series for the same kind of information or transactions, you can create relationships between the series. This feature can help you decide among the codes when you use a number. When you set up a relationship between a group of number series, you associate all of the related series to one number series. Then, you can enter that code in a field on the **Numbering** FastTab on setup pages, such as **Sales & Receivables Setup**.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **No. Series**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the line with the number series you want to create relationships for and then choose **Relationships**.
3. In the **Series Code** field, enter the code for the number series that you want to relate to the series you selected in step 2.
4. Add a line for each code that you want to relate to the selected number series.
5. Close the page.

Now when you set up something that requires a number, you can use the relationships you created to select among the related number series.

## To set up where a number series is used

The following procedure shows how to set up number series for the Sales area. The steps are similar for other areas.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales & Receivables**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Sales & Receivables** page, on the **Number Series** FastTab, select the desired number series for each sales card or document.

The selected number now fills in the **No.** field on the card or document according to your settings.

# Access with Microsoft 365 Licenses FAQ

[!INCLUDE[azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id](~/../shared-content/shared/azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id.md)]

[!INCLUDE [2023rw1-sec-group-short](includes/2023rw1-sec-group-short.md)]

Users can access Business Central data in Microsoft Teams using their Microsoft 365 license. This article answers frequently asked questions from administrators, consultants and others. Developers should refer to the Developer FAQ. For questions about integrating Business Central with Microsoft Teams, go to [Teams FAQ](teams-faq.md).

## [Permissions](#tab/permissions) 

### Can I proactively configure different starting permissions for different groups of users?

Not at this time. Business Central only allows configuring one group of permissions that are assigned to all Microsoft 365 users when they sign into Business Central for the first time.

### Can I proactively configure permissions, profiles, and settings for individual users before they sign in?

Yes. It can be achieved through security groups. By applying a security group to an environment, you define the total set of users that have access to that environment. This security group can include users with a Business Central license and users with a Microsoft 365 license. When you next update users from Microsoft 365 in the **Users** list, the Microsoft 365 user records will be created. You can then assign user groups, permissions, profiles, and other settings before they've signed in.

### After a user signs in, can I change which objects they have access to?

Yes. After a user has signed in for the first time and their user record has been provisioned, administrators manage those users just like any other Business Central user. For example, they can add or remove permissions to different objects. If you change the permission sets assigned to the Microsoft 365 license in the License Configuration page, the change will only affect the next users that sign in for the first time.

### How do I prevent access to sensitive tables?

Business Central offers a powerful and flexible permission model where administrators can define permission sets that grant access to specific objects, business processes or entire roles. To prevent access to sensitive tables, you can create custom permission sets that exclude permission to sensitive objects. For more information about exclude permissions, see [Create a permission set](ui-define-granular-permissions.md).  

### Instead of customizing the License Configuration, can I customize a user group?

Yes. Adding permission sets to the Microsoft Teams Internal Users user group in Business Central, has the same net effect as adding permission sets to the Microsoft 365 license, as long as the Microsoft 365 license continues to map to this user group. This approach has the added benefit that permission sets are always synchronized with members of the group whenever you modify the user group.

### When a Business Central user shares a record in Teams, do they grant new permissions?

No. This action isn't the same as sharing a link to a SharePoint document where the person sharing the document can choose to grant permission to others. In Business Central, only administrators can configure and assign permissions. When compared to sharing SharePoint documents, it's the equivalent of choosing the option to “Share to people with existing access”.

### Does this feature support row-level security?

Yes. Even though a person accessing a record in Teams with their Microsoft 365 license may have the correct table and page object permissions, row-level permissions will be enforced if it' been implemented for that table.  

### If I configure permissions that include write access, will users be able to write in Teams?

If you configure Business Central to assign a permission set that includes insert, modify, or delete access to one or more objects, users with that permission set will still not be able to write in Teams when they only have a Microsoft 365 license. The Business Central service enforces read-only access no matter what insert, modify, or delete permission you assign.  

Even though Business Central provides this level of protection, we still recommend that you avoid permission sets with write access. Doing so prevents issues further downstream when users change role or acquire new licenses.  

## [Setup and Configuration](#tab/setup)

### Why is the setting to enable access not available for my environment?

Enabling access with Microsoft 365 licenses is only available for Business Central environments of platform version 21.1 or later. When your environment is upgraded to this minimum version, the setting automatically becomes available. To check the version of your environment, go to the environment details page for the environment in the Business Central admin center. Or, sign in to the environment, and go to the **Help & Support** page from the **Help** menu.

### Can I access Business Central on premises with Microsoft 365 licenses?

No, it's not supported. Business Central displays an error when users try to access Business Central on premises records in Teams.

### What is the Employee profile?

The **Employee** profile displayed in the **Profiles (Roles)** list page was introduced with Update 21.1. It's the default profile assigned to users that access Business Central with their Microsoft 365 license. This profile's intended for people in an organization who don't have a specific role in Business Central and only need to view data that was shared with them.

### What is the Teams Users user group?

The **Microsoft Teams Internal Users** group displayed in the **User Groups** page was introduced with Update 21.1. This group is the default user group assigned to users that access Business Central with their Microsoft 365 license. The user group's intended for people within the same organization where Business Central is hosted that collaborate in Microsoft Teams.  

### Do users that only have a Microsoft 365 license show up in the Users list in Business Central?

Yes. If you apply security groups to environments, those users will show up in the Users list after you use the Update Users from Microsoft 365 action from the **Users** list. If you don't apply security groups, user records appear in the Users list after the first time they access a Business Central record.

### Does this feature work for embed ISV solutions?

Yes. Users with only a Microsoft 365 license can also access records in environments that run under the *.bc.dynamics.com domain.

## [Licensing](#tab/license)

### Can a customer use this feature if they don't have Business Central?

Accessing Business Central with a Microsoft 365 license is intended for organizations that already subscribe to Business Central and operate one or more Business Central environments with licensed Business Central users. It provides no new functionality or use rights to Microsoft 365 customers that don't have a Business Central plan.

### How does this help me manage subscription costs in my organization?

To maximize productivity and streamline their operations, SMBs often purchase Dynamics 365 Business Central together with Microsoft 365. In which case, most people receive a Microsoft 365 license, but only specific roles or people receive a Business Central license. Business Central provides licensing flexibility so that customers pay only for what they need:

- Users requiring full access to Business Central are typically assigned a Business Central Essentials or Business Central Premium license. 
- Users requiring limited write access are typically assigned a Business Central Team Member license.
- All other employees across the organization that only need to occasionally read business data that is shared with them, can do so if they have a Microsoft 365 license. They don't have to be assigned a Team Member license. Other licensing options are available. For more information, download and read the [Dynamics 365 licensing guide](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=866544).

### Is this 100% free of charge?
 
No. Accessing Business Central data in Microsoft Teams requires each user to have either a Business Central license or a Microsoft 365 license from the list of supported plans.

### Does this work with Microsoft 365 trials and Business Central trials?

Yes. If a user is assigned a Microsoft 365 license from a trial of a supported plan, they can also access Business Central records in Teams. It's then possible for customers to try Microsoft productivity and business apps working together, and allows partner salespeople and consultants to easily demonstrate this feature. For example, partners can provision their own Microsoft Entra tenants from [https://aka.ms/CDX](https://aka.ms/CDX) that include Microsoft 365 trials and Business Central trials for demonstrating Business Central.

### The list of licenses in Business Central shows a Microsoft 365 license. What's that?

The **License Configuration** page in Business Central displays the different types of licenses that can provide access to the Business Central service. In version 21, Microsoft added Microsoft 365 to this list as a new way to access Business Central. This list of licenses doesn't imply that your organization has purchased subscriptions to any of these licenses or your organization has enabled access through those licenses.

### Do I need to acquire a new type of Microsoft 365 license for this feature to work?  

Microsoft hasn't created new licenses or new plans to power this feature. This feature relies entirely on existing Microsoft 365 plans and licenses. If you already subscribe to one of the supported Microsoft 365 plans, then you already have this new use right. Learn more about the supported plans in [Business Central access with Microsoft 365 licenses](admin-access-with-m365-license.md#requirements-for-individual-users-to-access-data-in-teams). Otherwise, if you don't subscribe to Microsoft 365 today, you can sign up for Microsoft 365 Business Premium or similar plan. Learn more in [Try or buy a Microsoft 365 for business subscription](/microsoft-365/commerce/try-or-buy-microsoft-365).

### How do I find out which users have only a Microsoft 365 license?

There are multiple ways. In the Microsoft 365 admin center, go to the **Active Users** list and refer to the **Licenses** column. In Business Central, go to the **Users** list, choose any of the users and view the **Licenses** FactBox.  

### How do I filter the Users list in Business Central to see users that only have a Microsoft 365 license?

This task is currently not possible using a filter or list view. However, you can select a user in the list and view the Licenses FactBox that will include only Microsoft 365, if the user only has a Microsoft 365 license.

### What about users that have both a Microsoft 365 license and a Business Central license?

When multiple licenses are assigned to a user, the greater license use rights win over lesser license use rights when accessing Business Central. In this case, Business Central license entitles the user to more user rights. So, users can read and write Business Central records in Teams and access the Business Central web client in the browser, just like any other Business Central license-holder. If specific permission sets have been configured for the Microsoft 365 license, the user gets the configured permission sets combined with the permission sets from the Business Central license or that have already been assigned to the user.

### Is this licensing related to the Business Central Team Member license?

There's no relation between Business Central Team Member licenses and accessing Business Central in Microsoft Teams using Microsoft 365 licenses. Although Microsoft Teams and its documentation refer to people in a team as *team members*, it's a collective term for a group of Microsoft Teams users. It doesn't refer to Business Central licenses.

### Does Business Central enforce any of the constraints?

Yes, all of the platform constraints and minimum requirements, including licensing requirements, are enforced by the Business Central platform. This guides users with specific error messages to help them troubleshoot their setup, and prevent abuse. For example, if a user that only has a Microsoft 365 license attempts to access the Business Central web client in the browser, access will be denied and a guiding error message will be displayed. 

## [Usage](#tab/usage)
 
### Can I access records on Teams for iOS and Teams for Android? 

Currently, it isn't possible to access Business Central data on the Teams mobile using only a Microsoft 365 license. Microsoft is working on enabling this capability shortly. 

### How do users change their personal settings in My Settings? 

When a user accesses Business Central for the first time using only their Microsoft 365 license, their user settings such as language, time zone and regional settings are automatically set based on their operating system or browser settings. Administrators can modify these settings from Business Central for each user. 

### What determines the choice of language when you sign in for the first time? 

The language with which you experience Business Central is set based on various factors, including the Teams client through which you accessed Business Central the first time. For Teams desktop app, Teams for iOS and Teams for Android, the operating system language is applied. For Teams for the web, the browser language is applied. In all cases, the Teams language isn't considered. 

### Why can’t I activate some of the colored links in tabs and card details?

Actionable links on Business Central pages are often shown as a bold hyperlinks that can be activated to go elsewhere or run some operation. At a technical level, these links are typically implemented as field values with no caption that trigger some code and where the choice of style often reflects state. When users access Business Central pages with their Microsoft 365 license, the links are styled as if they're actionable. But they can't be activated because this license doesn't offer use rights to run actions.  

### Why can’t I activate page notification actions?

Contextual notifications shown on pages are often accompanied by actionable links. When users access Business Central pages with their Microsoft 365 license, these links are displayed, but can't be activated because this license doesn't offer use rights to run actions. At a technical level, these links are implemented as actions.

### Can Microsoft 365 users remove tabs?

Yes. Anyone in the chat or channel can remove tabs created by others. Removing a tab doesn't remove or affect data in Business Central, but the tab will be removed for all users in the chat or channel.

### If I can't filter, will I still see a filtered list that was created by others?

Users accessing Business Central with their Microsoft 365 license don't have the use rights to filter using the filter pane or apply list views. But, if another user has created a tab containing a filtered list page, Microsoft 365 users will also view those filters applied to the tab.

# The QuickBooks Data Migration Extension

This extension makes it easy to migrate customers, vendors, items, and accounts from QuickBooks to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. If your business uses QuickBooks today, you can export the relevant information and then open an assisted setup guide to upload the data to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  
For more information, see [Importing Business Data from Other Finance Systems](across-import-data-configuration-packages.md).

## Data from QuickBooks desktop

You can import the following data from QuickBooks Online to Business Central:

- Customers  
- Vendors  
- Items  
- Chart of Accounts  
- Beginning Balance transactions in General Ledger  
- On-hand Quantities for Inventory Items  
- Open documents for customers and vendors, such as invoices, credit memos and payments  

We migrate only full amounts on sales and purchase documents. We do not update partially paid amounts. For example, if a customer has paid 300 of a total of 500 dollars on a sales invoice, we migrate the full 500. If you have received partial payments, you must update these manually, either before or after you migrate data. We recommend that you apply outstanding transactions before you migrate, just to make things easier afterward.

> [!NOTE]
> We do not migrate purchase orders or sales orders.

## Before you start

An important part of the migration process is to specify the accounts to migrate transactions to. It's a good idea to plan this mapping before you migrate data. For example, the accounts where you post transactions for:

- The sale of items or services to customers  
- The purchase of items or services from vendors  
- Adjustments in the general ledger  

Business Central requires that general ledger accounts have account numbers assigned to them. Make sure that account numbers are assigned to your accounts in QuickBooks.
If transactions in QuickBooks have tax amounts, you must set up a tax account for your tax jurisdictions in Business Central before you can post transactions.

In order to get your data out of the QuickBooks desktop application you will need to download the Microsoft Data Exporter Tool.  The instructions for the tool are in the Data Migration Wizard in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The tool will connect to your QuickBooks application and export the applicable data to a .zip file.  

> [!NOTE]
> Currently the data exporter tool only works with QuickBooks 2017 and 2018.

## Finding the QuickBooks data migration extension

The QuickBooks Data Migration extension is installed and ready to go as an integrated part of the Data Migration assisted setup guide. If you are ready to get started now, and have exported your data from QuickBooks, choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Assisted Setup**, and then choose the related link. Choose **Migrate business data**, and then follow the steps in the guide.  

## What do I do after I migrate data?

After you migrate data, transactions have the status Unposted, so you can review them and make adjustments. To review the transactions, go to the page where you would normally find them. For example, to review unposted sales invoices, go to the Sales Invoices page. To review payment journals, go to the Payment Journals page.
There are a few things in particular that you should do:
If the transactions in QuickBooks had markup or discount amounts, you must manually add the amounts to the related transactions in Business Central before you post them.
If you are using value added tax (VAT), you may need to add a business posting group and a product posting group to the posting setup so that you can post VAT amounts.
Verify the beginning balances for accounts in the general ledger. QuickBooks does not store the current balance for all accounts, so you might need to correct beginning balances.

# Prepare financial reporting with financial data and account categories

The **Financial Reports** feature gives you insights into the financial data shown on your chart of accounts (COA). You can set up financial reports to analyze figures in general ledger (G/L) accounts, and compare general ledger entries with budget entries. The results display in charts and reports in your Role Center, such as the Cash Flow chart, and the Income Statement and Balance Sheet reports. You access these two reports, for example, with the **Financial Statements** action in the Business Manager and Accountant home pages.  

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides sample financial reports you can use right away as templates. You can also set up your own reports to specify the figures to compare. For example, you can create financial reports to calculate profit margins using dimensions such as departments or customer groups. The number of financial reports you can create is unlimited and require no involvement of a developer.  

## Prerequisites for financial reporting

Setting up financial reports requires an understanding of the structure of your chart of accounts. There are three key concepts that you likely need to pay attention to before you design your financial reports:

- Map G/L posting accounts to G/L account categories.
- Design how you use dimensions.
- Set up G/L budgets.

G/L account categories simplify your financial report definitions and make them more resilient to changes in the chart of accounts structure. Learn more at [Use G/L account categories to change the layout of your financial statements](bi-row-definitions.md#use-gl-account-categories-to-change-the-layout-of-your-financial-statements).

Setting up dimensions allows you to slice and dice your financial data in ways that make sense for your organization. Learn more at [Work with Dimensions](finance-dimensions.md).

If you want to view general ledger entries as percentages of budget entries, you must create G/L budgets. Learn more at [Create G/L Budgets](finance-how-create-budgets.md).

## Financial reports

Financial reports arrange accounts from your chart of accounts in ways that make data easier to present. You can set up various layouts to define the information you want to extract from the chart of accounts. Financial reports also provide a place for calculations that can't be made directly in the chart of accounts. For example, you can create subtotals for groups of accounts and then include that total in other totals. Another example is to calculate profit margins on dimensions such as departments or customer groups. Additionally, you can filter general ledger entries and budget entries, for example, by net change or debit amount.

> [!NOTE]
> Mathematically, think of a financial report as defined by two things:
>
> - A vector of row definitions that define what needs to be calculated.
> - A vector of column definitions that defines the data for the calculation.
>
> The financial report is then the outer product of these two vectors. The value in each cell is calculated by applying the formula in the row applied to the data definition from the column.

:::image type="content" source="media/financial-report-definition.svg" alt-text="Shows how a financial report is constructed from a row definition and a column definition." lightbox="media/financial-report-definition.svg":::

The **Financial Reports** page shows how all financial reports follow a pattern that consists of the following attributes:

- Name (code)
- Description
- Row definition
- Column definition
- Internal description (introduced in [!INCLUDE[2025_releasewave1_name](includes/2025_releasewave1_name.md)])

:::image type="content" source="media/financial-reports.png" alt-text="Shows how all financial reports are constructed from a row definition and a column definition." lightbox="media/financial-reports.png":::

> [!NOTE]
> The sample finance reports in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] aren't ready to use out of the box. Depending on how you set up your G/L accounts, dimensions, G/L account categories, and budgets, you need to adjust the sample row and column definitions and the finance reports they're used in to match your setup.

You can also use formulas to compare two or more financial reports and column definitions. Comparisons let can do the following things:

- Create customized financial reports.
- Create as many financial reports as you need, each with a unique name.
- Set up various report layouts and print the reports with the current figures.

To learn more about comparisons, go to [When to use a comparison period formula and comparison date formula in a column definition](bi-design-financial-reports.md#when-to-use-a-comparison-period-formula-and-comparison-date-formula-in-a-column-definition).

## Learning path: Create financial reports in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central

Want to learn how to create budgets and use financial reports, dimensions, and row and column definitions to generate financial reports that businesses often need?

Start on the following learning path [Create financial reports in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central](/training/paths/create-financial-reports-dynamics-365-business-central).

## Create a new financial report

You use financial reports to analyze general ledger accounts or to compare general ledger entries with budget entries. For example, you can view the general ledger entries as percentages of the budget entries.

The financial reports in the standard version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] might not suit your business needs. To quickly create your own financial reports, start by copying an existing one, as described in step 3 below.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Financial Reports**, then choose the related link.  
1. On the **Financial Reports** page, choose the **New** action to create a new financial report name. Alternatively, to reuse settings from an existing financial report, choose the report, and then choose the **Copy Report Definition** action.
1. In the **Name** field, enter a short name for the report

   > [!NOTE]
   > You can't change the name later.
1. In the **Display Title** field, enter a description of the report.
1. Choose a row definition and a column definition.
1. Optionally, choose analysis views for the row and column definitions.
1. Choose the **View Financial Report** action to access more properties on the financial report.
1. On the **Options** FastTab, you can edit the report title, change the row and column definitions, write an internal description, set the formatting for negative numbers, and define how to show dates. Dates can be a Day/Week/Month/Quarter/Year hierarchy, or use accounting periods. To learn more, go to [Comparing accounting periods using period formulas](bi-column-definitions.md#comparing-accounting-periods-using-period-formulas).
1. On the **Dimensions** FastTab, you can define dimension filters for the report.
1. If you want the report output to include an introductory and/or a closing paragraph, add them from the *Definitions* menu (these fields are available from the [!INCLUDE[2025_releasewave1_name](includes/2025_releasewave1_name.md)] and later).  
1. You can now preview the report in the area below the **Dimensions** FastTab.

> [!NOTE]
> When you open a financial report in View or Edit mode, the Filter pane is available. Don't use the Filter pane to set filters for the data in your report. Such filters can cause errors or might not actually filter the data. Instead, use the fields on the **Options** and **Dimensions** FastTabs to set up filters for the report.

### Adding introductory and/or closing paragraphs

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/introduced_in_2025rw1.md)]

If you want the report output to include an introductory and/or a closing paragraph, you can use the **Edit introductory/closing paragraphs** action on the **Definitions** menu. When you export the report to PDF or Excel, these paragraphs display before and after the report body.

### Choosing a format for negative numbers

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/introduced_in_2025rw1.md)]

If you want to control how negative numbers show in the report output (both on-screen and in PDF), you use the **Negative Amount Format** action on the **Options** FastTab to choose your preferred format. The format can be a minus sign or parentheses.

### Show amounts in an additional currency (ACY)

Your general ledger is set up to use your local currency (LCY), but you can set it up to also use another currency with a current exchange rate assigned. If you designate a second currency as an additional reporting currency (ACY), [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically records amounts in both LCY and ACY on each G/L entry.

Financial reports are based on G/L entries. To display report data in the additional reporting currency, select the **Show Amounts in Add. Reporting Currency** checkbox on the **Options** FastTab for the relevant report.

> [!NOTE]
> The **Show Amounts in Add. Reporting Currency** checkbox is only available if you set up an additional reporting currency (ACY).
To learn more, go to [Set Up an Additional Reporting Currency](finance-how-setup-additional-currencies.md).

### Create or edit a row definition

Row definitions in financial reports provide a place for calculations that can't be made directly in the chart of accounts. For example, you can create subtotals for groups of accounts and then include that total in other totals. You can also calculate intermediate steps that aren't shown in the final report.

Row definitions also provide settings for formatting your report. Most of the options provide visual definition to reports when people view or preview them on their monitors, or print them.

> [!NOTE]
> Some of the formatting options don't carry over when you export them to Excel. If you often export reports to Excel, you might skip the formatting here and format the report in Excel instead.

To learn more, go to [Row definitions in financial reporting](bi-row-definitions.md).

### Create or edit a column definition

Use column definitions to specify the columns to include in the report. For example, you can design a report layout to compare net change and balance for the same period this year and last year. You can have up to 15 columns in a column definition. For example, multiple columns are useful for displaying budgets for 12 months with a column that shows the total.

To learn more, go to [Column definitions in financial reporting](bi-column-definitions.md).

## Using dimensions in financial reports

In financial analysis, a dimension is data you add to an entry as a kind of marker. This data is used to group entries with similar characteristics, such as customers, regions, products, and salesperson, and easily retrieve these groups for analysis. You can use dimensions on entries in journals, documents, and budgets.

Each dimension describes the focus of analysis. So, a two-dimensional analysis, for example, would be sales per area. By using more than two dimensions when you create an entry, you can carry out a more complex analysis. An example of a complex analysis is exploring sales per sales campaign per customer group per area. That gives you greater insight into your business, such as how well your business is operating, where it is or isn't thriving, and where you should allocate more resources. That insight helps you make more informed business decisions. To learn more, go to [Work with Dimensions](finance-dimensions.md).

## Set up financial reports with overviews

You can use a financial report to create a statement that compares general ledger figures with budget figures.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 3.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Financial Reports**, then choose the related link.
1. On the **Financial Reports** page, select a financial report.  
1. Choose the **Edit Row Definition** action  
1. On the **Row Definition** page, in the **Name** field, select the default financial report name.
1. Choose the **Insert G/L Accounts** action.  
1. Select the accounts you want to include in your statement, then choose **OK**.

    The accounts are inserted in your financial report. If you want, you can also change the column definition.  
1. Choose the **Edit Financial Report** action.  
1. On the **Financial Report** page, on the **Dimensions** FastTab, set the budget filter to the filter name you want to use.  
1. Choose **OK**.  

Now you can copy and paste your budget statement into a spreadsheet.  

## Best practices for working with financial report definitions

Financial report definitions aren't versioned. When you change a report definition, the old version is replaced when your change saves to the database. The following list contains some best practices for working with financial report definitions:

- If you add report definitions, choose a good code and fill in the description field with a meaningful text while you still know what you use the report for. This information helps your coworkers (and your future self) to work with the report and perhaps changing the report definition.
- Before you change a report definition, consider taking a copy of it as a backup, just in case your change doesn't work as expected. You can either just copy the definition (give it a good name), or export it. To learn more, go to [Import or export financial report definitions](#import-or-export-financial-report-definitions).
- If you need a fresh copy of a definition that [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides, an easy way to get one is to create a new company that only contains setup data. Then, export the definition and import it in the company where the definition needs a refresh.

## Import or export financial report definitions

You can import and export financial report definitions as RapidStart configuration packages. For example, configuration packages are useful for sharing information with other companies. The package is created in a .rapidstart file, which compresses the contents.

> [!NOTE]
> When you import financial report definitions, the new definitions replace existing records with the same names. The configuration package for a report definition won't overwrite any existing row or column definitions that the report definition uses.

To import or export financial report definitions, follow these steps:

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 4.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Financial Reports**, then choose the related link.
1. Choose the financial report, then choose the **Import Financial Report** or **Export Financial Report** action, depending on what you want to do.

To learn more about how to import or export financial report row or column definitions, go to the following articles: 

- [Import or export financial reporting row definitions](bi-row-definitions.md#import-or-export-financial-reporting-row-definitions), or
- [Import or export financial reporting column definitions](bi-column-definitions.md#import-or-export-financial-report-column-definitions)

## Integrate financial reports with Excel

You can integrate a financial report with an Excel workbook template, adjust the layout to suit your needs, and then update the Excel template with data from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For example, this integration makes it easier to generate your monthly and yearly financial statements in a format that works for you.

To learn more, go to [How to integrate financial reports with Excel](finance-financial-reporting-view-a-report.md#integrate-financial-reports-with-excel).

## Print and save financial reports

You can print financial reports using your device's printing services. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] also offers options to save reports as PDF files. 

To learn more, go to [How to print and save financial reports](./finance-financial-reporting-view-a-report.md#print-and-save-financial-reports).

# Sharing Business Central records and page links in Microsoft Teams

[!INCLUDE [online_only](includes/online_only.md)]

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers a couple ways to share data from Business Central directly in a Microsoft Teams conversation:

- With the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app installed in Teams, you can include an interactive card of any Business Central record in a Teams conversation.

- With or without the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app installed, you can share a link from pages in Business Central to a Teams conversation.

The following sections describe the different ways in detail.

## Include and view a Business Central card in a Teams conversation

With the Business Central app for Teams, you can copy a link from any Business Central record, like a customer or sales order, and paste the link into a Teams conversation. The app connects Microsoft Teams to your business data in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]\. It then expands the link into a compact, interactive card that displays information about the record. Once in the conversation, you and coworkers can view more details about the record, edit data, and take action&mdash;without leaving Teams.

[![Teams integration with Business Central.](media/teams-intro-vBC24.png)](media/teams-intro-vBC24.png#lightbox)

### Prerequisites

- You have access to Microsoft Teams.
- You've installed the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app in Teams. Learn more in [Install the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] App for Microsoft Teams](across-install-app-for-teams.md)

> [!NOTE]
> All participants in a Teams conversation will be able to view cards for Business Central records that you submit to the conversation. But to view more details about records, by using the **Details** or **Pop out** buttons on a card, they'll need access to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Learn more in [Managing Microsoft Teams Integration](admin-teams-integration.md#minimum-requirements-1).

### Include a Business Central card in a Teams conversation

1. Sign in to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] using your browser.
2. Open the record that you want to share.

    The app is designed to display a card for almost any type of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] page. But it provides the best experience when used for pages that display a single record, such as an item, customer, or sales order.
3. Copy the link to the page.

    There are two ways to copy the link. The easiest and preferred way is to select **Share** ![Share icon in Business Central](media/share-icon.png) > **Copy Link**. Alternatively, copy the entire URL from the browser's address bar.

    [![Copy Business Central URL from browser.](media/teams-copy-link.png)](media/teams-copy-link.png#lightbox)
4. Go to Teams and start a conversation, which can be chat with a person, group of persons, or a team channel.
5. Paste the link (URL) in the message box where you compose a message. You might need to add a space or press <kbd>Enter</kbd> for the URL to be recognized.

    ![Paste Business Central URL in Teams.](media/teams-paste-url-v3.png)

    > [!TIP]
    > If you get a message like: *Business Central wants to show a preview of this link.*, it means that you don't have the Business Central app for Teams installed. To install the app, select **Show Preview** and follow the instructions.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Depending on your Business Central version, the first time you paste a link into a conversation, you might be asked to sign in to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and give consent for the app to connect to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Follow the on-screen instructions. You'll only have to do this step once.

6. Wait a moment while a card is generated in the message box.
7. When the card appears, review the contents of the card carefully for any sensitive information before sending the message. This step is important because once you send the message, everyone in the conversation can see the card.
8. If the card looks good, select **Send** to submit it to the conversation.
9. To view more details or make changes to the record shown in the card, select **Details**. Learn more in the next section.

### View card details

Once a card's been sent to a conversation, all participants with the [proper permissions](admin-teams-integration.md#permissions) can select **Details** to open a window that displays more information about the record&mdash;and possibly make changes to the record. It doesn't matter if you're the one sending the card or the one receiving the card. The **Details** feature is especially useful to recipients because it quickly provides concise, targeted information about the record.

The details window is similar to what you'd see in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], but it's focused on the page or record that the card is about. When you're finished viewing and making changes, close the window to return to the Teams conversation.

Here are a couple things to keep in mind when working with the card details:

- To open the card details, users must have permission on the page and its data in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]\.
- Cards in Teams chats aren't automatically updated to changes. Any changes you save to a record in the details window are saved in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]\. But the card in Teams won't show the changes in the conversion, until you paste the link again.

Learn more about working with cards and card details in [Teams FAQ](teams-faq.md).

## <a name="share-link"></a>Share a link to page from Business Central to Teams

Directly from most collection pages, like the **Items** page, and details pages, like the **Items** card, you can send a link to the page to specific recipients in a Teams conversation. For example, you can share a link to a filtered view of your records. Recipients can then select the link to open the page in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]\.

[![!The Share menu displayed on a card.](media/teams-share-link-v2.png "The Share menu displayed on a card.")](media/teams-share-link-v2.png#lightbox)

### Prerequisites

- You have access to Microsoft Teams.
- (Optional) You've installed the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app in Teams. 

  With the app installed, messages you send with the link will also include a compact card for the page. For more information about how to install the app, see [Install the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] App for Microsoft Teams](across-install-app-for-teams.md).

### Share a link

1. In [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]\, open the page that you want to share.
2. At the top of the page, select the ![!Share to other apps action on pages.](media/share-icon.png) icon, then **Share to Teams**.
3. If you're asked, sign in to Teams with your user name and password.
4. In the **Share to Teams** page, type a name of a person, group, or channel that you want send the message to.
5. The message box includes a link to the page. If the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams is installed, a card for the linked record or page will also appear in the message box.

   Add more information if you like, then select **Share**.
6. The link is now shared. To view the conversation, select **Go to Teams**.

# Finding Related Entries for Documents

Learn how to find documents and entries that are related to each other based on a piece of common information, like:

- Document number or posting date.
- Business contact type, number, or external document number.
- Item serial number or lot number.

This feature is useful for finding the ledger entries that resulted from certain transactions. When you search by document number, you can print the summary from the **Document Entries** report.

## Get started

The find entries feature is readily available from almost any page by pressing the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Q</kbd> keys. From pages that specifically display posted documents or posted document entries&mdash;for both lists and cards&mdash;you can also open the feature by choosing the **Find entries** action.

The **Find Entries** page includes all related documents and entries based on the document no. and posting date. The page is divided into three sections:

- The top section displays fields and actions that you use for filtering your search.
- The middle section displays related documents based on the search.
- The bottom section displays information about the source document that was found by searching.

## Search for entries

You can search for entries based on information about either the document, business contact, or item reference. On the top section, select one of the following options based on the type of information you have:

|Action|Description|
|------|-----------|
| **Search for documents** | View entries based on a specific document number or posting date. |
| **Search for business contacts** | View entries based on a specific contact type, contact number, and/or external document number. This last option allows you to search for vendor or customer documents by using the number assigned by the contact. |
| **Search for item references** | View entries based on a serial number or lot number. You can enter the lot number or serial number, or filter on the lot number or serial number that you want to search for. This action is useful to see where a specific item tracking number was used, what vendor it came from, or what customer it was sold to. |

After you make a selection, enter the relevant search information in the fields at the top of the page. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)] When you're finished, choose **Find** to start the search. If you change any of the filters, you have to choose **Find** again.

> [!TIP]
> For a couple of examples about using **Find Entries**, see [Trace Item-Tracked Items](inventory-how-to-trace-item-tracked-items.md) and [Walkthrough: Tracing Serial-Lot Numbers](walkthrough-tracing-serial-lot-numbers.md).

# Get ready to synchronize master data

When two or more companies use some of the same master data, you can synchronize the data rather than add it manually in each company. For example, synchronizing data is useful when you're setting up new subsidiary companies.

Master data includes settings and non-transactional information about business entities. For example, customers, vendors, items, and employees. The data provides context for business transactions. The following are a few examples of master data for a customer:

* Name
* Identification number
* Address
* Payment terms
* Credit limit

You set up synchronization in the subsidiary companies. Using a pull model, subsidiaries pull the data from the source company that they need to do business with them. After you set up synchronization and synchronize data for the first time, you're all set. Job queue entries update coupled records in the subsidiaries when someone changes data in the source company.

## Uni-directional synchronization only

You can synchronize data only from the source company to the subsidiary companies in a pull fashion. Subsidiaries can't push data to the source company.

> [!NOTE]
> Although it's possible, we don't recommend that you set up bi-directional synchronization. That is, synchronizing data from the source company to the subsidiaries, and from the subsidiaries to the source company. Synchronizing data in both directions can lead to conflicts or unwanted overwrites.

## Before you start

The following are requirements for setting up synchronization.

* All companies must be in the same environment.
* The user who sets up the subsidiary must have the **Essential**, **Premium**, or **Basic ISV** license.

> [!NOTE]
> The Team Member and Internal Administrator licenses let you access but not modify records, so they can't be used to set up the synchronization. The Delegated Admin license doesn't let you schedule background tasks, so you won't be able to complete the setup.

## Specify the source company

The first steps are to specify the company that will be the data source and enable synchronization. Subsidiary companies pull data from the source company.

> [!NOTE]
> When you enable synchronization, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates and schedules the job queue entries that synchronize the data. It might look like the entries immediately sync the data, but that isn't the case. The created job queue entries only sync coupled records, and at this point you haven't set that up yet. Synchronization starts after you [Enable or disable tables and fields](#enable-or-disable-tables-and-fields) and [Synchronize for the first time](#synchronize-for-the-first-time).

1. In a subsidiary company, choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Master Data Management Setup**, and then choose the related link.
1. In the **Source Company** field, specify the company that you'll pull changes from.
1. Turn on the **Enable Synchronization** toggle.
1. In the confirmation dialog, choose **OK**. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will find the tables and fields that are available from the source company.

The next step is to enable tables and fields for synchronization.

## Enable or disable tables and fields

To save time, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides a list of tables that businesses often synchronize. By default, these tables are enabled for synchronization. You can modify, disable, or delete them as you see fit. As an extra time-saver, some fields on the tables are already disabled because they probably aren't relevant for the subsidiary.

> [!NOTE]
> If one or more extensions are installed in the source company, when a subsidiary sets up synchronization the **Synchronization Tables** page includes tables from the extensions, and you can access their fields. However, if the source company adds an extension after synchronization is set up, each subsidiary must manually add the tables. To learn more about adding tables, go to [Add or delete tables from the synchronization tables list](#add-or-delete-tables-from-the-synchronization-tables-list). To learn more about extending [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], go to [Developing extensions in Visual Studio Code](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-dev-overview#developing-extensions-in-visual-studio-code).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Master Data Management Setup**, and then choose the related link.
1. Choose the **Synchronization Tables** action.
1. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](../archive/SetupAndAdministration/includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

> [!TIP]
> The **Table Filter** field is helpful for controlling what to synchronize for a table. You can set up filters to synchronize only when certain conditions are met. For example, you can add filters that specify that you synchronize only vendors in a certain region. Or, customers that use a certain currency.
>
> If the subsidiary already has data in their tables, another good way to set criteria for synchronization is to set up match-based coupling. To learn more about matching, go to [Use match-based coupling](#use-match-based-coupling).

1. To enable fields for a table, choose the table, and then choose the **Fields** action.
1. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](../archive/SetupAndAdministration/includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

> [!TIP]
> A fast way to enable or disable multiple fields at the same time is to select them in the list, and then use either the **Enable** or **Disable** actions.

### Use match-based coupling

You can specify the data to synchronize for a table by matching records based on criteria. On the **Master Data Management Setup** page, choose the **Match-Based Coupling** action to open the **Select Coupling Criteria** page. You can define the following criteria for your matching:

* Whether to synchronize after you couple records.
* Whether to create a new record in the subsidiary company if a unique, uncoupled match can be found by using the match criteria. To activate this capability, turn on the **Create New if Unable to Find a Match** action.
* The fields to use to match records, and whether the match is case-sensitive.
* Prioritize the order in which records are searched by specifying a match priority. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will search for a match in ascending order based on the match priority. A blank value equals priority 0, which is the highest priority. Fields with the 0 priority are considered first.

## Synchronize for the first time

When you're ready, on the **Master Data Management Setup** page, choose the **Start Initial Synchronization** action. On the **Master Data Initial Synchronization** page, choose the type of synchronization that you want to use for each table.

* If you already have records in both the source and the subsidiary companies, and you want to match existing records, choose the **Use Match-Based Coupling** action. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] matches records in the subsidiary company with records in the source company. The matches are based on matching criteria that you define. For several default tables, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] has already matched existing records by using their primary key, but you can change that if you want. You can also let the synchronization create new records in the subsidiary for records in the source company that the subsidiary doesn't have. To learn more about matching, go to [Use match-based coupling](#use-match-based-coupling).
* If you choose **Run Full Synchronization**, synchronization creates new records for all records in the source company that aren't coupled yet. For example, this option is useful in the following scenarios:

    * The subsidiary doesn't have data in the table.
    * You want to add records from the source company without matching.  

After you choose the option to use, choose the **Start All** action to start the synchronization.

While synchronization is running, the **Job Status** column on the **Master Data Initial Full Synchronization** page shows the status of each job queue entry. Press **F5** on your keyboard to update the status.

> [!TIP]
> Tables synchronize in a predefined order. If synchronization get's stuck on a table, select the table and then choose the **Restart** action to get it going again.

To access details, such as the number of records that are inserted or modified, choose the value in the **Job Status** column to open the **View - Integration Synchronization Jobs** page. For records that were inserted, you can choose the number in the **Inserted** column to access more details about the new records.

## Add or delete tables from the synchronization tables list

### Add a table

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Although tables that contain transactional data are available in the list, such as tables that contain ledger entries, you shouldn't choose them. Synchronization works only for tables that contain non-transactional data.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Synchronization tables**, and then choose the related link.
1. Choose **New**, and then choose the table to add.
1. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](../archive/SetupAndAdministration/includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

### Delete a table

> [!NOTE]
> If you delete a record in the source company, it isn't also deleted in the subsidiary. This helps prevented unwanted loss of data. The subsidiary can decide to delete the table if they want.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Synchronization tables**, and then choose the related link.
1. Choose the **Delete** action.

## Use export and import to share a synchronization setup

If you're setting up several subsidiaries that use the same or similar synchronization settings, there's a time saver. Set up one subsidiary company and then export its setup to an .xml file. The file contains the entire setup, including table and field mappings and filter criteria. You can then import the file to the next subsidiary. To import or export a setup, on the **Master Data Management Setup** page, use the **Import** or **Export** actions.

# Design Details: Cost Adjustment

The main purpose of cost adjustment is to forward cost changes from cost sources to cost recipients, according to an item’s costing method, to provide correct inventory valuation.  

An item can be sales invoiced before it has been purchase invoiced, so that the recorded inventory value of the sale does not match the actual purchase cost. Cost adjustment updates the cost of goods sold (COGS) for historic sales entries to ensure that they match the costs of the inbound transactions to which they are applied. For more information, see [Design Details: Item Application](design-details-item-application.md).  

The following are secondary purposes, or functions, of cost adjustment:  

* Invoice finished production orders:  

  * Change the status of value entries from **Expected** to **Actual**.  
  * Clear WIP accounts. For more information, see [Design Details: Production Order Posting](design-details-production-order-posting.md).  
  * Post variance. For more information, see [Design Details: Variance](design-details-variance.md).  
  * Update the unit cost on the item card.  

Inventory costs must be adjusted before the related value entries can be reconciled with the general ledger. For more information, see [Design Details: Reconciliation with the General Ledger](design-details-reconciliation-with-the-general-ledger.md).  

## Detecting the Adjustment

The task of detecting if cost adjustment should occur is primarily performed by the Item Jnl.-Post Line routine, while the task of calculating and generating cost adjustment entries is performed by the **Adjust Cost – Item Entries** batch job.  

To be able to forward costs, the detection mechanism determines which sources have changed in costs and to which destination these costs should be forwarded. The following three detection functions exist in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]:  

* Item Application Entry  
* Average Cost Adjustment Entry Point  
* Order Level  

### Item Application Entry

This detection function is used for items that use FIFO, LIFO, Standard, and Specific costing methods and for fixed applications scenarios. The function works as follows:  

* Cost adjustment is detected by marking the source item ledger entries as *Applied Entry to Adjust* whenever an item ledger entry or value entry is posted.  
* Cost is forwarded according to the cost chains that are recorded in the **Item Application Entry** table.  

### Average Cost Adjustment Entry Point

This detection function is used for items that use the Average costing method. The function works as follows:  

* Cost adjustment is detected by marking a record in the **Avg. Cost Adjmt. Entry Point** table whenever a value entry is posted.  
* Cost is forwarded by applying the costs to value entries with a later valuation date.  

### Order Level

This detection function is used in conversion scenarios, production and assembly. The function works as follows:  

* Cost adjustment is detected by marking the order whenever a material/resource is posted as consumed/used.  
* Cost is forwarding by applying the costs from material/resource to the output entries associated with the same order.  

The Order Level function is used to detect adjustments in assembly posting. The following graphic shows the adjustment entry structure:  

![Flow of entries in cost adjustment.](media/design_details_assembly_posting_3.png "Flow of entries in cost adjustment")  

For more information, see [Design Details: Assembly Order Posting](design-details-assembly-order-posting.md).  

## Manual versus Automatic Cost Adjustment

Cost adjustment can be performed in two ways:  

* Manually, by running the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job. You can run this batch job either for all items or for only certain items or item categories. This batch job runs a cost adjustment for the items in inventory for which an inbound transaction has been made, such as a purchase. For items that use the average costing method, the batch job also makes an adjustment if any outbound transactions are created.  
* Automatically, by adjusting costs every time that you post an inventory transaction, and when you finish a production order. The cost adjustment is only run for the specific item or items affected by the posting. This is set up when you select the **Automatic Cost Adjustment** check box on the **Inventory Setup** page.  

It is good practice to run the cost adjustment automatically when you post because unit costs are more frequently updated and therefore more accurate. The disadvantage is that the performance of the database can be affected by running the cost adjustment so often.  

Because it is important to keep the unit cost of an item up to date, it is recommend that you run the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job as often as possible, during nonworking hours. Alternatively, use automatic cost adjustment. This ensures that the unit cost is updated for items daily.  

Regardless if you run the cost adjustment manually or automatically, the adjustment process and its consequences are the same. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates the value of the inbound transaction and forwards that cost to any outbound transactions, such as sales or consumptions, which have been applied to the inbound transaction. The cost adjustment creates value entries that contain adjustment amounts and amounts that compensate for rounding.  

The new adjustment and rounding value entries have the posting date of the related invoice. Exceptions are if the value entries fall in a closed accounting period or inventory period or if the posting date is earlier than the date in the **Allow Posting From** field on the **General Ledger Setup** page. If this occurs, the batch job assigns the posting date as the first date of the next open period.  

## Adjust Cost - Item Entries Batch Job

When you run the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job, you have the option to run the batch job for all items or for only certain items or categories.  

> [!NOTE]  
> We recommend that you always run the batch job for all items and only use the filtering option to reduce the runtime of the batch job, or to fix the cost of a certain item.  

### Example

The following example shows if you post a purchased item as received and invoiced on 01-01-20. You later post the sold item as shipped and invoiced on 01-15-20. Then, you run the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** and **Post Inventory Cost to G/L** batch jobs. The following entries are created.  

#### Value Entries (1) 

|Posting Date|Item Ledger Entry Type|Cost Amount (Actual)|Cost Posted to G/L|Invoiced Quantity|Entry No.|  
|------------|----------------------|--------------------|------------------|-----------------|---------|  
|01-01-20|Purchase|10.00|10.00|1|1|  
|01-15-20|Sale|-10.00|-10.00|-1|2|  

#### Relation Entries in the G/L – Item Ledger Relation Table (1)

|G/L Entry No.|Value Entry No.|G/L Register No.|  
|-------------|---------------|----------------|  
|1|1|1|  
|2|1|1|  
|3|2|1|  
|4|2|1|  

#### General Ledger Entries (1)

|Posting Date|G/L Account|Account No. (En-US Demo)|Amount|Entry No.|  
|------------------|------------------|---------------------------------|------------|---------------|  
|01-01-20|[Inventory Account]|2130|10.00|1|  
|01-01-20|[Direct Cost Applied Account]|7291|-10.00|2|  
|01-15-20|[Inventory Account]|2130|-10.00|3|  
|01-15-20|[COGS Account]|7290|10.00|4|  

Later, you post a related purchase item charge for 2.00 LCY invoiced on 02-10-20. You run the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job and then run the **Post Inventory Cost to G/L** batch job. The cost adjustment batch job adjusts the cost of the sale by -2.00 LCY accordingly, and the **Post Inventory Cost to G/L** batch job posts the new value entries to the general ledger. The result is as follows.  

#### Value Entries (2)  

|Posting Date|Item Ledger Entry Type|Cost Amount (Actual)|Cost Posted to G/L|Invoiced Quantity|Adjustment|Entry No.|  
|------------|----------------------|--------------------|------------------|-----------------|----------|---------|  
|02-10-20|Purchase|2.00|2.00|0|No|3|  
|01-15-20|Sale|-2.00|-2.00|0|Yes|4|  

#### Relation Entries in the G/L – Item Ledger Relation Table (2)

|G/L Entry No.|Value Entry No.|G/L Register No.|  
|-------------|---------------|----------------|  
|5|3|2|  
|6|3|2|  
|7|4|2|  
|8|4|2|  

#### General Ledger Entries (2)

|Posting Date|G/L Account|Account No. (En-US Demo)|Amount|Entry No.|  
|------------|-----------|------------------------|------|---------|  
|02-10-20|[Inventory Account]|2130|2.00|5|  
|02-10-20|[Direct Cost Applied Account]|7291|-2.00|6|  
|01-15-20|[Inventory Account]|2130|-2.00|7|  
|01-15-20|[COGS Account]|7290|2.00|8|  

## Automatic Cost Adjustment

To set up cost adjustment to run automatically when you post an inventory transaction, use the **Automatic Cost Adjustment** field on the **Inventory Setup** page. This field enables you to select how far back in time from the current work date that you want automatic cost adjustment to be performed. The following options exist.  

|Option|Description|
|------|-----------|
|Never|Costs are not adjusted when you post.|  
|Day|Costs are adjusted if posting occurs within one day from the work date.|  
|Week|Costs are adjusted if posting occurs within one week from the work date.|  
|Month|Costs are adjusted if posting occurs within one month from the work date.|  
|Quarter|Costs are adjusted if posting occurs within one quarter from the work date.|  
|Year|Costs are adjusted if posting occurs within one year from the work date.|  
|Always|Costs are always adjusted when you post, regardless of the posting date.|  

The selection that you make in the **Automatic Cost Adjustment** field is important for performance and the accuracy of your costs. Shorter time periods, such as **Day** or **Week**, affect system performance less, because they provide the stricter requirement that only costs posted in the last day or week can be automatically adjusted. This means that the automatic cost adjustment does not run as frequently and therefore affects system performance less. However, it also means that unit costs may be less accurate.  

### Example

The following example shows an automatic cost adjustment scenario:  

* On January 10, you post a purchased item as received and invoiced.  
* On January 15, you post a sales order for the item as shipped and invoiced.
* On February 5, you receive an invoice for a freight charge on the original purchase. You post this freight charge, applying it to the original purchase invoice, which increases the cost of the original purchase.  

If you have set up the automatic cost adjustment to apply to postings that occur within a month or a quarter from the current work date, then the automatic cost adjustment runs and forwards the cost of the purchase to the sale.  

If you have set up the automatic cost adjustment to apply to postings that occur within a day or a week from the current work date, then the automatic cost adjustment does not run, and the cost of the purchase is not forwarded to the sale until you run the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job.

# Walkthrough: Set up and invoicing sales prepayments

This walkthrough takes you through the process of setting up and using prepayments in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. [!INCLUDE [prepayment_def](includes/prepayment_def.md)]

[!INCLUDE [prepayment_req](includes/prepayment_req.md)]

For example, you can send more prepayment invoices if more items are added to the order.  

## About this walkthrough  

This walkthrough will take you through the following scenarios:  

- Setting up prepayments  
- Creating an order that requires a prepayment  
- Creating a prepayment invoice  
- Correcting the prepayment requirements on an order  
- Applying prepayments to an order  
- Invoicing the final amount on an order with prepayment  

### Roles

This walkthrough includes tasks for the following roles:  

- Accounting Manager (Phyllis)  
- Order Processor (Susan)  
- Accounts Receivable Administrator (Arnie)  

## Story

 Phyllis is an accounting manager and makes decisions about which customers are required to pay a deposit before items are manufactured or shipped. Phyllis sets up [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to calculate prepayments automatically.  

 Susan is a sales order processor. When a customer calls to place an order, Susan enters the order into the system while the customer is on the telephone. This way, Susan can verify prices and payment terms with the customer immediately, and make changes to the order while negotiating with the customer.  

 Arnie works in the Accounts Receivable department and posts invoices and payments.  

 In this scenario, Phyllis sets up prepayment requirements for the customer Selangorian based on their credit history. Phyllis gives Susan instructions for how to handle their orders.  

 When the customer calls, Susan negotiates with the customer until they reach an agreement, and then chooses to calculate the prepayment in several different ways.  

 After Susan sends the prepayment invoice, the customer orders an extra item. Susan updates the order and creates a second prepayment invoice.  

 Arnie registers the customer's payment and applies it to the invoices, and then sends the final invoice.  

## Set up prepayments

Phyllis sets up the system to handle prepayments for customers.  

- Phyllis decides to have the same number series for prepayments as the one used for sales invoicing.  
- Phyllis sets application to check if prepayments are required before final invoicing on an order.  
- Phyllis sets up default values for a required prepayment percentage for particular items and customers.  

The following procedures describe how to complete Phyllis' tasks:  

### To set up number series for prepayments

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales & Receivables Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page, expand the **Number Series** FastTab.  
3. Verify that the number series for posted prepayment invoices in the **Posted Prepmt. Inv. Nos.** field is the same as for posted sales invoices (**Posted Invoice Nos.**), and the number series for posted prepayment credit memos (**Posted Prepmt. Cr. Memo Nos.**) is the same as for posted credit memos (**Posted Credit Memo Nos.**).  

### To block shipments for unpaid prepayment

1. On the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page, on the **General** FastTab, select the **Check Prepayment when Posting** check box.

Now you can't ship or invoice an order that has an unpaid prepayment amount.  

By default, Phyllis requires customer 20000 to be invoiced for a 30% down payment on all orders. Therefore, Phyllis will enter a default prepayment percentage on the customer card.  

Phyllis requires all customers to be invoiced a 20% deposit for item 1896-S. Customer 20000 has a poor payment history, so Phyllis requires a 40% prepayment from customer 20000 for item 1896-S. The following procedure illustrates how to set up default prepayment percentages.  

### To assign default prepayment percentages to customers and items

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customers**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the card for customer 20000 (Trey Research).
3. On the **Payments** FastTab, in the **Prepayment %** field, enter **30**.  
4. Choose the **Related** action, select the **Sales** menu item, and then choose the **Prepayment Percentages** menu item.  
5. Fill in two lines on the **Sales Prepayment Percentages** page as follows.  

    |**Sales Type**|**Sales Code**|**Item No.**|**Prepayment %**|  
    |--------------------|--------------------|------------------|----------------------|  
    |**Customer**|**20000**|**1896-S**|**40**|
    |**Customer**|**20000**|**1900-S**|**30**|  
    
    > [!TIP]
    > Depending on your country/region, you must also specify a tax group code on the **Costs & Posting** FastTab for item 1896-S. When you use the demonstration company, this field is already set.

6. Close all pages.  

### To specify an account for sales prepayments in general posting setup

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Posting Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the line where the **Gen. Bus. Posting Group** field is set to **DOMESTIC**, and the **Gen. Prod. Posting Group** field is set to **RETAIL**.  
3. In the **Sales Prepayments Account** field, specify the relevant account. Your selection is automatically saved.  

> [!TIP]
> If you cannot see the field in the **General Posting Setup** page, then use the horizontal scroll bar at the bottom of the page to scroll to the right.  

## Create an order that requires a prepayment

 In the following scenario, Susan, the order processor, creates an order when talking to a customer. The items the customer is ordering require a prepayment. Plus, the customer has made some late payments in the past. Susan's been instructed to require a fixed amount of **800** as a prepayment on the order.  

The customer asks to pay 35%, to which Susan agrees and changes the order.  

Susan creates the prepayment invoice and sends it to the customer.  

### To create a sales order with a prepayment

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. In the **Customer Name** field, choose **Trey Research**.  
4. Close the overdue balance warning that is displayed.  
5. Fill in two sales lines with the following information.  

    |**Type**|**No.**|**Quantity**|  
    |--------------|-------------|------------------|  
    |**Item**|**1896-S**|**1**|  
    |**Item**|**1900-S**|**1**|

    By default, the prepayment fields on the sales line are hidden. To display the fields, you must personalize the page. For more information, see [To start personalizing a page through the Personalizing banner](ui-personalization-user.md#start-personalizing-by-using-the-personalization-mode).

6. Verify that the **Prepayment %** field on the line with item **1900-S** contains **30**. The default value was taken from the sales header, which was populated from the customer card.  

    The **Prepayment %** field on the line with item **1896-S** contains **40**. 40 is the percentage you entered on the **Sales Prepayment Percentages** page for item **1896-S** and customer **20000**.  

    For more information, see [Set Up Prepayments](finance-set-up-prepayments.md).  
7. In the **Order** action, choose  **Statistics**.  
8. On the **Prepayment** FastTab, the **Prepayment Amount Excl. VAT** field contains **458.16**. If you create a prepayment invoice for the order now, 458.16 is the amount on the invoice.  

    In this scenario, Susan has been instructed to suggest a total prepayment of **800** for the order.  

    > [!IMPORTANT]  
    >  Depending on your country/region, the following step might not apply.  
9. Change the amount in the **Prepmt. Amount Excl. Tax** field to **800** and then close the page.  
10. Verify the **Prepayment %** field on the sales lines, and you'll see that it has been recalculated to **67.02438** and **67.02282**.  

     The recalculation includes all lines that have a prepayment percentage that is greater than 0.  

     Now the customer asks if the prepayment percent can be set to 35%. Susan's supervisor approves the change.
11. On the **Sales Order** page, on the **Prepayment** FastTab in the **Prepayment %** field, enter **35**.  
12. In the warning that appears, choose the **Yes** button. A rate of 35% will be applied as the payment percentage for the whole order.  
13. Verify that the lines have been updated correctly.  

## Create a prepayment invoice

After entering the correct prepayment values on the order, Susan creates the prepayment invoice and sends it to the customer.  

### To create a prepayment invoice

1. On the **Sales Order** page, choose **Actions**, then **Posting**, then **Prepayment** and then select **Post and Print Prepmt. Invoice**
2. Choose the **Yes** button to post the invoice.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Susan would now send the invoice to the customer.  

## Create an additional prepayment invoice

The following day, the customer calls Susan and makes changes to the order. The customer wants two of item 1896-S. Susan reopens the order, updates it, and then creates a second prepayment invoice for the order and sends it to the customer.  

### To create an additional prepayment invoice

1. On the **Sales Order** page, choose the **Release** action, and then **Reopen**.  
2. On the line for item **1896-S**, in the **Quantity** field, enter **2**.  

    In the **Order** action, choose **Statistics**. The **Prepayment Amount Excl. VAT** field now contains **768.04**, and the **Prepmt. Amt. Invoiced Excl. VAT** field contains **417.76**. These values show that there's an extra prepayment amount that hasn't been invoiced yet.  
3. To post an invoice for the extra prepayment amount, choose **Actions**, then **Posting**, then **Prepayment** and then select **Post and Print Prepmt. Invoice**
4. Choose the **Yes** button to post the invoice.  

## Apply the prepayments

The customer pays the prepayment amount. Arnie, from the accounting department, registers the payment, and applies it to the prepayment invoices.  

### To apply a payment to the prepayment invoices

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Cash Receipt Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in a journal line with the following information.  

    |Field name|Enter|  
    |----------------|-----------|  
    |**Document Type**|**Payment**|  
    |**Account Type**|**Customer**|  
    |**Account No.**|**20000**|  
3. Choose the **Process** action, and then **Apply Entries**.  
4. On the **Apply Customer Entries** page, select the first prepayment invoice, and then choose the **Process** action, and then choose the **Set Applies-to ID** action.  
5. Repeat the previous step for the second prepayment.  
6. Choose the **OK** button.  

    The **Amount** fields have now been filled in with the sum of the two prepayment invoices.  

7. To post the journal, choose the **Post/Print** action, then select **Post**.
8. Choose the **Yes** button.

## Invoice the remaining amount

Now Arnie has been informed that the items on the order have been shipped and that the order is ready for invoicing. Arnie creates the invoice for the order.  

### To invoice the remaining amount

1. Open the sales order.
2. Choose the **Posting** action, then **Post**.
3. Select **Ship and Invoice**, and then choose the **OK** button.
4. If you want to preview the invoice, choose the **Yes** button.

    > [!NOTE]  
    > Normally, the shipping department would have already posted the shipment.  

    Arnie can view the history to verify that the sales invoice was created as intended.

5. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Posted Sales Invoices**, and then choose the related link.  

## Update the status of prepaid orders and invoices automatically

You can speed up order and invoice processing by setting up job queue entries that automatically update the status of those documents. When a prepayment invoice is paid, the job queue entries can automatically change the document status from **Pending Prepayment** to **Released**. When you set up the job queue entries, the codeunits you'll need to use are **383 Upd. Pending Prepmt. Sales** and **383 Upd. Pending Prepmt. Purchase**. We recommend that you schedule the entries to run frequently, for example, every minute. For more information, see [Use Job Queues to Schedule Tasks](admin-job-queues-schedule-tasks.md).

## Next steps

This walkthrough covered the following steps to set up [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to handle prepayments. 

- Set up default prepayment percentages on customers and items.
- Use different methods to calculate the prepayments on an order.  
- Calculate the prepayment amount as a percentage of the total on the order.
- Assign one total prepayment amount to the order.  

You've also posted a prepayment invoice, created a second prepayment invoice when the order has changed, and posted the final invoice for the remaining amount.  

The prepayments capabilities make it easy to set up and enforce prepayment rules for customers and items. They also let you to post every payment against an invoice.

# Manage attachments, links, and notes on cards and documents

On most list pages, cards, and documents, you can attach files, add links, and write notes on the **Attachments** tab of the **FactBox** pane. The number in the tab title indicates how many attached files, links, or notes exist for the card or document.

On the **Lines** FastTab, you can also use the **Attachments** action to attach documents to a specific line. For example, you might want to attach design specifications to an item on a purchase invoice.

Attachments, links, and notes stay attached to the card or document while it's processed into other states. For example, from an ongoing sales order to a posted sales invoice. However, none of the attachment types are output from the system, for example, when printing or when saving to a file.

You can also add attachments to the emails you send from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. When you send an email directly from a document, such as a sales quote, the **Add file from source document** action lets you choose files that are attached to it. You can only choose files that are attached to the document. You can't choose files that are attached to lines.

> [!NOTE]
> When you partially ship and invoice a sales or purchase order, the attachment will only be attached to the final invoice of the order. Similarly, when you invoice deferrals, the attachment is attached to the G/L entries for the document but not for the deferral entries.
>
> If you delete an order before it is invoiced, the attachment is also removed.
>
> When you use the **Get Receipt Lines** action on a purchase invoice, the attachment on the related purchase order is added to the purchase invoice.

## Attach a file to a purchase invoice

You can attach any type of file, such as text, image, or video files, to a card, document, or a line on a document. This is useful, for example, when you want to store a vendor's invoice as a PDF file on the related purchase invoice in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

> [!NOTE]
> Files attached with the Incoming Documents feature aren't included on the **Attachments** tab. Learn more in [Incoming Documents](across-income-documents.md). The same is true for files that are attached to lines on documents.

The following procedure is based on a purchase invoice. The steps are similar for all other supported documents and cards.

> [!TIP]
> If your attachment is specific to a line on a document, you can attach it to the line. Select the line, and then choose the **Attachments** action.

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Invoices**, and then choose the related link.
1. Open the purchase invoice that you want to attach a file to.
1. On the **FactBox** pane, choose the **Attachments** tab.
1. Do one of the following steps:

   - Select **Documents**, and then select **Upload files**. 
   - Select **Documents**, select **Show details**, and then select **Attach files**.
1. On the **Select files** dialog box, do one of the following steps to attach a file:

   [!INCLUDE[file-upload](includes/file-upload.md)]

The file is now attached to the purchase invoice.

## View an attached file

1. On the FactBox, select the **Attachments** tab.
1. Under **Documents**, select the attachment you want to view.

   If you select a PDF file, it opens in your browser. Other files download to your device, where you can open them.

## Save a document as a PDF attachment

Whenever you need to save a document as a file, you can use the **Attach as PDF** action to capture the current document content as a PDF file attached to the FactBox of the document. This is useful, for example, when documents follow multiple steps in a process, such as a sales process or an approval workflow, and you want to refer to a printout of the previous step.

The following procedure is based on a sales order. The steps are similar for all supported documents.

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Orders**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select a sales order, and then choose the **Attach as PDF** action.

A PDF file with the current content of the sales order is added to the **Attachments** tab in the FactBox.

## To add a link from an item card

You can add a link from a card or document to any URL. This is useful, for example, when you want to link an item card with the supplier's item catalog.

The following procedure is based on an item card. The steps are similar for all other supported cards and documents.

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the item that you want to add a link from, and then choose the **Attachments** tab in the FactBox.
3. In the **Links**, choose the **+** icon.
4. In the **Link Address** field, enter the link.

    The link must be a valid internet or intranet URL.

5. In the **Description** field, enter any information about the link.  
6. Select the **OK** button.

The link is now attached to the item card.  

## Write a note on a sales order

You can write a note on a document or card, for example, to communicate special instructions to other users of the document or card. You can include file links and URLs in notes.

> [!NOTE]
> Notes on the **Attachments** tab aren't related to internal notes functionality, which is mainly used to communicate between workflow users. Learn more in [Setting Up Workflow Notifications](across-setting-up-workflow-notifications.md).

The following procedure is based on a sales order. The steps are similar for all other supported documents and cards.

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Orders**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the sales order that you want to write a note on, and then choose the **Attachments** tab in the FactBox.
3. In the **Notes** section, choose the **+** icon.
4. In the **Note** field, write any text, such as "This is an urgent order."
5. Select the **OK** button.

The note is now attached to the sales order.

# Set Up Locations to Use Bins

Bins represent the basic warehouse structure, and you use them to suggest where to place items. After you create your bins you define their contents, or let them serve as floating bins without specific contents.

To use the bin functionality at a location, turn on the **Bin Mandatory** toggle on the **Location** card. After you turn on the toggle, the **Bin Code** and **Zone Code** fields are available on the following documents:

* Warehouse receipt header
* Warehouse receipt lines
* Warehouse put-away lines
* Warehouse shipment header
* Warehouse shipment lines
* Warehouse put-away lines

The next step is to design the item flow at the location by specifying bin codes in setup fields that represent the different flows.  

> [!NOTE]  
> You must create bin codes before you can specify them for the location. For more information, see [Create Bins](warehouse-how-to-create-individual-bins.md).  

## To set up a location to use bins

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Locations**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the location where you want to use bins.  
3. Choose the **Edit** action.  
4. On the **Warehouse** FastTab, select the **Bin Mandatory** checkbox.  
5. If you aren't using directed put-away and pick for the location, in the **Default Bin Selection** field, choose the method you want [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to use to assign a default bin to an item.  
6. Open the card for the location that you want to set up bins for.
7. On the **Bins** FastTab, select the bins to use as the default for receipts, shipments, inbound, outbound, and open shop floor bins.  

    The bin codes you specify appear automatically on the headers and lines of various warehouse documents. The default bins define all starting or ending placements of items in the warehouse.  
8. If you're using directed put-away and pick, select a bin for warehouse adjustments. The bin code in the **Adjustment Bin Code** field defines the virtual bin in which to record discrepancies in inventory:

    * When you observe differences registered in the warehouse item journal
    * Differences calculated when you register a warehouse physical inventory  
9. Optional: Fill in the fields on the **Bin Policies** FastTab. The most important fields are **Bin Capacity Policy**, **Allow Breakbulk**, and **Put-away Template Code** fields.  
10. On the **Warehouse** FastTab, fill in the **Outbound Whse. Handling Time**, **Inbound Whse. Handling Time**, and the **Base Calendar Code** fields. To learn more, go to [Set Up Base Calendars](across-how-to-assign-base-calendars.md).

## Fill in the consumption bin

The following flow chart shows how the **Bin Code** field on production order component lines is filled in according to your location setup.

# Set Up Vendor Bank Accounts

Just as you can use bank account information on [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to keep track of your company's banking transactions, you can also set banking details for vendors. Vendor bank account data can simplify payments to suppliers when combined with the [AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals Extension](ui-extensions-amc-banking.md) or the [Export Payments to a Bank File](finance-make-payments-with-bank-data-conversion-service-or-sepa-credit-transfer.md) feature, for example.

## Add or edit a vendor bank account

[!INCLUDE [purchase-vendor-bank-account](includes/purchase-vendor-bank-account.md)]

# Moving Annual Total (MAT) (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Moving Annual Total (MAT)** report calculates total purchases over the last 12 months. It's a rolling calculation where the date is always moving. This report showcases figures for the Moving Annual Total (MAT) and Previous Year Moving Annual Total (PYMAT).

:::image type="content" source="media/purchases/purchases-moving-annual-total.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Moving Annual Total Power BI report" lightbox="media/purchases/purchases-moving-annual-total.png":::

## Use the report

The report is ideal for business leaders and purchasing managers who need to monitor purchase performance in the last 12 months.
  
CEOs can use the report to monitor the overall purchasing performance over the last 12 months. You can analyze the figures for Moving Annual Total (MAT) and Previous Year Moving Annual Total (PYMAT) and identify trends in purchasing amounts in line with the company's growth. If your purchasing amount exceeds your growth rate, you can use this information to develop a strategic plan that focuses on reducing inventory costs or optimizing purchasing budget. The report can also help you identify periods of high purchasing costs and work with purchasing managers to reduce them.

Purchasing managers can use this report to analyze the purchasing data over the last 12 months, and analyze purchase amounts for specific periods. You can identify purchasing performance by analyzing the MAT growth and growth percentage in each month. These measures offer insight into how your team performs during each period. By identifying the areas where purchasing increased, you can take necessary actions to optimize the purchasing process and ensure you're using purchasing budget efficiently.

# Privacy Notices Status in [!INCLUDE[prod_long](includes/prod_long.md)]

This article discusses what a privacy notice is and explains the purpose of the **Privacy Notices Status** page in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. You'll also learn how administrators can use this page.

## Privacy notice

A privacy notice states the data collection, data processing, and data privacy policies followed by the organizations's data controller. It's a document that describes what data is collected and for what purposes, how the user's data is processed, how it's being stored, and who to contact if a user wants to ask something about their data. 

## Privacy Notices Status page

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], if users want to integrate their data with Microsoft Exchange, Microsoft OneDrive, and Microsoft Teams, they must accept the privacy notice for each entity. Or an admin can approve the privacy notices on their behalf. Admins can see the status of privacy notices on the **Privacy Notices Status** page. You can find the **Privacy Notices Status** page in the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] by typing the name of the page in the search bar.  

On that page, you'll find a table with approval options for each of the services mentioned above. 

| Column | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- | 
| **Integration Name** | Name of the service, such as Microsoft OneDrive. |
| **Agree for All** | An admin approves the privacy notice for all users. |
| **Disagree for All** | An admin does not approve the privacy notice for all users. |
| **Let User Decide** | Users decide to approve the privacy notice for the service or not. |

> [!NOTE]
> You can only view the status of privacy notices on the main **Privacy Notices Status** page. To edit the responses, go to **Edit List** on the action bar of the page where options are now clickable and not greyed out.

## Privacy Notice Approvals

Admins can see individual approvals and manage them on the **Privacy Notice Approvals** subpage. Go to the *Action* bar of the **Privacy Notices Action** page, under *Actions*, to find the *Show individual approvals* option. This option goes to the **Privacy Notice Approvals** page.<br>

On that page, you'll find a table with approval options. 

| Column | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- | 
| **Integration Name** | Name of the service, such as Microsoft OneDrive. |
| **User Name** | The user who holds this approval. If *Organization* is written in the User Name column, approval belongs to the whole organization. 
| **Agree** | The user approves the privacy notice. |
| **Disagree** | The user does not approve the privacy notice. |
| **Approver User Name** | The one who approves the privacy notice. |

# Manage user settings and preferences

As an administrator, you can configure user settings in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], similar to how individual users can manage their own preferences in the **My Settings** page.  

Get an overview of all users in the **Users** list, and change individual settings by selecting the **User Settings** action for the relevant user.

> [!TIP]
> The **User Settings** list shows the current settings for each user. To view or edit individual users, select the **View** or **Edit** action.

The **User Settings** card page is similar to the **My Settings** page that each user has access to, and it's a powerful tool for you as the administrator for setting default settings and clearing personalized pages, for example.  

## Types of user settings

*User settings* isn't the same as *user setup*, which is about the user as an entity and the user's access in the system. Furthermore, the user settings have nothing to do with a user's personalization, such as lightweight changes to the user interface. User settings determine the predefined settings for each user in various aspects of the way the application presents itself to the user. The following paragraph lists the five types of user settings and preferences that can be set by the individual or centrally by the administrator:

* **Company**  

  This setting determines the company to be logged into at the next sign-in. A user can have access to multiple companies and can be active in several companies.

* **Role**  

  The role, or profile, describes the user's function in the company, such as *Sales Manager*, *Bookkeeper*, or *Purchasing Agent*. The profile then determines the user's role center, the home page that users experience when they sign in. The profile doesn't impact access rights to functionality in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

* **Language**  

  Defines the application language that [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] presents text, captions, and error messages in. If [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] users are synchronized from Microsoft 365, the language settings from Microsoft 365 are used, assuming that the user wants to use the same settings in Office products and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The administrator can change the default setting, and each user can choose between available languages in the My Settings page. But they'll be reset to the value from Microsoft 365 once the next synchronization is performed.

  If the language setting from Microsoft 365 matches a supported language in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], this language is chosen for the user.  

  > [!NOTE]
  > You may have to install a language app for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to properly display the language. Therefore, it's a good practice to install the necessary language apps before any user logs in the first time so that they have a good experience from their first day. For more information, see the list of [supported languages](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/compliance/apptest-countries-and-translations).  
  
* **Region**  

  Defines how dates and numbers are presented in the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] client, such as whether to use European or American date formats, or how to display the decimal sign and thousand separators in amounts. If [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] users are synchronized from Microsoft 365, the regional settings from Microsoft 365 are used, assuming that the user wants to use the same settings in Office products and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. An administrator or user can change these settings manually in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], but they'll be reset to the value from Microsoft 365 once the next synchronization is performed.

* **Time zone**  

  Defines the time zone in which the user is located. Currently this setting isn't synchronized from Microsoft 365 and must be set manually.  

* **Teaching tips**

  [!INCLUDE [ua-teachingtips](includes/ua-teachingtips.md)] As an administrator, you can switch off teaching tips for all users, such as if you are in process of onboarding users who are already familiar with [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

> [!NOTE]
> If a Microsoft 365 user synchronization is made while users are logged into [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], these users must refresh the browser or sign out and back in to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to see a potential different language set by the synchronization action.

## Overview of all user-specific changes

As the administrator, you can get an overview of individual changes to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] that each user might have made to various pages in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. As users make changes to their experience in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], these changes are reflected in the **Personalized Pages** list. <!--Administrators can also set these settings for users before they log in the first time, so users do not have to do it themselves, providing them a better *getting started* experience.-->

<!-- >[!NOTE]
> User personalizations do not have anything to do with the *personal* lightweight changes a user can make to the user experience.-->

## Review or delete user personalizations

1. Select the ![Search for Page or Report.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Personalized Pages**, and then select the related link.
2. This shows the list of users and their personalized pages. To clear a user's personalization, click the relevant row, or select **Manage**, and then select **Delete**.

This task deletes the personalization, and the user's experience of the relevant page returns to the default state.

# Pick for production, assembly, or projects in advanced warehouse configurations

How you pick components for production, projects, or assembly orders depend on how your warehouse is set up as a location. Learn more at [Setting Up Warehouse Management](warehouse-setup-warehouse.md).

In an advanced warehouse configuration for the outbound flow (pick), on the **Location Card** page for the location, use the following settings:

- Production, in the **Prod. Consumption Whse. Handling** field, select **Warehouse Pick (optional)** or **Warehouse Pick (mandatory)**.
- Assembly, in the **Asm. Consumption Whse. Handling** field, select **Warehouse Pick (optional)** or **Warehouse Pick (mandatory)**.
- Project management, in the **Project Consumption Whse. Handling** field, select **Warehouse Pick (optional)** or **Warehouse Pick (mandatory)**.

When the location is set up to require warehouse pick processing, use warehouse pick documents to create and process pick information before you post the usage or consumption of components.  

You can't create a warehouse pick document from scratch. Picks are part of a workflow where a person who is processing an order creates them in a push fashion, or the warehouse employee creates them in a pull fashion:

- In a push fashion, where you use the **Create Pick** action in the **Production Order**, **Assembly Order**, **Project Card** page. Select the lines to pick and prepare the picks by specifying, for example, which bins to take from and place in, and how many units to handle. Bins can be predefined for the warehouse location or resource.
- In a pull fashion, where you release **Production Order**, **Assembly Order**, **Project Card** to warehouse making the items available for picking. Then, on the **Pick Worksheet** page, warehouse employees can use the **Get Warehouse Documents** action to pull their assigned picks.

To pick or move components for source documents in a pull fashion, you must release the source document to make it ready for picking. Release source documents for internal operations in the following ways.  

|Source Document|Release Method|  
|---------------------|--------------------|  
|Production Order|Change the order status to Released or create a released production order right away.|  
|Assembly Order|Change status to Released.|
|Projects | Change status to Open or create project with status Open right away.|  

## Production

Use **Warehouse Pick** documents for picking production components in the flow to production.

For a location that uses bins to move items to open shop floor bins, you can use the following methods:

- For a location that uses directed put-away and pick, follow the steps in the [Move Items in advanced warehouse configurations](warehouse-how-to-move-items-in-advanced-warehousing.md) article.
- For other locations, follow the steps in the [Move Items Internally in Basic Warehouse Configurations](warehouse-how-to-move-items-ad-hoc-in-basic-warehousing.md) article.

### Over-picking in production

[!INCLUDE [manufacturing-overpicks](includes/manufacturing-overpicks.md)]

## Assembly  

Use **Warehouse Pick** documents to move assembly components to the assembly area.

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports assemble-to-stock and assemble-to-order types of assembly flows. To learn more about assemble-to-order in the outbound warehouse flow, go to [Handling Assemble-to-Order Items in Warehouse Shipments](warehouse-how-ship-items.md#handling-assemble-to-order-items-in-warehouse-shipments).

## Project management  

Use **Warehouse Pick** documents to pick project components in the flow to project management.

> [!NOTE]
> You can't use the **Project No.** and **Project Task No.** fields in a purchase order together with locations where the **Directed Put-Away and Pick** toggle is turned on. You must post receipts and consumption separately with the fully directed warehouse flow.

## Check whether items are available for picking

[!INCLUDE [inventory-availability-overview](includes/inventory-availability-overview.md)]

## To create pick documents in bulk with the pick worksheet

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Pick Worksheet**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **Get Warehouse Documents** action.  

    The list shows the released production, projects, and assembly orders that have been forwarded to the pick function. The orders include those for which pick instructions are already created. Documents with pick lines that have been picked and registered aren't shown on this list.  
3. Select the orders for which you want to prepare a pick.

    > [!NOTE]  
    > If you select a document that already has instructions for all its lines, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] informs you that there is nothing to handle. To combine the already created warehouse pick instructions into one pick instruction, delete the individual warehouse picks first.

4. Fill in the **Sorting Method** field to sort the lines the way you prefer.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > The way the lines are sorted in the worksheet doesn't automatically carry through to the pick instruction. However, the same sorting tools are available, along with bin ranking. You can easily recreate the order of the lines you plan in the worksheet when you create the pick instructions or by sorting in the pick instructions.

5. Fill in the **Qty. to Handle** field. Choose the **Autofill Qty.to Handle** action, or fill in the fields manually.  

    The page shows the quantities available in cross-dock bins, which is useful for planning work assignments in cross-docking situations. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will always propose a pick from a cross-dock bin first.

6. If needed, edit the lines manually. You can also delete some of the lines to make the pick more efficient. For example, if there are multiple lines with items that are in cross-dock bins, you might create a pick for all of the lines. The cross-docked items are picked with the other items on the source document, and the cross-dock bins have space for more incoming items.

    > [!NOTE]  
    > The lines are only deleted from this worksheet, not from the pick selection list.  

7. Choose the **Create Pick** action. The **Create Pick** page opens, where you can add more information to the pick.  

    Specify how to combine pick lines in the pick documents by selecting one of the following options.  

    |Option|Description|
    |-|-|
    |Per Whse. Document|Creates separate pick documents for worksheet lines with the same warehouse source document.|
    |Per Cust./Vend./Loc.|Creates separate pick documents for each customer (project)|
    |Per Item|Creates separate pick documents for each item in the pick worksheet.|
    |Per From Zone|Creates separate pick documents for each zone that you take the items from.|
    |Per Bin|Creates separate pick documents for each bin that you take the items from.|
    |Per Due Date|Creates separate pick documents for source documents that have the same due date.|

    Use the following options to specify how to create the pick documents.  

    |Option|Description|
    |-|-|
    |Max. No. of Pick Lines|Creates pick documents that have no more than the specified number of lines in each document.|
    |Max. No. of Pick Source Docs.|Creates pick documents that cover up to the specified number of source documents.|
    |Assigned User ID|Creates pick documents only for worksheet lines that are assigned to the selected warehouse employee.|
    |Sorting Method for Pick Lines|Select from the available options to sort lines in the created pick document.|
    |Set Breakbulk Filter|Hides intermediate breakbulk pick lines when a larger unit of measure is converted to a smaller unit of measure and picked.|
    |Don't Fill Qty. to Handle|Leaves the **Qty. to Handle** field empty on the created pick lines.|
    |Print Pick|Prints the pick documents when they're created. You can also print from the created pick documents.|

8. Choose the **OK** button.  

## To pick items for a production order, assembly order, or project

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Picks**, and then choose the related link.  

    If you need to work on a particular pick, select the pick from the list or filter the list to find the picks that have been assigned to you. Open the pick card.  
2. If the **Assigned User ID** field is empty, enter your ID to identify yourself, if needed.  
3. Pick the items.  

    If the warehouse is set up to use bins, the items’ default bins are used to suggest where to take the items from. The instructions contain at least two separate lines for Take and Place actions.  

    Operation areas such as production shop floors might have a default bin for the components they require. If so, the default bin code is added to the warehouse pick document to indicate where to put the items. For more information, see the tooltips for the **To-Production Bin Code**, the **To-Assembly Bin Code**, the **To-Project Bin Code** fields.

    If the warehouse is set up to use directed put-away and pick, the bin rankings are used to calculate the best bins to pick from. Those bins are suggested on the pick lines. The instructions contain at least two separate lines for Take and Place actions.  

    - The first line, with **Take** in the **Action Type** field, indicates where the items are located in the picking area. If you're shipping a large number of items on one shipment line, you might have to pick the items in several bins, so there's a Take line for each bin.
    - The next line, with **Place** in the **Action Type** field, shows where you must place the items in the warehouse. You can't change the zone and bin on this line.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you must pick or place the items for one line in more than one bin, for example because the designated bin is full, use the **Split Line** action on the **Lines** FastTab. The action creates a line for the remaining quantity to handle.

      You can sort the pick lines by various criteria, for example, by item, shelf number, or due date. Sorting can help optimize the put-away process, for example:

    - If the take and place lines for each shipment line don't immediately follow one another, and you want them to, sort the lines by selecting **Item** in the **Sorting Method** field.  
    - If bin rankings reflect the physical layout of the warehouse, use the **Bin Ranking** sorting method to organize the work by bin locations.

  > [!NOTE]  
  > Lines are sorted in ascending order by the selected criteria. If you sort by document, sorting is done first by document type based on the **Warehouse Activity Source Document** field. If you sort by ship-to, sorting is done first by destination type based on the **Warehouse Destination Type** field.

4. After you pick and place the items in the production, assembly or project area or bin, choose the **Register Pick** action.  

    You can now bring the items to the respective area and post the usage or consumption of the picked components by posting consumption journal, assembly order, or project journal. The following articles provide more information:

    - [Register Consumption and Output for One Released Production order line](production-how-to-register-consumption-and-output.md)
    - [Assemble Items](assembly-how-to-assemble-items.md)
    - [Record Consumption or Usage for Projects](projects-how-record-job-usage.md)

## Flushing production components in an advanced warehouse configuration

Flushing methods affect the flow of components in production. Learn more at [Flush Components According to Operation Output](production-how-to-flush-components-according-to-operation-output.md). Depending on the selected flushing method, you can pick components for production om the following ways:

* Use a **Warehouse Pick** document to record the pick for items that use the **Pick + Manual** flushing method. You need to register consumption separately. Learn more at [Batch Post Production Consumption](production-how-to-post-consumption.md).
* Use a **Warehouse Pick** document to record the pick for items that use the **Pick + Forward**, **Pick + Backward** flushing method. Consumption of the components happens automatically either when you change the status of the production order or by starting or ending an operation. All required components must be available. Otherwise, posting flushed consumption stop for that component.
* Use a **Warehouse Movement** document without a reference to a source document or other ways to record the movement of components that use the **Forward** or **Backward** flushing method. Components are automatically consumed either when you change of status of the production order or start or end an operation. All required components must be available. Otherwise, posting flushed consumption stops for that component. Learn more at [Move Items](warehouse-move-items.md).
* Use a **Warehouse Movement** document without a reference to a source document or other ways to record the movement of components that use the Manual flushing method. You need to register consumption separately. For example, skipping the pick might be useful for components which, due to their nature, you store in the shop floor zone so there's no need to pick. However, you might still have to manually post consumption, for example, because the consumed quantity can vary or require item tracking. To learn more, go to [Flushing methods](production-how-to-flush-components-according-to-operation-output.md#flushing-methods).

### Example

You have a production order for 15 PCS of item SP-SCM1004. Some of the items on the component list must be flushed manually in a consumption journal. Other items can be picked and flushed automatically using the **Pick + Backward** flushing method.  

The following steps describe the actions that different people take and the related response:  

1. The shop floor supervisor releases the production order. Items with **Forward** flushing method and no routing link are deducted from the open shop floor bin.  
2. The shop floor supervisor chooses the **Create Warehouse Pick** action on the production order. A warehouse pick document is created pick for items with **Manual**, **Pick + Backward**, and **Pick + Forward** flushing methods. These items are placed in the To-Production bin.  
3. The warehouse manager assigns the picks to a warehouse employee.  
4. The warehouse employee picks the items from the appropriate bins and places them in the To-Production bin or in the bin specified on the warehouse pick. The bin might be a work center or machine center bin.
5. The warehouse employee registers the pick. The quantity is transferred from the pick bin to the consumption bin. The **Qty. Picked** field on the component list for all picked items is updated.

    > [!NOTE]  
    > Only the quantity picked can be consumed.  
6. The machine operator informs the production manager that the end items are finished.
7. The shop floor supervisor uses the consumption journal or production journal to post the consumption of component items that use either **Manual** flushing method.
8. The shop floor supervisor uses the output journal or production journal to post the output. The quantity of component items that use **Pick + Forward** or **Pick + Backward** flushing methods with routing links is deducted from the To-Production bin.
9. The production manager changes the status of the production order to **Finished**. The quantity of component items that use **Backward** flushing method is deducted from the open shop floor bin, and the quantity of component items that use **Pick + Backward** flushing method and no routing link is deducted from the To-Production bin.  

The following illustration shows when the **Bin Code** field on the component list is filled according to your location or machine/work center setup.  

:::image type="content" source="media/binflow.png" alt-text="Overview of when and how the Bin Code field is filled in.":::

## Make-to-Order (MTO) production components in an advanced warehouse configuration

In scenarios where a produced item consists of raw materials and semi-finished items with the manufacturing policy set to **Make-to-order**, the warehouse pick for those semi-finished components is added to the same production order with the **Planning Level Code** field filled in. It's expected that the semi-finished items are available for consumption immediately and won't require pick so they aren't included in the warehouse pick document. The created warehouse picks only include raw materials for produced item and for semi-finished items.

However, if semi-finished items are available on stock, the planning system suggests that you consume those instead of producing the whole quantity. For example, a produced item requires five semi-finished components, but three are already in stock. In this case, five semi-finished items are listed in the production order components, but only two are produced in the same production order as a separate production order line.
Such a setup isn't compatible with warehouse picks and, depending on frequency, you must either change the manufacturing policy for such semi-finished items to **Make-to-stock** or manually split the production order component line when you need to pick the semi-finished items produced earlier.

# Autofill fields with Copilot (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]

Copilot's autofill feature assists you by automatically filling in editable blank fields on your page. Use autofill when creating or modifying a record. It suggests field values that you can choose to keep or discard. These suggestions are based on your Business Central data, such as frequently or recently used values, or they can be AI-generated based on option values, lookup values, or page context.

When Copilot generates suggestions, it only accesses the business data you can access. Copilot never saves suggestions automatically but presents them for you to decide what to keep. Copilot uses AI, and suggestions might not be correct.

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-note-d365.md)]

<!--[!INCLUDE [preview-note](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/production-ready-preview-dynamics365.md)]-->

<!--Suggestions are based on Business Central that only you have access to.-->

## Prerequisites

Autofill is activated, and you have the required permissions to use it. Learn more in [Configure Copilot and agent capabilities](enable-ai.md).

## Supported languages

[!INCLUDE[copilot-language-support-en-only](includes/copilot-language-support-en-only.md)]

## Availability

### Where the autofill feature is available

The autofill feature is available on card and document pages, like a **Customer card** or a **Sales Order**, and only on editable fields in FastTabs on these pages, except for the fields listed in the following section.

> [!NOTE]  
> Autofill works on editable fields in FastTabs added to card and document pages by add-on apps (extensions).

### Where the autofill feature isn't available

The autofill feature isn't available on these types of pages:

- List pages like **Customers** and **Sales Orders**.
- Worksheet pages like the **Put-away Worksheet**.
- Setup pages, like **Company information** and **General Ledger Setup**, and assisted setup pages, like **Set up sales tax** and **Set up outgoing email**.
- Task dialogs.

The autofill feature isn't available on these fields regardless of the page type:

- Noneditable fields.
- Fields in the FactBox pane.
- Fields in rows and columns.
- Multiline text fields.
- Masked fields like passwords and secrets.
- Date and time fields.
- Toggle switches.
- Fields that uniquely identify a record like IDs and numbers from a series.
- Certain fields depending on your country/region. For example, Copilot can't make suggestions for address fields until web search powered by Bing is available in your country/region.

## Use autofill on fields

Open the page for editing, select a field, and then select the ![Shows the Copilot icon for generating suggestions for field values.](media/copilot-star-unfilled.png) **Suggest a value for this field and related fields** icon or press <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>i</kbd>. If the icon doesn't appear, autofill isn't available for the field, so try another field.

![Shows a card page with a Copilot icon for generating suggestions for field values.](media/autofill-field.svg)

Suggestions are generated only for fields in the FastTab that you are on. When Copilot finds suggestions, they're automatically entered in the fields in italics along with the ![Shows the details icon for a suggestion](media/autofill-info.png) **Show details** icon. Fields remain unchanged if suggestions aren't found or they don't support the autofill feature.

![Shows a suggested field with the accept and discard buttons.](media/autofill-suggested-value-field.svg)

When you hover over or select a field that includes a suggestion, the ![Shows the accept button for a Copilot suggestion](media/autofill-accept.png) **Accept the suggestion** and ![Shows the discard button for a Copilot suggestion](media/autofill-discard.png) **Discard the suggestion** buttons appear.

### Review suggestions

Review the suggestion for each field and take appropriate action. Suggestions aren't saved until you accept them.

- To learn more about a suggestion, select the ![Shows the details icon for a suggestion](media/autofill-info.png) **Show details** icon next to the field, or press <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>i</kbd>. The details include the source of the suggestion, like the most frequently or recently used value. Use the thumbs-up and thumbs-down icons to give feedback.
- To keep a suggestion, select ![Shows the accept button for a Copilot suggestion](media/autofill-accept.png) **Accept the suggestion** or press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.
- To reject a suggestion and keep the original value, select ![Shows the discard button for a Copilot suggestion](media/autofill-discard.png) **Discard the suggestion** or press <kbd>Delete</kbd>.
- To change a suggestion, select **Change** in the details or press <kbd>F2</kbd>.

You can also use the **Keep all** button in the upper right corner of the page to accept or discard suggestions on all fields.

When you leave the page while there are unaccepted suggestions, Copilot asks you to accept or discard suggestions first.

<!--The first time you use Copilot, you're asked to accept the terms to continue.-->

## Autofill behavior with other data-entry features

Business Central offers many other features that reduce data entry, such as customer templates and business process settings that default values. On some pages, for example, when you specify the value for a field, Business Central validates and automatically sets related fields, like zip code and country. Unlike Copilot, these features don't use AI, and values are saved immediately.

When Copilot suggests a field value and you use any feature that saves a value to the same field, Copilot's suggestion is always discarded in favor of the value set by Business Central.

# Define an invoice posting policy for users

Companies often have unique processes for posting sales and purchase invoices and shipments. For example, processes can vary from one person posting everything on a purchase order, to multiple employees. You can restrict users from posting invoices, or require that invoices are posted together with shipments or receipts.

## To specify a posting policy

On the **User Setup** page, in the **Sales Invoice Posting Policy** and **Purch. Invoice Posting Policy** fields, choose one of the following options:

* **Allowed** (Default) - Keep the current behavior, where a user can choose the posting option to use, such as **Ship**, **Invoice**, and **Ship and Invoice**. 
* **Prohibited** - Prevent the user from posting invoices. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] shows a confirmation dialog that provides only the **Ship** or **Receive** options.
* **Mandatory** - Allow the user to post invoices together with receipts or shipments. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] shows a confirmation dialog with the **Ship and Invoice** or **Receive and Invoice** options.

## Effect on documents

The following table describes how invoice posting policies affect documents.

> [!NOTE]
> When you post sales and purchase invoices and credit memos, you don't have any posting options. The documents always post the physical and financial transactions together. You can't partially post invoices and credit memos.

|Document | Option 1: Allow <br>Displays a series of options| Option 2: Prohibited <br>Confirmation dialog | Option 3: Mandatory <br>Confirmation dialog|
|--|--|--|--|
|Sales order |- Ship <br>- Invoice <br>- Ship and Invoice |Do you want to post the shipment? |Do you want to post the shipment and invoice?|
|Sales invoice|No options| Posting is prohibited per User Setup|Do you want to post the invoice?|
|Sales credit memo|No options|Posting is prohibited per User Setup|Do you want to post the credit memo?|
|Sales return order |- Receive <br>- Invoice <br>- Receive and Invoice |Do you want to post the receipt? |Do you want to post the receipt and invoice?|
|Inventory pick |- Ship <br>- Ship and Invoice |Do you want to post the shipment? |Do you want to post the shipment and invoice?|
|Purchase order |- Receive <br>- Invoice <br>- Receive and Invoice |Do you want to post the receipt? |Do you want to post the receipt and invoice?|
|Purchase invoice|No options|Posting is prohibited per User Setup|Do you want to post the invoice?|
|Purchase credit memo|No options|Posting is prohibited per User Setup|Do you want to post the credit memo?|
|Purchase Return Order |- Ship <br>- Invoice <br>- Ship and Invoice |Do you want to post the shipment? |Do you want to post the shipment and invoice?|
|Inventory Put-away |- Receive <br>- Receive and Invoice |Do you want to post the receipt? |Do you want to post the receipt and invoice?|
|Warehouse Shipment |- Ship <br>- Ship and Invoice | Do you want to post the shipment? |Do you want to post the shipment and invoice?|

   > [!Note]
   > The setting doesn't affect posting of general journal lines where you can select **Invoice** in the **Document Type** field.

# Adding Contacts to Segments
After you have created a segment and entered basic information about it, you may want to add contacts to the segment. You can do this by filling in the lines on the **Segment** page manually, but it is easier and faster to use the **Add Contacts** action.

## To add a contact to a segment
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Segments**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the segment, and then choose the **Add Contacts** action. The **Add Contacts** batch job page opens.
3. In the **Contact** section, set filters to specify the information by which you want to select contacts.

To enter additional filters, repeat this procedure on each of the remaining sections, and then choose the **OK** button.

If you have added contacts by mistake and want to go back one step, then choose the **Go Back** action.

## To refine the number of contacts
After you have selected the contacts within a segment, you may decide to remove some but keep others. You can manually remove contacts from the lines on the **Segment** page, but it is easier and faster to use the **Refine Contacts** action.

1. Open the segment.
2. Choose **Contacts**, and then choose the **Refine Contacts** action. The **Remove Contacts - Refine** page opens.
3. In the **Contact** section, enter filters to specify the information that you want to use to select the contacts to be removed from the segment.
4. Add additional filters as needed, and then choose the **OK** button.

You can refine a segment as many times as you want. If you have refined the segment by mistake and want to go one step back, choose the **Go Back**.

To see a list of the segment criteria that you have used, in the **General** section, choose the **No. of Criteria Actions** field.

## To reduce the number of contacts
After you have selected the contacts within a segment, you may want to remove some of them. You can do this by manually removing them from the lines in the Segment page, but it is easier and faster to use the Reduce Contacts function to specify which contacts to remove, and to use the Refine Contacts function to specify which contacts to keep.

1. Open the segment.
2. Choose Contacts, and then choose the **Reduce Contacts** action. The **Remove Contacts - Reduce** page opens.
3. In the **Contact** section, enter filters to specify the information that you want to use to select the contacts to be removed from the segment.
4. Add additional filters as needed, and then choose the **OK** button.

You can reduce a segment as many times as you want. If you have refined the segment by mistake and want to go one step back, then choose the **Go Back** action.

# Remove and reapply item ledger entries
On the **Application Worksheet** page, you can view and manually change certain item application entries that are created automatically during inventory transactions.  

When you post a transaction where items are moved in or out of inventory, an item application is created between each inventory increase and inventory decrease. These applications determine the flow of costs from the goods that are received in inventory to the cost of goods going out of inventory. Because of the way the unit cost is calculated, an incorrect item application could lead to a skewed average cost and a skewed unit cost. For more information, see Design Details: Item Application.

The following scenarios might require that you undo an application or reapply item ledger entries:

- You have forgotten to make a fixed application.
- You have made an incorrect fixed application.
- You have to return an item to which a sale has already been applied.

If possible, use a document to reapply an item ledger entry. For example, if you must make a purchase return of an item to which a sale has already been applied, you can reapply by creating and posting the purchase return document by using the correct application in the **Appl.-to Item Entry** field on the purchase return line. You can use the **Get Posted Document Lines to Reverse** function or the **Copy from Document** function in the purchase return document to make this easier. When you post the document, the item ledger entry is automatically reapplied. For more information, see [Process Purchase Returns or Cancellations](purchasing-how-process-purchase-returns-cancellations.md).

If you can't use a document to reapply, such as when you have to correct a fixed application, then use the **Application Worksheet** page to correct an application.

> [!Warning]  
> The following are important considerations to remember when you are working with the application worksheet:
    - You should not leave application entries unapplied for long periods of time because other users cannot process the items until you reapply the application entries or close the **Application Worksheet** page. Users who try to perform actions that involve a manually unapplied application entry receive the following error message: “You cannot perform this action because entries for item XXX are unapplied in the Application Worksheet by user XXX.”
    - You should only reapply item ledger entries during nonworking hours to avoid conflicts with other users who are posting transactions with the same items.
    - When you close the application worksheet, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] performs a check to make sure that all entries are applied. For example, if you remove a quantity application but do not create a new application, and then you close the application worksheet, a new application is created. This helps keep the cost intact. However, if you remove a fixed application, a new fixed application is not automatically created when you close the worksheet. You must do this manually by creating a new application in the worksheet.
    - It is possible to remove applications from more than one entry at a time in the application worksheet. However, because applying entries affects the set of entries that are available for application, you cannot create an application for more than one entry at a time.
    - The application worksheet cannot make an application in the following situation: If there is not enough quantity on stock to apply, the application worksheet cannot make an application when you are trying to apply an inventory decrease entry without item tracking information to an inventory increase entry with item tracking information.

## To remove an item application by using the Application Worksheet

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Application Worksheet**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  The **Application Worksheet** page opens displaying existing item ledger entries for all items.  
3.  Enter filters on the **General** FastTab to make it easier to find the item ledger entry for which you want to change the application.  
4.  Select the item ledger entry, and then choose the **Applied Entries** action. The **View Applied Entries – Applied Entries** page opens to show the item ledger entry or entries that are currently applied to the selected entry.  
5.  Select the item ledger entry for which you want to remove the application.  
6.  Choose the **Remove Application** action. This removes the item application entry that links the two item ledger entries and moves it to the **View Applied Entries – Unapplied Entries** page.  
7.  Close the **View Applied Entries – Applied Entries** page.  

 The **Remaining Quantity** field of the two item ledger entries is increased by the quantity that has been unapplied. The removed item ledger entry is now available for reapplication on the **View Applied Entries – Unapplied Entries** page.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  You should not leave application entries unapplied for longer periods of time because other users cannot process the affected items until you reapply the application entries or close the **Application Worksheet** page. The following error message is displayed if you try to perform actions that involve a manually unapplied application entry:  
>   
>  **You cannot perform this action because entries for item \<item\> are unapplied in the Application Worksheet by user \<user\>.**  

## To reapply an item application by using the Application Worksheet

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 2.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Application Worksheet**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  The **Application Worksheet** page opens displaying existing item ledger entries for all items.  
3.  To reapply entries that were removed since the worksheet was opened, select the item ledger entry that you want to reapply, and then choose the **Reapply** action.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  This reapplication to the original balance also occurs automatically when you close the **Application Worksheet** page.  
4.  To apply an available open item ledger entry to another entry, select the item ledger entry that you want to apply. Choose the **Unapplied Entries** action. The **View Applied Entries – Unapplied Entries** page opens.  
5.  Select one or more item ledger entries that you want to apply to the entry selected on the **Application Worksheet** page, and then choose the **OK** button.  

     An item application entry is created between the two item ledger entries. The **Remaining Quantity** fields of the two entries are reduced by the applied quantity.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  If you have chosen to make an application that would create an infinite loop in the cost adjustment process, then the application that you proposed is not made. This can occur when the original entries created negative stock. The application is not made. Therefore, you must select a different entry for the application.  
6.  If the **Automatic Cost Adjustment** field in the **Inventory Setup** is set to **Always**, then the cost adjustment batch job is automatically run after you make a reapplication. Otherwise, run the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job to make sure that all costs are up to date.

# Item Availability (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Item Availability** report gives an overview of the availability of each item in terms of supply and demand. Use the report to identify items where demand exceeds supply, so you can take action to avoid delayed orders.

# Work with bills of material

You use bills of materials (BOMs) to structure parent items that must be assembled from other items or produced by resources or machine centers from components.

## Assembly BOMs or production BOMs

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports two different types of BOMs:

| BOM type | General category | Example |
| -------- | ---------------- | ------- |
| [Assembly BOMs](assembly-how-work-assembly-boms.md) | Warehouse / assembly | Items that consist of other items, assembled with basic or no resources. |
| [Production BOMs](production-how-to-create-production-boms.md) | Manufacturing / production | Items that consist of different components and subassemblies, produced at a work or machine center. |

You use assembly orders for making end items from components in a simple process that can be performed by one or more basic resources, which aren't machine or work centers, or without any resources. For example, an assembly process could be to pick two wine bottles and one coffee sack and then pack them as a gift item.  

An assembly BOM is the master data that defines which component items go into an assembled end item and which resources are used to assemble the assembly item. When you enter an assembly item and a quantity in the header of a new assembly order, the assembly order lines automatically fil in according to the assembly BOM with one assembly order line per component or resource. Learn more at [Assembly Management](assembly-assemble-items.md).

You use production orders for making end items from components in a complex process that requires a production routing and work or machine centers, which represent production capacities. For example, a production process could be to cut steel plates in one operation, weld them in the next operation, and paint the end item in the last operation. Learn more at [Manufacturing](production-manage-manufacturing.md).

A production BOM is the master data that defines a production item and the components that go into it. For assembly items, the production BOM must be certified and assigned to the production item before it can be used in a production order. When you enter the production item on a production order line, either manually or by refreshing the order, then the production BOM content becomes the production order components. Learn more at [Create Production BOMs](production-how-to-create-production-boms.md).

The concept of resources in production is much more advanced than in assembly management. Work centers and machine centers act as resources. The operations assigned to resources in production routings represent production steps. Learn more at the [Create Routings](production-how-to-create-routings.md) article.

Both assembly orders and production orders might be linked directly to sales orders. However, you can only use assembly orders to customize the end item directly for a customer request with the sales order.

# Work with VAT on sales and purchases

If your country or region requires you to calculate and report value-added tax (VAT) on sales and purchase transactions, you can set up [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to calculate VAT. For more information, see [Setting Up to Calculations and Posting Methods for Value-Added Tax](finance-setup-vat.md).

There are, however, some VAT-related tasks that you can do manually. For example, you might need to correct a posted amount if you discover that a vendor uses a different rounding method.  

> [!TIP]
> You can let [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] validate VAT registration numbers and other company information when you create or update documents. For more information, see [Validate VAT Registration Numbers](finance-how-validate-vat-registration-number.md).

## Calculating and displaying VAT amounts on sales and purchase documents  

When you choose an item number in the **No.** field on a sales or purchase document, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] fills in the **Unit Price** and **Line Amount** fields. The unit price comes from either the **Item** card or the item prices allowed for the item and customer. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates the line amount when you enter a quantity for the line.  

If you want the unit prices and line amounts to include VAT, for example, if you sell to retail consumers, choose the **Prices Including VAT** check box on the document. For more information, see [Including or Excluding VAT in Prices and Line Amounts](#including-or-excluding-vat-in-prices-and-line-amounts). 

You can calculate and display VAT amounts in sales and purchase documents differently. The difference depends on the type of customer or vendor you're dealing with. You can also change the calculated VAT amount manually, for example, so that it matches the VAT amount calculated by your vendor on a given transaction.

### Including or excluding VAT in prices and line amounts

If you choose the **Prices Including VAT** checkbox on a sales document, the **Unit Price** and **Line Amount** fields include VAT. By default, the values in these fields don't include VAT. The names of the fields reflect whether prices include VAT.  

You can set up the default setting of the **Prices Including VAT** for all sales documents for a customer in the **Prices Including VAT** field on the **Customer** card. You can also set up item prices to include or exclude VAT. Typically, prices on the Item Card exclude VAT.

The following table provides an overview of how the application calculates the unit price amounts for a sales document when prices aren't set up on the **Sales Prices** page:  

|**Price Includes VAT field on Item Card**|**Prices Including VAT field**|**Action Performed**|  
|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|  
|Not Enabled|Not Enabled|The **Unit Price** on the Item Card is copied to **Unit Price Excl. VAT** field on the sales lines.|  
|Not Enabled|Enabled|The application calculates the VAT amount per unit and adds to the **Unit Price** on the Item Card. This total unit price is then entered in the **Unit Price Incl. VAT field** on the sales lines.|  
|Enabled|Not Enabled|The application calculates the VAT amount included in the **Unit Price** field on the **Item Card** using the VAT percentage related to the VAT Bus. Posting Gr. (Price) and the VAT Prod. Posting Group combination. The **Unit Price** on the Item Card, reduced by the VAT amount, is then entered in the **Unit Price Excl. VAT** field in the sales lines. For more information, see [Using VAT Business Posting Groups and Customer Price Groups](finance-work-with-vat.md#using-vat-business-posting-groups-and-customer-price-groups).|  
|Enabled|Enabled|The **Unit Price** on the Item Card is copied to **Unit Price Incl. VAT** field on the sales lines.|

#### Using VAT business posting groups and customer price groups 

If you want prices to include VAT, you can use VAT business posting groups to calculate the amount based on the VAT posting setup for the group. For more information, see [Set up VAT business posting groups](finance-setup-vat.md#set-up-vat-business-posting-groups).

Depending on what you want to do, you can assign a VAT business posting group to customers or sales documents in the following ways:

* To use the same VAT rate for all customers, you can choose a group in the **VAT Business Posting Group (Price)** field on the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page.
* To use a VAT rate for a specific customer, you can choose a group in the **VAT Business Posting Group (Price)** field on the **Customer Card** page. 
* To use a VAT rate for a specific of customers, you can choose a group in the **VAT Business Posting Group (Price)** field on the **Customer Price Group** page. For example, this setting is useful when you want a price to apply to all customers in a certain geographical region or a specific industry.
* On all sales documents, in the **VAT Business Posting Group** field. The VAT amount specified for the group is used only for the document you're currently working on.

> [!NOTE]
> If you do not specify a group in the **VAT Business Posting Group (Price)** field VAT will not be included in prices.

#### Examples

Factors such as the country or region you're selling in, or the type of industries you sell to, can affect the amount of VAT that you must account for. For example, a restaurant might charge 6% VAT for meals that are eaten in-house, and 17% for takeaway. To accomplish that, you create a VAT business posting group (price) for in-house and one for takeaway.

## Working with VAT Date

### VAT Date in documents

When you create new sales or purchase documents, the **VAT Date** is based on the setting in the **Default VAT Date** field on the **General Ledger Setup** page. This default value can be the same as **Posting Date** or **Document Date**. If you need a different VAT date, you can manually change the value in the **VAT Date** field. When you post the document, the **VAT Date** is shown on the posting document and on the VAT and G/L entries.

> [!NOTE]
> If the **VAT Date** field isn't available on your documents or journals, that means that **Do not use VAT Date functionality** is chosen in the **VAT Date Usage** field on the **General Ledger Setup** page.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you configure **Control VAT Period** in the **General Ledger Setup** as **Block posting within closed period**, or **Block posting within closed and warn for released period**, you can post document or journal only if the date in the **VAT Date** field is not in a closed period in **VAT Return Periods**. Even if the period in **VAT Return Periods** is open, you might get a warning based on the **VAT Return Status** and configuration in the **Control VAT Period**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Starting in version 23.1, you can prevent or allow posting of the **VAT Date** for specific data range, using the **Allow VAT Date From** and **Allow VAT Date To** fields in the **VAT Setup** and the **User Setup**. If you are using older versions, you can prevent or allow posting of the **VAT Date** for specific data range, using the **Allow Posting From** and **Allow Posting To** fields in the **General Ledger Setup** and the **User Setup**.  

> [!NOTE]
> If you leave the **VAT Date** blank, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will use your default setup from **Default VAT Date** in the **General Ledger Setup** as a **VAT Date** in the posted transaction.  

### Modifying the VAT Date in posted entries

If needed, you can change the VAT date posted documents. To change the date in the **VAT Date** field for posted documents, follow these steps:

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Entries**, and then choose the related link. 
2. Find the entry with wrong VAT date.  
3. Choose the **Edit list** action, and then enter the correct date in the **VAT Date** field.  
4. When you close the page, the VAT date changes in related **G/L Entries** and in the posted document.  

> [!NOTE]
> You can change the **VAT Date** field in **VAT Entries** only if your current date is not in a closed VAT return period. Even if the period in the **VAT Return Periods** field is open, you might get a warning based on the **VAT Return Status**.  

> [!NOTE]
> If your document has more than one **VAT Entry**, you only need to change the value in the **VAT Date** field in one entry related to the document. To keep entries consistent, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically changes the VAT date in VAT entries related to this transaction. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will update the **VAT Date** in other tables (GL Entries and documents), but only related to this transaction.  

## Correcting VAT amounts manually on sales and purchase documents  

You can make corrections to posted VAT entries so that you can change the total sales or purchase VAT amounts without changing the VAT base. For example, if you receive an invoice from a vendor with an incorrect VAT amount.  

Although you might have one or more combinations set up to handle import VAT, you must set up at least one VAT product posting group. For example, you can name it **CORRECT** for correction purposes, unless you can use the same general ledger account in the **Purchase VAT Account** field on the VAT posting setup line. For more information, see [Setting Up to Calculations and Posting Methods for Value-Added Tax](finance-setup-vat.md).

If a payment discount was calculated based on an invoice amount that includes VAT, you revert the payment discount part of the VAT amount when you grant the payment discount. You must activate the **Adjust for Payments Disc.** field in both the general ledger setup in general and the VAT posting setup for specific combinations of a VAT business posting group and a VAT product posting group.  

### To set the system up for manual VAT entry in sales documents

To enable manual VAT changes on sales documents, follow these steps. The steps are similar on the **Purchases & Payables Setup** page.

1. On the **General Ledger Setup** page, specify a **Max. VAT Difference Allowed** between the amount calculated by application and the manual amount.  
2. On the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page, turn on the **Allow Vat Difference** toggle.  

### To adjust VAT for a sales document

1. Open the relevant sales order.  
2. Choose the **Statistics** action.  
3. On the **Invoicing** FastTab, choose the value in the **No. of Tax Lines** field.
4. Edit the **VAT Amount** field.   

> [!NOTE]  
> The total VAT amount for the invoice, grouped by VAT identifier, is displayed in the lines. You can manually adjust the amount in the **VAT Amount** field on the lines for each VAT identifier. When you modify the **VAT Amount** field, application checks to ensure that you have not changed the VAT by more than the amount you have specified as the maximum difference allowed. If the amount is outside the range of the **Max. VAT Difference Allowed**, a warning will be displayed stating the maximum allowed difference. You will be unable to proceed until the amount is adjusted to within the acceptable parameters. Click **OK** and enter another **VAT Amount** that is within the allowed range. If the VAT difference is equal to or lower than the maximum allowed, the VAT will be divided proportionally among the document lines that have the same VAT identifier.  

## Calculating VAT manually using journals  

You can also adjust VAT amounts in general, sales, and purchase journals. For example, you might need an adjustment if you enter a vendor invoice in your journal and the VAT amount that [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculated and the VAT amount on the vendor's invoice differ.  

### To set the system up for manual VAT entry in general journals

You must perform the following steps before you manually enter VAT in a general journal.  

1. On the **General Ledger Setup** page, specify a **Max. VAT Difference Allowed** between the amount calculated by application and the manual amount.  
2. On the **General Journal Templates** page, choose the **Allow VAT Difference** check box for the relevant journal.  

### To set the system up for manual VAT entry in a sales and purchase journals

You must perform the following steps before you manually enter VAT in a sales or purchase journal.

1. On the **Purchases & Payables Setup** page, choose the **Allow VAT Difference** check box.  
2. Repeat step 1 for the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page.
3. After you complete the setup, you can adjust the **VAT Amount** field on the general journal line, or the **Bal. VAT Amount** field on the sales or purchase journal line. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] verifies that the difference isn't greater than the specified maximum.  

> [!NOTE]  
> If the difference is greater, a warning will be displayed stating the maximum allowed difference. To continue, you must adjust the amount. Choose **OK** and then enter an amount that is within the allowed range. If the VAT difference is equal to or lower than the maximum allowed, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will show the difference in the **VAT Difference** field.  

## Posting Import VAT with Purchase Invoices
Instead of using journals to post an import VAT invoice, you can use a purchase invoice.  

### To set up purchasing for posting import VAT invoices

1. Set up a vendor card for the import authority that sends you the import VAT invoice. The **Gen. Bus. Posting Group** and **VAT Bus. Posting Group** must be set up in the same way as the general ledger account for the import VAT.  
2. Create a **Gen. Product Posting Group** for the import VAT and set up an import VAT **Def. VAT Product Posting Group** for the related **Gen. Product Posting Group**.  
3. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Chart of Accounts**, and then choose the related link.  
4. Select the import VAT general ledger account, and then choose the **Edit** action.  
5. On the **Posting** FastTab, select the **Gen. Prod. Posting Group** setup for import VAT. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically fills in the **VAT Prod. Posting Group** field.  
6. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Posting Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
7. Create a combination of the **Gen. Bus. Posting Group** for the VAT authority and the **Gen. Prod. Posting Group** for import VAT. For this combination, in the **Purchase Account** field, choose the import VAT general ledger account.  

### To create a new invoice for the import authority vendor after you complete the setup  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Invoices**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Create a new purchase invoice.  
3. In the **Buy-from Vendor No.** field, choose the import authority vendor, and then choose the **OK** button.  
4. In the purchase line, in the **Type** field, choose **G/L Account**, and in the **No.** field, choose the import VAT general ledger account.  
5. In the **Quantity** field, type **1**.  
6. In the **Direct Unit Cost Excl. VAT** field, specify the VAT amount.  
7. Post the invoice.  

## Processing certificates of supply

When you sell goods to a customer in another EU country/region, you must send the customer a certificate of supply that the customer must sign and return to you. The following procedures are for processing certificates of supply for sales shipments, but the same steps apply for service shipments of items, and return shipments to vendors.  

### To view certificate of supply details  
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Posted Sales Shipments**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the relevant sales shipment to a customer in another EU country/region.  
3. Choose **Certificate of Supply Details**.  
4. By default, if the **Certificate of Supply Required** check box is selected for VAT Posting Group setup for the customer, the **Status** field is set to **Required**. You can update the field to indicate whether the customer returned the certificate.  

> [!Note]  
>  If the VAT Posting Group setup does not have the **Certificate of Supply Required** check box selected, then a record is created and the **Status** field is set to **Not Applicable**. You can update the field to reflect the correct status information. You can manually change the status from **Not Applicable** to **Required**, and from **Required** to **Not Applicable** as needed.  

   When you update the **Status** field to **Required**, **Received**, or **Not Received**, a certificate is created.  

> [!TIP]  
>  You can use the **Certificates of Supply** page to get a view of the status of all posted shipments for which a certificate of supply has been created.  

5. Choose **Print Certificate of Supply**.  

> [!Note]  
> You can preview or print the document. When you choose **Print Certificate of Supply** and print the document, the **Printed** check box is automatically selected. In addition, if not already specified, the status of the certificate is updated to **Required**. If needed, you include the printed certificate with the shipment.  

### To print a certificate of supply

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Posted Sales Shipments**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the relevant sales shipment to a customer in another EU country/region.  
3. Choose the **Print Certificate of Supply** action.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Alternatively, you can print a certificate from the **Certificate of Supply** page.  

4. To include information from the lines on the shipment document in the certificate, turn on the **Print Line Details** toggle.  
5. To have [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] create certificates for posted shipments that didn't have one, turn on the **Create Certificates of Supply if Not Already Created** toggle. When you turn on the toggle, new certificates are created for all posted shipments that don't have certificates within the selected range.  
6. By default, the filter settings are for the shipment document that you selected. Fill in the filter information to select a specific certificate of supply that you want to print.  
7. On the **Certificate of Supply** page, choose the **Print** action to print the report, or choose the **Preview** action to view it on the screen.  

   > [!Note]  
   > The **Certificate of Supply Status** field and the **Printed** field are updated for the shipment on the **Certificates of Supply** page.  

8. Send the printed certificate of supply to the customer for signature.  

### To update the status of a certificate of supply for a shipment  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Posted Sales Shipments**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the relevant sales shipment to a customer in another EU country/region.  
3. In the **Status** field, choose the relevant option.  

   If the customer returned the signed certificate of supply, choose **Received**. The **Receipt Date** field is updated. By default, the receipt date is set to the current work date.  

   You can modify the date to reflect the date that you received the customer's signed certificate of supply. You can also add a link to the signed certificate using standard [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] linking.  

   If the customer doesn't return the signed certificate of supply, choose **Not Received**. You must then send the customer a new invoice that includes VAT, because the tax authority won't accept the original invoice.  

To view a group of certificates, start from the **Certificates of Supply** page, and then update the information about the status of outstanding certificates as you receive them from your customers. The updated information can be useful when you want to search for all certificates that have a certain status, for example, **Required**, for which you want to update their status to **Not Received**.  

### To update the status of a group of certificates of supply  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Certificates of Supply**, and choose the related link.  
2. Filter the **Status** field to the value that you want in order to create the list of certificates that you want to manage.  
3. To update the status information, choose **Edit List**.  
4. In the **Status** field, choose the relevant option.  

   If the customer returned the signed certificate of supply, choose **Received**. The **Receipt Date** field is updated. By default, the receipt date is set to the current work date.  

   You can modify the date to reflect the date that you received the signed the certificate of supply. You can also add a link to the signed certificate using standard [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] document linking.  

> [!NOTE]
> You cannot create a new certificate of supply on the **Certificate of Supply** page when you navigate to it using this procedure. To create a certificate for a shipment that was not set up to require one, open the posted sales shipment, and use either of two procedures described earlier:  
>
> * To manually create a certificate of supply certificate  
> * To print a certificate of supply.

# Plan for New Demand Order by Order

This planning task can be performed on the **Order Planning** page, which displays all new demand along with availability information and suggestions for supply. It provides the visibility and tools needed to effectively plan demand from sales lines and component lines and then create different types of supply orders directly.  

You can enter the **Order Planning** page in two ways depending on your focus: From an order that you want to plan for specifically or in batch mode because you want to plan for all and any new demand.  


## To plan for new production order demand

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Planned Production Orders**, and then choose the related link. (You can perform these steps for planned, firm planned, or released production orders).
2. Open the production order you want to plan for, and then choose the **Planning** action.  
3. On the **Order Planning** page, choose the **Calculate Plan** action.  

The page displays planning lines according to the view filter **Production Demand**, meaning unfulfilled component lines of all existing production orders. Demand for only the one production order is not shown because it is necessary to plan for one production order with an overview of demand for potentially earlier components lines. Planning lines for the production order in context are expanded.  

## To plan for any new demand

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Order Planning**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Order Planning** page, choose the **Calculate Plan** action.
3. Choose the **Expand (+)** button in front of the date in the **Demand Date** field to see the underlying planning lines that represent demand lines with insufficient availability.  
4. For each expanded planning line, that is, demand line, you can see values in information fields at the bottom of the page.  

    |Option|Description|  
    |----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Qty. on Other Locations**|Shows if the item exists on another location. You can then look up and select it.|  
    |**Substitutes Exist**|Shows if a substitute item is created for the item. You can then look up and select it. Note that this feature only applies to components, that is, from demand lines of type **Production**.|  
    |**Quantity Available**|Shows the total availability of the item, that is, the Projected Available Balance.|  
    |**Earliest Date Available**|Shows the arrival date of an inbound supply order that can cover the needed quantity on a date later than the demand date.|  

5. In the **Replenishment System** field, select which type of supply order to create.  

    The default value is that of the item card, or SKU card, but you can change it to one of three options:  

    |Option|Description|  
    |----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Purchase**|Creates a purchase order.|  
    |**Transfer**|Creates a transfer order.|  
    |**Prod. Order**|Creates a production order.|  

    In the **Supply From** field you must select a value according to the selected replenishment system.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  If the field is not filled in, the system will display an error message when you use the **Make Supply Order** function, and no supply order will be created for the planning line in question. This, however, is not the case if the replenishment system is **Prod. Order**.  

6. From the **Supply From** field, you can look up in the relevant list and select where the supply should come from:  

    - If replenishment system is **Purchase**, the look-up button in this field looks up on the **Item Vendor Catalog** page.  
    - If replenishment system is **Transfer**, the look-up button in this field looks up on the **Location List** page.  

    In case the item exists in another location, the **Qty. on Other Location** field at the bottom shows a value and you can then look up and select the location from which the item should be supplied when you make the transfer order.  

    If a substitute exists for the demanded item, the **Substitute Exists** field is set to **Yes**, and you can then look up to the **Item Substitution Entries** page and select the substitute.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > Be aware that item substitutions will not automatically cause an item to be replaced by another item, for example when creating a sales order or in a BOM. Instead, you will be alerted to the fact that a substitution is available to you.

7. Select the **Reserve** check box if you want to make a reservation between the supply order you are creating and the demand line that it is created for. It is empty by default.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  You can only select this check box if the item has **Optional** or **Always** in the **Reserve** field on its item card.  

8. In the **Qty. to Order** field, you can enter the quantity that will go on the supply order you are creating.   
    The default value is the same quantity as that in the **Needed Quantity** field. But you may decide to order more or less than this quantity based on your knowledge of the demand situation. If, for example, you see on the **Order Planning** page that several unrelated demand lines are for the same purchased item, and they are due around the same date, you can consolidate these by entering the total needed quantity in the **Qty. to Order** field of one line, and then delete the other, obsolete planning lines for that item.  

9. In the **Due Date** and **Order Date** fields, you can enter the dates that should apply to the created supply orders.  

    These two fields are interrelated according to the **Default Safety Lead Time** field, which can be found on the **Manufacturing Setup** page. By default, the due date is the same as the demand date, but you can change this as you like.  

> [!NOTE]  
> If you enter a date later than the demand date, you will receive a warning message.  

## To make supply orders

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Planned Production Orders**, and then choose the related link. You can perform these steps for a planned, firm planned, or released production order.  
2. Open the production order you want to plan for, and then choose the **Planning** action.  
3. Place the cursor on a relevant planning line, and then choose the **Make Orders** action.  
4. On the **Make Supply Orders** page, on the **Order Planning** FastTab, in the **Make Orders for** field, select one of the following options.  

    |Option|Description|  
    |----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**The Active Line**|Make a supply order only for the line where the cursor is placed.|  
    |**The Active Order**|Make supply orders for all lines in the order where the cursor is placed.|  
    |**All Lines**|Make supply orders for all lines on the **Order Planning** page.|  

5. On the **Options** FastTab, define what kind of supply orders, or requisition worksheet lines, should be made.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  The settings you last made on the **Make Supply Orders** page will be saved under your user ID so that they are the same the next time you use the page.  

6. Choose the **OK** button to make the suggested supply orders or requisition worksheet lines.  

You have now planned for the unfulfilled demand by making respective supply orders. Details about specific work flows when using the **Order Planning** page would depend on a company’s internal policies.  

When you have finished your planning work on the **Order Planning** page, for example defined an alternative way to supply the quantity, you can proceed to create supply orders for one or more of the planning lines.  

> [!NOTE]  
> The supply orders you create may introduce new dependent demand, for example for underlying production orders, and you should therefore choose **Calculate Plan** again to find and resolve this before moving down the list.

# Viewing Database Locks

Database locking controls access by multiple users to the same data at the same time. To protect a transaction against other transactions modifying the same data, the first transaction puts a lock on the data. The lock remains until the transaction's done.

Users may be blocked from completing transactions on the locked data. They'll typically get a message that indicates the lock condition.

## To view database locks

Choose the ![Search for Page or Report.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Database Locks**, and then choose the related link.

The **Database Locks** page gives snapshot of all current database locks.

For more information about database locking, see [Monitoring Database Locks](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/monitor-database-locks) in the Business Central Developer and IT Pro help.

# Ship items with a warehouse shipment

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you pick and ship items using one of four methods, as described in the following table.

|Method|Outbound Process|Require Pick|Require Shipment|Complexity Level (Learn more at [Warehouse Management Overview](design-details-warehouse-management.md))|  
|------|----------------|-----|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
|A|Post the pick and shipment from the order line|||No dedicated warehouse activity.|  
|B|Post the pick and shipment from an inventory pick document|Turned on||Basic: Order-by-order.|  
|C|Post the pick and shipment from a warehouse shipment document||Turned on|Basic: Consolidated receive/ship posting for multiple orders.|  
|D|Post the pick from a warehouse pick document, and post the shipment from a warehouse shipment document|Turned on|Turned on|Advanced|  

To learn more about shipping items, go to [Outbound Warehouse Flow](design-details-outbound-warehouse-flow.md).

This article refers to methods C and D in the table. In both methods, you start by creating a shipment document from a business source document. Then you pick the specified items for the shipment.

When a location requires warehouse shipments, you can ship items based on source documents that were released to the warehouse. Releasing source documents makes the items on them ready to be handled in the warehouse. The following are examples of source documents:

* Sales orders
* Purchase return orders
* Transfer orders
* Service orders

You can create a warehouse shipment in one of two ways:

* In a push fashion, when work is done on an order-by-order basis. Choose the **Create Warehouse Shipment** action in the source document to create a warehouse shipment for the document.
* In a pull fashion, where you use the **Release** action in the source document to release it to the warehouse. A warehouse employee creates a **Warehouse Shipment** for one or many released source documents. The following procedure describes how to create warehouse shipment in a pull fashion.

## To ship items using a warehouse shipment document

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Warehouse Shipments**, then choose the related link.  
2. Choose **New**.  
3. In the **No.** field, choose the number series to use to create an ID for the shipment.  
4. In the **Location Code** field, choose the location you're shipping from. 

    When you retrieve source document lines, some of the information from the location is copied to each line.  
5. If the location requires bins, fill in the **Bin Code** field. Depending on your setup, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]] can add the bin code for you. Learn more at [Zone and bin codes](warehouse-how-ship-items.md#zone-and-bin-codes).  
6. You can get the source document in two ways:

    * Choose the **Get Source Documents** action. The **Source Documents - Outbound** page opens. Here you can select one or more source documents released to warehouse that requires shipment.
    * Choose the **Use Filters to Get Src. Docs.** action. The **Filters to Get Source Docs.** page opens. You can select the source document filter and apply it. All released source document lines that fulfill the filter criteria are added on the **Warehouse Shipment** page. Learn more at [How to Use Filters to Get Source Documents](warehouse-how-ship-items.md#how-to-use-filters-to-get-source-documents).

    > [!NOTE]
    > If your location uses cross-docking and bins for each line, you can review the quantity of items placed in the cross-dock bins. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates the quantities whenever the fields on the shipment are updated. If they're the items on the shipment you're preparing, you can create a pick for all the items and then complete the shipment. Learn more at [Cross-Dock Items](warehouse-how-to-cross-dock-items.md).

7. Create a warehouse pick. If the location requires picking, you can create pick activities for warehouse shipments in one of two ways:

    * In a push fashion, where you use the **Create Pick** action. Select the lines to pick and specify information about the picks. For example, which bins to take from and place in, and how many units to handle. The bins can be predefined for the warehouse location or resource.
    * In a pull fashion, where you use the **Release** action. On the **Pick Worksheet** page, use the **Get Warehouse Documents** action to get your assigned picks. When the warehouse picks are fully registered, the lines in the **Pick Worksheet** are deleted. Learn more at [Pick Items for Warehouse Shipment](warehouse-how-to-pick-items-for-warehouse-shipment.md).

    > [!TIP]
    > For a location that doesn't require picking, you can print warehouse shipment and use it as a picking list.

8. Specify the quantity to ship.  

    For a location that requires picking, the **Qty. to Ship** field is updated automatically when the pick is registered. Otherwise, the **Qty. to Ship** field is filled with the quantity outstanding for each line when warehouse shipment line is created.

    You can change the quantity, but you can't ship more items than the number in the **Qty. Outstanding** field on the source document line or the **Qty. Picked** field if picking is required.

    To set the value in the **Qty. to Ship** field on all lines to zero, choose the **Delete Qty. to Ship** action. For example, setting the quantities to zero is useful if you're using a barcode scanner to update the shipping quantities. To add the quantity available for shipping, choose the **Autofill Qty. to Ship** action.

9. Post the shipment.

    [!INCLUDE [preview-posting-shipment](includes/preview-posting-shipment.md)]

## How to use filters to get source documents

From a warehouse shipment, you can use the **Filters to Get Source Docs.** page to retrieve the released source document lines that define which items to ship.

1. In the warehouse shipment, choose the **Use Filters to Get Src. Docs.** action. 
2. To set up a new filter, enter a descriptive code in the **Code** field, then choose the **Modify** action.

    The **Source Document Filter Card - Outbound** page opens.

3. Use the filters to define the type of source document lines to retrieve. For example you can select types of source documents, such as sales or transfer orders.
4. Choose **Run**.  

All released source document lines that meet the filter criteria are added on the **Warehouse Shipment** page on which you set the filters.

You can make an unlimited number of filter combinations. Filters are saved on the **Filters to Get Source Docs.** page and are available the next time you need them. You can change the criteria at any time by choosing the **Modify** action.

## Zone and bin codes

If bins are mandatory at the location, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] suggests a zone and bin code on the warehouse shipment document.

* For advanced configurations in which a location uses directed put-away and pick, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses the bin specified in the **Shipment Bin Code** field on the **Location Card**. If a **Shipment Bin Code** isn't specified, the field is blank. If the item and shipment bin don't match, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] leaves the shipment bin blank.
* In other cases, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] always uses the bin specified in the **Shipment Bin Code** field on the **Location Card** first. If a shipment bin code isn't specified, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses the bin code from the source document.

## Handling Assemble-to-Order Items in Warehouse Shipments

In assemble-to-order scenarios, use the **Qty. to Ship** field on warehouse shipment lines to record how many units are assembled. The quantity is posted as assembly output when you post the warehouse shipment. For other warehouse shipment lines, the value in the **Qty. to Ship** field is zero.

When workers finish assembling some or all of the assemble-to-order quantity, record the quantity on the **Qty. to Ship** field on the warehouse shipment line. Then choose the **Post Shipment** action. The assembly output is posted, including the component consumption. A sales shipment for the quantity is posted for the sales order.

From the assembly order, you can choose **Asm.-to-Order Whse. Shpt. Line** to access the warehouse shipment line.

After you post the warehouse shipment, various fields on the sales order line are updated to show progress in the warehouse. The following fields are also updated to show how many assemble-to-order quantities remain to be assembled and shipped:

* **ATO Whse. Outstanding Qty.**
* **ATO Whse. Outstd. Qty. (Base)**

> [!NOTE]
> In combination scenarios where a part of the quantity must be assembled and another must be shipped from inventory, two warehouse shipment lines are created. One is for the assemble-to-order quantity, and one is for the inventory quantity.
>
> The assemble-to-order quantity is handled as described in this article. The inventory quantity is handled as a regular warehouse shipment line. To learn more about combination scenarios, go to [Understanding Assemble to Order and Assemble to Stock](assembly-assemble-to-order-or-assemble-to-stock.md).

# Set up general fixed assets information

Before you can manage fixed assets (FA), you must set up default G/L accounts, allocation keys, and journal templates and batches to post and reclassify fixed assets. Also, define a classification hierarchy (classes and sub classes) to structure your assets and, if needed, define the locations where you store assets.

## To set up general behavior for fixed assets functionality

Define the general behavior of the fixed asset functionality and its document number series on the **Fixed Assets Setup** page.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Fixed Assets Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

## To set up fixed asset posting groups

Use posting groups to define groups of fixed assets. Entries for these posting groups post to the same general ledger accounts.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **FA Posting Groups**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.
3. On the **FA Posting Group Card** page, fill in the fields as necessary.

    > [!NOTE]  
    >   To make sure that balancing accounts for different fixed assets postings are automatically inserted when you choose the **Insert FA Bal. Account** action on journal lines, follow the next step, based on appreciation posting.
4. On the **Balancing Account** FastTab, in the **Appreciation Bal. Account** field, select the general ledger account to which you want to post balancing entries for appreciation.

For more information about using the **Insert FA Bal. Account** action on fixed asset G/L journal lines, see [Revalue Fixed Assets](fa-how-revalue.md).

## To set up fixed asset journal templates

A template is a predefined layout for a journal. The template contains information about trace codes, reports, and number series. For more information, see [Work with General Journals](ui-work-general-journals.md).

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically creates a fixed asset journal template the first time that you open the **Fixed Asset Journal** page, but you can set up other journal templates.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **FA Journal Templates**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary.

## To set up fixed asset class and subclass codes

In fixed assets, you can define a classification hierarchy that can be used to group assets. The hierarchy has two levels: classes and subclasses.

### Fixed asset class codes

Fixed asset classes are the top-level entries in the classification hierarchy in which you group assets. For example, use classes to divide assets into tangible or intangible assets. You must create at least one fixed asset class in your setup.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **FA Classes**, and then choose the related link.
2. Enter codes and names for the fixed asset classes that you want to create.

### Fixed asset subclass codes

Fixed asset subclasses are the second level entries in the classification hierarchy in which you group assets. Each subclass points to a top-level class. Use fixed asset subclass codes to group fixed assets in more specific categories, such as buildings, vehicles, furniture, or machinery. You must create at least one fixed asset subclass in your setup.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **FA Subclasses**, and then choose the related link.
2. Enter codes and names for the fixed asset subclasses that you want to create.

## Start to register assets

If you're using the fixed assets in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] for the first time, you must set up the general ledger application area before you set up fixed assets. How you do so depends on whether you integrate fixed assets with the general ledger.  

The following procedure is used if fixed asset transactions are to be posted to the general ledger.  

1. Complete the basic setups for fixed assets.  
2. Fill in a fixed asset card for each existing asset.  
3. Create a fixed asset depreciation book for each depreciation purpose (such as tax and financial statements). For each depreciation book, define the terms and conditions, such as integration with the general ledger.

    Enable general ledger integration by following the next steps. First, ensure that general ledger integration isn't enabled for all depreciation books, then post the opening entries, and finally, turn on general ledger integration.  
4. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Depreciation Books**, and then choose the related link.  
5. Select the relevant depreciation book, and then choose the **Edit** action to open the **Depreciation Book Card** page.
6. On the **Integration** FastTab, turn off all of the toggles. If you have more than one depreciation book, repeat this step for each one.  
7. In the fixed asset journal, enter the following lines for each asset:
   * A line with the acquisition cost.
   * A line with the accumulated depreciation to the end of the previous fiscal year.
   * A line with the accumulated depreciation from the start of the current fiscal year to the date that [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is set to start calculating the depreciation.

    If you have other opening balances you can also enter them now, such as write-down and appreciation.  
8. After you enter and post the journal lines for each asset, turn on general ledger integration in the
depreciation books.

If the fixed assets aren't integrated with the general ledger, skip steps six and eight.

## To set up fixed asset location codes (optional)

Fixed asset location codes define identifiers for where assets can be located, such as sales department, reception, administration, production, or warehouse. You can use them to register the location of a fixed asset. This information is useful for insurance and inventory purposes.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **FA locations**, and then choose the related link.
2. Enter codes and names for the fixed asset locations that you want to create.

## To set up fixed asset allocation keys (optional)

Use allocation keys to allocate transactions to various departments or projects. For example, you can set up an allocation key to allocate vehicle depreciation costs with 35 percent to the administration department and 65 percent to the sales department. For more information, see [Allocate Costs and Income](year-allocate-costs-income.md).

Allocation keys apply to fixed asset classes, not to individual assets.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **FA Posting Groups**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **FA Posting Groups** page, choose the **Allocations** action, and then choose a posting type.
3. On the **FA Allocations** page, fill in the fields as necessary.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for each posting type that you want to define allocation keys for.

## To set up fixed asset journal batches (optional)

You can set up multiple journal batches, which are individual journals for each journal template. For example, employees can have their own journal batch that uses the employee’s initials as the journal batch name. For more information, see [Work with General Journals](ui-work-general-journals.md).  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **FA Journal Templates**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the relevant journal template, and then choose the **Batches** action.
3. On the **FA Journal Batches** page, fill in the fields as necessary.

## To set up fixed asset reclassification journal templates (optional)

Use dedicated reclassification journals to transfer, split, or combine fixed assets. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically creates a fixed asset reclassification journal template the first time you open the **FA Reclass. Journal** page, but you can set up other reclassification journal templates. For more information, see [Work with General Journals](ui-work-general-journals.md).  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **FA Reclass. Journal Templates**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary.

## To set up fixed asset reclassification journal batches (optional)

You can set up multiple journal batches, which are individual journals for each reclassification journal template. For example, employees can have their own reclassification journal batch that uses the employee’s initials as the reclassification journal batch name. For more information, see [Work with General Journals](ui-work-general-journals.md).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **FA Reclass. Journal Templates**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the relevant journal template, and then choose the **Batches** action.
3. On the **FA Reclass. Journal Batches** page, fill in the fields as necessary.

# Process sales returns or cancellations

If a customer wants to return items or be reimbursed for items or services that you have sold and received payment for, you must create and post a sales credit memo that specifies the requested change. To include the correct sales invoice information, you can do the following tasks:  

- Create the sales credit memo directly from the posted sales invoice.
- Create a new sales credit memo with copied invoice information.

If you need more control of the sales return process, such as warehouse documents for the item handling, or a better overview when receiving items from multiple sales documents with one sales return, then you can create sales return orders. A sales return order automatically issues the related sales credit memo and other return-related documents, such as a replacement sales order, if needed. For more information, see [Process sales return orders](sales-how-process-sales-returns-orders.md).

> [!NOTE]  
> If a posted sales invoice has not yet been paid, then you can use the **Correct** or **Cancel** functions on the posted sales invoice to reverse transactions. These functions only work for unpaid invoices, and they do not support partial returns or cancellations. For more information, see [Correct or Cancel Unpaid Sales Invoices](sales-how-correct-cancel-sales-invoice.md).

A return or reimbursement might relate to only some of the items or services on the original sales invoice. In that case, you must edit information on the lines on the sales credit memo or sales return order. When you post the sales credit memo or sales return order, the sales documents that are affected by the change are reversed and a refund payment can be created for the customer. For more information, see [Making Payments](payables-make-payments.md).  

The credit memo posting will also revert any item charges that were assigned to the posted document, so that the item's value entries are the same as before the item charge was assigned.

> [!NOTE]
> The bookkeeping aspects of sales returns, such as the payments to customers as reimbursement, is considered bookkeeping work and not described here. For more information, see [Managing Payables](payables-manage-payables.md).

## To create a sales credit memo from a posted sales invoice  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Posted Sales Invoices**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Posted Sales Invoices** page, select the posted sales invoice that you want to reverse, choose the **Cancel** action, and then choose the **Create Corrective Credit Memo** action.

    The sales credit memo header contains some information from the posted sales invoice. You can edit this, for example, with new information that reflects the return agreement.  
3. Edit information on the lines according to the agreement, such as the number of returned items or the amount to reimburse.
4. Choose the **Prepare** action, and then choose the **Apply Entries** action.
5. On the **Apply Customer Entries** page, select the line with the posted sales document that you want to apply the sales credit memo to, and then choose the **Applies-to ID** action.

    The identifier of the sales credit memo displays in the **Applies-to ID** field.
6. In the **Amount to Apply** field, enter the amount that you want to apply if it's smaller than the original amount.  

    At the bottom of the **Apply Customer Entries** page, you can see the total amount to apply to reverse all involved entries, namely when the value in the **Balance** field is zero.
7. Choose the **OK** button. When you post the sales credit memo, it is applied to the posted sales documents.

    After you create or edit sales credit memo lines, and the single or multiple applications are specified, you can post the sales credit memo.  
8. Choose the **Posting** action, then choose the **Post and Send** action.  

The **Post and Send Confirmation** dialog box opens showing the preferred sending method for the customer. You can change the sending method by choosing the lookup button for the **Send Document** to field. For more information, see [Set Up Document Sending Profiles](sales-how-setup-document-send-profiles.md).  

The posted sales documents that you applied the credit memo to are now reversed, and a refund payment can be created for the customer. The sales credit memo is removed and replaced with a new document in the list of posted sales credit memos.

## To create a sales credit memo by copying a posted sales invoice

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Credit Memos**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action to open a new empty sales credit memo.
3. In the **Customer Name** field, enter the name of an existing customer.
4. Choose the **Prepare** action, then choose the **Copy Document** action.
5. On the **Copy Sales Document** page, in the **Document Type** field, select **Posted Invoice**.
6. Choose the **Document No.** field to open the **Posted Sales Invoices** page, and then select the posted sales invoice record that contains lines that you want to reverse.
7. Select the **Recalculate Lines** check box if you want the copied posted sales invoice lines to be updated with any changes in item price and unit cost since the invoice was posted.
8. Choose the **OK** button. The copied invoice lines are inserted in the sales credit memo.
9. Complete the sales credit memo as explained in [To create a sales credit memo from a posted sales invoice](sales-how-process-sales-returns-cancellations.md#to-create-a-sales-credit-memo-from-a-posted-sales-invoice).

## To create a sales allowance
You can send a customer a credit memo with a price reduction if the customer has received slightly damaged items or received the items late.  
You can post this reduced price as an item charge in a credit memo or a return order and assign it to the posted shipment. The following describes it for a sales credit memo, but the same steps apply to a sales return order.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Credit Memos**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action to open a new empty sales credit memo.
3. Fill in the credit memo header with relevant information about the customer that you want to give the sales allowance to.  
4. On the **Lines** FastTab, in the **Type** field, select **Charge (Item)**.  
5. In the **No.** field, select the appropriate item charge value.  
     You might want to create a special item charge number to cover sales allowances.  
6. In the **Quantity** field, enter **1**.  
7. In the **Unit Price Excl. Tax** field, enter the amount of the sales allowance.  
8. Assign the sales allowance as an item charge to the items in the posted shipment. For more information, see [Use Item Charges to Account for Additional Trade Costs](payables-how-assign-item-charges.md). When you have assigned the allowance, return to the **Sales Credit Memo** page.  

When you post the sales return order, the sales allowance is added to the relevant sales entry amount. In this way, you can maintain accurate inventory valuation.

## To combine return receipts
You can combine return receipts if your customer returns several items that are covered by different sales return orders.  

When you receive the items into your warehouse, post the relevant sales return orders as received. This creates posted return receipts.  

When you're ready to invoice this customer, instead of invoicing each sales return order separately, you can create a sales credit memo and automatically copy the posted return receipt lines to this document. Then you can post the sales credit memo and conveniently invoice all the open sales return orders at once.  

To combine return receipts, the **Combine Shipments** check box must be selected on the **Customer Card** page.  

### To manually combine return receipts  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Credit Memos**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.
3. On the **General** FastTab, fill in the fields as necessary.  
4. Choose the **Get Return Receipt Lines** action.  
5. Select the return receipt lines that you want to include in the credit memo:  

    - To insert all lines, select all lines, and then choose the **OK** button.  

    - To insert specific lines, select the lines, and then choose the **OK** button.  
6.  If an incorrect shipment line was selected or you want to start over, you can simply delete the lines on the credit memo and rerun the **Get Return Receipt Lines** function.  
7.  Post the invoice.  

### To automatically combine return receipts

You can automatically combine return receipts and have the option of automatically posting the credit memos using the  **Combine Return Receipts** function.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Combine Return Receipts**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Combine Return Receipts** page, fill in the fields to select the relevant return receipts.
3. Select the **Post Credit Memos** check box. If not, you must manually post the resulting purchase credit memos.
4. Choose the **OK** button.  

### To remove a received and invoiced return order

When you invoice return receipts in this way, the return orders from which the return receipts were posted still exist, even if they have been fully received and invoiced.  

When return receipts are combined on a credit memo and posted, a posted sales credit memo is created for the credited lines. The **Quantity Invoiced** field on the originating sales return order is updated based on the invoiced quantity.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Delete Invoiced Sales Return Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Specify in the **No.** filter field which return orders to delete.  
3. Choose the **OK** button.  

Alternatively, delete individual sales return orders manually.  

## Inventory costing

To preserve correct inventory valuation, you typically want to put returned items back in inventory at the unit cost that they were sold at, not at their current unit cost. This is referred to as exact cost reversing.

Two functions exist to assign exact cost reversing automatically:  

|Function|Description|  
|------------------|---------------------------------------|  
|**Get Posted Document Lines to Reverse** function on the **Sales Return Order** page|Copies lines of one or more posted documents to be reversed into the sales return order. For more information, see [Create a sales return order based on one or more posted sales documents](sales-how-process-sales-returns-orders.md#create-a-sales-return-order-based-on-one-or-more-posted-sales-documents).|  
|**Copy Document** function in the **Sales Credit Memo** and **Sales Return Order** pages|Copies both the header and lines of one posted document to be reversed.<br /><br /> Requires that the **Exact Cost Reversing Mandatory** check box is selected on the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page.|

To assign exact cost reversing manually, you must choose the **Appl.-from Item Entry** field on any type of return document line, and then select the number of the original sales entry. This links the sales credit memo or sales return order to the original sales entry and ensures that the item is valued at the original unit cost.

For more information, see [Design Details: Inventory Costing](design-details-inventory-costing.md).

# Create service items

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the term "service item" refers to equipment or items that require service. When you create a service order, you specify the items that need service. In the order, you can link a service item to an item in inventory or a service item group.

When you receive an item that needs service, you can register it as a service item. There are several ways to do so. For example, you can create a service item on the **Service Items** page, or as part of another process, such as when working with a service order.

## To create a service item

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Items**, and then choose the related link.
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  

## To create service items within a service order

When you receive items for service that you want to register as service items, you can create them as service items in the **Service Order** or **Service Quote** pages.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  
3. Choose the **Create Service Item** action.  

    A number is assigned to the service item and a service item card is created. The **Service Item No.** field is filled in with the number of the new service item.

## To create a service item when shipping items

When you ship items by posting either sales orders or sales invoices, the shipped items are automatically registered as service items if the following condition is met. The items must belong to a service item group with the **Create Service Item** check box selected. If the items have serial numbers registered in the Item Tracking Lines page, this information is copied automatically to the **Serial No.** field on the service item card when creating service items.  

The following procedure shows how to create service items when you ship items on sales orders.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the relevant sales order.  
3. Choose the **Post** or **Post and Print** action.  
4. Choose the **Ship** or **Ship and Invoice** action.  
5. The service items are automatically created for the items on the order, provided these belong to a service item group that you have set up to create service items. If you registered specific serial numbers on the **Item Tracking Lines** page, they will be assigned to these service items.  

> [!NOTE]  
> If an item is a BOM and you have exploded the BOM, the exploded BOM items are processed in the same way as regular items. Service items are created based on the service items group condition and, optionally, the serial numbers condition. Additionally, if a service item is created for an exploded BOM item that is made up of other BOM components, these items are created as service item components for the exploded BOM service item.  
>
> If an item is a BOM and you have not exploded the BOM, a service item is created for it based on the service item group condition and, optionally, the serial numbers condition.  

## To insert a starting fee for a service item

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Tasks**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **Item Worksheet** action.
3. Choose the service line, and then choose **Actions**, choose **Functions**, and then choose **Insert Starting Fee** action.  

    A service line of type **Cost** is inserted with the starting fee. The starting fee applies to the selected service item.

## Block items, item variants, or specific service items

You can prevent items, item variants, or service items from being used in service management transactions, such as service contracts, service orders, and service invoices. This can be useful if you want to restrict the availability of some items or service items for service purposes, for example, due to discontinued support, limited stock, or contractual agreements.

To block an item or an item variant from being used in service management transactions, turn on the **Service Blocked** toggle on the **Item Card**, **Item Variants**, and **Item Variant Card** page. You can also set this field on the **Item Template** page, and it will be copied to the items created from that template.

When an item or an item variant is service blocked, it isn't available for selection on the following pages:

- Service Line (except for service credit memos, where you'll see a notification that the item or variant is blocked, but allowed on this type of document)
- Service Item
- Service Contract Line
- Standard Service Line

If you manually enter an item number or variant that's blocked, you'll get an error message that states, "The field contains a value that cannot be found in the related table."

Additionally, if you have service contracts, service contract quotes, or service orders that include blocked service items or item variants, you can't use the following actions:

- **Lock** or **Make Contract** on the **Service Contract Quote** page.
- **Lock Contract**, **Sign Contract**, **Create Contract Service Orders** or **Create Contract Invoices**  on the **Service Contract** page.
- **Make Order** on the **Service Quote** page.
- **Release to Ship** or **Post** on the **Service Order** page.
- **Post** in the **Service Invoice** page.

### Block a service item

To block a service item from being used in service management transactions, on the **Service Item Card** page, in the **Blocked** field, choose one of the following options:

- **Service Contract**: Block the service item from being used in service contracts and service contract quotes, but not in service orders or other service documents.
- **All**: Block the service item from being used in any service management transaction, including service contracts, service orders, and other service documents.

When a service item is blocked, you can't select it on the following pages:

- Service Contract Line (if blocked for service contract, or all)
- Service Item Line (except for service credit memos, if blocked for all)

If you manually enter a service item number for a blocked service item, an error message displays "The field contains a value that cannot be found in the related table."

Additionally, if you have service contracts, service contract quotes, or service orders that include blocked service items, you can't use the following actions:

- **Lock** and **Make Contract** on the **Service Contract Quote** page (if blocked for service contract, or all).
- **Lock Contract**, **Sign Contract**, or **Change Customer** on the **Service Contract** page (if blocked for service contract, or all).
- **Make Order** on the **Service Quote** (if blocked for all).
- **Release to Ship**, **Post** on the **Service Order** (if blocked for all. If service order documents contain multiple service items, and some are blocked and others are not, you can release and post non-blocked lines. Consider whether to turn on the **One Service Item Line/Order** toggle on the **Service Management Setup** page).
- **Post** on the **Service Invoice** page (if blocked for all).

You can also view the blocked service items by applying a filter to the following reports:

- Service Items (report 5935)
- Service Items Out of Warranty (report 5937)
- Service Profit (Service Items) (report 5938)

### Data upgrade

This feature doesn't require additional setup. However, if you upgrade your [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], be aware of the following:

- If you have items, item variants, or item templates where the **Sales Blocked** toggle is turned on, the **Service Blocked** field is also turned on for those records during upgrade. This ensures that the existing sales blocked logic also applies to service management transactions.
- Data upgrades only if you have at least one service item in your company, which means you're using the service management functionality and need the data upgrade. If you don't have service items, the data upgrade is skipped and the **Service Blocked** toggle is turned off by default for all items, item variants, and item templates.

title: Mapping the tables and fields to synchronize

# Mapping the tables and fields to synchronize

The basis of synchronizing data is mapping the tables and fields in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with tables and columns in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)], so they can exchange the data. Mapping happens through integration tables.

## Mapping integration tables

An integration table is a table in the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] database that represents a table, such as an account, in [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)]. Integration tables include fields that correspond to columns in the [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] table. For example, the Account integration table connects to the Accounts table in [!INCLUDE[cds_short_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)]. There must be an integration table mapping for each table in [!INCLUDE[cds_short_md](includes/cds_short_md.md)] that you want to synchronize with data in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

When you create the connection between the apps, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] sets up some default mappings. You can change the table mappings if you want. For more information, see [Standard Table Mapping for Synchronization](admin-synchronizing-business-central-and-sales.md#standard-table-mapping-for-synchronization). If you changed the default mappings and want to revert your changes, on the **Integration Table Mappings** page, choose **Use Default Synchronization Setup**.

> [!Note]
> If you are using an on-premises version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the integration table mappings are stored in table 5335 Integration Table Mappings, where you can view and edit the mappings. Complex mappings and synchronization rules are defined in codeunit 5341.

> [!TIP]
> When a coupled record changes, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically synchronizes the data with Dataverse. Automatic synchronization is great in most cases. However, frequent changes to large amounts of coupled records in a table can slow down data synchronization.
>
> To avoid slow performance, on the **Integration Table Mappings** page, you can enable or disable event-based data synchronization for any table. By default, event-based synchronization is turned on so that existing integrations aren’t affected. Your administrator can turn it on or off for specific tables.

### Add table and field mappings to existing integration tables

[!INCLUDE [preview](includes/preview.md)]

On the **Integration Table Mappings** page, you can use the New Table Mapping action to add new table mappings to integration tables. The action starts the **Create new integration mappings** assisted setup guide, which helps you set up new integration table and field mappings.

The guide lets you map the tables in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with existing integration tables in Dataverse. You can also specify the Dataverse table's unique identifier in **Integration Table Unique Identifier Field Name** and the **Integration Table Modified on Field Name**, which are needed for data synchronization to work.

> [!NOTE]
> The lookup on the Table column shows all [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] tables, including custom tables, that aren't yet mapped. It excludes those that already exist on your Integration Table Mappings page. The lookup on the Integration Table column shows only Dataverse tables (AL Proxy Tables) that are part of out-of-the-box integrations. To add additional or custom Dataverse tables, you'll need help from a developer to create and deploy them through an extension.

The Advanced action opens extra table mapping settings that you can set up. In the **Advanced** section, the **Table Filter** field lets you specify filters for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Use the **Integration Table Filter** field for Dataverse data to consider in data synchronization together with the configuration template codes in **Table Config. Template Code** and **Int. Tbl. Config. Code** to prefill missing data when new data comes from either application.

The guide also helps you specify the fields you want the new mapping to contain. You can match a [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] field in the **Field Name** column with a Dataverse field name in the **Integration Field Name** column. You can also specify a **Direction**, whether the field always has the same value in the **Constant** column, and whether validations or transformations need to be applied during field mapping.

> [!NOTE]
> To reduce errors, the lookup for the **Integration Table Field** column filters to a list of available fields. To map fields that the filters don't include, you'll need help from a developer.
>
> * Fields must be enabled.
> * You can't use the guide to map FlowField and FlowFilter fields.
> * You can only map fields of the type BigInteger, Boolean, Code, Date, DateFormula, DateTime, Decimal, Duration, GUID, Integer, Option, and Text.

> [!TIP]
> You can also add new field mappings to existing integration table mappings through the **Integration Field Mappings** list page, which you can access by choosing **Fields** on the **Integration Table Mappings** page.
>
> Simply choose **New Field Mapping** to open the field mapping step of the **Create new integration mappings** assisted setup guide, and then proceed as described in this article.

New field mappings you add to an existing table mapping are in a Disabled state. You can choose **Edit List** to enable them later.

### Synchronization rules

An integration table mapping also includes rules that control how integration synchronization jobs synchronize records in a [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] table and a table in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)]. For examples of rules for an integration with Sales, go to [Synchronization Rules](#synchronization-rules).

### Strategies for autoresolving conflicts

Data conflicts can easily occur when business applications exchange data on an ongoing basis. For example, someone might delete or change a row in one of the applications, or both. To reduce the number of conflicts to manually resolve, you can specify resolution strategies. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically resolves conflicts according to the rules in the strategies.

Integration table mappings include rules that control how synchronization jobs synchronize records. On the **Integration Table Mapping** page, in the **Resolve Deletion Conflicts** and **Resolve Update Conflicts** columns, you can specify how [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] resolves conflicts that occur because records were deleted in tables in one or the other business application, or updated in both. 

In the **Resolve Deletion Conflicts** column, you can choose to have [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically restore deleted records, remove the coupling between the records, or do nothing. If you do nothing, you must manually resolve conflicts. 

In the **Resolve Update Conflicts** column, you can choose to have [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically send a data update to the integration table when sending data to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)], or to get a data update from the integration table when getting data from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)], or do nothing. If you do nothing, you must manually resolve conflicts.

After you specify the strategy, on the **Coupled Data Synchronization Errors** page, you can choose the **Retry All** action to automatically resolve conflicts.

## Mapping integration fields

Mapping tables is only the first step. You must also map the fields on the tables. Integration field mappings link fields in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] tables with corresponding columns in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)], and determine whether to synchronize data in each table. The standard table mapping that [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides includes field mappings, but you can change the mappings. For more information, see [Viewing Table Mappings](admin-synchronizing-business-central-and-sales.md#tip-for-admins-viewing-table-mappings).

> [!Note]
> If you are using an on-premises version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], integration field mappings are defined in table 5336 Integration Field Mapping.

You can manually map the fields, or you can automate the process by mapping multiple fields at the same time based on criteria for matching their values. For more information, see [To couple multiple records based on field value matching](admin-how-to-couple-and-synchronize-records-manually.md).

### Handle differences in field values

Sometimes the values in the fields that you want to map are different. For example, in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] the language code for the United States is "U.S.," but in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] it's "US." That means you must transform the value when you synchronize data. You can specify transformation rules for the fields on the **Integration Table Mappings** page by choosing **Mapping**, and then **Fields**. Predefined rules are provided, but you can also create your own. For more information, see [Transformation Rules](across-how-to-set-up-data-exchange-definitions.md#transformation-rules).

### Handle missing option values

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] contains option set columns that provide values that you can map to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] fields of the type **Option** for automatic synchronization. During synchronization, nonmapped options are ignored and the missing options are appended to the related [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] table and added to the **CDS Option Mapping** system table to be handled manually later. For example, by adding the missing options in either product and then updating the mapping. For more information, see [Handling Missing Option Values](admin-cds-missing-option-values.md).

## Couple records

Coupling links rows in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] to records in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For example, accounts in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] are typically coupled with customers in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Coupling records offers the following benefits:

* It makes synchronization possible.
* Users can open records or rows in one business app from the other.

Coupling requires that the apps are already integrated.

Couplings can be set up automatically by using the synchronization jobs, or manually by editing the record in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For more information, see [Synchronizing Data in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)]](admin-synchronizing-business-central-and-sales.md) and [Couple and Synchronize Records Manually](admin-manual-synchronization-of-table-mappings.md#synchronize-individual-table-mappings).

## Filter records and rows  

If you don't want to synchronize all rows for a specific table in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] or table in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can set up filters to limit the data that is synchronized. You set up filters on the **Integration Table Mappings** page.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Integration Table Mappings**, and then choose the related link.
2. To filter the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] records, set the **Table Filter** field.  
3. To filter the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] rows, set the **Integration Table Filter** field.  

## Create new records  

By default, only coupled records in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and rows in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] are synchronized by the integration synchronization jobs. You can set up table mappings to create new records or rows in the destination app for each row in the source app that isn't already coupled.  

For example, the SALESPEOPLE - Dynamics 365 Sales synchronization job uses the table mapping SALESPEOPLE. The synchronization job copies data from users in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] to salespersons in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. If you set up the table mapping to create new records, for every user in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] that isn't already coupled to a salesperson in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], a new salesperson row is created in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

### To create new records during synchronization  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Integration Table Mappings**, and then choose the related link.
2. In the table mapping entry in the list, clear the **Synch. Only Coupled Records** field.  

## Use configuration templates on table mappings

You can specify one or more configuration templates to use for new [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] records, and another template to use new [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] rows.  

If you install the default synchronization setup, most of the time, two configuration templates are automatically created and used on the table mapping for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] customers and [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] accounts: **CDSCUST** and **CDSACCOUNT**.  

* **CDSCUST** creates and synchronizes new customers in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] based on accounts in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)].  

     To create this template, copy an existing configuration template for customers. The **CDSCUST** is created only if there's an existing configuration template and the **Currency Code** field in the template is blank. If a field in the configuration template contains a value, the value replaces the value in the mapped column for the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] account. For example, if the **Country/Region** column in an account in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] contains *U.S.* and the **Country/Region** field in the configuration template is **GB**, then **GB** is used as the **Country/Region** for the customer in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

* **CDSACCOUNT** creates and synchronizes new accounts in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] based on an account in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

You can add more templates, and use filters to define conditions under which [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] applies them. The templates apply to data moving in either direction. For example, you might use a template for domestic customers in the United States, and another for foreign customers in the European Union, or vice versa. In that case, when the data synchronizes, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses the country/region code for the customer to apply the appropriate template.

### To specify configuration templates on a table mapping  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Integration Table Mappings**, and then choose the related link.
2. In the table mapping entry in the list, in the **Table Config Templates** field, choose to the configuration template to use for new records in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  
3. If you have multiple templates, to define the conditions that determine when to use the template, enter criteria in the **Integration Table Filter** field, and then enter a number in the **Priority** field. The priority determines the order in which [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] evaluates whether to use the templates.

   > [!NOTE]
   > The **Table Config Template Code** and **Int. Tbl. Config Template Code** fields show different values depending on the number of templates that you configure for a specific integration table mapping:
   >
   > * If you configure a single configuration template, the name of the configuration template shows in order to stay compatible with current capabilities.
   > * If you configure multiple configuration templates, the number of configured configuration templates shows.

4. Set the **Int. Tbl. Config Template Code** field to the configuration template to use for new records in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)].

# Ad-hoc analysis of sustainability data

This article explains how to use the **Data Analysis** feature to analyze sustainability data directly from list pages and queries. You don't have to run a report or switch to another application, such as Excel. The feature provides an interactive and versatile way to calculate, summarize, and examine data. Instead of running reports using options and filters, you can add multiple tabs that represent different tasks or views on the data. Some examples are "Emission overview" or "Emission By Scope," or any other view you can imagine. To learn more about how to use the **Data Analysis** feature, go to [Analyze list and query data with analysis mode](analysis-mode.md).

Use the following list pages for ad-hoc analysis of sustainability data:

- [Sustainability Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=6220&layout=analysis)

## Sustainability ad-hoc analysis scenarios

Use the **Data Analysis** feature for quick fact checking and ad-hoc analysis:

- If you don't want to run a report.
- If a report for your specific need doesn't exist.
- If you want to quickly iterate to get a good overview on a part of your business.

The following sections provide examples of sustainability scenarios in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

| Area | To... | Open this page in analysis mode | Using these fields |
| ---- | ----- | ------------------------------- |------------------- |
| [Emission overview (sum by category)](#example-emission-overview-sum-by-category) | Analyze your emissions by category. | [Sustainability Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=6220&layout=analysis) | **Account Category**, **Account Name**, **Emission NH4**, **Emission CO2**, and **Emission N2O**.|
| [Average emissions by category](#example-average-emissions-by-category) | Analyze your average emissions by category. | [Sustainability Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=6220&layout=analysis) | **Account Category**, **Account Name**, **Emission NH4**, **Emission CO2**, and **Emission N2O**.|
| [Emissions by scope](#example-emissions-by-scope) | Analyze your emissions by scope. | [Sustainability Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=6220&layout=analysis) | **Emission Scope**, **Account Category**, **Emission NH4**, **Emission CO2**, and **Emission N2O**.|

## Example: Emission overview (sum by category)

## Data foundation for ad-hoc analysis on sustainability

The information that you enter in a sustainability journal is temporary and you can change it while it's in the journal. When you post a sustainability journal, the information is transferred to sustainability ledger entries on individual sustainability accounts, where you can't change it. However, you can post reversing or correcting entries. The [Sustainability Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=6220) list page is the main data source for ad-hoc analysis of sustainability data.

To learn more about posting sustainability entries, go to [Record sustainability entries](finance-sustainability-journal.md).

# Analyze general ledger (G/L) transactions

When a transaction is posted to the general ledger, the following data is stored in the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] database: a single row in the G/L register table and one or more rows in the G/L Entry table.

## Analyzing the G/L register

You can use the G/L Registers page for financial reporting and transaction tracking. The page gives you an overview of all transactions to the general ledger with the ability to navigate to related entries in subledgers, such as VAT entries or Customer Ledger Entries. You can also see which type of transaction that occured, the user who did the transaction and when it was recorded in the database.

The G/L Registers page is particularly useful during audits, as it provides auditors with easy access to related detailed transaction information. It helps identify any discrepancies, errors, or unusual entries that may require further investigation. 

## Example: use analysis mode to get an overview of G/L transaction types and volume

[!INCLUDE [gl-register-analysis-example](includes/gl-register-analysis-example.md)]


## Analyzing general ledger (G/L) entries

Depending on your need for details or aggregation when analyzing general ledger (G/L) entries, you have several options:

- use the G/L entries page in analysis mode. To learn more, go to [Ad-hoc analysis on finance data](ad-hoc-analysis-finance.md)  
- use the Chart of Accounts page to get a summary across all your G/L accounts. To learn more, go to [Analyze finance data from the Chart of Accounts](finance-general-ledger.md).
- run or define a financial report. To learn more, go to [Primary capabilities of financial reporting](finance-financial-reporting-capabilities.md).

# Reconcile inventory costs with the general ledger

When you post inventory transactions, such as sales shipments, purchase invoices, or inventory adjustments, the changed item costs are recorded in item value entries. To reflect this change of inventory value in your financial books, the inventory costs also need to be posted to the related inventory accounts in the general ledger, such as the inventory account, adjustment account, and COGS account in the general ledger.

Unless you have selected the **Automatic Cost Posting** check box in the **Inventory Setup** window, inventory costs aren't recorded dynamically in the general ledger, and COGS isn't calculated with a sale. Therefore, you must post to the general ledger manually by running the **Post Inventory Cost to G/L** batch job to update the general ledger and potentially print a report of the value entries that are posted.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Before you use this batch job, you should run the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job. This ensures that, when you run this batch job, the costs that will be posted to the general ledger are up to date. This is referred to as cost adjustment. For more information, see [Adjust Item Costs](inventory-how-adjust-item-costs.md).

## To post inventory costs manually

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Post Inventory Cost to G/L**, and then choose the related link.

2. Post inventory costs to the general ledger manually by running the batch job. When you run this batch job, general ledger entries are created on the basis of value entries. To calculate the value to post, it uses the difference between the **Cost Amount (Actual)** field and the **Cost Posted to G/L** field in the value entries. If you have selected the **Expected Cost Posting to G/L** checkbox on the **Inventory Setup** page, the batch job also posts the difference between the **Cost Amount (Expected)** field and the **Exp. Cost Posted to G/L** field to interim accounts in the general ledger. You can post the entries so that they are summarized per posting group.

|Option  |Description  |
|--------------|---------|
|**Posting Method**|The batch job can either post inventory value to the general ledger per posting group or per posted entry. If you post per entry, you achieve a detailed specification of how the inventory affects the general ledger, but you also get numerous G/L entries. If you post per posting group, the batch job creates a general ledger entry per posting date per posting group combination. This means that a general ledger entry is created for each combination of posting date, general business posting group, general product posting group, inventory posting group, and location code. In addition, the batch job creates separate general ledger entries for costs with different signs.|
|**Document No.**|In this field, you can enter a document number if you have chosen the *Post per Inventory Posting Group* option. The document number appears on posted entries.|
|**Post**|Select this field if you want the batch job to post to the general ledger automatically. If you don't choose to post the inventory cost to G/L, the batch job will only print a test report showing the values that can be posted to the general ledger, and on the report will appear: **Test Report (not posted)**.|

> [!NOTE]  
> When you run this batch job, you might encounter errors having to do with missing setup or incompatible dimension setup. If the batch job encounters errors in the dimension setup, it overrides these errors and uses the dimensions of the value entry. For any other errors, the batch job skips posting the value entries and lists them at the end of the report in a section titled “Skipped Entries.” To post these entries, you must fix the errors.
> For example if you have not selected the **Expected Cost Posting to G/L** check box in the **Inventory Setup** window, then the last section of the report will list value entries that are skipped because they represent expected costs.

To see a list of errors before running the posting batch job, you can run the **Post Invt. Cost to G/L - Test** report. The test report lists all the errors encountered during a test posting. You can then fix the errors, and run the inventory cost posting batch job without skipping any entries.

If you would like to get an overview of what values could be posted to the general ledger without actually performing the posting, you can run the **Post Inventory Cost to G/L** batch job without actually posting the values to the general ledger. You do this by clearing the check mark from the **Post** field on the request page. This way, when you run the batch job, the report is produced showing the values that are ready to be posted to the general ledger, but they aren't posted.

## To audit the reconciliation between the inventory ledger and the general ledger

The **Inventory - G/L Reconciliation** page provides the following:

- Exposes reconciliation differences by comparing what is recorded in G/L and what is recorded in the inventory ledger (value entries).
- Displays unreconciled cost amounts in the value entries in the inventory ledger as if they were mapped to corresponding inventory-related accounts in G/L and compares those to the totals recorded in the same accounts in G/L.
- Reflects the double entry structure of G/L by visually presenting data as such. For example, a COGS entry has a corresponding inventory entry.
- Lets users drill down and see the entries that make up the cost amounts.
- Includes filters to narrow the analysis by date, item, and location.
- Explains reasons for reconciliation differences in informative messages.


The **Name** column on the far left in the grid lists the various G/L account types that are associated with inventory.

The **Inventory**, **Inventory (Interim)**, and **WIP Inventory** columns show the invoiced, non-invoiced, and WIP totals of each G/L account type. These are calculated from value entries, that is, they're projected onto the G/L account types where they'll end when they're eventually posted to G/L.

The **Total** column shows the sum (in bold font) of the value entry amounts in the three inventory columns.

The **G/L Total** column shows the amounts (in bold font) for each G/L account type that exists in G/L. These are calculated from G/L entries, that is, they represent inventory costs already posted to G/L.

The **Difference** column represents the difference between the value in the **G/L Total** and **Total** fields.

In the top of the **Inventory - G/L Reconciliation** page, you can enter filters to limit, for example, the period of time for which you want information.

If you select the **Show Warning** check box and if there are any discrepancies between the inventory totals and G/L totals, application shows messages in the **Warning** field of the grid that explain the discrepancy. If you choose the Warning field, application gives you more information on what the warning means.

When you have entered all relevant filters, choose the **Show Matrix** action. The data is calculated and the matrix page appears.

On the far left column in the grid, you see the various general ledger account types that are associated with inventory. The grid then shows the invoiced, non-invoiced (interim), and WIP inventory totals for each of these account types. These totals are calculated from the value entries.

The next columns show the totals for the same account types calculated from the general ledger entries.

Choose the  amount in any of the total fields to see the inventory report entries that were used to calculate the totals. For inventory totals, the inventory report entries are the sums of the value entries for the items. For the G/L totals, the inventory report entries are the sums from the general ledger entries.

## Reporting Costs and Reconciling with the General Ledger
Other reports, tracing functions, and a special reconciliation tool are available to the auditor or controller responsible for reporting a correct and balanced inventory value to the finance department.

The following table describes them.    

|**To**|**See**|  
|------------|-------------|  
|View the inventory value of selected items, including information about the quantities and values of increases and decreases in inventory over a selected period.|**Inventory Valuation** report|  
|View the inventory value of selected production orders in your WIP (work in process) inventory, such as the quantities and values of consumption, capacity usage, and output in ongoing production orders.|**Inventory Valuation - WIP** report|  
|View the inventory value of selected items, including their actual and expected cost on the date specified.|**Invt. Valuation - Cost Spec.** report|  
|Use a report to analyze the reasons for cost variances or to gain insight into the cost shares of sold items (COGS).|**Cost Shares Breakdown** report|

# Work with [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]

In this article, you learn some of the basics about working with reports. Learn about viewing [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports inside [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] (including scorecards and dashboards) and editing [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports that use [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] as a data source. The article discusses some aspects that help you get started as a [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] user. For general guidelines and instructions about using Power BI, see [Power BI documentation for consumers](/power-bi/consumer).

## Overview

[!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports give you insight into your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Various pages in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] include a [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports part that can display [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports. The role center is a typical page where you find a [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports part. Some list pages, like **Items**, also include a Power BI part.

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] works together with the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-service-name](includes/powerbi-service-name.md)]. Reports for displaying in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] are stored in a [!INCLUDE [powerbi-service-name](includes/powerbi-service-name.md)]. In [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can switch the report displayed in the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] part to any Power BI report available in your [!INCLUDE [powerbi-service-name](includes/powerbi-service-name.md)]. The first time you sign into [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], and until you connect to a [!INCLUDE [powerbi-service-name](includes/powerbi-service-name.md)], parts are empty, as shown here:

![Power BI part in Business Central.](./media/power-bi-part.png)

## Get started

> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online is already set up to integrate with Power BI.

### Sign up Power BI

Before you can use Power BI with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you need to sign up for the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-service-name](includes/powerbi-service-name.md)]. If you didn't already sign up, go to [https://powerbi.microsoft.com](https://powerbi.microsoft.com). When you sign up, use your work email address and password.

Once you have a [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] account , you can sign in at [https://powerbi.microsoft.com/](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/). Learn more in [Sign in to the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-service-name](includes/powerbi-service-name.md)]](/power-bi/consumer/end-user-sign-in). 

The [!INCLUDE [powerbi-service-name](includes/powerbi-service-name.md)] hosts all the reports available to you. To see a report in your personal workspace, select **My Workspace** > **Reports**. Then just select the report that you want to view. If you have access to one or more shared Power BI workspaces, you can also see reports in those workspaces.

With [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, you automatically get a set of default reports on your workspace. If you want to create your own reports, you can use Power BI Desktop to create reports, and then publish them to your workspace. Learn more in [Getting Started Building Reports in Power BI Desktop to Display [!INCLUDE [prod_long](includes/prod_long.md)] Data](across-how-use-financials-data-source-powerbi.md).

[!INCLUDE[note-multicompany-reports](includes/note-multicompany-reports.md)]

## <a name="connect"></a>Connect to Power BI - one time only

When you first sign into [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], an empty [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] part (as shown in the previous figure) is most likely available on various pages. The first thing to do is to connect to your [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] account . Once connected, you can see reports. You only have to do this step once.

1. Select the **Get Started with Power BI** link in the **[!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports** part.
2. The **Set Up [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports in Business Central** assisted setup starts. Select **Next** to continue.
3. On the **Check your Power BI License** page, do one of the following steps:

    - If you didn't sign up for Power BI yet, select the [Go to Power BI homepage](https://powerbi.microsoft.com). Sign up for an account, then come back to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and finish the setup.

    - If you already have a license, select **Next**.
4. In the next page, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will now upload a demo report to Power BI. This step takes a few minutes, so it runs in the background. To complete the setup, select **Next**, then **Finish**.

The connection process starts. During the process, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] communicates with the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-service-name](includes/powerbi-service-name.md)] to determine if you have a valid [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] account  and license. Once your license is verified, the default Power BI report displays on the page. If there a report isn't shown, you can select a report from the part.

> [!TIP]
> With [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, this step automatically uploads default [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports used in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to your Power BI workspace.

## <a name="apps"></a>Use Power BI apps 

[!INCLUDE [powerbi-apps-overview](includes/powerbi-apps-overview.md)]

[!INCLUDE [powerbi-apps-overview-table](includes/powerbi-apps-overview-table.md)]

The [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] apps are free to install and use, the only requirement is that users need to have a non-free Power BI license. To learn more, go to [Installing Power BI apps for Business Central](across-powerbi-install-business-central-apps.md).


<!--#### From [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises

Connecting to Power BI from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is similar to online. However, you might be prompted on the **MICROSOFT ENTRA SERVICE PERMISSIONS** page to grant access to [!INCLUDE [powerbi-service-name](includes/powerbi-service-name.md)]s. To grant access, select **Authorize Azure Services**, and then **Accept**.

Once connected, you can select a report from the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] part on pages.-->

## Work with [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports

### Get the latest data

Each Power BI report is based on a dataset that gets data from the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] sources. You want to make sure that the data in your [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports is up to date with the data in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. This concept is referred to as *refreshing*.  Depending on how your organization set up Power BI, refreshing might not happen automatically. There are two ways to refresh data: manually or by scheduling a refresh. Manual refreshing is done on-demand, as needed. Scheduled refreshing lets you refresh automatically at defined time intervals.

#### Refresh manually

From Power BI online, in the navigation pane, under **Datasets**, select **More options (...)** next to the dataset, then select **Refresh now**.

#### Schedule a refresh

From Power BI online, in the navigation pane, under Datasets, select More options (...) next to the dataset, then select **Schedule refresh**. Fill in the information under the **Schedule refresh** section, and select **Apply**.

Learn more in [Configure scheduled refresh](/power-bi/connect-data/refresh-scheduled-refresh)

### Show reports on list pages

[!INCLUDE[prod_long](includes/prod_long.md)] includes a Power BI FactBox on several key list pages. This FactBox provides extra insight into the data in the list. As you move between rows in the list, the report is updated and filtered for the selected entry.

To learn how to create reports for list pages, see [Creating [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports for Displaying List Data in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]](across-how-use-powerbi-reports-factbox.md).

> [!TIP]
> If you don't see the Power BI FactBox, it might be hidden on your workspace by personalization. Select the ![Settings.](media/ui-experience/settings_icon_small.png "Settings icon for role center") icon, and then select **Personalize** action. Learn more in [Personalize Your Workspace](ui-personalization-user.md).
>
> Or if you have an older version of Business Central, go to the action bar, select **Actions** > **Display** > **Show/Hide [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports**.

### Switch reports

A [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] part on a page can display any Power BI report that's available to you. To switch to view another report, choose the **Select Report** action from the drop-down command list at the top of the part.  

The **[!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports Selection** page shows a list of all the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports that you have access to. This list is retrieved from any of your own workspaces or workspaces that others shared with you in the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-service-name](includes/powerbi-service-name.md)]. Select the **Enable** box for each report that you want to display on the page, and then choose **OK**. You return to the page, and the last report you enabled appears. Using the drop-down command list, use the **Previous** and **Next** commands to navigate between reports.  

### Get more reports

If you don't see any reports on the **[!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports Selection** page, or don't see the report you want, choose **Get Reports**. This action lets you look for reports from two locations: *My Organization* or from *Services*.

- Select **My Organization** to go to the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-service-name](includes/powerbi-service-name.md)]s. From here, you can view the reports within your organization that you have rights to view. You can then add them to your workspace.
- Select **Services** to go to Microsoft AppSource where you can install Power BI apps.  

> [!TIP]
> If you have Power BI Desktop, you can also create new [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports. Then, once those reports are published to your Power BI workspace, they appear on the **[!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports Selection** page.  

### Manage and modify reports

You can make changes to a report in the Power BI part. The changes that you make are then published to the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-service-name](includes/powerbi-service-name.md)]. If the report is shared with other users, they'll also see the changes, unless you save the changes to a new report.

To modify a report, choose the **Manage Report** action from the drop-down command list in the Power BI part. Then start making changes. Once you finish making changes, select **File** > **Save**. If it's a shared report, and you don't want to make the change for all users, select **Save As** to avoid making this change for all users.

When you return to the role center, the updated report appears. If you used **Save As**, you have to choose **Select Report**, and then enable the new report to see it.

> [!NOTE]
> This capability isn't available with [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises.

### <a name="upload"></a>Upload reports

[!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports can be distributed among users as .pbix files. If you have any .pbix files, you can upload and share them with all users of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The reports are shared within each company in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

To upload a report, select the **Upload Report** action from the drop-down command list on the **[!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports** part. Then, locate the .pbix file that defines the reports that you want to share. You can change the default name of the file.  

After the report uploads to your Power BI workspace, it automatically uploads to other users' Power BI workspaces.

> [!NOTE]
> Uploading a report through [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] requires that you have SUPER user permissions in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. You don't need any special permission to upload reports to your workspace through the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-service-name](includes/powerbi-service-name.md)].

## <a name="upload"></a>Upload reports from files

[!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports can be distributed among users as .pbix files. If you have a .pbix file, you can upload the file to a workspace. To upload a report, do the following steps:

1. In your new workspace, select **Get Data**.
1. In the Files box, select **Get**.

3. Select **Local File**, navigate to where you saved the file, and select **Open**.

Learn more in [Upload the report to the service](/power-bi/paginated-reports/paginated-reports-quickstart-aw#upload-the-report-to-the-service).

<!--
> [!NOTE]
> Uploading a report requires that you have a [Premium capacity](/power-bi/service-premium-what-is) work space. Learn more in [Managing Premium capacities](/power-bi/admin/service-premium-capacity-manage). -->

> [!TIP]
> If you're using [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, you can also upload a report from within [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Learn more in [Work with [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] - Upload Reports](across-working-with-powerbi.md#upload).

## <a name="share"></a>Share reports with others

Once a report is in your workspace, you can share it with others in your organization.

To share a report, in a list reports, or in an open report, select **Share**. In the **Share report** pane, enter the full email addresses for individuals or distribution groups you want to share with. Follow the instructions on screen to complete the sharing. Learn more in [Share a dashboard or report](/power-bi/collaborate-share/service-share-dashboards#share-a-dashboard-or-report).

> [!NOTE]
> Sharing requires that both you and the people you're sharing the report with have [Power BI Pro license](/power-bi/service-features-license-type). Otherwise, the content must be in [Premium capacity](/power-bi/service-premium-what-is). Learn more in [Ways to share your work in Power BI](/power-bi/service-how-to-collaborate-distribute-dashboards-reports).

## Fixing problems

However, if something goes wrong, this section provides a workaround for the most typical issues.  

### You don't have a [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] account 

A [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] account  isn't set up for you. To get a valid [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] account , you must have a license, and you must have previously signed into Power BI to create a Power BI workspace.

### Message: There are no enabled reports. Choose Select Report to see a list of reports that you can display.

This message appears if the default report failed to deploy to your Power BI workspace. Or it deployed but didn't refresh successfully. Navigate to the report in your Power BI workspace, select **Dataset**, **Settings**, and then manually update the credentials. Once the dataset successfully refreshes, navigate back to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], and manually select the report from the **Select Reports** page.

#### You can't see a report on the Select Report page on a list page

It's probably because the report's name doesn't contain the name of the list page. Clear the filter to get a full list of [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports available.

# Bulk Invoicing for Microsoft Bookings in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]

If your company uses the Bookings app in Microsoft 365, you can do bulk invoicing for appointments. The **Bookings Not Invoiced** page in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides a list of the company's completed bookings. In this page you can quickly select the appointments that you want to invoice and create draft invoices for the services provided.  

## Connect to Bookings

To connect your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with Bookings, you must specify your Bookings company, what to synchronize with Bookings, how often to synchronize, and which templates to use. You set up this information on the **Booking Sync. Setup** page, which you can launch from the **Exchange Sync. Setup** page, which you can find through [Search](ui-search.md).  

For example, if you want to synchronize customers between Bookings and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you must specify the default template to use to add new customers in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] based on the customers in your Bookings company.  

> [!NOTE]
> The Bookings app is designed to book appointments for individual customers rather than companies. The synchronization with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will, therefore, only synchronize customer contacts with a Type of *Person*. An email address is also required for the contact to synchronize.  

Similarly, if you want to synchronize service items between Bookings and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you must specify the default template to use to add new service items in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] based on the services in our Bookings company.  

> [!NOTE]
> Only items of type *Service* will synchronize between Bookings and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The template that you set up in the **Configuration Templates** page so it can be used for the item synchronization must define the type as *Service*.

## Invoice Appointments

When it is time to send invoices for the completed bookings, you go to the **Bookings Not Invoiced** page. Depending on how often the information is synchronized, the list is long or short. You can create invoices for all bookings in the list or one booking at a time. You can select one or more entries in the list and invoice those only.  

The support for invoicing appointments from Bookings is simpler than the fuller workflow of working with sales quotes, sales orders, and sales invoices. For more information, see [Invoice Sales](sales-how-invoice-sales.md). You can choose to sell your services using [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] or choose to use Bookings, depending on your business needs.  

> [!NOTE]
> In May 2022, we discovered an issue in the integration with Bookings. Currently, the sync from Bookings to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] requires you to manually associate the invoices with customers in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

# Invoicing prepayments

[!INCLUDE [prepayment_def](includes/prepayment_def.md)]

[!INCLUDE [prepayment_req](includes/prepayment_req.md)]

For example, you can specify a total amount for the entire order, or you can distribute the prepayment across each line on the order. You can also send additional prepayment invoices if, for example, additional items are added to the order. You can increase quantities or add new lines to an order after issuing a prepayment, and then you can post another prepayment invoice.  

> [!NOTE]
> If you want to delete a line for which a prepayment has already been invoiced, you must issue a prepayment credit memo before you can delete the line.

The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the articles that describe them.

# Design details: Handling reordering policies

To include an item in supply planning, you must specify a reordering policy for it on the **Item Card** page. The following reordering policies are available:  

* Fixed Reorder Qty.  
* Maximum Qty.  
* Order  
* Lot-for-Lot  

The **Fixed Reorder Qty.** and **Maximum Qty.** policies relate to inventory planning. These policies coexist with the step-by-step balancing of supply and order tracking.  

## The role of the reorder point

A reorder point represents demand during lead time. When inventory is projected to pass below the level defined by the reorder point, it's time to order more. Inventory decreases gradually until the replenishment arrives. It might reach zero or the safety stock level. The planning system suggests a forward-scheduled supply order at the point when the inventory passes below the reorder point.  

Inventory levels can move significantly during the time bucket. Therefore, the planning system constantly monitors available inventory.

## Monitoring the projected inventory level and the reorder point

Inventory is a type of supply, but for inventory planning, the planning system distinguishes between two inventory levels:  

* Projected inventory  
* Projected available inventory  

### Projected inventory  

At the start of the planning process, projected inventory is the gross quantity of inventory. The gross quantity includes posted and unposted supply and demand in the past. This quantity becomes a projected inventory level that gross quantities from future supply and demand maintain. Future supply and demand are introduced along the time line, whether reserved or allocated in other ways.  

The planning system uses projected inventory to monitor the reorder point and determine the reorder quantity using the **Maximum Qty.** reordering policy.  

### Projected available inventory  

Projected available inventory is the inventory that is available to fulfill demand at a given point in time. The planning system uses projected available inventory when monitoring the safety stock level. Safety stock must always be available for unexpected demand.  

### Time buckets  

Projected inventory is important detecting when the reorder point is reached or crossed, and to calculate the right order quantity when using the **Maximum Qty.** reordering policy.  

The projected inventory level is calculated at the start of the planning period. It's a gross level that doesn't consider reservations or other allocations. To monitor this inventory level during the planning sequence, the planning system monitors the aggregated changes over a period of time. That period is called a *time bucket*. To learn more about time buckets, go to [The role of the time bucket](#the-role-of-the-time-bucket). The planning system ensures that the time bucket is at least one day. One day is the minimum unit of time for demand or supply events.  

### Determining the projected inventory level  

The following sequence describes how the planning system determines the projected inventory level:  

* When a supply event is fully planned, such as a purchase order, it increases the projected inventory on the event's due date.  
* When a demand event is fully satisfied, it doesn't decrease the projected inventory right away. Instead, it posts a decrease reminder, which is an internal record that holds the date and quantity of the addition to projected inventory.  
* When a later supply event is planned and added to the timeline, the system investigates posted decrease reminders one by one to the planned date of the supply. During this process, the reorder point level of the internal increase reminder might be reached or crossed.  
* When a new supply order is introduced, it checks whether it was entered before the current supply. If it is, the new supply becomes current supply and the balancing procedure restarts.  

The following image shows this principle.  

![Determining the Projected Inventory Level.](media/nav_app_supply_planning_2_projected_inventory.png "Determining the Projected Inventory Level")  

1. Supply **Sa** of 4 (fixed) closes Demand **Da** of -3.  
2. CloseDemand: Create a decrease reminder of -3 (not shown).  
3. Supply **Sa** is closed with a surplus of 1 (there isn't more demand).  

     The projected inventory level increases to +4, while the projected **available** inventory becomes -1.  

4. The next supply **Sb** of 2 (another order) is already placed on the timeline.  
5. The planning system checks for a decrease reminder before **Sb** (in this example there isn't, so no action is taken).  
6. The planning system closes supply **Sb** (no more demand exists) by either A, reducing it to 0 (cancel) or B, by leaving it as is.  

     The projected inventory level increases (A: +0 => +4 or B: +2 = +6).  

7. The planning system makes a final check. Is there any decrease reminder? Yes, there's one on the date of **Da**.  
8. The planning system adds the decrease reminder of -3 reminder to the projected inventory level, either A: +4 -3 = 1 or B: +6 -3 = +3.  
9. For A, the planning system creates a forward-scheduled order starting on date **Da**. For B, the reorder point is reached and a new order is created.

## The role of the time bucket

The purpose of the time bucket is to collect demand events within a time period in order to make a joint supply order.  

For reordering policies that use a reorder point, you can define a time bucket. Time buckets help ensure that demands within the same time period are accumulated. The system then checks the effect on projected inventory and whether the reorder point is passed.

If you pass the reorder point, the system forward schedules a new supply order from the end of the time bucket. Time buckets begin on the planning starting date.  

The time bucket concept reflects the manual process of checking the inventory level on a frequent basis rather than for each transaction. You define the frequency (the time bucket). For example, you might gather all item needs from a vendor to place a weekly order.  

![Example of time bucket in planning.](media/nav_app_supply_planning_2_reorder_cycle.png "Example of time bucket in planning")  

Time buckets are often used to avoid a cascade effect. For example, a balanced row of demand and supply where an early demand is canceled, or a new one is created. The result would be that every supply order (except the last one) is rescheduled.

## Stay below the overflow level

When using the **Maximum Qty.** and **Fixed Reorder Qty.** reordering policies, the planning system focuses on the projected inventory in the given time-bucket only. It might suggest extra supply when negative demand or positive supply changes happen outside the time bucket. For extra supply, the planning system calculates the quantity by which you should decrease the supply. This quantity is called the "overflow level." The overflow is available as a planning line with a **Change Qty. (Decrease)** or **Cancel** action and the following warning message:  

* Attention: The projected inventory [xx] is higher than the overflow level [xx] on the Due Date [xx].*  

![Inventory overflow level.](media/supplyplanning_2_overflow1_new.png "Inventory overflow level")  

### Calculating the overflow level  

The overflow level is calculated in different ways depending on the reordering policy.  

#### Maximum Qty.

Overflow level = maximum inventory  

> [!NOTE]  
> If you use a minimum order quantity, it's added as follows:
>
> overflow level = maximum inventory + minimum order quantity.  

#### Fixed Reorder Qty.  

overflow level = reorder quantity + reorder point  

> [!NOTE]  
> If the minimum order quantity is higher than the reorder point, it's replaced as follows:
>
> overflow level = reorder quantity + minimum order quantity  

#### Order multiple  

If an order multiple exists, it adjusts the overflow level for both the Maximum Qty. and Fixed Reorder Qty. reordering policies.  

### Creating the planning line with an overflow warning  

A planning line is created when a supply causes the projected inventory to be higher than the overflow level at the end of a time bucket. To warn about the extra supply, the planning line has a warning message, the **Accept Action Message** field isn't selected, and the action message is either **Cancel** or **Change Qty.**  

#### Calculating the planning line quantity  

The quantity on a planning line is calculated as follows:

planning line quantity = current supply quantity – (projected inventory – overflow level)  

> [!NOTE]  
> As with all warning lines, the maximum and minimum order quantity and order multiple are ignored.  

#### Defining the action message type  

* If the planning line quantity is higher than 0, the action message is **Change Qty.**  
* If the planning line quantity is equal to or less than 0, the action message is **Cancel**  

#### Composing the warning message  

If there's overflow, the **Untracked Planning Elements** page displays a warning message with the following information:  

* The projected inventory level that triggered the warning  
* The calculated overflow level  
* The due date of the supply event  

Example: “The projected inventory 120 is higher than the overflow level 60 on 01-28-23”  

### Example scenario  

In this scenario, a customer changes a sales order from 70 to 40 pieces between two planning runs. The overflow feature reduces the purchase that was suggested for the initial sales quantity.  

#### Item setup  

|Reordering Policy|Maximum Qty.|  
|-----------------------|------------------|  
|Maximum Order Quantity|100|  
|Reorder Point|50|  
|Inventory|80|  

#### Situation before a sales decrease  

|Event|Change Qty.|Projected Inventory|  
|-----------|-----------------|-------------------------|  
|Day one|None|80|  
|Sale|-70|10|  
|End of time bucket|None|10|  
|Suggest new purchase order|+90|100|  

#### Situation after sales decrease  

|Change|Change Qty.|Projected Inventory|  
|------------|-----------------|-------------------------|  
|Day one|None|80|  
|Sale|-40|40|  
|Purchase|+90|130|  
|End of time bucket|None|130|  
|Suggest to decrease purchase<br><br> order from 90 to 60|-30|100|  

#### Resulting planning lines  

The system creates a warning planning line to reduce the purchase by 30, from 90 to 60, to keep the projected inventory at 100 according to the overflow level.  

![Plan according to overflow level.](media/nav_app_supply_planning_2_overflow2.png "Plan according to overflow level")  

> [!NOTE]  
> Without the overflow feature, no warning is created if the projected inventory level is above the maximum, which could cause an extra supply of 30.

## Handling projected negative inventory

The reorder point expresses the anticipated demand during the lead time of the item. The projected inventory must be large enough to cover the demand until the new order is received. Meanwhile, the safety stock should take care of fluctuations in demand up to a targeted service level.  

The planning system considers it an emergency if a future demand can't be served from the projected inventory. Or, expressed in another way, that the projected inventory goes negative. The system suggests that you create a new supply order to cover the unmet part of the demand. The size of the new supply order doesn't consider the maximum inventory or the reorder quantity nor the following order modifiers:

* Maximum order quantity
* Minimum order quantity
* Order multiple 

Instead, it reflects the exact deficiency.  

The planning line for this type of supply order displays an **Emergency** warning icon provide additional information about the situation.  

In the following image, supply D represents an emergency order to adjust for negative inventory.  

![Emergency planning suggestion to avoid negative inventory.](media/nav_app_supply_planning_2_negative_inventory.png "Emergency planning suggestion to avoid negative inventory")  

1. Supply **A**, initial projected inventory, is below the reorder point.  
2. A new forward-scheduled supply is created (**C**).  

     (quantity = maximum inventory – projected inventory level)  
3. Supply **A** is closed by demand **B**, which isn't fully covered.  

     (Demand **B** could try to schedule Supply C in, but the time-bucket prevents that.)  
4. New supply (**D**) is created to cover the remaining quantity on Demand **B**.  
5. Demand **B** is closed (creating a reminder to the projected inventory).  
6. The new supply **D** is closed.  
7. Projected inventory is checked. The reorder point isn't crossed.  
8. Supply **C** is closed (there's no more demand).  
9. Final check. There are no outstanding inventory level reminders.  

The following section describes the characteristics of the four supported reordering policies.

## Reordering policies

Reordering policies define how much to order when the item needs to be replenished. Four different reordering policies exist.  

### Fixed Reorder Quantity

The Fixed Reorder Qty. policy is typically used for inventory planning for items with the following characteristics:

* Low inventory cost
* Low risk of obsolescence
* Low number of items

Typically, use this policy with a reorder point that reflects the anticipated demand during the item's lead time.  

#### Calculated per time bucket  

If you reach or cross at the reorder point in a time bucket (reorder cycle), the system suggests two actions:

* Create a new supply order for the reorder quantity
* Forward schedule the order from the first date after the end of the time bucket  

The time bucketed reorder point reduces the number of supply suggestions. It reflects a process of manually checking to actual contents of bins in your warehouse.  

#### Creates only necessary supply  

Before it suggests a new supply order to meet a reorder point, the planning system checks for the following supply:

* Whether supply is already ordered
* Whether you expect to receive the supply within the item’s lead time

The system doesn't suggest a new supply order if a supply brings the projected inventory to the reorder point within the lead time.  

Supply orders that are created specifically to meet a reorder point are excluded from supply balancing and aren't changed. If you want to phase out an item that has a reorder point, review your outstanding supply orders manually or change the reordering policy to **Lot-for-Lot**. The system reduces or cancels extra supply.  

#### Combines with order modifiers  

The Minimum Order Quantity, Maximum Order Quantity, and Order Multiple order modifiers shouldn't play a significant role when you use the Fixed Reorder Qty. policy. However, the planning system takes them into account:

* Decrease the quantity to the specified maximum order quantity (and create two or more supplies in order to reach the total order quantity)
* Increase the order to the specified minimum order quantity
* Round up the order quantity to meet a specified order multiple  

#### Combines with calendars  

Before suggesting a new supply order to meet a reorder point, the planning system checks whether the order is scheduled for a nonworking day. It uses the calendars you specify in the **Base Calendar Code** field on the **Company Information** and **Location Card** pages.  

If the scheduled date is a nonworking day, the planning system moves the order forward to the nearest work day. Moving the date might result in an order that meets a reorder point but doesn't meet a specific demand. For such unbalanced demand, the planning system creates an extra supply.  

#### Shouldn't be used with forecasts  

Because the anticipated demand is already expressed in the reorder point level, it isn't necessary to include a forecast in the planning. If it's relevant to base the plan on a forecast, use the **Lot-for-Lot** policy.  

#### Must not be used with reservations  

If you reserve a quantity, for instance a quantity in inventory, for a distant demand, you might disturb the planning foundation. Even if the projected inventory level is acceptable in relation to the reorder point, the quantities might not be available. The system might try to compensate by creating exception orders. However, we recommend that the **Reserve** field is set to **Never** on items that are planned using a reorder point.

### Maximum Quantity

The Maximum Quantity policy is a way to maintain inventory using a reorder point.  

Everything regarding the Fixed Reorder Qty. policy also applies to this policy. The only difference is the quantity of the suggested supply. When you use the maximum quantity policy, the reorder quantity is defined dynamically based on the projected inventory level. Therefore, it usually differs from order to order.  

#### Calculate per time bucket

When you reach or cross the reorder point, the system determines the reorder quantity at the end of a time bucket. It measures the gap between the current projected inventory level and the specified maximum inventory to determine the quantity to order. The system then checks:

* Whether supply is already ordered
* Whether you expect to receive the supply within the item’s lead time

If so, the system reduces the quantity of the new supply order by the quantities already ordered.  

If you don't specify a maximum inventory quantity, the planning system ensures that the projected inventory reaches the reorder quantity.

#### Combine with order modifiers

Depending on your setup, it might be best to combine the Maximum Quantity policy with order modifiers:

* Ensure a minimum order quantity
* Round the quantity to an integer number of purchase units of measure
* Split the quantity into lots as defined by the maximum order quantity  

### Combine with calendars

Before suggesting a new supply order to meet a reorder point, the planning system checks whether the order is scheduled for a nonworking day. It uses the calendars you specify in the **Base Calendar Code** field in the **Company Information** and **Location Card** pages.  

If the scheduled date is a nonworking day, the planning system moves the order forward to the nearest work day. Moving the date might result in an order that meets a reorder point but doesn't meet a specific demand. For such unbalanced demand, the planning system creates an extra supply.

### Order

In a make-to-order environment, an item is purchased or produced to cover a specific demand. Typically, the Order reordering policy is used for items with the following characteristics

* Demand is infrequent
* The lead-time is insignificant
* Required attributes vary  

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates an order-to-order link, which acts as a preliminary connection between the supply (a supply order or inventory) and the demand. You can apply the order-to-order link during planning in the following ways:  

* When you use the Make-to-Order manufacturing policy to create multi-level or project type production orders (producing needed components on the same production order)  
* When you use sales order planning to create a production order from a sales order  

> [!TIP]
> If item attributes don't vary, it might be best to use a Lot-for-Lot reordering policy. As a result, the system uses unplanned inventory and only accumulates sales orders with the same shipment date or within a defined time bucket.  

#### Order-to-order links and past due dates

Unlike most supply-demand sets, linked orders with due dates before the planning starting date are fully planned for by the system. The reason for this exception is that specific demand-supply sets must be synchronized. To learn more about the frozen zone that applies to most demand-supply types, go to [Process orders before the planning start date](design-details-balancing-demand-and-supply.md#process-orders-before-the-planning-start-date).

### Lot-for-Lot

The Lot-for-Lot policy is the most flexible because the system only reacts to actual demand. It acts on anticipated demand from forecast and blanket orders and then settles the order quantity based on the demand. The policy is intended for items where inventory can be accepted but should be avoided.  

In some ways, the Lot-for-Lot policy is similar to the Order policy. It can accept quantities in inventory, and it bundles demand and supply in the time buckets you define.

You specify the time bucket in the **Time Bucket** field on the **Item Card** page. The minimum size of time bucket is one day, because that's the smallest time unit of measure on demand and supply events in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

The time bucket also limits when you should reschedule a supply order to meet a given demand. Supply within the time bucket is rescheduled in or out to meet the demand. Earlier supply causes extra inventory, and you should cancel it. For supply that's later, create a new supply order.  

With this policy, you can specify a safety stock to compensate for changes in supply or to meet a sudden demand. The lot-for-lot policy can also include a dampener period and dampener quantity to reduce order scheduling.  

Together with the **Rescheduling Period** field, the **Lot Accumulation Period** field contributes to defining the reorder cycle. From the date of the first demand, the system accumulates all demands in the next lot accumulation period into one supply order on the date of the first demand. Demand that is outside the lot accumulation period isn't covered by the supply order.

Because the supply order quantity is based on the actual demand, it can make sense to use order modifiers:

* Round up the order quantity to meet an order multiple (or purchase unit of measure)
* Increase the order to a specified minimum order quantity
* Decrease the quantity to the specified maximum quantity (and thus create two or more supplies to reach the total needed quantity)

# Collect outstanding balances

This article describes features that can help you collect outstanding balances from your customers.

When customer payments are registered and reconciled, the collections process often involves one or more of the following steps to collect outstanding balances. Depending on the way you handle collections in your business, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can help you:

- Send statements to inform customers about their balances, overdue balances, and the relevant transactions. For example, either open entries or all entries posted in last year/quarter/month or other period. If customers have overdue payments, you can begin by sending the Customer Statement report as a reminder. To learn more, go to [Statements](#statements).
- Send reminders (also known as *dunning letters* or *payment requests*) to customers to inform them of overdue balances. The reminder can include both overdue and open entries, so the customer is also aware of upcoming due dates. You can also use reminders to calculate finance charges, such as interest or fees and include them on the reminder. You can automate the processes for creating, issuing, and posting reminders. To learn more, go to [Reminders](#reminders).  
- Send finance charge memos to claim interest fees for overdue amounts. Use finance charge memos if you want to debit customers for interest or fees without reminding them of overdue amounts. To learn more, go to [Finance Charges](#finance-charges).
- Communicate with customers over the phone or by e-mail regarding overdue balances and manage potential misunderstandings and disputes, or simply to remind customers to balance their accounts in a more direct manner. To learn more, go to [Use Copilot for Finance in Outlook to streamline manual collections work](#use-copilot-for-finance-in-outlook-to-streamline-manual-collections-work).

## Use Copilot for Finance in Outlook to streamline manual collections work

> [!NOTE]
> Copilot for Finance is currently in preview and available in the United States. It's planned to become generally available in the second half of 2024, at which point pricing information is expected to be published.

When you're communicating with customers via e-mail about outstanding balances, chances are you need to look up customer and invoice related information in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Copilot for Finance makes this task easier by ensuring that relevant customer data is on hand in Outlook. For example, for an email you received, Copilot for Finance can find the customer through the linked contact and display aged balance information and list outstanding invoices that you can easily attach to a reply. Copilot for Finance in Outlook also lets you:

- Access and update the **Dispute Status** and **Promise to Pay** date on invoices
- Update contact information
- Draft e-mail replies with Copilot
- Attach a statement and invoices directly from Outlook.

To learn more, go to [Copilot for Finance](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-copilot/microsoft-copilot-for-finance) and [Deployment Guide for Copilot for Finance (preview)](/copilot/finance/get-started/deployment-guide).

## Statements

From the customer card, you can create a statement for customer's transactions with you. Then, you can generate a PDF file and send it to the customer. Alternatively, use the **Customer Statement** report to send your customers an overview of their business with you.

> [!TIP]
> If needed, you can send the statement to Excel to make changes.  

### To send the Customer Statement report

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 10.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customer Statement**, and then choose the related link.
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
3. Under **Output Options**, select how to send the report to the customer.

> [!NOTE]
> If you're using multiple currencies, the Customer Statement report is always printed in the customer's currency. The last date in a statement period is also used as the statement date and the aging date, if aging is included.

## Reminders

[!INCLUDE [receivables-reminders](includes/receivables-reminders.md)]

## Finance charges

When a customer doesn't pay by the due date, you can have finance charges calculated automatically and add them to the overdue amounts on the customer's account. You can inform customers of the added charges by sending finance charge memos.  

> [!NOTE]  
> You use finance charge memos to calculate interest and finance charges and to inform your customers about interest and finance charges without reminding them of overdue payments. Alternatively, you can calculate interest on overdue payments when you create reminders.  

Before you can create finance charge memos, you must set up terms. For more information, see [Set Up Finance Charge Terms](finance-setup-finance-charges.md).  

You can manually create a finance charge memo for an individual customer, and fill in the lines automatically. Alternatively, you can use the **Create Finance Charge Memos** action to create finance charge memos for all or selected customers with overdue balances.  

After you create the finance charge memos, you can modify them. The text that appears at the beginning and end of the finance charge memo is determined by the finance charge terms, and can be seen in the **Description** column on the lines. If a calculated amount is added automatically in the beginning or ending text, the text won't be adjusted if you delete lines. Then you must use the **Update Finance Charge Text** action.  

After you have created finance charge memos and made any needed modifications, you can either print test reports or issue the finance charge memos, typically as email.

### To create a finance charge memo manually

A finance charge memo is similar to an invoice. You can fill in a header manually and have the lines filled in for you, or you can create finance charge memos for all customers automatically.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 2.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Finance Charge Memos**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action, and then fill in the fields as necessary.  
3. Choose **Suggest Fin. Charge Memo Lines** action.
4. On the **Suggest Finance Charge Memo Lines** page, set a filter on the **Cust. Ledger Entry** FastTab if you want to create finance charge memos only for specific entries.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Although they're listed, selecting **Payment** and **Credit Memo** as **Document Type** filters won't have an effect because the **Suggest Finance Charge Memo Lines** action only handles positive amounts.
5. Choose the **OK** button to start the batch job.  

### To update finance charge memo texts

In some cases, you might want to modify the beginning and ending text for the finance charge terms. If you do this at a time when you have created, but not yet issued, finance charge memos, you can update the memos with the modified text.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 3.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Finance Charge Memo**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the finance charge memo that you want to change text for, and then choose the **Update Finance Charge Text** action.
3. On the **Update Finance Charge Text** page, you can set a filter if you want to update several memos.
4. Choose the **OK** button to update the beginning and ending texts.  

### To issue finance charge memos

After you create finance charge memos and make any needed modifications, you can either print test reports or issue the finance charge memos.

When you issue a reminder, the entries post according to your specifications on the **Finance Charge Terms** page. This specification determines whether interest and/or additional fees post to the customer's account and the general ledger. Settings on the **Customer Posting Groups** page determine the accounts that interest or fees post to.

For each customer ledger entry on the finance charge memo, an entry is created on the **Reminder/Fin. Charge Entries** page.

If the **Post Interest** or the **Post Additional Fee** checkboxes are selected on the **Finance Charge Terms** page, the following entries are also created:

- One entry on the **Cust. Ledger Entries** page
- One receivables entry in the relevant G/L account
- One interest and/or one additional fee entry in the relevant G/L account

Also, issuing the finance charge memo might result in VAT entries.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 4.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Finance Charge Memos**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the relevant memo, and then choose the **Issue** action.
3. On the **Issue Finance Charge Memos** page, fill in the fields as necessary.
4. Choose the **OK** button.

The finance charge memo is either printed for sent to a specified email as a PDF attachment.

### To cancel an issued finance charge memo

If finance charge memos were issued in error, you can cancel them before they're sent out. You can do this either one by one or as a batch.

1. On the **Issued Finance Charge Memos** page, select one or more lines for issued finance charge memos that you want to cancel, and then choose the **Cancel** action.
2. On the **Cancel Issued Fin. Charge Memos** page, fill in the fields as necessary, and then choose the **OK** button.

### To view reminder and finance charge entries  

When you issue a reminder, a reminder entry is created on the **Reminder/Fin. Charge Entries** page for each reminder line that contains a customer ledger entry. You can then get an overview of the created reminder entries for a specific customer.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 5.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customers**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the relevant customer card, and then choose the **Ledger Entries** action.
3. On the **Customer Ledger Entries** page, select the line with the ledger entry you want to see the reminder entries for, and then choose the **Reminder/Fin. Charge Entries** action.

# Track your business KPIs with Power BI metrics

If you use Power BI on [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] data, it's easy to track KPIs or metrics that are important to you.

With metrics in Power BI, you can curate your own metrics and track them against key business objectives, in a single pane. This feature enhances data culture by promoting accountability, alignment, and visibility for teams and initiatives within organizations.

Follow this four-step process to set up Power BI metrics:

1. Create a scorecard in Power BI. Learn more at [Create scorecards in Power BI](/power-bi/create-reports/service-goals-create).  
2. Add the metrics you want to track by connecting to your Power BI report on telemetry. Learn more at [Create connected metrics](/power-bi/create-reports/service-goals-create-connected).  
3. Add alerting, if needed, to define status rules for your metrics. Learn more at [Create automated status rules for metrics](/power-bi/create-reports/service-metrics-status-rules).  

    This step automates status updates based on rules that govern the metric. Rules trigger changes based on value, percentage of target met, date conditions, or a combination of the three, making the rules versatile. For connected metrics, these status rules refresh every time the data in your scorecard refreshes.
4. Follow metrics to get alerts in Teams or by email. Learn more at [Follow your metrics](/power-bi/create-reports/service-metrics-follow).  

Learn more about Power BI metrics at [Get started with metrics in Power BI](/power-bi/create-reports/service-goals-introduction).

> [!NOTE]
> Starting with Business Central 2023 release wave 2, it's possible to embed scorecards from Power BI metrics in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

# Design details: reservation, order tracking, and action messaging

The comprehensive reservation system includes the interrelated and parallel features of Order Tracking and Action Messaging.  

At the core of the reservation system, is the linking of a demand entry and a corresponding supply entry, either through reservation or order tracking. A reservation is a user-generated link, and an order tracking record is a system-generated link. An item quantity entered in the reservation system is either reserved or order tracked, but not both at the same time. How the systems handle an item depends on how the item is setup.  

The reservation system interacts with the planning system by creating action messages on planning lines during planning runs. An action message can be considered an appendage to an order tracking record. Action messages, whether created dynamically in order tracking or during the planning run, provide a convenient tool for efficient supply planning.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Reserved quantities are ignored by the planning system, that is, the hard link that is made between supply and demand cannot be changed through planning.  

 The reservations system also forms the structural foundation for the item tracking system. For more information, go to [Design Details: Item Tracking](design-details-item-tracking.md).  

 <!--For more detailed information about how the reservation system works, see the _Reservation Entry Table_ white paper on [PartnerSource](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=258348).  -->

## Reservation  

 A reservation is a firm link that connects a specific demand and a specific supply to each other. This link directly affects the subsequent inventory transaction and ensures the proper application of item entries for costing purposes. A reservation overrides the default costing method of an item. For more information, go to [Design Details: Item Tracking](design-details-item-tracking.md).  

 The **Reservation** page is accessible from all order lines of both demand and supply types. On this page, the user can specify which demand or supply entry to create a reservation link towards. The reservation consists of a pair of records that share the same entry number. One record has a negative sign and points to the demand. The other record has a positive sign and points to the supply. These records are stored in the *Reservation Entry* table with the status value *Reservation*. The user can view all reservations on the **Reservation Entries** page.  

### Offsetting in reservations  

 Reservations are made against available item quantities. Item availability is calculated in basic terms as follows:  

 `available quantity = inventory + scheduled receipts - gross requirements`

 The following table shows the details of the order network entities that are part of the availability calculation.  

||Field in T27 Item|Source table|Table filter|Source field|  
|-|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|  
|**Inventory**|Inventory|Item Ledger Entry|N/A|Quantity|  
|**Scheduled receipts**|FP Order Receipt (Qty.)|Prod. Order Line|=Firm Planned|Remaining Qty. (Base)|  
|**Scheduled receipts**|Rel. Order Receipt (Qty.)|Prod. Order Line|=Released|Remaining Qty. (Base)|  
|**Scheduled receipts**|Qty. on Assembly Order|Assembly Header|=Order|Remaining Qty. (Base)|  
|**Scheduled receipts**|Qty. on Purch. Order|Purchase Line|=Order|Outstanding Qty. (Base)|  
|**Scheduled receipts**|Trans. Ord. Receipt (Qty.)|Transfer Line|N/A|Outstanding Quantity|  
|**Gross requirements**|Qty. On Sales Order|Sales Line|=Order|Outstanding Qty. (Base)|  
|**Gross requirements**|Scheduled Need (Qty.)|Prod. Order Component|<>Simulated|Remaining Qty. (Base)|  
|**Gross requirements**|Qty. on Asm. Component|Assembly Line|=Order|Remaining Qty. (Base)|  
|**Gross requirements**|Trans. Ord. Shipment (Qty.)|Transfer Line|N/A|Outstanding Quantity|  

 For more information, go to [Design Details: Availability in the Warehouse](design-details-availability-in-the-warehouse.md).  

### Manual reservation  

When a user intentionally creates a reservation, the user gains full ownership of and responsibility for these items. This means that the user must also manually change or cancel a reservation. Such manual changes might cause automatic modification of the involved reservations.  

The following table shows when and which modifications might occur:  

|User Action|System Reaction|  
|-----------------|---------------------|  
|Decreasing the reserved quantity|The related quantity fields are updated.|  
|Changing date fields|The related date fields are updated.<br /><br /> **Note:** If the due date on a demand is changed to precede the shipment date or due date of the supply, then the reservation is canceled.|  
|Deleting the order|The reservation is canceled.|  
|Changing location, bin, variant, serial number, or lot number|The reservation is canceled.|  

> [!NOTE]  
> The Late Binding functionality may also change reservations without informing the user, by reshuffling nonspecific reservations of serial or lot numbers. For more information, go to [Design Details: Item Tracking and Reservations](design-details-item-tracking-and-reservations.md).  

### Automatic reservations  

The item card can be set up to automatically reserve items based on demand, such as sales orders. In that case, reservation is made against inventory, purchase orders, assembly orders, and production orders. A warning is issued if the supply is insufficient.  

In addition, various planning functions automatically reserve items to keep a demand linked to a specific supply. The order tracking entries for such planning links contain **Reservation** in the **Reservation Status** field in the *Reservation Entry* table. Automatic reservations are created in the following situations:  

- A multilevel production order where the **Manufacturing Policy** field of the involved parent and child items is set to **Make-to-Order**. The planning system creates reservations between the parent production order and the underlying production order to ensure they process together. This reservation binding overrides the item's default costing and application method.  

- A production, assembly, or purchase order where the **Reordering Policy** field of the involved item is set to **Order**. The planning system creates reservations between the demand and the planned supply to ensure that the specific supply is created. For more information, go to [Order](design-details-handling-reordering-policies.md#order).  

- A production order created from a sales order with the **Sales Order Planning** function is linked to the sales order with an automatic reservation.  

- An assembly order created automatically for a sales order line to fulfill the quantity in the **Qty. to Assemble to Order** field. This automatic reservation links the sales demand and the assembly supply so that sales order processors can customize and promise the assembly item to the customer directly. In addition, the reservation links the assembly output to the sales order line through to the shipping activity that fulfills the customer order.  

For supply or demand that isn't allocated, the planning system automatically assigns a reservation status **Surplus**. This could result from demand that is due to forecasted quantities or user-entered planning parameters. This is a legitimate surplus, which the system recognizes, and it doesn't give rise to action messages. The surplus could also be genuine, excess supply or demand that remains untracked. This is an indication of an imbalance in the order network, which causes the system to issue action messages. Note that an action message that suggests a change in quantity always refers to type **Surplus**. For more information, go to [Example: Order Tracking in Sales, Production, and Transfers](#example-order-tracking-in-sales-production-and-transfers) section in this article.  

Automatic reservations created during the planned run are handled in the following ways:  

- They apply to item quantities included in the availability calculation, just like manual reservations. For more information, go to the "Offsetting in Reservations" section in this article.  

- They're included and potentially changed in subsequent planning runs, unlike manually reserved items.  

## Order tracking  

Order Tracking helps the planner maintain a valid supply plan by providing an overview of the offsetting between demand and supply in the order network. The order tracking records serve as the foundation for creating dynamic action messages and planning line suggestions during planning runs.  

> [!NOTE]  
> The order tracking system offsets available stock as orders are entered into the order network. This implies that the system does not prioritize orders that may be more urgent in terms of their due date. It is therefore up to the logic of the planning system or the wisdom of the planner to rearrange these priorities in a meaningful way.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Order tracking policy and the Get Action Messages function are not integrated with Projects. That means that demand related to a project is not automatically tracked. Because it is not tracked, it could cause the use of an existing replenishment with project information to be tracked to another demand, for example, a sales order. Consequently, you may encounter a situation in which your information about available inventory is out of sync.  

### The order network  

The order tracking system is based on the principle that the order network must always remain balanced, ensuring every demand that enters the system is offset by a corresponding supply and vice versa. The system provides this by identifying logical links between all demand and supply entries in the order network.  

This principle implies that a change in demand results in a corresponding imbalance on the supply side of the order network. Conversely, a change in supply results in a corresponding imbalance on the demand side of the order network. In reality, the order network is in a state of constant flux as users enter, amend, and delete orders. Order Tracking processes orders dynamically, reacting to each change at the time that it enters the system and becomes a part of the order network. As soon as new order tracking records are created, the order network is in balance, but only until the next change occurs.  

To increase the transparency of calculations in the planning system, the **Untracked Planning Elements** page displays untracked quantities, which represent the difference in quantity between known demand and suggested supply. Each line on the page refers to the cause of the excess quantity, such as **Blanket Order**, **Safety Stock Level**, **Fixed Reorder Quantity**, **Minimum Order Qty.**, **Rounding**, or **Dampener**.  

### Offsetting in order tracking  

In contrast to reservations, which can only be made against available item quantities, order tracking is possible against all order network entities that are part of  the net requirements calculation of the planning system. The net requirements are calculated as follows:  

`net requirements = gross requirements + reorder point - scheduled receipts - planned receipts - projected available balance`  

> [!NOTE]  
> Demand that is related to forecasts or planning parameters is not order tracked.  

### Example: Order tracking in sales, production, and transfers  

The following scenario shows which order tracking entries are created in the *Reservation Entry* table as results of various order network changes.  

Assume the following data for two items that are set up for order tracking.  

|Item|Parameter|Detail|
|-|-|-|
|Item 1|Name|Component|
||Availability|100 units in EAST location<br /><br />- 30 units of LOTA<br />- 70 units of LOTB|  
|Item 2|Name|Produced Item|
||Production BOM|1 qty. per of Component|  
||Demand|Sale for 100 units at WEST location|  
||Supply|Released production order (generated with the *Sales Order Planning* function for the sale of 100 units)|  

On the **Manufacturing Setup** page, the **Components at Location** field is set to *EAST*.

The following order tracking entries exist in the *Reservation Entry* table based on the data in the table.  

<!--![First example of order tracking entries in Reservation Entry table.](media/supply_planning_RTAM_1.png "supply_planning_RTAM_1")  -->
**Reservation entries**

|Entry No.|Positive|Item No.|Location Code|Quantity|Reservation Status|Description|Lot No.|Source Type|Source ID|Binding|  
|--------|--------|--------|-------------|--------|------------------|-----------|-------|-----------|---------|-------| 
|8|-|COMPONENT|EAST|-70|Tracking|Component|-|5407|101004|-|
|8|Yes|COMPONENT|EAST|70|Tracking|Component|LOTB|32|-|-| 
|9|-|COMPONENT|EAST|-30|Tracking|Component|-|5407|1001004|-| 
|9|Yes|COMPONENT|EAST|30|Tracking|Component|LOTA|32|-|-| 
|10|-|PRODUCED ITEM|WEST|-100|Reservation|Produced Item|-|37|1001|Order-to-Order|
|10|Yes|PRODUCED ITEM|WEST|100|Reservation|Produced Item|-|5406|101004|Order-to-Order|


#### Entry numbers 8 and 9  

For the component need for LOTA and LOTB respectively, order tracking links are created from the demand in table 5407, *Prod. Order Component*, to the supply in table 32, *Item Ledger Entry*. The **Reservation Status** field contains *Tracking* to indicate that these entries are dynamic order tracking links between supply and demand.  

> [!NOTE]  
> The **Lot No.** field is empty on the demand lines because the lot numbers are not specified on the component lines of the released production order.  

#### Entry number 10  

From the sales demand in table 37, *Sales Lines*, an order tracking link is created to the supply in table 5406, *Prod. Order Line*. The **Reservation Status** field contains *Reservation*, and the **Binding** field contains *Order-to-Order*. This is because the released production order was generated specifically for the sales order and must remain linked, unlike order tracking links with a reservation status of Tracking, which is created and changed dynamically. For more information, go to the [Automatic Reservations](#automatic-reservations) section in this article.  

 At this point in the scenario, the 100 units of LOTA and LOTB are transferred to WEST location by a transfer order.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Only the transfer order shipment is posted at this point, not the receipt.  

 Now the following order tracking entries exist in the *Reservation Entry* table.  

<!-- ![Second example of order tracking entries in Reservation Entry table.](media/supply_planning_RTAM_2.png "supply_planning_RTAM_2")  -->
**Reservation entries**

|Entry No.|Positive|Item No.|Location Code|Quantity|Reservation Status|Description|Lot No.|Source Type|Source ID|Binding|  
|---------|--------|--------|-------------|--------|------------------|-----------|-------|-----------|---------|-------| 
|9|-|COMPONENT|EAST|-30|Surplus|Component|-|5407|1001004|-| 
|10|-|PRODUCED ITEM|WEST|-100|Reservation|Produced Item|-|37|1001|Order-to-Order|
|10|Yes|PRODUCED ITEM|WEST|100|Reservation|Produced Item|-|5406|101004|Order-to-Order|
|12|Yes|COMPONENT|WEST|70|Surplus|Component|LOTB|5741|1011|-| 
|14|Yes|COMPONENT|WEST|30|Surplus|Component|LOTA|5741|1011|-| 
|15|Yes|COMPONENT|OUT.LOG.|70|Surplus|Component|LOTB|32|-|-| 
|16|Yes|COMPONENT|OUT.LOG.|30|Surplus|Component|LOTA|32|-|-| 

#### Entry numbers 8 and 9  

Order tracking entries for the two lots of the component reflecting demand in table 5407 are changed from a reservation status of *Tracking* to *Surplus*. The reason is that the supplies that were linked to before, in table 32, are used by the shipment of the transfer order.  

Genuine surplus, as in this case, reflects excess supply or demand that remains untracked. It's an indication of an imbalance in the order network, which generates an action message by the planning system unless it's resolved dynamically.  

#### Entry numbers 12 to 16  

Because the two lots of the component are posted on the transfer order as shipped but not received, all related positive order tracking entries are of reservation type *Surplus*, indicating that they aren't allocated to any demands. For each lot number, one entry relates to table 5741, *Transfer Line*, and one entry relates to the item ledger entry at the in-transit location where the items now exist.  

At this point in the scenario, the transfer order of the components from *EAST* to *WEST* location is posted as received.  

Now the following order tracking entries exist in the *Reservation Entry* table.  

<!-- ![Third example of order tracking entries in Reservation Entry table.](media/supply_planning_RTAM_3.png "supply_planning_RTAM_3") -->
 **Reservation entries**

|Entry No.|Positive|Item No.|Location Code|Quantity|Reservation Status|Description|Lot No.|Source Type|Source ID|Binding|  
|---------|--------|--------|-------------|--------|------------------|-----------|-------|-----------|---------|-------| 
|8|-|COMPONENT|EAST|-70|Surplus|Component|-|5407|101004|-| 
|9|-|COMPONENT|EAST|-30|Surplus|Component|-|5407|1001004|-|
|10|-|PRODUCED ITEM|WEST|-100|Reservation|Produced Item|-|37|1001|Order-to-Order|
|10|Yes|PRODUCED ITEM|WEST|100|Reservation|Produced Item|-|5406|101004|Order-to-Order|
|17|Yes|COMPONENT|WEST|70|Surplus|Component|LOTB|32|-|-| 
|18|Yes|COMPONENT|WEST|30|Surplus|Component|LOTA|32|-|-| 

The order tracking entries are now similar to the first point in the scenario before the transfer order was posted as shipped only, except entries for the component are now of reservation status *Surplus*. This is because the component need is still at *EAST* location, reflecting that the **Location Code** field on the production order component line contains *EAST* as setup in the **Components at Location** field. The supply that was allocated to this demand before was transferred to *WEST* location and can't be fully tracked unless the component need on the production order line is changed to *WEST* location.  

At this point in the scenario, the **Location Code** on the production order component line is set to *WEST*. In addition, on the **Item Tracking Lines** page, the 30 units of LOTA and the 70 units of LOTB are assigned to the production order component line.  

Now the following order tracking entries exist in the *Reservation Entry* table.  

<!-- ![Fourth example of order tracking entries in Reservation Entry table.](media/supply_planning_RTAM_4.png "supply_planning_RTAM_4")   -->
 **Reservation entries**

|Entry No.|Positive|Item No.|Location Code|Quantity|Reservation Status|Description|Lot No.|Source Type|Source ID|Binding|  
|---------|--------|--------|-------------|--------|------------------|-----------|-------|-----------|---------|-------| 
|10|-|PRODUCED ITEM|WEST|-100|Reservation|Produced Item|-|37|1001|Order-to-Order|
|10|Yes|PRODUCED ITEM|WEST|100|Reservation|Produced Item|-|5406|101004|Order-to-Order|
|21|-|COMPONENT|WEST|-70|Tracking|Component|LOTB|5407|101004|-| 
|21|Yes|COMPONENT|WEST|70|Tracking|Component|LOTB|32|-|-| 
|22|-|COMPONENT|WEST|-30|Tracking|Component|LOTA|5407|1001004|-| 
|22|Yes|COMPONENT|WEST|30|Tracking|Component|LOTA|32|-|-| 

#### Entry numbers 21 and 22  

Since the component need changed to *WEST* location, and the supply is available as item ledger entries at *WEST* location, all order tracking entries for the two lot numbers are now fully tracked, indicated by the reservation status of *Tracking*.  

The **Lot No.** field is now filled in the order tracking entry for table 5407 because the lot numbers were assigned to the production order component lines.  

## Action messaging  

When the order tracking system detects an imbalance in the order network, it automatically creates an action message to notify the user. Action messages are system-generated calls for user action that specify the details of the imbalance and suggestions on how to restore balance to the order network. They display as planning lines on the **Planning Worksheets** page when you choose **Get Action Messages** action. In addition, action messages on planning lines are generated during the planning run to reflect the planning system's suggestions to restore balance to the order network. In both cases, the suggestions are run on the order network, when you choose **Carry Out Action Message** action.  

An action message addresses one BOM level at a time. If the user accepts the action message, this might give rise to additional action messages at the next BOM level.  

The following table shows the action messages that exist.  

|Action message|Description|  
|--------------------|---------------------------------------|  
|**Change Qty.**|Changes the quantity on an existing supply order to cover a changed or new demand.|  
|**Reschedule**|Reschedules the due date on an existing order.|  
|**Resched. & Chg. Qty.**|Reschedules the due date and changes the quantity on an existing order.|  
|**New**|Creates a new order if demand can't be fulfilled by either of the previous action messages.|  
|**Cancel**|Cancels an existing order.|  

The order tracking system always attempts to resolve an imbalance in the existing order network. If this isn't possible, it issues an action message to create a new order. Following is the prioritized list that the order tracking system uses when it determines how to restore balance. If an additional demand enters the order network, the system seeks to order track through the following checks:  

1. Check for any excess supply in the existing order tracking record for this demand.  
1. Check for planned and scheduled receipts in order of receipt date. The latest possible date is selected.  
1. Check for available stock.  
1. Check if a supply order exists in the current order tracking record. If so, the system issues an action message of type *Change* to increase the order.  
1. Check that no supply order exists in the current order tracking record. If so, the system issues an action message of type *New* to create a new order.  

An open demand passes through the list and offsets the available supply at each point. Any remaining demand is always covered by check 4 or check 5.  

If a decrease in demand quantity occurs, the order tracking system attempts to resolve the imbalance by performing the previous checks in reverse order. This means that existing action messages could be modified or even deleted, if necessary. The order tracking system always presents the net result of its calculations to the user.  

## Order tracking and planning  

When the planning system runs, it deletes all existing order tracking records and action message entries and recreates them as planning line suggestions according to supply/demand pairs and priorities. When the planning run finishes, the order network is in balance.  

### Planning system versus order tracking and action messaging  

 The following comparison shows the differences between the methods that are used by the planning system to create planning line suggestions and the methods that are used by the order tracking system to create order tracking records and action messages.  

- The planning system deals with the entire supply and demand pattern of a particular item, whereas order tracking deals with the order that activated it.  

- The planning system deals with all levels of the BOM hierarchy, whereas order tracking deals with one BOM level at a time.  

- The planning system establishes links between demand and supply according to the prioritized due date. Order tracking establishes links between demand and supply according to the order entry sequence.  

- The planning system takes planning parameters into account, whereas order tracking doesn't.  

- The planning system creates links in a user-activated batch mode when it balances demand and supply, whereas order tracking creates the links automatically and dynamically as the user enters orders.

# Move Items Internally in Basic Warehouse Configurations

You might want to move items between bins without a demand from a source document. For example, as part of the following activities:

* Reorganize your warehouse.
* Bring items to an inspection area.
* Move extra items to and from a production area. 

How you move items depends on how your warehouse is set up as a location. Learn more at [Setting Up Warehouse Management](warehouse-setup-warehouse.md).

In warehouse configurations where the **Bin Mandatory** setup toggle is turned on, but not **Directed Pick and Put-away** you can register unplanned movements on the following pages:  

* On the **Internal Movement** page.
* On the **Item Reclassification Journal** page.  

## Internal movements

The **Internal Movements** page lets you specify Take and Place lines when there isn't a demand from a source document. The Internal Movement page is like a worksheet for organizing things. You can't process the actual movement directly from it. When a line is filled in, use the **Create Inventory Movement** action to send the line to the **Inventory Movement** page, which is where you process and register the movement.

### To move items as an internal movement

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Internal Movements**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose **New** action. Make sure that the **No.** field on the **General** FastTab is filled in.
3. In the **Location Code** field, enter the location where the movement takes place.  

    If the location is your default location as a warehouse employee, the location code is added automatically.  
4. In the **To Bin Code** field, enter the code for the bin that you want to move the items to.

    For example, in production, the bin could be the open shop floor bin defined on the location card or work center.  
5. In the **Due Date** field, enter the date by which to complete the movement.  
6. On each line, fill in the fields as necessary. Internal movement documents have one line per movement. The line contains both the take and the place actions.
7. Choose the **Item No.** field to open the **Bin Contents List** page. Select the item to move based on its availability in bins. You can also choose the **Get Bin Contents** action to fill the internal movement lines based on your filters.  

    After you select the item, the **From Bin Code** field is automatically filled in according to the selected bin content. You can choose any bin where the item is available. The **Item No.** and **From Bin Code** fields are related. Changing the value in one field might change the value in the other.  

    The **To Bin Code** field is filled in with the value you entered on the header. You can change it on the line to any other bin code that isn’t blocked or dedicated for special purposes. Learn more at [The Dedicated field](warehouse-how-to-create-individual-bins.md#the-dedicated-field).  

8. After you define which bins you want to move the items from and to, enter the quantity to move in the **Quantity** field.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > The quantity must be available in the bin specified in the **From Bin Code** field.  

9. When you're ready to process the movement, choose the **Create Inventory Movement** action.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  After you create the movement, the internal movement lines are deleted.  

Perform the rest of the unplanned movement on the **Inventory Movement** page in the same way as you would for a movement based on source documents.

### To record the inventory movement

1. On the **Inventory Movement** page, open the document to record the movement for.  
2. In the **Bin Code** field on the movement lines, the bin where the items must be picked from is where the item is available. You can change the bin if needed.
3. Perform the move and enter the information for the moved quantity in the **Qty. to Handle** field. The value on the Take and the Place lines must be the same. Otherwise, you can't register the movement.

    If you must take the items for a line from more than one bin, for example because the full quantity isn't in the bin, use the **Split Line** action on the **Lines** FastTab. The action creates a line for the remaining quantity to handle.  
4. Choose the **Register Invt. Movement** action.  

The following happens during the posting process:

* Warehouse entries indicate that the quantity is transferred from the take bins to the place bins.

## To move items with the item reclassification journal

Instead of using movement documents, you can record movements by reclassifying bin codes on items. Learn more at [Count, Adjust, and Reclassify Inventory Using Journals](inventory-how-count-adjust-reclassify.md).

> [!NOTE]  
> Movements posted with reclassification journals don't make the movement documents ready to move.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Item Reclass. Journal**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On each journal line, define the bins to move the items from and to by filling in the **Bin Code** and the **New Bin Code** fields.  

    1. To move a bin's entire contents to another bin, choose the **Get Bin Contents** action.  
    2. Use the filters to find the bin that contains the items you'd like to move, and then choose **OK**. The journal lines are filled with the contents of the bin.  
3. Fill in the remaining fields on each journal line.
4. Post the reclassification journal.

# Create incoming document records directly from documents and entries

You can store external business documents in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] by attaching the document files to the related incoming document records. If the document, such as a purchase invoice, didn't start its existence as an incoming document record, you can still create and connect an incoming document record to it later. You can also attach incoming document files to posted purchase and sales documents and to vendor, customer, and general ledger entries by using the **Incoming Document Files** FactBox in, for example, the **Posted Purchase Invoices** and **Vendor Ledger Entries** pages.

From the **Chart of Accounts** and **General Ledger Entries** pages, you can use a search function to find general ledger entries for posted purchase and sales documents that don't have incoming document records and then centrally link to existing records or create new ones with attached document files. For more information, see [Find Posted Documents without Incoming Document Records](across-how-find-posted-documents-without-income-document-records.md).

The following procedures show how to attach a file to a vendor ledger entry or an existing purchase invoice that wasn't created from an incoming document record. Attaching a file to posted purchase or sales documents works in a similar way.

[!INCLUDE [incoming-doc-archived-doc](includes/incoming-doc-archived-doc.md)]

## Create and connect an incoming document record from a purchase invoice

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Invoices**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the line for a purchase invoice that you want to attach a file to, and then choose the **Create Incoming Document from File** action.
3. Alternatively, select the line for a purchase invoice that you want to attach a file to, and then choose the **Attach File** action.
4. On the **Insert File** page, do one of the following steps to attach a file that represents the incoming document in question:

   [!INCLUDE[file-upload](includes/file-upload.md)]


## Create and connect an incoming document record from a vendor ledger entry

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Vendor Ledger Entries**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select a line for a vendor ledger entry that you want to attach a file to, and then choose the **Create Incoming Document from File** action.
3. Alternatively, select a line for a vendor ledger entry that you want to attach a file to, and then choose the **Attach File** action.
4. On the **Insert File** page, do one of the following steps to attach a file that represents the incoming document in question:

   [!INCLUDE[file-upload](includes/file-upload.md)]


## Remove a connection from an incoming document record to a posted document

You can remove file attachments from non-posted documents at any time by deleting the related incoming document record. If the document is posted, then you must first remove the connection from the incoming document record.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Incoming Documents**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the line for an incoming document record connected to a posted document that you want to remove, and then choose the **Remove Reference to Record** action.

The connection to the posted document is removed. You can now proceed to connect another incoming document record to the posted document as described in this article.

# Where is personalization stored?

When you interact with the Business Central web client to optimize your workspace, some user interface (UI) adjustments are automatically saved and roam with you across devices and browsers. Others are local and only affect your current browser.

- *Roaming personalization* is stored in the Business Central service and affects your experience no matter which device or browser you sign in to. Personalizing in one browser or device immediately affects other browsers or devices that you use. Roaming personalization is typically infrequent, more permanent, or time-consuming to recreate. Roaming settings can only be reset by clearing personalization from the Business Central web client.
- *Local personalization* is stored in your browser and only affects your experience when using different browser tabs in that same browser. It doesn't affect your Business Central experience on other devices, browsers, or browser profiles. UI adjustments that are saved locally are typically those adjustments that users frequently do and redo as they work in Business Central.  

  > [!NOTE]
  > If you delete the browsing data in your browser, specifically cookies and site data, you also delete any local personalization that you've done. To avoid deleting local personalization, make sure that the browser isn't set up to clear cookies and site data every time you close the browser. For example, in Microsoft Edge, you turn off the **Cookies and other site data** toggle in the **Privacy, search, and services** settings. Learn more at [Manage cookies in Microsoft Edge](https://support.microsoft.com/windows/manage-cookies-in-microsoft-edge-view-allow-block-delete-and-use-168dab11-0753-043d-7c16-ede5947fc64d#bkmk_deletecookieseverytimeyouclosethebrowser) or consult the documentation for your browser.

## Roaming versus local UI adjustments

The following table indicates which UI adjustments are roaming, local, or both. An \* indicates that the roaming personalization can be made without entering the personalization mode.

# Switching to Another Company or Environment

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is available in many different countries/regions and supports many different types of organizations. Your organization may choose to organize work in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] into multiple *companies* and *environments*. This article helps you understand the key differences and how to work across them.

## About companies and environments

[!INCLUDE [company_environment](includes/company_environment.md)]

> [!TIP]
> If you often switch between companies, or work with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] from within another app like Microsoft Teams, it can be easy to lose track of where you are. To help you keeping track, you can add a badge that will display the company name, so you can quickly verify that you're in the right place. For more information, see [Display a company badge](admin-company-information.md#badge).
> 
> Depending on your browser, you can also pin the different companies to your favorites bar.  

<!--
[!INCLUDE [about-ui-learn](includes/about-ui-learn.md)]-->

## Features for switching company or environment

There are a few features you can use to switch the company or environment as you work. The following table compares the capabilities of the feature, which are explained in more detail in the sections that follow.

|Feature|Switch company|Switch environment|Switch in new browser tab| Available on-premises|
|-------|--------------|------------------|-------------------------|----------------------|
|[Company switcher](#use-the-company-switcher)|![check mark](media/check.png "check")|![check mark](media/check.png "check")|![check mark](media/check.png "check")|![check mark](media/check.png "check")|
|[App launcher](#use-the-app-launcher)||![check mark](media/check.png "check")|![check mark](media/check.png "check")||
|[My Settings](#use-my-settings)|![check mark](media/check.png "check")|||![check mark](media/check.png "check")|
|[Company Hub](#use-company-hub)|![check mark](media/check.png "check")|![check mark](media/check.png "check")|![check mark](media/check.png "check")||

## Use the company switcher

Using the company switcher is probably the quickest and most versatile way to switch company. The company switcher is a pane that's readily available from any page. The pane gives an overview of all companies in all environments that you have access to, and lets you switch directly to any one of them&mdash;either in the same browser tab or a new one. It's especially useful when you work in many companies across different environments.

1. In upper-right corner, near the search icon, you'll see either the standard company icon, like ![company icon Launcher.](media/ui-experience/company-icon.png "Displays the company switcher icon used when there is a single environment") and ![company-icon-mult-env](media/ui-experience/company-icon-multi-env.png "Displays the company switcher icon used when there are multiple environments"), or a [custom badge](admin-company-information.md#badge) for the company you're currently working with. Select the icon to open the company switcher pane.

   :::image type="content" source="media/ui-experience/company-switch-2.png" alt-text="Shows the company switcher icon in the heading of the Business Central client.":::  

   > [!TIP]
   > You can also use the <kbd>Crtl</kbd>+<kbd>O</kbd> keyboard shortcut to open the pane.
2. In the **Available Companies** pane, select the company that you want to switch to, select the **Switch** arrow, then choose one of the following options:

   |Option|Description|
   |------|-----------|
   |Switch|Opens the role center for selected company in the same browser tab that you're working in. The company becomes the default company that opens in Business Central, until you switch again or change the company by using **My Settings**. |
   |Open in new tab|Opens the role center for selected company in a new browser tab, keeping the original company open in the other tab.|
   |Open in new tab and go to same page|This option is only active on list pages, like customers, sales orders, or items. It opens the same list, but for the selected company, in a new browser tab. |

> [!TIP]
> Select <kbd>F5</kbd> to refresh list of environments and companies.

## Use the app launcher

When you're signed in to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the environments that you can access are available on the Microsoft 365.  

1. Select the **App Launcher** icon ![App Launcher.](media/app-launcher-icon.png "The App Launcher provides access to more features").
2. In the pane that opens, look for and choose [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. If you don't see [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], choose **All apps**, then enter **Business Central** in the **Search** box.

   :::image type="content" source="media/app-launcher-bc-tile.png" alt-text="The Microsoft 365 app launcher showing the Business Central tile.":::  

3. If there's more than one environment, you'll be asked to choose the environment to access.

> [!NOTE]
> App launcher isn't available if you're signed in to Business Central as a guest.

<!--
The following image shows tiles for accessing production and sandbox environments on the Dynamics 365 Home page.

:::image type="content" source="media/app-picker-environments.png" alt-text="The Dynamics 365 Home page showing production and sandbox environments.":::
-->
## Use My Settings

When you're signed in to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can quickly switch to another company in the same environment. After you make the switch, the company you choose becomes your default company and will open the next time you sign in.

1. In the top-right corner, choose the **Settings** icon ![Settings.](media/ui-experience/settings_icon_small.png "Settings icon for role center"), and then choose the **My Settings** action.

    > [!TIP]
    > You can also use the <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>T</kbd> keyboard shortcut to quickly open the My Settings page.

2. On the **My Settings** page, in the **Company** field, select the company.  
3. Choose the **OK** button.

> [!TIP]
> A good way to go directly to your default company when you sign in, and avoid having to specify an environment, is to add the the URL to your list of favorites after you sign in.

## Use company hub

*Company hub* is a highly specialized role center that gives a financial overview across companies and environments. Available as an [extension](ui-extensions-company-hub.md), company hub provides a dashboard with summary data for each company that you have access to. The home page displays financial KPIs and a direct link to the individual environments and companies. For more information, see [Manage Work across Multiple Companies in the Company Hub](company-hub.md).

# Sell products with a customer sales order

This article provides guidance on when you should use a customer sales order in addition to an invoice. If your sales process requires you to only ship part of an order, perhaps because the full quantity isn't available right away, you must process that sale by making a sales order.

You must also use sales orders if you sell items that deliver directly from your vendor to your customer, in what is called a drop shipment. To learn more, go to [Make Drop Shipments](sales-how-drop-shipment.md). In all other respects, sales orders work the same way as sales invoices. To learn more, go to [Invoice Sales](sales-how-invoice-sales.md).

When you deliver the products, either fully or partially, you post the sales order as shipped or as shipped and invoiced to create the related item and customer ledger entries in your system. When you post the sales order, you can also email it as a PDF attachment. You can prefill the email body with a summary of the order and payment information, such as a link to PayPal. To learn more, go to [Ship Items](warehouse-how-ship-items.md) and [Send Documents by Email](ui-how-send-documents-email.md).

In business environments where the customer pays immediately, such as via PayPal or cash, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] records the payment when you post the sales invoice. The posted sales invoice is closed as fully applied. You select the method in the **Payment Method Code** field on the sales order. For electronic payments, such as PayPal, you must also fill in the **Payment Service** field. To learn more, go to [Enable Customer Payments Through Payment Services](sales-how-enable-payment-service-extensions.md).

You can even create directly paid orders for unregistered customers by first setting up a "cash customer" card, which you point to on the sales order. To learn more, go to [Set Up Cash Customers](finance-how-to-set-up-cash-customers.md).

## Create a sales order

> [!NOTE]  
> The following procedure assumes that the customer is already set up. To learn more about setting up customers, go to [Register New Customers](sales-how-register-new-customers.md).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Orders**, then choose the related link.
2. Select **New** to create a new entry.
3. In the **Customer Name** field, enter the name of an existing customer.

    Other fields on the **Sales Order** page are now filled in with information about the selected customer.  

4. Fill in the remaining fields on the **Sales Order** page as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

    > [!NOTE]  
    > If you allow the customer to pay immediately, for example, by credit card or PayPal, then fill in the **Payment Method Code** field. The payment is then recorded as soon as you post the sales order as invoiced. If you select *cash*, then the payment is recorded in a specified balancing account.

    You're now ready to fill in the sales order lines with inventory items or services you want the customer to purchase.

    If you set up recurring sales lines for the customer, such as a monthly replenishment order, you can insert these lines on the order by choosing the **Get Recurring Sales Lines** action.
5. On the **Lines** FastTab, in the **Type** field, select what type of product, charge, transaction, or comment you post to the customer on the sales line.

6. In the **No.** field, enter the number of an inventory item or service.

    Leave the **No.** field empty if the line is for a:

    * Comment. Write the comment in the **Description** field.
    * Catalog item. Choose the **Select Catalog Items** action. To learn more about catalog items, go to To learn more, go to [Work With Catalog Items](inventory-how-work-nonstock-items.md).
7. In the **Quantity** field, enter the number of items to be sold.

    > [!NOTE]  
    > For items of the *Resource* or *Service* type, the quantity is a time unit, such as hours, as indicated in the **Unit of Measure Code** field on the line. To learn more, go to [Set Up Item Units of Measure](inventory-how-setup-units-of-measure.md).

    The **Line Amount** field is updated to show the value in the **Unit Price** field multiplied by the number in the **Quantity** field.

    The price and line amounts are shown with or without sales tax depending on what you selected in the **Prices Including Tax** field on the customer card.
8. In the **Line Discount %** field, enter a percentage if you want to grant the customer a discount on the product. The value in the **Line Amount** field is updated accordingly.

    If you set up special item prices on the **Sales Prices and Sales Line Discounts** FastTab on the **Customer Card** or **Item Card** pages, the price and amount values on the sales lines update automatically if the criteria are met. To learn more about prices and discounts, go to [Record Sales Price, Discount, and Payment Agreements](sales-how-record-sales-price-discount-payment-agreements.md).
9. To add a comment about the order line, that the customer can read on the printed sales order, write a comment on an empty line in the **Description** field.  
10. Repeat steps 5 through 9 for every item you want to the customer to purchase.

    The totals fields under the lines are automatically updated as you create or modify lines to display the amounts to be posted to the ledgers.

    > [!NOTE]
    > In rare cases, the posted amounts might differ from what is displayed in the totals fields. The difference is typically due to rounding calculations in relation to value-added tax (VAT) or sales tax.
    >
    > To double-check the amounts, use the **Statistics** page, which takes into account the rounding calculations. Also, if you choose the **Release** action, the totals fields update to include rounding calculations.  

11. Optionally, in the **Inv. Discount Amount** field, enter the amount to be deducted from the value shown in the **Total Incl. Tax** field.

    If you set up invoice discounts for the customer, the **Invoice Discount %** field automatically updates if the discount criteria are met. The **Inv. Discount Amount Excl. Tax** field shows related amount. To learn more, go to [Record Sales Price, Discount, and Payment Agreements](sales-how-record-sales-price-discount-payment-agreements.md).
12. To ship only part of the order quantity, enter that quantity in the **Qty. to Ship** field. The value automatically copies to the **Qty. to Invoice** field.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If the **Shipping Advice** field is set as **Complete** in the **Shipping and Billing** FastTab, you can't post partial shipments. Learn more at [Process Partial Shipments](sales-how-send-partial-shipments.md).
13. To invoice only part of the shipped quantity, enter that quantity in the **Qty. to Invoice** field. The quantity must be lower than the value in the **Qty. to Ship** field.  
14. When the sales order lines are completed, choose the **Post and Send** action.

[!INCLUDE [order-ship-invoice](includes/order-ship-invoice.md)]

The **Post and Send Confirmation** dialog box displays the customer's preferred method of receiving documents. You can change the sending method by choosing the lookup button for the **Send Document to** field. To learn more, go to [Set Up Document Sending Profiles](sales-how-setup-document-send-profiles.md).

The related item and customer ledger entries are now created, and the sales order is output as a PDF document. When the sales order is fully posted, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] removes it from the list of sales orders.  

## Create a new sales order based on a copy of another order

> [!TIP]
> This section describes how to copy a sales order, but the steps are the same for other sales documents.

When you're creating a sales order that's similar to a previous one, you can save time by copying the order you already have. For example, you can copy the data in the order's header, its lines, or both, to your new order. Afterward, you can update the information on the new order, if needed.

The value of some fields on an order's lines depend on what you enter in the header. For example, the values in the amount fields depend on the discounts you set up for the customer. If you don't include the header when you copy the order, you must recalculate the lines so that their values are appropriate to the header's values. The **Recalculate Lines** toggle turns on automatically if you turn off the **Include Header** toggle.

> [!NOTE]
> If the **Calc. Inv. Discount** option is selected on the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page, the invoice discount recalculates when you post the new document line. The new calculation might cause the amount on the new line to differ from the original.

> [!NOTE]
> If part of the quantity on the original lines was returned, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates the new line with only the quantity that wasn't returned. If the full quantity was returned, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't create a new line.

### How to copy a sales order

The following steps describe how to copy a sales order.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Orders**, and then choose the related link.
1. Choose **New** to create a new document, and then choose the **Copy Document** action.

   > [!NOTE]
   > When you copy an order, you can choose to copy only the information in the order's lines, and not copy the order header. Skipping the header might be useful, for example, when you're selling the same items and quantities to a different customer. If you skip the header, fill in the **Customer Name** field on your new order before you use the **Copy Document** action.

1. In the **Document Type** field, choose **Order**.
1. In the **Document No.** field, choose the order to copy.

   [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] fills in the **Doc. NO. Occurrence**, **Version No.**, **Sell-to Customer No.**, and **Sell-to Customer Name** fields based on the order you choose.
1. To copy information in the order's header, such as the customer name and the order's due date, turn on the **Include Header** toggle.

   If you choose this option, you also copy the lines. However, you must recalculate the amounts on the lines in the new order.
1. To copy and recalculate the lines from the original order to the new, turn on the **Recalculate Lines** toggle.

   The action keeps the item numbers and item quantities, but recalculates the amounts based on the item prices and discounts for the customer on the new order.

1. Choose **OK** to create the copy.

## External document number

[!INCLUDE [ext-doc-no-sales](includes/ext-doc-no-sales.md)]

## Working with amount fields

The values in fields that show amounts can be positive or negative, depending on whether the value represents a credit or a debit. This video shows how to work with fields that show amounts.

# Setting up finance

Before you can begin to run your business, you must specify how you want to manage company finance processes. First, you set up the core of the company's accounting records: the chart of accounts (COA). Then you set up posting groups, which make the process of assigning default general ledger posting accounts to customers, vendors, and items more efficient.

Some finance setup can be done automatically with assisted setup guides, and some must be done manually. Learn more at [Getting Ready for Doing Business](ui-get-ready-business.md). The **General Ledger Setup** page specifies how to handle of your company's different accounting processes. For example, use this page to specify invoice rounding details, the currency code for your local currency, address formats, and whether you want to use an additional reporting currency. Learn more at [Understanding the General Ledger and the Chart of Accounts](finance-general-ledger.md).  

You can use dimensions to add different types of information to every transaction. You can set up your company's basic dimensions, such as *Projects* and *Departments*. Later, add more dimensions when you need them. For example, you can set up temporary dimensions to use for a limited time period, such during a sales campaign. Learn more at [Working with Dimensions](finance-dimensions.md).

Many of the setup tasks must be completed before you can begin recording financial transactions, but most settings can be adjusted as needed. That said, there are optional setup tasks as well. For example, you need only set up intercompany postings and consolidations if you are working with multiple companies. And other setup tasks, such as specifying the period during which posting is allowed, may have to be repeated periodically.  

The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the topics that describe them.

# Bin Contents (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Bin Contents** report breaks down an organization's inventory levels on a bin-by-bin basis. Use this information to identify high and low volume bins and inform inventory movement requirements if bins need more inventory.

The report also shows the available quantity and quantity metrics across different warehouse activities. For example, picks, put-aways, and general adjustments.

:::image type="content" source="media/inventory/bin-contents.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Bin Contents Power BI Report" lightbox="media/inventory/bin-contents.png":::

## Use the report

The report helps managers and manufacturing or procurement staff to identify item volumes in each bin.

For warehouse or inventory managers, the report provides a clear picture of the stock levels of each bin across your organization. The report can help you make decisions on procurement or production. It might also prompt you to transfer stock to a specific bin to maintain supply.

Manufacturing team members can use this report to gauge inventory levels across all bins and plan production schedules based on the inventory in each bin.

The procurement team can use this report to gauge inventory levels across all bins and plan purchase orders to ensure that quantities in bins stay at a reasonable level.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The *Bin Contents* report includes the following KPIs:

- [**Quantity in Adjustment Bin**](inventory-powerbi-kpis.md#quantity-in-adjustment-bin)
- [**Available Quantity to Take**](inventory-powerbi-kpis.md#available-qty-to-take)
- [**Warehouse Quantity**](inventory-powerbi-kpis.md#warehouse-quantity)
- [**Pick Quantity (Base)**](inventory-powerbi-kpis.md#pick-quantity-base)
- [**ATO Components Pick Qty.**](inventory-powerbi-kpis.md#ato-components-pick-qty)
- [**Put-Away Quantity (Base)**](inventory-powerbi-kpis.md#put-away-quantity-base)
- [**Negative Adjmt. Qty. (Base)**](inventory-powerbi-kpis.md#negative-adjmt-qty-base)
- [**Positive Adjmt. Qty. (Base)**](inventory-powerbi-kpis.md#positive-adjmt-qty-base)

# Create projects

When you start a new project, you must create a project card with integrated project tasks and project planning lines, structured in two layers.  

The first layer consists of project tasks. You must create at least one project task per project because all posting refers to a project task. Having at least one project task in your project enables you to set up project planning lines and to post consumption to the project.

The second layer consists of project planning lines, which specify the detailed use of resources, items and various general ledger expenses.

The layer structure enables you to divide the project into smaller tasks, and therefore use more specific details in budgeting, quotes, and registration. In addition, it gives you insight into how a project is progressing. For example, you can track whether you're meeting designated milestones or if you're on target to meet budget expectations.

> [!TIP]
> Choose the **New Project** action on the **Project Manager** Role Center to launch an assisted setup guide that takes you through the steps of creating a project with integrated tasks and planning lines. The following procedure describes how to perform the steps manually. <!-- For an example of how to create a project manually, go to [Video: How to create a project in Dynamics 365 Business Central](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqaPWr7BWmw).-->

## To create a project card

You create a project card and then create project task lines and project planning lines for it.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Projects**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action, and then fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
3. To base the project on information from another project, choose the **Copy Project** action, fill in the fields as necessary, and then choose the **OK** button.

> [!NOTE]  
> If you're using time sheets with your project, you must also designate a person responsible. This person can approve time sheets for the employee tasks associated with the project. For more information, see [Set Up Time Sheets](projects-how-setup-time-sheets.md).

> [!NOTE]  
> The **Apply Usage Link** toggle indicates whether project ledger entries are linked to project planning lines. The **Apply Usage Link** toggle also activates warehouse handling, planning, assembly-to-order, item tracking, and reservation capabilities for a project.

Optionally, mark actions on project as blocked using the **Blocked** field. The following table describes the effect of the options for this field.

|Option  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|Blank |All actions are allowed.|
|Posting    |You can work with planning lines, but the project is blocked for posting. You can't post usage or sales for the project.|
|All  |All actions are blocked.|

## To create tasks for a project

A key part of creating a project is to specify the various tasks involved in the project. You specify tasks by creating one line per task on the **Tasks** FastTab on the **Project Card** page. Every project must have at least one task.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Projects**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the project card for a relevant project.
3. On the **Tasks** FastTab, fill in the fields as necessary on a new line.
4. To indent tasks and create a hierarchy, Choose the **Tasks** action, the then choose **Indent Project Tasks** action.
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 for all the tasks that you need for the project.
6. To specify the project tasks with information on other project tasks, choose the **Copy Project Tasks from** action, fill in the fields as necessary, and then choose the **OK** button.

## Invoice one or more customers for project tasks

Sometimes the party that is receiving a service is different from the party that pays the bill. Also, sometimes you might need to invoice multiple customers for tasks in the project. On the **Project Card** page, use the **Task Billing Method** field to specify whether you're billing one customer, or multiple customers.

If the customer who is receiving the service also pays the bill, in the **Bill-to** and **Ship-to** fields, choose **Default (Customer)** and **Default (Sell-to Address)**.

If you're billing multiple customers, you can specify the customer who receives the service and the customer to invoice for each task in the project. You can also provide the following information:

* Select the ship-to address for the customer where the work happens.
* Add information about external references to simplify communication about the project.
* Overwrite the standard financial terms of the project.

## Specify a default location for project items

You can save time on data entry by specifying a default location and bin for projects on the **Project Card** page. When you create tasks, project planning lines, and project journal lines for the project, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] assigns the default location. You can, however, change the location code and bin on tasks and lines if needed.

If you define a **To-Project Bin Code** on the location, the bin code is populated when you select the location code. If your warehouse flow requires warehouse picks, you can also define other bins from which to consume items.

These fields are the defaults when you create project tasks. Existing project tasks don't change.

There are a few things to know about using default locations:

* For project tasks, if you define a **To-Project Bin Code** on the location, the bin code is assigned when you select the location code. If your warehouse flow requires warehouse picks, you can also define other bins from which to consume items.
* For project planning lines, the **Location Code** is based on the value selected on the project planning line when you select an item. If a bin code isn't defined for the project task, the bin from the default bin content is selected. You can change both values manually.
* For project journal lines, the **Location Code** is based on the value selected on the job journal line when you select an item. If a bin code isn't defined for the project task, the bin from default bin content is selected. You can change both values manually.

> [!NOTE]
> The processes businesses use to pick items in their warehouses differ, depending on whether they use basic or advanced warehouse configurations. To learn more about the options for warehouse configuration, go to [Overview of different configuration options](design-details-warehouse-management.md#overview-of-different-configuration-options).

## To create planning lines for a project

You can refine your new project tasks on project planning lines. A planning line can capture the information that you want to track for a project. For example, you can track the resources the project requires, or the items that are needed. For example, you have a task to get a customer to approve a project. You associate the task with planning lines for items such as meeting the customer and assigning a resource.  

A project planning line can have one of the types described in the following table.  

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Budget** |Provides estimated usage and costs for the project, typically in a time and materials type project. You can't invoice planning lines of this type. |
| **Billable** |Provides estimated invoicing to the customer, typically in a fixed price project. |
| **Both Budget and Billable** |Provides budgeted usage equal to what you want to invoice. |

> [!NOTE]
> While you enter information on project planning lines, cost information is automatically filled in. For example, the cost, price, and discount for resources and items are based on information from the resource and item.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Projects**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open a relevant project card.
3. Select a project task for which the **Project Task Type** field contains **Posting**, and then choose the **Project Planning Lines** action.  
4. On the **Project Planning Lines** page, on a new line, fill in the fields as necessary.
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 for all planning lines that you need for the project task.

> [!TIP]
> If the line is for an item, you can use the **Item Availability by** action to explore the item's availability by location, event, or period.

## Avoid document number errors when you post project journals

If you use a number series for project journal batches, you can't post the journal if the document numbers aren't consecutive. If needed, you can correct the order of document numbers when you post project journals.

On the **Project Journals** page, the **Document No.** field is editable so that you can specify different document numbers for different journal lines, or the same document number for related journal lines.

If a number series is specified in the **No. Series** field on the project journal batch, document numbers for individual or grouped lines must be sequential when you post a project journal. If they aren't, you can't post the journal. To avoid getting stuck, use the **Renumber Document Numbers** action on the **Project Journals** page before you post the journal. If you group journal lines by document number before you use the action, they stay grouped but might be assigned a different document number.

> [!TIP]
> The **Renumber Document Numbers** action also works on filtered views.

# Use Power Automate flows in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]

With [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you're given a license to Microsoft Power Automate. This license lets you use your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] data as part of a workflow in Microsoft Power Automate. You create flows and connect to your data from internal and external sources through the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] connector.

Power Automate flows are triggered by events, such as a record being created, modified, or deleted. Flows can also be run on a user-defined schedule or on demand.

> [!NOTE]
> Administrators can restrict access to Power Automate. If you find that you don't have access to some or all of the features described in this article, talk to your admin. If you want to learn how you can control Power Automate access as an admin, see [Set Up Power Automate Integration](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/powerplatform/power-automate-setup).

<!-- You must have a valid account with both [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and Power Automate. --> 

> [!TIP]
> In addition to Power Automate, you can use approval workflow templates in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Although they're two separate workflow systems, any approval workflow template you create with Power Automate is added to the list of workflows within [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Learn more at [Workflows](across-workflow.md).

## About Power Automate flows

Power Automate is a service that helps you create automated workflows (or flows) between apps and services, like [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Power Automate flows require little or no coding knowledge. They can be associated with a wide range of events and responses, such as:

- Record changes
- External files updates
- Posted documents
- Different Microsoft and third-party services, like Microsoft Outlook, Excel, Dataverse, Teams, SharePoint, Power Apps, and more.

There are three different cloud flow types that you can work with:

|Flow type|Description|
|---------|-----------|
|Automated flow|This flow type is run automatically by an event. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], an event could be when a record or document is created, modified or deleted. So, for example, a new sales invoice can trigger a flow for an approval request, which can have different events set depending on the approver's reply. A negative response sends a notification and email to the approval requester. A positive reply simultaneously updates an Excel spreadsheet located in a SharePoint folder and sends an update to a Teams chat. Automated flows can be started by both internal and external events in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].|
|Approval flow|Approval flows are also automated flows in Power Automate, but they're designed specifically for requesting approval when changes are made to records and data. You can use approval flows in Power Automate as an alternative to the [approval workflows feature](across-use-workflows.md) that's part of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. |
|Scheduled flow|This type of flow is also automatically run but it runs periodically at a scheduled date and time. |
|Instant flow|This flow type is run on-demand, requiring the user to run it manually from a button or action in another app or device, in this case, the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] client. Instant flows work similarly to batch shortcuts, performing multiple lengthy steps with a few button presses and are launched from specific pages or tables. For example, a flow can add a button to the action menu on the **Vendors** page to block payments to a vendor and, at the same time, send customizable emails to the vendor's contact and your company's purchasers as well as update the contact in Outlook. |

## Power Automate features

You can explore all Power Automate flows currently available to you by signing in to [Power Automate](https://powerautomate.com) and selecting **My flows** from the navigation bar on the left. Here you find any flows you have already created yourself and flows shared with you by an admin or coworker.

- Instant flows are also made available for running directly from most list, card, and document pages in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. You find the instant flows in the **Automate** action group in the action bar of pages. To run a flow, select it, and follow the instructions presented to you. Learn more in the sections that follow.

- With automated flows in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], there's nothing for you to do, unless you want to change them, or turn them off. Otherwise, they just work when triggered. 
<!--

## Automated flows

With Power Automate, you can create business flows directly in-house and rely on citizen developers. Automated workflows can be started by both internal and external events in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], and also be set to run periodically. Learn more and get instructions on how to create flows in the [Set Up Automated Workflows](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/powerplatform/automate-workflows) article in the administration content.

-->

## Run instant flows

Instant flows open inside [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online so you can remain within the context of the business process you were in the middle of doing. You can run an instant flow from most lists, cards, or documents.

1. In the action bar, select **Automate**, then choose a flow from the list of available flows under the **Power Automate** action.

    :::image type="content" source="media/power-automate-instant-menu.svg" alt-text="Shows the Automate action with instant flow actions.":::

    On some pages, **Automate** is nested under **More options (...)**. 
2. In the **Run Flow** pane, fill in any required fields, then select **Continue** to run the flow.

> [!NOTE]
> The first time you use the **Automate** item, you may see only the **Get started with Power Automate** action. You see this action because you haven't agreed to the privacy notice for Microsoft Power Automate. To continue, select **Get started with Power Automate** and follow the instructions to agree or disagree.  
>
> :::image type="content" source="media/power-automate-action.png" alt-text="Shows the Automate item in the action bar.":::

<!--

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can run a Power Automate flow from most list, card, and document pages. Once the admin has connected [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with Power Automate, you'll see any flows your organization has added when you choose the **Automate** action on the relevant pages. Instant flows are run without leaving [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Learn more in the [Set Up Automated Workflows](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/powerplatform/automate-workflows) article in the administration content.

These instant flows open on a page inside [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online so you can remain within the context of the business process you were in the middle of. Choose the **Automate** action—on some pages nested under the **More Options** menu—choose the **Power Automate** menu item, then choose the relevant link to trigger the workflow. The connection to Power Automate is already set up for you.

Most flows require you to fill in a field or two before you choose the **Run flow** action.

> [!TIP]
> If you don't see an **Automate** action, then your [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] probably hasn't yet been set up to use Power Automate. Learn more from your admin.-->

## Create, edit, and manage flows

Creating new flows or modifying and managing existing ones (like turning them on or off) can be done directly in Power Automate. But you can initiate some of these tasks from the Automate action menu in  [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]:

:::image type="content" source="media/power-automate-menu.svg" alt-text="Shows the Automate action in the action bar with expanded actions.":::

- To create an automated flow from a list, card, or document page, select **Automate** > **Create automated flow**.
- To create an approval workflow from a card or document page, select **Automate** > **Create approval flow**.

  > [!TIP]
  > This action is only available on card and document type pages; not lists.
- To create an instant flow from a list, card, or document page, select **Automate** > **Create action based on a flow**.
- To open Power Automate from a list, card, or document page, select **Automate** > **Manage flows**.
<!--- To create new flows or manage existing flows from inside [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], got to the **Manage Power Automate Flows** page.-->

These tasks are typically done by an admin or super user. The tasks require a broader knowledge of the business processes in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. To learn more, go to the following articles in the Business Central Dev and IT Pro help:

- [Power Automate integration](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/powerplatform/power-automate-overview)
- [Create automated flows](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/powerplatform/automate-workflows) (also covers approval flows)

- [Manage Power Automate flows](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/powerplatform/manage-power-automate-flows)
<!-- 

## Add more automated flows and instant flows

You can create flows through the [powerautomate.microsoft.com](https://powerautomate.microsoft.com) website. However, if your admin has switched on the capability to run Power Automate flows from inside [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, you can start the process of building a flow from the **Automate** action on the relevant pages, which can be found under the **More Options** menu depending on the page. Then choose the **Power Automate** menu item, and then choose the **Create a flow** action. Power Automate then opens in a new browser tab, and you're signed in automatically.

You can find sample templates to adapt to your company and all available trigger events, using both [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and external tools, by choosing the **Connectors** menu on the Power Automate website. Learn more about available templates and triggers in the [Set Up Automated Workflows](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/powerplatform/automate-workflows) article in the administration content.

## Create and manage Power Automate flows

You can create new flows or manage existing Power Automate flows in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on the **Manage Power Automate Flows** page. Learn more in the [Manage Power Automate Flows](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/powerplatform/manage-power-automate-flows) article in the administration content.

# Report and document layouts overview

A report layout controls content and format of the report. For example, the data fields in the report dataset that appear on the report, how they're arranged, the text style, images, and so on. From [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can change which layout is used on a report, create new layout, or modify the existing layouts.

> [!NOTE]  
> In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the term "report" also covers externally facing documents, such as sales invoices and order confirmations that you send to customers as PDF files.

You can also use report layouts to add content to email messages. For example, report layouts can save time and help ensure consistency by reusing the same content when you communicate with your customers. To use custom report layouts with email, the file type for the layout must be Word. You can't use the RDLC file type. Learn more in [Set Up Reusable Email Texts and Layouts](admin-how-setup-email.md#set-up-reusable-email-texts-and-layouts).

## Introduction

A report layout sets up the following things:

* The label and data fields to include from the dataset of the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] report.
* The text format, such as font type, size, and color.
* The company logo and its position.
* General page settings, such as margins and background images.

You can set up multiple layouts for a report, and then switch between them to suit different reporting needs.

<!--You can use one of the built-in report layouts or you can create custom report layouts and assign them to your reports as needed. Learn more in [Create a Custom Report or Document Layout](ui-how-create-custom-report-layout.md).-->

There are two important aspects of report layouts that influence how you work with them:

* The **Layout Type** indicates the kind of file that the layout is based on.
* The **Layout Source** indicates the origin of the layout.

## Layout types

There are four types of layouts that you can use for reports:

* Word
* RDLC
* Excel
* External

### Word

Word layouts are based on Word documents (.docx file type). Word layouts enable you to design report layouts by using Microsoft Word. A Word layout determines the report's content - controlling how that content elements are arranged and how they look. A Word layout document typically uses tables to arrange content, where the cells can contain data fields, text, or pictures.

[![Example of a word report layout document for Business Central.](media/word-layout-overview.png)](media/word-layout-overview.png#lightbox)

<!--![Example of a word report layout document for Business Central.](media/nav_wordreportlayout_edit_in_word_example.png) -->

Learn more in [Work with Word Layouts](ui-how-add-fields-word-report-layout.md).

### Excel

Excel layouts are based on Microsoft Excel workbooks (.xlsx file type). They let you create reports by using familiar Excel features for summarizing, analyzing, and presenting data with tools like formulas, PivotTables, PivotCharts, and more.

[![Shows the an example of an Excel layout.](media/excel-layout-2.png)](media/excel-layout-2.png#lightbox)

Learn more in [Work with Excel Layouts](ui-excel-report-layouts.md).

### RDLC

RDLC layouts are based on client report definition layout files (.rdl or .rdlc file types). These layouts are created and modified by using SQL Server Report Builder or Microsoft RDLC Report Designer. The design concept for RDLC layouts is similar to Word layouts, where the layout determines what fields to show and how they're arranged. However, designing RDLC layouts is more advanced than Word layouts.

[![Shows the an example of an RDLC layout.](media/rdlc-layout-overview.png)](media/rdlc-layout-overview.png#lightbox)

Learn more in [Work with RDLC Layouts](ui-rdlc-report-layouts.md).

### External

An external layout type refers to an advanced type designed for specific reports. The reports and the layouts themselves are typically provided by partners, not Microsoft. The actual file type of the layout varies depending on the provider.

Learn more in [Developing a Custom Report Render](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-report-custom-render).

## Layout sources

In addition to the type, layouts are further divided into three categories, based on their source or origin.

* Extension layouts

   Extension layouts are layouts that are part of an extension installed in a [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] environment. These layouts are typically standard layouts provided by Microsoft, for example, in the base application. Or, they could be layouts that are included in extensions from other software providers. You can identify extension layouts on the **Report Layouts** page because the **Extension** column shows the extension name and publisher.

* User-defined layouts

   The other source of layouts is the people who use [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. People with the right permissions can add new layouts in various ways. For example, you could start from an existing extension layout or a user-defined layout. You can identify user-defined layouts on the **Report Layouts** page because the **Extension** column is blank.

   Learn more in [Get Started Creating Report Layouts](ui-get-started-layouts.md).

* Custom layouts (obsolete)

  Custom layouts are also layouts that users create. The difference is that these layouts are created from the now obsolete **Custom Report Layouts** page, and they can only be Word and RDLC type. Although you can still create custom layouts, they're being phased out in favor of user-defined layouts.

  Learn more in [(Obsolete) Create and Modify Custom Report Layouts](ui-how-create-custom-report-layout.md).

To learn more about which type is best for you, go to [Decide what type of layout you want](ui-get-started-layouts.md#decide).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> One important thing to remember is that you can't modify extension layouts from the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] client. For example, you can't change the layout name or type, or upload and replace it with another version. If you try, an error message displays. You can create a user-defined or custom layout based on the extension layout instead.

<!--
### Built-in and custom report layouts

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes several built-in layouts. Built-in layouts are predefined layouts that are designed for specific reports. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] reports will have a built-in layout as either an RDLC report layout, Word report layout, or in some cases both. You can’t modify a built-in report layout from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] but you use them as a starting point for building your own custom report layouts.

Custom layouts are report layouts that you design to change the appearance of a report. You typically create a custom layout based on a built-in layout, but you can create them from scratch or from a copy of an existing custom layout. Custom layouts enable you to have multiple layouts for the same report, which you switch among as needed. For example, you can have different layouts for each [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] company, or you can have different layouts for the same company for specific occasions or events, like a special campaign or holiday season.

Deciding on whether to use a Word, Excel, or RDLC layout type will depend on how you want the generated report to look and your knowledge of tools for creating the layouts, like Word, Excel, and SQL Server Report Builder.

* The general design concepts for Word and RDLC layouts are similar. However each type has certain design features that affect how the generated report appears in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. This means that the same report might look different when using the Word report layout compared to the RDLC report layout.

* The process for setting up Word, Excel, and RDLC report layouts on reports is the same. The main difference is in the way you modify the layouts. Word and especially Excel layouts are typically easier to create and modify than RDLC report layouts because you use Word and Excel. RDLC report layouts are modified by using SQL Server Report builder, which targets more advanced users.

* Not all reports and document have a dataset that is optimized for use with an Excel layout. For example, aggregations and complex calculations work best with RDLC or Word layouts. The same is true for documents.

For information about how to switch the layout currently used on a report, see [Set the Layout Used by a Report](ui-set-report-layout.md).

## View report layout lifecycle telemetry

You can set up [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to send data to an Application Insights resource in Microsoft Azure about the actions users take on report layouts, like adding, modifying, deleting, and more. Then, using Azure Monitor, you create reports and set up alerts on the gathered data. Learn more in the following articles of the Developer and IT Pro help:

* [Monitoring and Analyzing Telemetry - Enabling Application Insights](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/telemetry-overview?toc=/dynamics365/business-central/toc.json#enable)

# Install and Uninstall Extensions (Apps) in Business Central

You can change [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] by installing apps that, for example, add functionality, change behavior, or give you access to new online services. For more information, see [Customizing Business Central Using Extensions](ui-extensions.md).

> [!NOTE]
> To install or uninstall apps from AppSource or add per-tenant apps, you must have the right permissions. You must either be a member of the D365 Extension MGT user group or you must have the EXTEND. MGT. - ADMIN permission set. If you're an administrator, you can assign user groups and permissions to other users in your company. To learn more about user groups and permissions, go to [Assign Permissions to Users and Groups](ui-define-granular-permissions.md).
>
> To use the functionality that is provided by an extension, such as opening pages, running reports, selecting actions, and so on, you must be assigned the permission sets that are installed as part of the extension.

To use an extension, you must be assigned the permission sets that come with it.

## <a name="install"></a>Install an extension

You manage apps and extensions on the **Extension Management** page. You can access this page from Home. Alternatively, choose the **Search for Page or Report** icon ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") in the top-right corner, enter **Extension**, and then choose the related link.  

You can get new apps from the marketplace at [AppSource.microsoft.com](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2081646). The marketplace offers all available apps for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], plus apps and content packs for other Microsoft products. Set the relevant filters, take a look at the information for each extension, and get an extension for your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

> [!NOTE]  
> Sign in to [AppSource.microsoft.com](https://appsource.microsoft.com/) using the email account that you use for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Use the same email account for other services and products for a smooth experience.  

You can also get to AppSource from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. On the **Extension Management** page, you can see the apps that are currently installed, and you can open the **Microsoft AppSource Apps** page that shows the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] apps that are currently available in AppSource. If you choose the **View AppSource** action, you're taken to [AppSource.microsoft.com](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2081646). For more information, see [Manage AppSource apps](admin-manage-appsource-apps.md).  

Choose an app to learn about what it does, and you can access Help for the app to learn more. When you choose to get an app, you must agree to its terms of use. If you get the app from the AppSource website, you'll be signed in to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to complete the installation.  

After you install an app, you might have to set it up. Some apps require that you provide some information before you can use them. For example, after you install the **PayPal Payments Standard** app, you must specify the email or the Merchant account ID for your PayPal account. To set up an app, or to find out what information you'll need, on the **Installed Extensions** page, choose the **Set up** action.  

Other apps simply add fields to an existing page, or they add a new page, for example.

If you uninstall an app, and you then change your mind, you can install it again. When you uninstall an app that you've been using your data isn't deleted. The data is available if you install the app again.

Some apps are provided by Microsoft, and other apps are provided by [other companies](ui-extensions-other.md). We recommend that you learn more about the app before you choose to install it.

Microsoft provides the following apps:

* [AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals Extension](ui-extensions-amc-banking.md)
* [Ceridian Payroll](ui-extensions-ceridian-payroll.md)
* [Company Hub](ui-extensions-company-hub.md)

* [US/CA/UK/AU/NZ/ZA - Send Remittance Advice](ui-extensions-send-remittance-advice.md)

## Set up an app

After you install an app, you might have to set it up. For example, for the **PayPal Payments Standard for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]** app you must specify the PayPal account to use. If that's the case, when installation completes [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will ask whether you want to set up the app right away. Setups can be required for the app to work, or optional.

If you choose to set up your app right away, and it has a required setup, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will open the required setup. The setup can be either a page where you enter information, or an assisted setup guide that helps you through the steps. If you don't complete the setup in one go, you can use the **Setups for _name of app_** page, which lists all setups for the app. Required setups indicated by **bold letters**.

## Upload a per-tenant extension (PTE)

You upload a PTE by using the **Extension Management** page. On the **Extension Management** page, go to **Manage**, then choose **Upload Extension**. On the **Upload and Deploy Extension** page, specify the .app file to upload. To proceed, choose the **Accept** button, and then the **Deploy** button, which will start the process of deploying the PTE.

If the PTE contains breaking schema changes, it's possible to *force* an upload of it. To do that, in **Schema Sync Mode** choose the **Force** option. You'll get a confirmation dialog to accept before proceeding.  

## Uninstall an app

You uninstall an app by using the **Extension Management** page. To uninstall an app, select it on the page, then select the **Uninstall** action. If you uninstall an app, and you then change your mind, you can install the app again.

By default, when you uninstall an app that you've been using your data isn't deleted. If you're sure you won't install the app again, and you can delete the data when you uninstall it. To delete data when you uninstall an app, turn on the **Delete Extension Data** toggle. You'll get a confirmation dialog, and you must choose **Yes** to turn it on. After the **Delete Extension Data** switch is turned on, you can uninstall the app, and you'll be asked to reconfirm that you want to uninstall the app and delete the data.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> * There might be apps that require or depend on the app that you want to uninstall. These apps are referred to as *dependents*. You can't uninstall an app unless you also uninstall its dependents. When you uninstall an app that has dependents, a dialog lists the dependents. To continue, you'll have to select **Yes** to uninstall the app and its dependents.
> * If you turn on the **Delete Extension Data** toggle, uninstalling the app will delete all data for the app *plus* data for all dependent apps. The action can't be undone.
> * Some apps are required and you can't delete them on the **Extension Management** page.  

If you want to keep the data for an uninstalled app, you can delete the data later. The **Delete Orphaned Extension Data** page lists the apps that you still have data for. To delete the data, choose the app, and then choose **Delete Data**.

# Setting Up Data Exchange

Before you can send and receive electronic documents or import and export bank files, you must set up the data exchange framework to process the involved files. In addition, you must set up related areas, such as the customers that you send electronic invoices to, or the AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals extension if you use the external service provider to convert your bank files. For more information, see [Exchanging Data Electronically](across-data-exchange.md).  

 When [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is set up to exchange data with external files, users can use the setup in common business tasks, such as sending and receiving electronic documents and importing and exporting bank files.  

 The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the topics that describe them.

# Publish a web service

Web services are a lightweight way to make application functionality available to different kinds of external systems and users. By default, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] exposes several objects as web services for better integration with other Microsoft services. You can add other web services as your business requires.  

Set up a web service in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], and then publish the web service so that it's available to authenticated users. All authorized users can access metadata for web services, but only users who have sufficient permissions can access actual data.  

## Creating and Publishing a Web Service

The following steps explain how to create and publish a web service.  

### To create and publish a web service  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Web Services**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Web Services** page, choose **New**. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > **Codeunit** and **Page** are valid types for SOAP web services. **Page** and **Query** are valid types for OData web services. Starting with version 16.3, **Codeunit** is also a valid type for OData v4 web services, but then no URL is shown in the user interface. 
    > Also, if the database contains multiple companies, you can choose an object ID that is specific to one of the companies.  
    > Finally, the service name is visible to consumers of your web service and is the basis for identifying and distinguishing web services, so you should make the name meaningful.

3. Select the check box in the **Published** column.  

When you publish the web service, the **OData URL** and **SOAP URL** fields show the new URLs. However, for codeunits that are exposed as OData v4 unbound actions, the URL fields aren't shown.  

You can test the web service immediately by choosing the links in the **OData URL** and **SOAP URL** fields. Optionally, copy the value of the field and save it for later use. To test codeunits that are exposed as OData v4 unbound actions, follow the instructions in the [Verifying web service availability](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-creating-and-interacting-with-odatav4-unbound-action#verifying-web-service-availability) section in the developer content.

> [!NOTE]
> If the objects that you expose as web services must not be accessible from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, you must mark the methods exposed in the code as `[Scope('OnPrem')]`. For more information, see [Scope Attribute](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/methods/devenv-scope-attribute).

After you publish a web service, it's available to external parties. You can verify the availability of that web service by using a browser, or choose the link in the **OData URL** and **SOAP URL** fields on the **Web Services** page. The following procedure illustrates how you can verify the availability of the web service for later use.  

### To verify the availability of a web service  

1. In your browser, enter the relevant URL. The following table illustrates the types of URLs that you can enter for different web service types.  

    > [!div class="mx-tdBreakAll"]
    > |Type|Syntax|Example|
    > |----------------|------|-------|
    > |SOAP|`https://api.businesscentral.dynamics.com/*version*/*tenant*/Production/WS/*CompanyName*/*entity*/` |`https://api.businesscentral.dynamics.com/v2.0/7acc9d3d-d354-4616-8bbd-c4fc9f2b15b3/Production/WS/CRONUS%20USA%2C%20Inc./Page/InvoiceDocument`|
    > |OData V4|`https://api.businesscentral.dynamics.com/*version*/*tenant*/Production/ODataV4/Company('*CompanyName*')/*entity*`|`https://api.businesscentral.dynamics.com/v2.0/7acc9d3d-d354-4616-8bbd-c4fc9f2b15b3/Production/ODataV4/Company('CRONUS%20USA%2C%20Inc.')/InvoiceDocument`<br/>    The company name is case-sensitive.|

2. Review the information that is displayed in the browser. Verify that you can see the name of the web service that you created.  

When you access a web service, and you want to write data back to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you must specify the company name. You can specify the company as part of the URI as shown in the examples; alternatively, specify the company as part of the query parameters. For example, the following URIs point to the same OData web service and are both valid URIs.  

```
https://api.businesscentral.dynamics.com/v1.0/OData/Company('CRONUS International Ltd.')/Customer  
```

```
https://api.businesscentral.dynamics.com/v1.0/OData/Customer?company='CRONUS International Ltd.'  
```

# Troubleshooting: Accessing Camera and Location

You might come across some issues when trying to access the camera and location information of a device from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. You can find the possible causes behind these problems and how to work around them listed below.

## Device must have Camera and Location Capabilities

In order to access the camera or a user's location from a device, the device must have a physical camera or the capability to retrieve location information, respectively.

If your device has camera and location capabilities but you still encounter problems, it is possible that some drivers need updating or reinstalling. Even if you are unsure, we always recommend you update your device operating system, drivers, and browser to the latest version for the best experience.

## Access Permissions not Enabled

You must enable general access to camera and location from your device's privacy settings and explicitly give permission to  [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to access them. For example, to see or change permissions for a device running on Windows, go to **Settings**, choose **Privacy**, and then **App permissions**. 

For mobile devices, you must give camera and location access permissions to the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Mobile App. To do so for an iOS device, go to **Settings**, choose **Privacy**, and then **Camera** or **Location**. For Android devices go to **Settings**, choose **Apps & Notifications**, **Advanced**, **Permission Manager**, and then **Camera** or **Location**.

In addition, if you are using [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in a browser, you must also grant the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] site permission to access the camera or location information. To see or change a site's permissions in the Microsoft Edge browser, go to **Settings**, choose **Site Permissions**, and then **Camera** or **Location**. Note that this might be different for other browsers.

By default, the device or browser will pop up a request to access these capabilities when the user activates them for the first time.

> [!NOTE]  
> Some old browsers do not grant access to camera and location. For example, camera is not available in Internet Explorer or the legacy Edge browser.

## Web Client Connection not Secure

The camera and location capabilities are only available when accessing the Web Client through SSL secured HTTP connections, using the `https://` URI scheme. 

The only exception is connecting to `http://localhost`, used for development and test purposes.


## Work with Virtualization Technologies

When connecting to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] through Remote Desktop or another virtualization, the access to camera or location might not be available. If this is the case, use the physical system instead.

## Antivirus Software
Some antivirus software block access to camera and location by default. Remember to check your antivirus software settings.

# Financial analytics

During daily activities, businesses capture lots of data that can support business intelligence (BI) for decision makers:

- Sales figures
- Purchases
- Operational expenses
- Employee salaries
- Budgets

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers features to help you gather, analyze, and share your organization's finance data:

- Financial reporting (for financial statements and KPIs)
- Power BI reports for finance
- Ad-hoc analysis on lists
- Ad-hoc analysis of data in Excel (using open in Excel)
- Built-in finance reports

Each of these features has its advantages and disadvantages, depending on the type of data analysis and the role of the user. To learn more, go to [Analytics, business intelligence, and reporting overview](reports-bi-reporting.md).

This article introduces how you can use these analytical features to provide financial insights.

## Analytics needs in finance

When thinking of analytics needs in finance, it might help to use a mental model based on personas described on a high-level and their different analytics needs.

:::image type="content" source="/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/media/analytics-personas.svg" alt-text="Illustration of different personas for analytics" lightbox="/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/media/analytics-personas.svg":::

People in different roles have different needs when it comes to data, and they use the data in different ways. For example, people in finance interact with data differently than people in sales.

:::image type="content" source="/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/media/analytics-personas-scenarios.svg" alt-text="Illustration of how different personas have different analytics needs." lightbox="/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/media/analytics-personas-scenarios.svg":::

| Role              | Data aggregation  | Typical ways to consume data                          | 
|-------------------|-------------------| ----------------------------------------------------- |
|CFO / CEO          | Performance data  | KPIs <br> Dashboards <br> Financial reports           |
|Finance Management | Trends, summaries | Built-in managerial reports <br> Ad-hoc analysis      | 
|Bookkeeper         | Detailed data     | Built-in operational reports <br> On-screen task data |

## Using Power BI to monitor financial statements and KPIs

A key performance indicator (KPI) is a measurable value that shows how effectively you’re meeting your goals. In finance, people often use the following KPIs to monitor their organization's financial health:

- Net Profit Margin
- Gross Profit Margin
- Current/Quick/Cash Ratio
- COGS (Cost of Goods Sold)
- Debt-to-Equity Ratio
- Current/Payroll/Longterm Liabilities
- Operating Profit - EBIT
- EBITDA
- Average Collection Period (Days)

:::image type="content" source="media/finance/financial-overview.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Finance Overview report" lightbox="media/finance/financial-overview.png":::

These financial KPIs, and more, are available in the Power BI Finance app for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. To learn more, go to [Power BI finance app](finance-powerbi-app.md).

[!INCLUDE [power-bi-finance-app](includes/power-bi-finance-app.md)]

## Using Financial Reporting to produce financial statements and KPIs

The **Financial Reporting** feature gives you insights into the financial data shown on your chart of accounts (COA). You can set up financial reports to analyze figures in general ledger (G/L) accounts, and compare general ledger entries with budget entries. The results display in charts and reports on your home page, such as the Cash Flow chart, and the Income Statement and Balance Sheet reports.

Dimensions play an important role in business intelligence. A dimension is data that you can add to an entry as a parameter. Dimensions let you group entries that have similar characteristics so they're easier to analyze. For example, customers, regions, products, and salespersons. Among other purposes, use dimensions when you define analysis views and create financial reports. Learn more at [Work with Dimensions](finance-dimensions.md).

> [!TIP]
> As a quick way to analyze transactional data, you can filter totals in the chart of accounts and all entries in **Entries** pages by dimensions. Look for the **Set Dimension Filter** action.  

The following table describes a sequence of tasks in financial reporting, with links to the articles that describe them.

## Finance reporting across business units or legal entities

Some organizations use [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in multiple business units or legal entities. Others use [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in subsidiaries that must report into parent organizations. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] gives accountants tools that help them transfer general ledger entries from two or more companies (subsidiaries) into a consolidated company.  

To learn more, go to [Company consolidation](finance-consolidated-company-reporting.md).

## Ad-hoc analysis of finance data

Sometimes, you just need to check whether the numbers add up correctly, or quickly confirm a figure. The following features are great for ad-hoc analyses:

- Data analysis on ledger list pages
- Open in Excel

The Data analysis feature lets you open almost any list page, such as General Ledger Entries, Fixed Asset Ledger Entries, Check Ledger Entries, or Bank Account Ledger Entries, enter analysis mode, and then group, filter, and pivot data as you see fit.

:::image type="content" source="media/data-analysis-gl-entries.png" alt-text="Example of how to do data analysis on the G/L entries page." lightbox="media/data-analysis-gl-entries.png":::

Similarly, you can use the **Open in Excel** action to open a list page for ledger entries, optionally filter the list to a subset of the data, and then use Excel to work with the data. For example, by using features such as [!INCLUDE [excel-copilot-name](includes/excel-copilot-name.md)], Analyze Data, What-If Analysis, or Forecast Sheet.

:::image type="content" source="media/open-in-excel-gl-entries.png" alt-text="Example of how to do data analysis on the G/L entries data using Excel." lightbox="media/open-in-excel-gl-entries.png":::

[!INCLUDE [onedrive-excel-online](includes/onedrive-excel-online.md)]

To learn more about ad-hoc analyses on ledgers, go to [Ad hoc analysis on finance data](ad-hoc-analysis-finance.md).

## Built-in reports for finance

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes several built-in reports, tracing functions, and tools to help auditors or controllers who are responsible for reporting to the finance department.

To get an overview of available reports, you can choose **All reports** on the top pane of your home page. This action opens the Role Explorer, which is filtered to the features in the **Report & Analysis** option. To learn more, go to [Finding Reports with the Role Explorer](ui-role-explorer.md).

:::image type="content" source="media/report-explorer-finance.png" alt-text="Example of reports on the finance role center." lightbox="media/report-explorer-finance.png":::

Built-in reports come in two flavors:

- Designed for print (pdf).
- Designed for analysis in Excel.

The following articles provide more information about built-in reports:

- [Built-in key finance reports](finance-reports.md)
- [Built-in fixed assets reports](fa-reports.md)
- [Built-in accounts receivable reports](receivables-reports.md)
- [Built-in accounts payable reports](payables-reports.md)

<!-- TODO: add when we have these articles
* [Built-in Cost Accounting reports](cost-accounting-reports.md) 
* [Built-in Cash Management reports](cost-accounting-reports.md) 
* [Built-in Tax and VAT reports](tax-and-vat-reports.md) 
-->

## On-screen finance task pages

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] has several pages that give you financial overviews and tasks to do:

- [Show general ledger entries and balances from the Chart of Accounts page](#show-general-ledger-entries-and-balances-from-the-chart-of-accounts-page)
- [View actual amounts compared to budgeted amounts for all accounts and for several periods](#view-actual-amounts-compared-to-budgeted-amounts-for-all-accounts-and-for-several-periods)
- [Analyze data by dimensions](#analyze-data-by-dimensions)
- [Analyzing cash flow](#analyzing-cash-flow)

### Show general ledger entries and balances from the Chart of Accounts page

The Chart of Accounts page shows all general ledger accounts with aggregated numbers posted to the general ledger. From this page, you can do things like:  

- View reports that show general ledger entries and balances.  
- Review a list of posting groups for that account.
- View separate debit and credit balances for a single account.

:::image type="content" source="media/chart-of-accounts-page.png" alt-text="Example of how the Chart of Accounts page shows finance insights" lightbox="media/chart-of-accounts-page.png":::

To learn more, go to [Understand the Chart of Accounts](finance-general-ledger.md#the-chart-of-accounts).

### View actual amounts compared to budgeted amounts for all accounts and for several periods

As a part of gathering, analyzing, and sharing your company data, you might want to view actual amounts compared to budgeted amounts for all accounts and for several periods. You can make this comparison from the **Chart of Accounts** page, by choosing the **G/L Balance/Budget** action.

To learn more, go to [Analyze Actual Amounts Versus Budgeted Amounts](bi-how-analyze-actual-versus-budget.md).

### Analyze data by dimensions

Dimensions are values that categorize entries so you can track and analyze them on documents, such as sales orders. Dimensions can, for example, indicate the project or department an entry came from.  

So, instead of setting up separate general ledger accounts for each department and project, you can use dimensions as a basis for analysis and avoid having to create a complicated chart of accounts structure.

In financial analysis, a dimension is data you add to a G/L entry as a kind of marker. This data is used to group G/L entries with similar characteristics, such as customers, regions, products, and salesperson, and easily retrieve these groups for analysis. You can use dimensions on entries in journals, documents, and budgets.

To learn more, go to [Analyze Data by Dimensions](bi-how-analyze-data-dimension.md).

### Analyzing cash flow

On the Accountant home page, under **Finance Performance**, the Cash Cycle, Cash Flow, and Income & Expense charts offer ways to analyze cash flow:

- Review figures for a period by using the timeline slider.
- Filter the chart by choosing the source in the legend.
- Change the length of the period, or go to the previous or next period, by choosing options on the Finance Performance drop down.

:::image type="content" source="media/cashflow-accountant-rolecentre.png" alt-text="Example of how the cash flow visuals look on the accountant role centre" lightbox="media/cashflow-accountant-rolecentre.png":::

To examine the forecast, in addition to forecast entries, you can also look at the cash flow worksheet. For example, you can see how the forecast:

- Handles confirmed sales and purchases.
- Subtracts payables and adds receivables.
- Skips duplicate sales orders and purchase orders.

To learn more, go to [Analyzing Cash Flow in Your Company](finance-analyze-cash-flow.md).

# Track Email Message Exchanges Between Salespeople and Contacts

[!INCLUDE[azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id](~/../shared-content/shared/azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id.md)]

Get more out of the communications between your salespeople and customers by turning email exchanges into actionable opportunities. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can work with Exchange Online to keep a log of the inbound and outbound messages. You can view and analyze the contents of each message on the **Interaction Log Entries** page.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and Exchange Online must be on the same tenant.

## To set up email logging

### Set up public folders and rules for email logging in Exchange Online

[!INCLUDE[admin-setup-email-public-folder](includes/admin-setup-email-public-folder.md)]

Next, you connect [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with Exchange Online.

### Set Up a shared mailbox and rules for email logging in Exchange Online

> [!NOTE]
> These steps require administrator access for Exchange Online.

Prepare a shared mailbox in the Exchange admin center. Alternatively, you can also use Exchange Online PowerShell. For more information, see [Create a shared mailbox](/microsoft-365/admin/email/create-a-shared-mailbox) or [Exchange Online PowerShell](/powershell/exchange/exchange-online-powershell?view=exchange-ps&preserve-view=true).

> [!NOTE]
> If you use Exchange Management PowerShell, your changes are available in the Exchange admin center after a delay. The delay might be several hours.

### Add a user account for members of the shared mailbox

The account that you use for email logging is an Exchange Online account. The scheduled job uses the account to connect to the shared mailbox and process emails. This account shouldn't be associated with a specific person. Add the email account to the members for the shared mailbox. For more information, see [Use the EAC to edit shared mailbox delegation](/exchange/collaboration-exo/shared-mailboxes#use-the-eac-to-edit-shared-mailbox-delegation).

### Allow other users to see logged emails

You can allow another user to open an email message in Exchange that is related to an interaction log entry from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. To do that, give the user ``Read`` permission to the **Archive** folder in the shared mailbox. For more information, see [Exchange Online PowerShell](/powershell/exchange/exchange-online-powershell?view=exchange-ps&preserve-view=true).

### Create mail flow rules

Mail flow rules look for specific conditions on messages and take action on them. Create two mail flow rules based on the information in the following table. For more information, see [Manage mail flow rules in Exchange Online](/exchange/security-and-compliance/mail-flow-rules/manage-mail-flow-rules?preserve-view=true) and [Mail flow rule actions in Exchange Online](/exchange/security-and-compliance/mail-flow-rules/mail-flow-rule-actions?preserve-view=true).

|Purpose  |Name  |Apply this rule if...  |Do the following...  |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|A rule for incoming email     |Log Email Sent to This Organization|The sender is located outside the organization, and the recipient is located inside the organization|BCC the email account that is specified for the shared mailbox.|
|A rule for outgoing email     |Log Email Sent from This Organization|The sender is located inside the organization, and the recipient is located outside the organization.|BCC the email account that is specified for the shared mailbox.|

> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] only processes messages in the Inbox folder in the shared mailbox. If a rule moves messages from the Inbox to another folder, those messages will not be processed. Additionally, messages in the Junk Mails folder are also ignored.

## Set Up [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to log email messages

Get started with email logging in two easy steps:

1. Connect [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with Exchange Online for your Microsoft 365 subscription. Exchange Online handles your email messages. We made this step easy by providing an assisted setup guide. You just need your administrator credentials for your administrator account in Microsoft 365. To start the guide, go to the **Assisted Setup** page, and then select the **Set up email logging** guide.  

2. Make sure that the email addresses for your sales people and contacts in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] are valid. To do that, for each customer or salesperson, open the **Contact** or **Salesperson/Purchaser** card and have a look in the **Email** field.

    > [!Tip]
    > After you complete the steps in the guide you can check whether the connection was successful. Search for **Email Logging**, choose **Actions**, and then choose **Validate Setup**.

## View email message exchanges in the Interaction Log

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates an entry on the **Interaction Log** page each time a salesperson and a contact exchange an email message. To view the interaction log, open the **Contact** card for the person, choose **Related**, then **History**, and then **Interaction Log Entries**. There are a few things you can do with each entry in the log, for example:

* View the content of the email message that was exchanged by selecting **Process** and then **Show Attachments**.
* Turn an email exchange into a sales opportunity. If an entry looks promising, you can turn it into an opportunity and then manage its progress toward a sale. To turn an email exchange into an opportunity, choose the entry, then **Process**, and then **Create Opportunity**. For more information, see [Managing Sales Opportunities](marketing-manage-sales-opportunities.md).

## Mailbox and folder limits in Exchange Online

There are mailbox and folder limits in Exchange Online, such as limits for folder sizes and the number of messages. For more information, see [Exchange Online limits](/office365/servicedescriptions/exchange-online-service-description/exchange-online-limits#storage-limits) and [Limits for public folders in Exchange Server](/Exchange/collaboration/public-folders/limits?view=exchserver-2019&preserve-view=true).

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] stores logged email messages in a folder in Exchange Online. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] also stores a link to each logged message. The links open the logged messages in Exchange Online from the Interaction Log Entries, Contact Card, and Salespersons Card pages in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. If a logged message is moved to another folder, the link is broken. For example, a message might be moved manually, or Exchange Online might automatically start AutoSplit when a storage limit is reached.

The following steps can help you avoid breaking links to messages in Exchange Online.

1. Don't move existing messages to another folder after you change settings for your email logging setup. Keeping existing messages put preserves the links. Links to messages in the new folder are valid.
2. Avoid reaching the mailbox and folder limits. If you're about to reach a limit, take the following steps:
    1. Set up a new shared mailbox in Exchange Online.
    2. Update your email flow rules in Exchange Online.
    3. Update your email logging setup in Business Central accordingly

## Connect on-premises versions to Microsoft Exchange

You can connect [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises to Exchange on-premises or Exchange Online for email logging. For both versions of Exchange, settings for the connection are available on the **Marketing Setup** page. For Exchange Online, you can also use an assisted setup guide.

<!-- [!IMPORTANT]
> The new experience doesn't support a connection to Exchange on-premises. If you must use Exchange on-premises, do not enable the feature update for the new experience.

## Connect to Exchange on-premises
<!--
## [Current Experience](#tab/current-experience)
To connect [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises to Exchange on-premises, on the **Marketing Setup** page, you can use **Basic** as the **Authentication Type**, and then enter credentials for the user account for Exchange on-premises. Then turn on the **Enabled** toggle to start logging email.

## [New Experience](#tab/new-experience)
The new experience does not support connections to Exchange on-premises.
-->
## Connect to Exchange Online

To connect to Exchange Online, you must register an application in Microsoft Entra ID. Provide the application ID, key vault secret, and the redirect URL to use for the registration. The redirect URL is preset and should work for most installations. For more information, see [To register an application in Microsoft Entra ID for connecting from Business Central to Exchange Online](#to-register-an-application-in-microsoft-entra-id-for-connecting-from-business-central-to-exchange-online). 

You must also use **OAuth2** as the **Authentication Type**. You must also register an application in Microsoft Entra ID. Provide the application ID, key vault secret, and the redirect URL to use for the registration. The redirect URL is prepopulated and should work for most installations. For more information, see [To register an application in Microsoft Entra ID for connecting from Business Central to Exchange Online](#to-register-an-application-in-microsoft-entra-id-for-connecting-from-business-central-to-exchange-online).

You must set up your installation to use HTTPS. For more information, see [Configuring SSL to Secure the Business Central Web Client Connection](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/deployment/configure-ssl-web-client-connection). If you're setting up your server to have a different home page, you can change the URL. The client secret is saved as an encrypted string in your database.

### To register an application in Microsoft Entra ID for connecting from Business Central to Exchange Online

The following steps assume that you use Microsoft Entra ID to manage identities and access. For more information, see [Quickstart: Register an application with the Microsoft identity platform](/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app). 

1. In the Azure portal, under **Manage**, choose **Authentication**.
2. Under **Redirect URL**, add the redirect URL that is suggested on the **Email Logging** page in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. If the redirect URL field on the Email Logging page is empty, find the suggested redirect URL on the **Assisted Setup** page. To open the page, on the **Email Logging** page, choose **Actions**, and then **Assisted Setup**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you do not specify the redirect URL, you can do so later by choosing **Add a platform**, and then choosing **Web** to add the web application and the redirect URL.

3. Under **Manage**, choose **API permissions**, and choose **Microsoft Graph**, and then choose **Delegated permissions**.
4. Use the search box to find and select **Mail**, and then add the **Mail.ReadWrite.Shared** permission.
5. Under **Manage**, choose **Certificates & Secrets**, and then create a new secret for your app. You use the secret either in the **Client Secret** field on the **Email Logging** page in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].
6. Choose **Overview**, and then find the **Application (client) ID** value. This value is the client ID of your application. You must enter it either in the **Client ID** field on the **Email Logging** page.
7. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], set up email logging on the **Email Logging** page, or use the **Assisted Setup** guide for assistance.

### Use Another Identity and Access Management Service

If you aren't using Microsoft Entra ID to manage identities and access, you need some help from a developer. If you prefer to store the app ID and secret in a different location, you can leave the Client ID and Client Secret fields blank and write an extension to fetch the ID and secret from the location. You can provide the secret at runtime by subscribing to the OnGetEmailLoggingClientId and OnGetEmailLoggingClientSecret events in codeunit 1641 "Setup Email Logging."

## To start logging email

1. To start logging email, on the **Email Logging** page, turn on the **Enabled** toggle.
2. Sign in with the Exchange Online account that the scheduled job uses to connect to the shared mailbox and process emails.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you are not prompted to sign in the the Exchange Online account, it might be because your browser is blocking pop-ups. To sign in, allow pop-ups from https://login.microsoftonline.com.

## To stop logging email

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Email Logging**, and then choose the related link.
2. Turn off the **Enabled** toggle.

## To change the user account used for email logging

### [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Online

1. Sign in to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with the account that the scheduled job uses to connect to the shared mailbox and process emails. This account must have access to both [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and Exchange Online.
2. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Email Logging**, and then choose the related link. 
3. Choose **Related**, and then **Job Queue Entry**.
4. Restart the **Email Logging** job.

### [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Email Logging**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose **Actions**, and then **Renew Token**.

# Design Details: Availability in the Warehouse

Stay on top of item availability to ensure that outbound orders flow efficiently, and that your delivery times are optimal.  

Availability can vary, depending on several factors. Fr example:

* Allocations at the bin level when warehouse activities such as picks and movements happen.
* When the inventory reservation system imposes restrictions to comply with.

Before allocating quantities to picks for outbound flows, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] verifies that all conditions are met.

When conditions aren't met, error messages are shown. One typical message is the generic "Nothing to handle." message. The message can be shown for many different reasons in outbound and inbound flows where a document line contains the **Qty. to Handle** field.

## Bin content and reservations  

Item quantities exist both as warehouse entries and as item ledger entries in inventory. These two types of entries contain different information about where items are and whether they're available. Warehouse entries define an item’s availability by bin and bin type, which is called bin content. Item ledger entries define an item’s availability by its reservation for outbound documents.  

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates the quantity that's available to pick when bin content is coupled with reservations.  

## Quantity available to pick  

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] reserves items for pending sales order shipments so that they aren't picked for other sales orders that ship earlier. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] subtracts quantities of items that are already being processed, as follows:

* Quantities reserved for other outbound documents.
* Quantities on existing pick documents.
* Quantities picked but not yet shipped or consumed.  

The result is calculated dynamically and displayed in the **Available Qty. to Pick** field on the **Pick Worksheet** page. The value is also calculated when users create warehouse picks directly for outbound documents. The following are examples of outbound documents:

* Sales orders
* Production consumption
* Outbound transfers

The result is available in these documents in the quantity fields, such as the **Qty. to Handle** field.  

> [!NOTE]  
> For the priority of reservations, the quantity to reserve is subtracted from the quantity available to pick. For example, if the quantity available in pick bins is 5 units, but 100 units are in put-away bins, when you reserve more than 5 units for another order, an error message is displayed because the additional quantity must be available in pick bins.  

### Calculating the quantity available to pick  

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates the quantity available to pick as follows:  

quantity available to pick = quantity in pick bins - quantity on picks and movements – (reserved quantity in pick bins + reserved quantity on picks and movements)  

The following diagram shows the different elements of the calculation.  

![Available to pick with reservation overlap.](media/design_details_warehouse_management_availability_2.png "Available to pick with reservation overlap")  

## Quantity available to reserve

Because the concepts of bin content and reservation coexist, the quantity of items that are available to reserve must align with allocations to outbound warehouse documents.  

You can reserve all inventory items, except items for which outbound processing has started. The quantity that's available to reserve is defined as the quantity on all documents and bin types. The following outbound quantities are exceptions:  

* Quantity on unregistered pick documents  
* Quantity in shipment bins  
* Quantity in to-production bins  
* Quantity in open shop floor bins  
* Quantity in to-assembly bins  
* Quantity in adjustment bins  

The result is displayed in the **Total Available Quantity** field on the **Reservation** page.  

On a reservation line, the quantity that can't be reserved because it's allocated in the warehouse is displayed in the **Qty. Allocated in Warehouse** field on the **Reservation** page.  

## Check whether items are available for picking

[!INCLUDE [inventory-availability-overview](includes/inventory-availability-overview.md)]

### Calculating the quantity available to reserve

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates the quantity available to reserve as follows:  

quantity available to reserve = total quantity in inventory - quantity on picks and movements for source documents - reserved quantity - quantity in outbound bins  

The following diagram shows the different elements of the calculation.

# Liquidity (Power BI report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The Liquidity Report is designed to help you evaluate your company's short-term financial health by focusing on three key performance indicators: Current Ratio, Quick Ratio, and Cash Ratio. These ratios, along with their supporting details, allow you to assess your ability to meet current liabilities.

:::image type="content" source="media/finance/liquidity-report.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Liquidity report" lightbox="media/finance/liquidity-report.png":::

## Use the report

The audiences for the report are:

- Executives
- Directors
- Other high-level decision makers

Executives use the report to analyze the company's financial stability and help ensure there's sufficient cash flow for ongoing operations. For a broad perspective of liquidity, you could assess the current ratio. The current ratio compares current assets to current liabilities. This helps assess day-to day operational stability.

For a more conservative assessment, you can analyze the quick ratio, which removes inventory and purchase prepayments from the equation. This ratio focuses on cash and assets that you can quickly convert to cash, such as accounts receivable.  

Finally, you could review the cash ratio, which focuses on liquid assets to meet financial obligations. This perspective is the most conservative, and focuses on cash and cash equivalents to meet current liabilities.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The *Liquidity* report includes the following KPIs and measures: 

- [**Current Ratio**](finance-powerbi-kpis.md#current-ratio)
- [**Quick Ratio**](finance-powerbi-kpis.md#quick-ratio)
- [**Cash Ratio**](finance-powerbi-kpis.md#cash-ratio)
- [**Current Assets**](finance-powerbi-kpis.md#current-assets)
- [**Current Liabilities**](finance-powerbi-kpis.md#current-liabilities)
- [**Inventory**](finance-powerbi-kpis.md#inventory)
- [**Purchase Prepayments**](finance-powerbi-kpis.md#purchase-prepayments)
- [**Liquid Assets**](finance-powerbi-kpis.md#liquid-assets)

[!INCLUDE[click-on-a-kpi-link](includes/click-on-a-kpi-link.md)] 

[!INCLUDE[powerbi-tip-track-kpis](includes/powerbi-tip-track-kpis.md)]

## Data used in the report

The report uses data from the following tables in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]:

- G/L Entry
- G/L Accounts
- G/L Account Categories

# Keyboard shortcuts

This article provides an overview of key combinations (keyboard shortcuts) that you can use when you work with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

You can find an overview of the most popular keyboard shortcuts in [Keyboard shortcuts (PC only)](keyboard-shortcuts-cheatsheet.md).

> [!TIP]
> For a graphical view of the most-used keyboard shortcuts, select the following image, and download the PDF file.

## Overview of keyboard shortcuts

Keyboard shortcuts aid accessibility and can make it easier and more efficient to navigate to different areas and elements on a page. Most web browsers support these shortcuts. However, the behavior might vary slightly.

> [!NOTE]
> The keyboard shortcuts that this article describes refer to the English (United States) keyboard layout. The layout of keys on other keyboards doesn't correspond exactly to the layout on a United States English keyboard.

Most of the keyboard shortcuts are the same, regardless of whether the operating system is Windows or macOS. However, some shortcuts differ for macOS. These shortcuts are enclosed in parentheses in the following sections.

> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports only a single character set for data. Therefore, some characters might not be supported in your environment, and you might experience issues if you try to retrieve data that was entered by using a different character set. For example, if your environment supports only English and Russian characters, data might not be stored correctly if you enter it in a language that uses different characters. This issue can also apply to keyboard shortcuts. You should contact your system administrator to ensure that you know which languages your instance of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports.
>
> In addition to the global keyboard shortcuts that this article describes, some business-specific shortcuts are available. For example, in the generic version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the <kbd>F9</kbd> key posts a document, and <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>F7</kbd> shows the ledger entries for a record when you open the record in a card. This article includes some of the more common business-specific shortcuts. Be aware that the shortcuts might differ in your solution. In the user interface, the tooltip for an action shows the keyboard shortcut to use.

## <a name="Keyboard"></a>General keyboard shortcuts

The following table describes the keyboard shortcuts for navigating and accessing different elements of a page. Elements include things like actions, dropdown lists, and lookups. Learn about the shortcuts for navigating records when you're inside a list in the [Keyboard shortcuts in lists](#lists) section.

# OneDrive in Business Central FAQ

[!INCLUDE [online_only](includes/online_only.md)]

This article answers common questions about using OneDrive for Business with [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## Does this work with all [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] clients?

Yes. You can open files in OneDrive from the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] mobile apps, when viewing card details in Microsoft Teams, or even from the Outlook add-in.  

## Is OneDrive the same as SharePoint for storing files?

No. OneDrive is private by default, allowing you to organize and share content, while SharePoint offers a shared file repository for your organization. Additionally, OneDrive is included in your Microsoft 365 subscription.

## Does [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] support consumer OneDrive?

No. This integration is exclusively intended for OneDrive for Business and only supports your work account. 

## Are all OneDrive for Business plans supported?

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't support standalone OneDrive for Business plans. OneDrive must be part of a Microsoft 365 business or enterprise plan. Learn more at [Compare OneDrive plans](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/onedrive/compare-onedrive-plans?market=af&activetab=tab:primaryr2).

## Where can I see OneDrive service health?

Administrators can access the Service health dashboard in the Microsoft 365 admin center. The dashboard includes OneDrive's service availability. Visit the [Service health dashboard](https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/Home?#/servicehealth).

## Is OneDrive integration available to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on premises?

Yes, but unlike [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, it does require more setup. Learn more in [Configuring Business Central on-premises](admin-onedrive-integration-onpremises.md).  

## Does [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on premises connect with SharePoint Server?

No. This deployment combination isn't supported, even if SharePoint Server is enabled with My Sites.  

## Does [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online connect with SharePoint Server?

No. This deployment combination isn't supported, even if SharePoint Server is enabled with My Sites.  

## How does this work in an organization with multiple environments?

The integration assumes that company names are unique across [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] environments. When company names are unique across the organization, opening a file in OneDrive will copy the file to a folder named after the current company. If company names aren't unique across environments, files from identical company names might be placed together in the same folder.  

## We changed the company name. What happens to my previous files?

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't automatically migrate files you opened earlier in OneDrive to the new folder. After you rename your company, the Open in OneDrive action will copy files to a folder that has the new company name.   

## When I want to attach a file in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], how do I pick a file from OneDrive?

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't provide a cloud file picker. You must download the file from OneDrive to your device, and then upload it to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. 

## I want to open files in SharePoint instead. How do I do this?

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't provide features to copy files to SharePoint and open them from a SharePoint library. Contact your Microsoft partner to understand your options, or search for apps on AppSource.  

## How do I turn off integration to OneDrive?

Run the **OneDrive Setup** assisted setup guide and turn off the **Use OneDrive for app features** and **Use OneDrive for system features** switches.

## Should I use the SharePoint Connection Setup page to connect to SharePoint?

> **APPLIES TO:** Business Central on-premises, version 21 and 22

This page is a legacy feature where all [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] files from all users are sent to a single SharePoint folder. We recommend that you don't configure the Shared Documents FastTab on the **SharePoint Connection Setup** page because this page is [deprecated](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/upgrade/deprecated-features-w1#microsoft-sharepoint-connection-setup) and removed in 2023 release wave 2, version 23.0. We recommend that you use the **OneDrive Setup** instead.  

## Which version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports OneDrive?

Integration with OneDrive became available in 2021 release wave 2.  

## <a name="features"></a>Which features are affected by OneDrive integration?

In the **OneDrive Setup** assisted setup guide for setting up OneDrive integration, you can turn on or off features for handling Business Central files in OneDrive. The features are divided between two options:

|Option|Description|
|------|----------|
|**Use for app features**|If you turn on this option, the **Open in OneDrive** and **Share** actions are made available on files in Business Central, like files attached to documents or in the report inbox. These actions let users copy, open, and share files in OneDrive. Learn more in [Opening and Sharing Business Central Files in OneDrive](across-share-onedrive.md).
|**Use for system features**|Turning on this option activates the following features:<ul><li> The **Open in Excel** and **Edit in Excel** actions on list pages automatically copy the Excel file to OneDrive, then open it in Excel Online. Learn more in [Viewing and Editing in Excel](across-work-with-excel.md).</li><li> Sending a report to an Excel or Word file automatically copies the file to OneDrive, then opens it in the Excel or Word online. Learn more in [Saving a report to a file](ui-work-report.md#save-a-report-to-a-file).|

## Will Microsoft continue to improve the integration to OneDrive?

At Microsoft, we're constantly listening to feedback from our diverse user community and acting upon the top suggestions. To learn about what's next for integrations with Microsoft 365 apps, see the [Dynamics 365 release plan](/dynamics365-release-plan/2021wave1).  

If you want to participate in improving OneDrive integration, or have an idea that would improve file sharing and collaboration in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], add an idea or vote for existing ideas at [https://aka.ms/BusinessCentralIdeas](https://aka.ms/BusinessCentralIdeas).

## Does OneDrive work for guest users and delegated admins?

OneDrive features don't work when you're signed in to Business Central as a guest user. For example, if you select **Open in OneDrive** or **Share** on a file, you get the message "Could not connect to your OneDrive for Business."

If you're signed in as a delegated admin, files are downloaded instead of connecting to OneDrive.

These limitations apply to all OneDrive-based features in Business Central, including file sharing, opening, or editing.

## Troubleshooting

This section provides information about how to identify and fix problems you might experience when using OneDrive with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

### Business Central can't find my OneDrive

When this message displays, "Could not determine the location of your OneDrive for Business, contact your partner to set this up.", check whether the user accessed their OneDrive at least one time. If they haven't, ask the person to visit [https://portal.office.com/onedrive](https://portal.office.com/onedrive) to set it up. This step can take a while. If the message still displays after 24 hours, contact Support.  

### I'm having problems sharing from Outlook

Learn more at [Can't share OneDrive files from Outlook.com](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/can-t-share-onedrive-files-from-outlook-com-05d4cb21-40a2-40e3-b111-82cddb82d22f) on Microsoft Support.

### Actions Open in OneDrive and Share are missing

There are a couple things you can check:

- Check that the application features for OneDrive are turned on in the **OneDrive Setup** assisted setup guide. Learn more in [Configure OneDrive using OneDrive Setup](admin-onedrive-integration.md#configure-onedrive-using-onedrive-setup).
- Check that Microsoft OneDrive is set to **Agree** in the **Privacy Notices Status** page. Learn more in [Privacy Notices Status](privacy-notices-status.md).

# Set up resources for projects

To correctly manage resource activities, you must set up your resources and the related costs and prices. The project-related prices, discounts, and cost factor rules are set up on the project card. You can specify the costs and prices for individual resources, resource groups, or all available resources of the company.

You specify the default amount per hour when you set up a resource. The price and cost amounts apply when you use or sell resources in a project. For example, if you use a specific machine for five hours, the calculation is based on the amount per hour.

> [!NOTE]
> You can't purchase external resources for a specific project. We recommend that you use items of the type Service instead.

## To set up a resource

Create a card for each resource that you want to use in projects.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Resources**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action.
3. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  

## To set up a resource group

You can combine several resources in one resource group. All capacities and budgets of resource groups are accumulated from the individual resources. You can also enter capacities for resource groups either independently of the accumulated values or in addition to them.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Resource groups**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action.
3. Fill in the fields as necessary.

## To set capacity for a resource

To calculate how much time a resource can spend on projects, you must set their capacity. Capacity represents a resource's available time for a period on the work calendar. This setup is used when you fill in project planning lines that contain the resource. For more information, see [Create Projects](projects-how-create-jobs.md).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Resources**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the relevant resource card, and then choose the **Resource Capacity** action.
3. On the **Resource Capacity** page, in the **View By** field, specify the length of the period, such as **Day**, that is shown on columns on the **Resource Capacity Matrix** FastTab.
4. For each resource on a line, specify for each period on the columns the number of hours that the resource is available.
5. Alternatively, to detail the resource's capacity for a specific period, choose the **Set Capacity** action.

   > [!TIP]
   > If you're setting capacity for a group of people who typically work the same hours, you can save a little time and ensure consistency by choosing a work hour template. For example, you might have one work hour template for full time technicians, and another for technicians that work part time. To learn more about work hour templates, go to [To set up work hour templates](service-how-setup-work-service-hours.md#to-set-up-work-hour-templates).

6. On the **Resource Capacity Settings** page, fill in the fields as necessary.
7. Choose the **Update Capacity** action. The **Resource Capacity** page is updated with the entered capacity.
8. Close the page.

## To set up alternate resource costs

In addition to the cost specified on the resource card, you can set up alternate costs for each resource. For example, if you pay an employee a higher hourly rate for overtime, you can set up a resource cost for the overtime rate. The alternate cost that you set up for the resource overrides the cost on the resource card when you use the resource in the resource journal.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Resources**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the resource for that you want to set up one or more alternate costs for, and then choose the **Costs** action.  
3. On the **Resource Costs** page, fill in the fields on a line as necessary.  
4. Repeat step 3 for each alternate resource cost that you want to set up.

> [!NOTE]
> To set up resource costs that apply to all resources and resource groups, open the **Resource Costs** page and fill in the fields.

## To set up alternate resource prices

In addition to price specified on the resource card, you can set up alternate prices for each resource. These alternate prices can be conditional. They can depend on whether the resource is used with a specific project or work type.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Resources**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the resource for that you want to set up one or more alternate prices for, and then choose the **Prices** action.
3. On the **Resource Prices** page, fill in the fields on a line as necessary.
4. Repeat step 3 for each alternate resource price that you want to set up.

## To adjust resource prices

If you want to change costs or prices for a large number of resources, you can use a batch job.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Adjust Resource Costs/Prices**, and then choose the related link.
2. Fill in the fields on a line as necessary, and then choose the **OK** button.

> [!NOTE]  
> This batch job doesn't create or adjust alternate costs or prices for resources. It only changes the contents of the field on the resource card for the **Adjust Field** field that you selected in the batch job. The adjustment takes effect immediately for resources, so check your adjustment factors before you run the batch job.

## To get resource price change suggestions based on existing alternate prices

If you already set up alternate resource prices for some resources, you can use a batch job to set up multiple alternate resource prices.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Resource Price Changes**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **Suggest Res. Price Chg. (Price)** action, and then fill in the fields as necessary.
3. Choose the **OK** button.  
4. When the batch job is finished, the **Resource Price Changes** page shows the results of the batch job.

## To get resource price change suggestions based on standard prices

If you want to set up multiple alternate resource prices based on the standard prices on the resource cards, you can use a batch job.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Resource Price Changes**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **Suggest Res. Price Chg. (Res.)** action, and then fill in the fields as necessary.  
3. Choose the **OK** button.  
4. When the batch job is finished, open the **Resource Price Changes** page to see the results of the batch job.

### Allow multiple people to post resource transactions at the same time

To allow people to post transactions for resources at the same time, enable the **Enable multiple users to post resource ledger entries at the same time** feature update on the **Feature Management** page. By default, the feature isn’t enabled.

> [!NOTE]
> Similar features are available for project, inventory, and warehouse entries. To learn more, go to:
>
> * [Allow multiple people to post project transactions at the same time](projects-how-setup-jobs.md#allow-multiple-people-to-post-project-transactions-at-the-same-time)
> * [Allow workers to post inventory transactions at the same time](inventory-how-setup-general.md#allow-workers-to-post-transactions-at-the-same-time)
> * [Design details: Creating warehouse entries](design-details-warehouse-entries.md)

If you enable the feature, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] assigns entry numbers for each table from `SequenceNumbers` in the database, which allows people to post transactions at the same time. The result can be that sometimes entries from two or more transactions are interleaved.

There's a similar feature for inventory transactions. An item register might contain any or all of the entry tables, as shown in the following image.

:::image type="content" source="media/interleaved inventory tables.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the item register with several entry tables." lightbox="media/interleaved inventory tables.png":::

If you don’t enable the feature, when someone posts a transaction the tables are locked and other users can’t post. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] finds the last entry in each table and assigns a number that’s one higher. This numbering ensures that entries that belong to the same register are consecutive, but prevents other people from posting at the same time.

> [!NOTE]
> You might not want to enable the feature if you have a feature or extension that:
>
> * Relies on consecutive entry numbers.
> * Requires that tables are locked throughout the posting process.

# Track packages
Most shipping agents provide a web service that lets you track the status of your packages while they're en route. That information can be useful in many business processes, for example, when providing customer service. If you use one or more shipping agents, you can enter some basic information about them, and then use their package tracking service directly from the Posted Sales Shipments, Posted Sales Invoices, Posted Sales Credit Memos, and Posted Return Receipt pages. For more information, see [Set Up Shipping Agents](sales-how-to-set-up-shipping-agents.md). 

The following procedure shows how to track a package from a posted sales shipment, but the same steps apply to enable package tracking from the Posted Sales Invoice, Posted Sales Credit Memo, and Posted Return Receipt pages.  

## To track a package

> [!NOTE]
> The following procedure uses the Posted Sales Shipment page as an example. The steps to track a package are the same on the Posted Sales Invoices, Posted Sales Credit Memos, and Posted Return Receipt pages.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Posted Sales Shipment**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the shipment you want to track, and then choose the **Update Document** action.
3. In the **Package Tracking No.** field, enter the package number you received from the shipping agent. 
4. Make sure that the correct shipping agent and the level of service are correct, and then close the page.
5. Choose the **Track Package** action to open the shipping agent's package tracking service.

# Use the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] apps in Power BI

> **APPLIES TO:** [!INCLUDE [prod_long](includes/prod_long.md)] online 

[!INCLUDE [prod_long](includes/prod_long.md)] publishes the following Power BI apps, which provide detailed dashboards for viewing data:

- [!INCLUDE [prod_long](includes/prod_long.md)] - CRM  
- [!INCLUDE [prod_long](includes/prod_long.md)] - Finance  
- [!INCLUDE [prod_long](includes/prod_long.md)] - Sales

## Overview

Each app includes several reports that you can drill into for data, including the following features:

- Choose any visual on the dashboard to bring up one of the underlying reports.  
- Filter the report or add fields that you want to monitor.  
- Pin a customized view to the dashboard to continue tracking.  
  You can refresh data manually, and you can set up a refresh schedule. For more information, see [Configuring scheduled refresh](/power-bi/refresh-scheduled-refresh).  

The apps are designed to work with data from any company in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. When you install the Power BI app, you specify one or more parameters to connect to your [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

> [!NOTE]
> You can also build your own reports and dashboards in Power BI based on your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] data. For more information, see [Connecting Your Business Data to Power BI](across-how-use-financials-data-source-powerbi.md). 

## Prerequisites

Power BI apps require permissions to the tables where data is retrieved and the web services used to retrieve data. The following table lists the web services required for each Power BI app:

    ![Select Dynamics 365 Business Central  and select Get it now.](./media/across-how-to-connect-powerbi-d365-content-packs/powerbi-workspace-dashboard-report-dataset.png)

## Fixing problems

The Power BI dashboard relies on the published web services that are listed above. It shows data from the demonstration company or your own company if you import data from your current finance solution. However, if something goes wrong, this section provides a workaround for the most typical issues.  

### You don't have a Power BI account

A Power BI account hasn't been set up. You must have a license to get a valid Power BI account. Also, you must have previously signed into Power BI to create your Power BI workspace.  

### Message: There are no enabled reports. Select report to see a list of reports that you can display.

This message appears if the default report failed to deploy to your Power BI workspace. Or the report deployed but didn't successfully refresh. If this problem happens, navigate to the report in your Power BI workspace, select **Dataset**, **Settings**, and then manually update the credentials. Once the dataset successfully refreshes, navigate back to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and manually select the report from the **Select Reports** page.

### You need a Power BI Pro license to install the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app in Power BI

You need a [Power BI Pro license](/power-bi/service-features-license-type) to share your content, and the people you share it with do too. The content must be in a workspace in a [Premium capacity](/power-bi/service-premium-what-is). For more information, see [Ways to share your work in Power BI](/power-bi/service-how-to-collaborate-distribute-dashboards-reports).  

### "Parameter validation failed, please make sure all parameters are valid"

This error indicates that one more of the parameters aren't valid.

- The specified environment parameter doesn't match any existing [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] production or sandbox environment.
- The specified company parameter doesn't match any existing [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] companies. Verify the company name in the **Companies** page in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].
- If connecting to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, you entered a URL that isn't valid. You can verify the URL in the **Web Services** page in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]  
- A port isn't open to allow the request through your firewall.

### Can't sign in

If you get a "login failed" error after using your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] user credentials to sign in, then you're probably experiencing one of the following issues:

- The account that you're using doesn't have permissions to retrieve the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] data from your account. Verify that you have permissions to the required data in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and try again.
- You've selected an authentication type other than Basic, if connecting to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises.
- You haven't entered a valid user name or password.

### Message: Your data source can't be refreshed because the credentials are invalid. Please update your credentials and try again

For [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, the problem might be that the OData URL is only exposed to the local network.

### Incorrect company name

A common mistake is to enter the company display name instead of the company name. To find the company name search for **Companies**. Then use the **Name** field when entering your company name.

### The key didn't match any rows in the table

If you enter a non-valid company name during the connection process, you may get the error message "The key didn't match any rows in the table". Provide the correct company name and try connecting again.

### Historical data appears to be missing

Once the Power BI app installs and your data show in Power BI, you notice that not all your data displays. The datasets are filtered to only return the previous 365 days of data. This default is in place to help make the reports faster.  

### I only see data for a single company

The Power BI app will only display data from the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] company that was defined when the Power BI app was installed. Data from additional companies can be added to the reports by adding new queries that use different companies as the data source.  

### What now?

- Try [asking a question in the Q&A box](/power-bi/service-q-and-a-tips) at the top of the dashboard.
- [Change the tiles](/power-bi/service-dashboard-edit-tile) in the dashboard.  
- [Select a tile](/power-bi/service-dashboard-tiles) to open the underlying report.  
- By default, your dataset isn't scheduled to refresh. You can change the refresh schedule or try refreshing it on demand using **Refresh Now**. For more information, see [Configuring scheduled refresh](/power-bi/refresh-scheduled-refresh).

# The VAT Group Management extension for the United Kingdom

[!INCLUDE[azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id](~/../shared-content/shared/azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id.md)]

You can connect one or more businesses in the United Kingdom to combine value-added tax (VAT) reporting under a single registration number. This type of arrangement is known as a *VAT group*. You can engage with the group as a member or as the group representative.

## Forming a VAT group

VAT group members and the group representative can use the **Set Up VAT Group Management** assisted setup guide to both define their engagement with the group and create a connection between their [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] tenants. The group members use this connection to submit their VAT returns to the group representative. The group representative then uses a single VAT return to submit the group's VAT to tax authorities.

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports intra-group VAT return submissions for companies using [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises or online, in any combination, which influences the communication setup between businesses. This article describes various group setups.

### License requirements

Participants in the group must be licensed to use [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. You can't use guest accounts in VAT groups.

* To calculate and submit VAT returns, a user must be a full [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] user.
* To sign in and do basic tasks, such as create accounts, you need a [!INCLUDE[prod_long](includes/prod_long.md)] Team Member license.

## Set up a VAT group

The following is the recommended order of steps an administrator uses to set up a VAT group:

1. Create the setup in [Microsoft Entra ID setup for group members](#microsoft-entra-id-setup-for-group-members).
2. Share the technical information VAT group members and the group representative need to connect their [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] tenants. Usually, the group representative has this information, such as the [API URL](#group-api-setup) and the name of the VAT group representative's environment the VAT group members submit their VAT data to.
3. Create users that VAT group members use to authenticate when they connect to the VAT group representative's [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The users must have full user licenses for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].
4. Run the **Set Up VAT Group Management** assisted setup guide to connect the VAT group members.

   The VAT group representative must supply certain information to group members to complete their setup. (Learn more in the [Set up VAT group members](#set-up-vat-group-members) section below.) Make a note of the **Group Member ID** for each VAT group member. The group representative needs these IDs to add the companies to the VAT group.
5. Set up the VAT group management extension in the VAT group representative's [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] using the **Set Up VAT Group Management** assisted setup guide.

> [!NOTE]
> To connect to the VAT group representative, group members must have a user account that can access the VAT group representative's [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The VAT group representative must create at least one user for this. However, for security reasons we recommended that they create a user for each VAT group member, which can be a system user account that is not related to an actual person. Make sure to distribute the user credentials to VAT group members in a secure way.

### Microsoft Entra ID setup for group members

When the VAT group representative is using [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online or on-premises, VAT group members must use Microsoft Entra ID to authenticate users when they submit VAT returns to the VAT group representative. For [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, members must configure single sign-on. Learn more at [Configure Microsoft Entra authentication with WS-Federation](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/authenticating-users-with-azure-active-directory?tabs=singletenant%2Cadmintool).

If the VAT group members are also using [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, the member can authenticate with the designated user credentials and the sign-in information provided by the group representative. Learn more in the [Set up VAT group members](#set-up-vat-group-members) section below.

VAT group members who have [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises must set up an app registration in Microsoft Entra ID for the VAT group representative's [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] tenant. The app registration enables the VAT group representative's [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online to authenticate the group member.

When the VAT group member's administrator creates the app registration in Microsoft Entra ID, they must specify the following information.

* In the **Authentication** section, add **Web** as a platform, and use the following **Redirect URL**: `https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/OAuthLanding.htm`.
* In the **Authentication** section, in the option to select **Supported account types**, select **Accounts in any organizational directory (Any Microsoft Entra directory - Multitenant)**.
* In the **Certificates & secrets** section, create a new client secret and note the value. The VAT group members need the secret when they set up the connection to the group representative.
* In the **API permissions** section, add permissions to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Enable delegated access to **Financials.ReadWrite.All** and **user_impersonation**.
* In the **Overview** section, note the **Application (client) ID**. The VAT group members need the ID when they set up the connection to the group representative.

### Group API setup

The VAT group representative creates and supplies an API to group members. The members use this API to connect to the representative's [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] tenant and submit VAT returns. VAT group members often use [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in separate Microsoft Entra tenants. For that reason, setup is needed to connect the VAT group member and the representative's [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

> [!NOTE]
> This setup requires credentials for an administrator account that has a full user license for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

1. In the Business Central admin center for the representative's tenant, choose the **Environments** tab.
1. Choose the representative's environment.
1. In the **Details** section, copy the **URL**.
1. Open Notepad, and paste the URL. Replace `https://businesscentral.dynamics.com` with `https://api.businesscentral.dynamics.com/v2.0`.

## Set up VAT group members

VAT group members connect to the representative by calling a web service on the VAT group representative's tenant. The caller must be authenticated using OAuth2. When the VAT group management extension is set up, members are asked to authenticate to the VAT group representative, during which an access token is generated and saved. This access token is used when submitting VAT returns to the VAT group representative.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The member companies in the VAT group do not need to connect to HMRC because they report through the group's representative.

Before VAT group members start their setup (listed below), they need to contact the VAT group representative for the following information about their [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] tenant:

* The API URL
* The name of their company
* Sign in credentials for the dedicated user

1. In the top right corner, choose the **Settings** ![Settings.](media/ui-experience/settings_icon_small.png "Settings icon for role center") icon, then choose the **Assisted setup** action.
2. Choose the **Set Up VAT Group Management** action.
3. In the **VAT Group Role** field, choose **Member** then **Next**.
4. Copy the value of the **Group Member ID** field, and then share it with the VAT group representative so they can add your company as an approved member of the group.
5. In the **Group Representative Product Version** field, specify the version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] the representative is using.
6. In the **API URL** field, enter the API URL provided by the VAT group representative. Typically, the URL is formatted as follows: `https://api.businesscentral.dynamics.com/v2.0/[TENANT-ID]/[ENVIRONMENTNAME]`. For example, `https://api.businesscentral.dynamics.com/v2.0/aaaabbbb-0000-cccc-1111-dddd2222eeee/UKRepresentative`.
7. In the **Group Representative Company** field, enter the company name of the VAT group representative, such as, **CRONUS UK Ltd**.
8. In the **Authentication Type** field, choose **OAuth2**. If the VAT group representative is using [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, enable the **Group Representative Uses Business Central Online** toggle, and then choose **Next**.

   Then, follow the steps in either the [VAT Group Representative uses Business Central online](ui-extensions-vat-group.md#vat-group-representative-uses-business-central-online) or [VAT Group Representative uses Business Central on-premises](ui-extensions-vat-group.md#vat-group-representative-uses-business-central-on-premises) section below.

### VAT group representative uses Business Central online

1. Enter the user credentials provided by the VAT group representative, and add the required permissions to generate the access token.
2. Choose the VAT report configuration you use to submit VAT returns to the UK tax authorities. 

After you complete the setup, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will create a new configuration based on this choice that enables you to submit VAT returns to the VAT group representative.

### VAT group representative uses Business Central on-premises

1. Enter the user credentials provided by the VAT group representative and choose **Next**.
2. In the **Client ID** field, specify the client ID from the app registration in [Microsoft Entra ID setup for group members](#microsoft-entra-id-setup-for-group-members).
3. In the **Client Secret** field, specify the client secret from the app registration in Microsoft Entra ID.
4. In the **OAuth 2.0 Authority Endpoint** field, enter `https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2`.
5. In the **OAuth 2.0 Resource URL** field, enter `https://api.businesscentral.dynamics.com/`.
6. In the **OAuth 2.0 Redirect URL** field, enter `https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/OAuthLanding.htm`.
7. When you've specified the various fields, choose **Next**, and then confirm the authentication connection to generate the access token.
8. Choose the VAT report configuration you use to submit VAT returns to the UK tax authorities.

## Set up the VAT group representative

> [!NOTE]
> For on-premises, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports only a single tenant instance of the group representative.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The representative company must enable the **HMRC VAT Setup** service connection on the **Service Connections** page. Representatives must also download VAT return periods from HMRC.

1. In the top right corner, choose the **Settings** icon ![Settings.](media/ui-experience/settings_icon_small.png "Settings icon for role center"), and then choose the **Assisted setup** action.
2. Choose the **Set Up VAT Group Management** action.
3. In the **VAT Group Role** field, choose **Representative** to act as the VAT group representative, then choose **Next**.
4. In the **Group Settlement Account** field, specify the settlement account used for the group member VAT tax amounts. This account should have **Assets** as the **Account Category**.
5. In the **VAT Settlement Account** field, specify the account you use for VAT settlements. This account should have **Liabilities** as the **Account Category**.
6. In the **VAT Due Box No.** field, specify the box that represents the total VAT amount due from a VAT group submission.
7. In the **Group Settlement General Journal Template** field, specify the general journal template used to create the document with which the group representative posts the group VAT to the settlement account.
8. The **Approved Members** field shows the number of group members set up to submit VAT returns to the group representative. To add new members, choose the number to open the **VAT Group Approved Members** page and add the following information:
    1. In the **Group Member ID** field, enter an identifier for the group member, as displayed during the group member setup (learn more in the [VAT group member setup](#set-up-vat-group-members) section above).
    2. In the **Group Member Name** field, specify the name of the group member.
    3. In the **Company** field, specify the company from which the group member submits VAT returns in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], such as, **CRONUS UK Ltd**.
    4. Specify contact details for the company.

## Use the VAT group management features

VAT group members use the standard processes to prepare VAT returns. The only difference is members must choose the **VATGROUP** report version in the **VAT Return** page to submit the VAT return to the VAT group representative rather than the authorities. Learn more at [About the VAT Return report](finance-how-report-vat.md#vatreturn).

> [!NOTE]
> VAT group members can correct submitted VAT returns as long as the group representative has not released the VAT return for the group. To make a correction, the VAT group member must create a new VAT return for the VAT return period and submit it to the VAT group representative. On the VAT group representative's side, the member's latest VAT return replaces the previous and is included on the **VAT Returns** page.

The following sections describe the tasks that VAT group representatives must do to file the group VAT return.

### Review VAT member submissions

The **VAT Group Submissions** page lists the VAT returns that members have submitted. The page serves as a draft location for the submissions until the VAT group representative includes them in a VAT return for the group. The representative can open the submissions to review the individual boxes containing the amount reported by each VAT group member.

> [!TIP]
> On the **VAT Return Periods** page, the **Group Member Submissions** field shows how many returns members have submitted. To ensure that this number is up to date, choose the **Get VAT Returns** action.

### Create a group VAT return

To report VAT for the group, on the **VAT Returns** page, create a VAT return for your company only. Afterward, include the most recent VAT submissions from VAT group members by choosing the **Include Group VAT** action.  

When the group representative has submitted the group's VAT return to the authorities, the representative then normally runs the **Calculate and Post VAT Settlement** action. This action closes open VAT Entries and transfers amounts to the VAT settlement account. Currently, this action doesn't take the group submissions into account. Only the VAT entries of the VAT group representative company are posted. The VAT group member submission amounts must be posted using the **Post Group VAT Settlement** action.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The VAT group functionality is only supported in those markets where [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses a VAT framework that consists of VAT returns and VAT return periods. You cannot use VAT groups in markets with other implementations of local VAT reporting, such as Austria, Germany, Italy, Spain, and Switzerland.

## Issue with enabling Multifactor Authentication (MFA)

If you get an error message related to authorization during the renewal of the **OAuth2 Token** on the **VAT Report Setup** page after you enable MFA, complete the following steps.  

1. Sign in to the **Azure Portal** as an Authentication Administrator.  
2. Go to the **Microsoft Entra ID**.   
3. Browse to **Users**, and then select the user you want to perform an action.  
4. Select the **Authentication methods** and at the top of the page, select **Require re-register multifactor authentication**. 
5. Go back to Dynamics 365 Business Central and select to renew the token from the **VAT Report Setup**.  

This should be a onetime setup after you enable multifactor authentication for the user selected in **VAT Report Setup**.

# Design details: costing methods

The costing method determines whether an actual or a budgeted value is capitalized and used in the cost calculation. Together with the posting date and sequence, the costing method also influences how the cost flow is recorded.

> [!NOTE]
> You cannot change an item's costing method if item ledger entries exist for the item. For more information, see [Design Details: Change the Costing Method for Items](design-details-changing-costing-methods.md).

The following methods are supported in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]:  

| Costing method | Description | When to use |
|--|--|--|
| FIFO | An item's unit cost is the actual value of any receipt of the item, selected by the FIFO rule.<br /><br /> Inventory valuation assumes that the first items placed in inventory are sold first. | In business environments where product cost is stable.<br /><br /> (When prices are rising, the balance sheet shows greater value. This means that tax liabilities increase, but credit scores and the ability to borrow cash improve.)<br /><br /> For items with a limited shelf life, because the oldest goods need to be sold before they pass their sell-by date. |
| LIFO | An item's unit cost is the actual value of any receipt of the item, selected by the LIFO rule.<br /><br /> Inventory valuation assumes that the last items placed in inventory are sold first. | Disallowed in many countries/regions, as it can be used to depress profit.<br /><br /> (When prices are rising, the value on the income statement decreases. This means that tax liabilities decrease, but the ability to borrow cash deteriorates.) |
| Average | An item's unit cost is calculated as the average unit cost at each point in time after a purchase.<br /><br /> Inventory valuation assumes that all inventories are sold simultaneously. | In business environments where product cost is unstable.<br /><br /> When inventories are piled or mixed together and can't be differentiated, such as chemicals. |
| Specific | An item's unit cost is the exact cost at which the particular unit was received. | In production or trade of easily identifiable items with fairly high unit costs.<br /><br /> For items that are subject to regulation.<br /><br /> For items with serial numbers. |
| Standard | An item's unit cost is preset based on estimated.<br /><br /> When the actual cost is realized later, the standard cost must be adjusted to the actual cost through variance values. | Where cost control is critical.<br /><br /> In repetitive manufacturing, to value the costs of direct material, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead.<br /><br /> Where there's discipline and staff to maintain standards. |

The following image shows how costs flow through the inventory for each costing method.  

![Costing methods visualized.](media/design_details_inventory_costing_7_costing_methods.png "Costing methods visualized")  

Costing methods differ in the way that they value inventory decreases and if they use actual cost or standard cost as the valuation base. The following table explains the different characteristics. (The LIFO method is excluded, as it's similar to the FIFO method.)

## Example

This section gives examples of how different costing methods affect inventory value.  

The following table shows the inventory increases and decreases that the examples are based on.  

|Posting Date|Quantity|Entry No.|  
|------------------|--------------|---------------|  
|01-01-20|1|1|  
|01-01-20|1|2|  
|01-01-20|1|3|  
|02-01-20|-1|4|  
|03-01-20|-1|5|  
|04-01-20|-1|6|  

> [!NOTE]  
> The resulting quantity in inventory is zero. Consequently, the inventory value must also be zero, regardless of the costing method.  

### Effect of Costing Methods on Valuing Inventory Increases  

For items with costing methods that use actual cost as the valuation base (**FIFO**, **LIFO**, **Average**, or **Specific**), inventory increases are valued at the item's acquisition cost.  

- **Standard**  

    For items using the **Standard** costing method, inventory increases are valued at the item's current standard cost.  

#### Standard  

For items using the **Standard** costing method, inventory increases are valued at the item's current standard cost.  

### Effect of Costing Methods on Valuing Inventory Decreases

- **FIFO**  

    For items using the **FIFO** costing method, items that were purchased first are always sold first (entry numbers 3, 2, and 1 in this example). Accordingly, inventory decreases are valued by taking the value of the first inventory increase.  

     COGS is calculated using the value of the first inventory acquisitions.  

     The following table shows how inventory decreases are valued for the **FIFO** costing method.  

    |Posting Date|Quantity|Cost Amount (Actual)|Entry No.|  
    |------------------|--------------|----------------------------|---------------|  
    |02-01-20|-1|-10.00|4|  
    |03-01-20|-1|-20.00|5|  
    |04-01-20|-1|-30.00|6|  

- **LIFO**  

    For items using the **LIFO** costing method, items that were purchased most recently are always sold first (entry numbers 3, 2, and 1 in this example). Accordingly, inventory decreases are valued by taking the value of the last inventory increase.  

     COGS is calculated using the value of the most recent inventory acquisitions.  

     The following table shows how inventory decreases are valued for the **LIFO** costing method.  

    |Posting Date|Quantity|Cost Amount (Actual)|Entry No.|  
    |------------|--------|--------------------|---------|  
    |02-01-20|-1|-30.00|4|  
    |03-01-20|-1|-20.00|5|  
    |04-01-20|-1|-10.00|6|  

- **Average**  

    For items using the **Average** costing method, inventory decreases are valued by calculating a weighted average of the remaining inventory on the last day of the average cost period in which the inventory decrease was posted. For more information, see [Design Details: Average Cost](design-details-average-cost.md).  

     The following table shows how inventory decreases are valued for the **Average** costing method.  

    | Posting Date | Quantity | Cost Amount (Actual) | Entry No. |
    |--|--|--|--|
    | 02-01-20 | -1 | -20.00 | 4 |
    | 03-01-20 | -1 | -20.00 | 5 |
    | 04-01-20 | -1 | -20.00 | 6 |

- **Standard**  

    For items using the **Standard** costing method, inventory decreases are valued similar to the **FIFO** costing method, except valuation is based on a standard cost, not on the actual cost.  

    The following table shows how inventory decreases are valued for the **Standard** costing method.  

    |Posting Date|Quantity|Cost Amount (Actual)|Entry No.|  
    |------------------|--------------|----------------------------|---------------|  
    |02-01-20|-1|-15.00|4|  
    |03-01-20|-1|-15.00|5|  
    |04-01-20|-1|-15.00|6|  

- **Specific**  

    Costing methods make an assumption about how cost flows from an inventory increase to an inventory decrease. However, if more accurate information about the cost flow exists, then you can override this assumption by creating a fixed application between entries. A fixed application creates a link between an inventory decrease and a specific inventory increase and directs the cost flow accordingly.  

    For items that use the **Specific** costing method, inventory decreases are valued according to the inventory increase that the fixed application links it to.  

    The following table shows how inventory decreases are valued for the **Specific** costing method.  

    |Posting Date|Quantity|Cost Amount (Actual)|Applies-to Entry|Entry No.|
    |------------|--------|--------------------|----------------|---------|  
    |02-01-20|-1|-20.00|**2**|4|  
    |03-01-20|-1|-10.00|**1**|5|  
    |04-01-20|-1|-30.00|**3**|6|

# Set Up Cash Customers

You cannot create an invoice without a customer number. This is true, even if you make a cash sale and do not have anything to record in a customer account.  

## To set up a cash customer

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customer**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Create a new **Customer** card. For more information, see [Register New Customers](sales-how-register-new-customers.md).
3. In the **No.** field, enter **Cash**, for example.  
4. In the **Name** field, enter **Cash Sale**, for example.  
5. On the **Invoicing** FastTab, fill in the **Customer Posting Group** and the **Gen. Bus. Posting Group** fields.  

 Now you have set up a customer that contains sufficient information for invoicing.  

> [!NOTE]  
> You may have chosen a posting group that is also used for domestic credit sales. If you want to maintain separate data on cash sales, for example, with a special sales or receivables account, you can set up an extra posting group for this purpose.  
>
> You must enter a number for a receivables account for the posting group, even though the balance in this account will always be 0 after you post an invoice.

# Create routings

Manufacturing companies use routings to visualize and direct the manufacturing process.

The routing is the basis of process scheduling, capacity scheduling, scheduled assignment of material needs, and manufacturing documents.  

As for production bills of material (BOMs), the routings are assigned to the manufacturing end item. A routing holds master data that captures the process requirements of a given produced item. After a production order is created for an item, its routing governs the scheduling of operations as represented on the **Prod. Order Routing** page under the production order.  

Before you can set up a routing, the following setups must be in place:  

- Item cards are created for parent items that take part in manufacturing. To learn more, go to [Register New Items](inventory-how-register-new-items.md).
- Production resources are set up. To learn more, go to [Set Up Work Centers and Machine Centers](production-how-to-set-up-work-and-machine-centers.md).

## To create a routing

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Routings**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
4. In the **Type** field, select one of the following options:
   - **Serial** to calculate the production routing according to the value in the **Operation No.** field.  
   - Select **Parallel** to calculate the operations according to the value in the **Next Operation No.** field.  
5. To edit the routing, set the **Status** field to **New** or **Under Development**.  

    Proceed to fill in the routing lines.
6. In the **Operation No.** field, enter the number of the first operation, for example,  **10**.  
7. In the **Type** field, specify which kind of resource is used, for example, **Work Center**.  
8. In the **No.** field, select the resource to be used, or type it in the field.  
9. In the **Routing Link Code** field, enter a code to connect the component to a specific operation. For more information, see [To create routing links](production-how-to-create-routings.md#to-create-routing-links).
10. In the **Run Time** and **Setup Time** fields, enter the process times needed to perform the operation.

     > [!NOTE]
     > Setup time is calculated per production order, whereas run time is calculated per produced item.  

11. In the **Concurrent Capacities** field, specify how many units of the selected resource are used to perform the operation. For example, allocating two people to one packing operation halves the run time.  
12. Continue to fill in lines for all operations involved in producing the item in question.  
13. To copy lines from an existing routing, choose the **Copy Routing** action to select existing lines.  
14. To activate the routing, in the **Status** field, choose **Certified**.  
15. You can now attach the new routing to the card of the production item in question, by filling in the **Routing No.** field. To learn more, go to [Register New Items](inventory-how-register-new-items.md).  

> [!NOTE]  
> Remember to recalculate the item's standard cost from the **Item** card. Choose the **Production** action, the **Calc. Production Std. Cost** action, and then choose the **All Levels** action.  You can also calculate and update the standard cost for one or many items on the **Standard Cost Worksheet** page. Learn more at [Update Standard Costs](finance-about-calculating-standard-cost.md#updating-standard-costs-with-standard-cost-worksheet).  


## To create routing links

You can create routing links to connect components to specific operations to retain their relationship even though the production BOM or routing is modified. Routing links also facilitate just-in-time flushing of components, namely when the specific linked operation starts, not when the complete production order is released. To learn more, go to [Flush Components According to Operation Output](production-how-to-flush-components-according-to-operation-output.md).  

Another important benefit is that linked components and operations display in a logical process structure when you use the **Production Journal** page to post output and consumption.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Routings**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the routing that contains the operations that you want to link.  

    Make sure the routing status is **Under Development**.  

3. On the relevant routing line, in the **Routing Link Code** field, select a code.  
4. Add different routing link codes to other operations in the routing, if relevant.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > You shouldn't use the same routing link code in different operations on a routing because you might incorrectly link a component to two different operations, so that it is consumed two times.  
    >
    > It's a good idea to name the routing link code after the operation to ensure operation-specific routing links.

5. Set the routing status to **Certified**.  

    Routing link codes are now assigned to operations. Next, you must create the actual link by assigning the same codes to specific components in the relevant production BOM.  

6. Open the **Production BOM** that contains the components that you want to link to the above operations. To learn more, go to [Create Production BOMs](production-how-to-create-production-boms.md).
7. Make sure the BOM status is **Under Development**.  
8. On the relevant production BOM line, in the **Routing Link Code** field, select the code that you assigned to the operation.  
9. Proceed to add routing link codes to other components according to the unique operations where they're used.  
10. Set the production BOM status to **Certified**.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > To enable the routing links on an existing production order, you must refresh the production order. To learn more, go to [Create Production Orders](production-how-to-create-production-orders.md).  

The selected components are now linked to the selected operations when you create or refresh a production order using the production BOM and routing. This link is visible on the **Prod. Order Components** page under the production order. You can remove and add the routing link codes at any time.

## To assign personnel, tools, and quality measures to routing operations

If you require personnel with qualifications, special knowledge, or special authorization for an operation, you can assign these personnel to the operation. In addition, you can assign tools and quality requirements to the operation. This procedure describes how to assign personnel. The steps are similar for other types of operation information.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Routings**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the relevant routing.  
3. On the **Lines** FastTab, select the line that you want to process, choose the **Operations** action, and then choose the **Personnel** action.  
4. Fill in the fields on the **Routing Personnel** page.  
5. Choose the **OK** button to exit the page. The entered values are copied and assigned to the operation.  

## To create a new version of a routing

The version principle enables you to manage several versions of a routing. The structure of the routing version corresponds to the structure of the routing consisting of the routing version header and the routing version lines. The starting date defines the basic difference.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Routings**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the routing to copy, and then choose the **Versions** action.  
3. On the **Routing Versions** page, choose the **New** action.
4. In the **Version Code** field, enter the unique identification of the version. You can use any combination of numbers and letters.  

    The newly created version is automatically assigned the status **New**.  
5. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](../archive/SetupAndAdministration/includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
6. To create operation lines, select the first blank line, and then fill in the **Operation No.** field according to the sequence of operations.

    The operation lines are in ascending order by operation numbers. To be able to make changes later, we recommend that you select adequate step widths. The **Next Operation No.** field refers to the next operation in the routing.

7. When you're done setting up the routing version, in the **Status** field, choose **Certified**.

# Quote an Assemble-to-Order Sale

You can use assembly management to customize an assembly item to a customer's request during the sales process. For more information, see [Sell Items Assembled to Order](assembly-how-to-sell-items-assembled-to-order.md).  

As when you sell any other type of item, you can also create a sales quote for a customized assembly item before converting it to a sales order. This process involves several extra steps when you compare it to creating a regular sales quote, and it uses a variation of a linked assembly order, which is an assembly quote.

> [!NOTE]  
>  Like all types of quotes, the quantities on assembly quotes are not used in availability, planning, or reservations.  

## To create a sales quote for an assemble-to-order item

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Quote**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Create a sales quote line with one line for an assembly item. For more information, see [Make Sales Quotes](sales-how-make-offers.md).  
3.  In the **Qty. to Assemble to Order** field, enter the full quantity.

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  You should not quote a partial quantity. Therefore, you must enter the same quantity that you entered in the **Quantity** field on the sales quote line.  

4.  On the **Lines** FastTab, choose **Line**, choose **Assemble to Order**, and then choose **Assemble-to-Order Lines**. Alternatively, choose the **Qty. to Assemble to Order** field on the line.  
5.  On the **Assemble-to-Order Lines** page, review or modify the assembly order lines according to the quote that the customer is requesting. If you want to view more information, choose the **Show Document** action to open the complete blanket quote order. You cannot change the contents of most fields, and you cannot post.  
6.  When you have adjusted the assembly order lines according to the quote, close the **Assemble-to-Order Lines** page to return to the **Sales Quote** page.  
7.  If the customer accepts the quote, then create a sales order for the quoted assembly item. For more information, see [Make Sales Quotes](sales-how-make-offers.md). The linked assembly quote and any customizations are linked to that new sales order to prepare for assembly of the item or items to be sold.

# Walkthrough: Create custom financial reports

The examples in this article describe how to create the following reports:

* Example 1 creates a Trial Balance report
* Example 2 creates a Balance Sheet report
* Example 3 creates an Income Statement report

> [!NOTE]
> The examples are based on the demonstration data that [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides for its CRONUS demonstration company.

> [!TIP]
> Formulas are expressed as a row number reference, such as "R" or "CA" (current assets), which adds all accounts with row number "R" or "CA."

## Example 1: Trial Balance

In this example, we have a new financial report called **Trial Balance** and a new row definition called **TB**.

:::image type="content" source="media/trialbalanceselection.png" alt-text="Shows the trial balance selection.":::

1. Open the new Trial Balance report.
1. Open the **TB** row definition, and choose **Insert**.
1. Choose the **Insert G/L Accounts** action to open the G/L Accounts page.
1. Filter the **Account Type** column to **Posting**.

   > [!TIP]
   > To quickly apply the filter, choose any row that has Posting in the Account Type column, and then right-click the Account Type column header and choose **Filter to this value**.

1. On the first line, choose **Show more options** :::image type="content" source="media/show-more-options-icon.png" alt-text="Show more options icon.":::, and then choose **Select more**.
1. Select all lines by choosing the radio button next to the first column header.

   :::image type="content" source="media/account type select all.png" alt-text="Shows how to select all lines.":::

1. Choose **OK** to assign all general ledger accounts with a totaling type of Posting to your row definition.

   > [!TIP]
   > To sum the results of all lines, add a formula on the last line of the row definition. Because this is a trial balance report, the expected result is zero.

Your trial balance report is complete. To view the report, choose the report on the Financial Reporting page, and then choose **View Financial Report**. Choose the column definition you prefer for the report. Often used column definitions for a trial balance report are **Balance Only**, **M-Balance**, and **Default**.

> [!TIP]
> If you add a new general ledger account to the chart of accounts, you must update your row definition to include it. Otherwise, your trial balance report won't balance to zero.

## Example 2: Balance Sheet

In this example, we have a new financial report called **Balance Sheet** and a new row definition called **BS**.

:::image type="content" source="media/balance sheet selection.png" alt-text="Shows a balance sheet selection in financial reporting.":::

1. Open the Balance Sheet report.
1. Open the **BS** row definition.
1. Map the accounts as shown in the following table. This example maps the balance sheet to the chart of accounts in the CRONUS demonstration company.

| Row No.| Description | Totaling Type | Totaling  | Row Type  | Bold  |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| | **Current Assets**| Formula | |Balance at Date    | Yes |
|CA | Cash                | Posting Accounts | 18000..18999 |Balance at Date|     |
|CA | Accounts Receivable | Posting Accounts | 15000..15999 |Balance at Date|    |
|CA |  Other Receivables  | Posting Accounts | 13000..13999 |Balance at Date|    |
|CA | Inventory           | Posting Accounts | 14000..14999 |Balance at Date|    |
|CA |Prepaid Expenses     | Posting Accounts | 16000..16999 |Balance at Date|    |
|CA |Other Current Assets | Posting Accounts | 100000..11999|Balance at Date|    |
|F1 | **Total Current Assets**  | Formula    |              |Balance at Date|    |
|   |                           | Formula    |              |Balance at Date|    |
|   | **Long Term Assets**      |            |              |Balance at Date|Yes |
|LTA|Fixed Assets         | Posting Accounts| 10000..12899  |Balance at Date|    |
|LTA|Accumulated Depreciation| Posting Accounts|12900..12999|Balance at Date|    |
|LTA|Other Long Term Assets | Posting Accounts|17000..17999|19000..19999|Balance at Date|
|F2 |**Total Long Term Assets**|Formula     |   LTA         |Balance at Date | Yes |
|   |                          | Formula    |               |Balance at Date |     |
|F3 | **Total Assets**         |            | F1+F2         | Balance at Date|     |

The following table describes the fields on the **Row Definition** page.

|Field  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|Row No.      |Alphanumeric codes are used for each section. The codes let you group by row number when you use formulas. Groupings help make formulas shorter and more simple. Each formula line is labeled with an alphanumeric code for easy identification.         |
|Description  | Used to hold the words to label each row of the report.        |
|Totaling type| Formula is used in three ways:<br><br>* To add the results of rows together.<br><br>* When combined with a section header or total.<br><br>* When inserting a blank row into the report.<br><br> Posting accounts are used to indicate that the row pulls the result of posted transactions based on the accounts listed in the Totaling column. |
|Totaling | Contains either a range of accounts shown as 10000..11999, or multiple nonconsecutive ranges of accounts shown as 17000..17999\|19000..19999.<br><br> Formulas are expressed as a row number reference, such as CA, which adds all accounts with Row No. of CA.<br><br> Following the general accounting convention of displaying financial report lines in the order of liquidity, general ledger accounts initially appear out of order. Notice that accounts show in the ranges created for each line. Totaling ranges let the report update dynamically when you add a new general ledger account to your chart of accounts.  |
|Row type     | Balance at Date is used for Balance Sheet reports.        |
|Bold         | Section headers and totals are set to Bold so they stand out.        |

> [!TIP]
> This example shows a summarized balance sheet, where each line is a group of related balance sheet accounts. Your report’s level of summarization is up to you. Good financial report design tries to provide enough detail to tell the story of financial performance without detailing every account. Avoid creating a balance sheet that is a categorized trial balance. It can be hard for people to digest such a large amount of information.

Continue to add balance sheet sections as shown in the following table. You can incorporate your own account groupings to create or replicate your company’s method of displaying accounts.  

The last line of this report is a check figure that the report complies with the accounting equation where Assets=Liabilities+Equity. The result of this check figure should be zero. If it isn't zero, it's a good indication that there's a problem:

* Some accounts aren't included in the report.
* Accounts might be included more than once.
* A formula in the report isn't calculating correctly.

| Row No. | Description | Totaling Type | Totaling | Row Type  | Bold  |

Your balance sheet financial report is complete. To view the report, choose the report on the Financial Reporting page and select **View Financial Report**. Select any column definition to use with this report. The column definitions that are typically used for a balance sheet are **Balance Only**, **M-Balance**, and **Default**. You can also create a new column definition if you want.

The following image shows the structure of the report in this example.

# Upgrading an Integration with Dynamics 365 Sales
[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] integrates with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)], which makes it easy to connect and synchronize data with other Dynamics 365 applications, such as [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)], or even apps that you build yourself. If you are integrating for the first time, we recommend that you do so through [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)]. For more information, see [Integration with Dataverse](admin-common-data-service.md).

If you have already integrated [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can continue to synchronize data using your setup. However, if you upgrade [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], or turn off your [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] integration, to turn it on again you must connect through [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)]. 

> [!NOTE]
> Reconnecting through [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] will apply default synchronization settings, and will overwrite any configurations you have. For example, the default table mappings will be applied.

## To upgrade your connection to use Dataverse

# Setting up and troubleshooting your browser to work with Business Central Web Client

This article explains how to set up your browser so that the [!INCLUDE[web_client](includes/web_client.md)] and all its features work properly. Read this article if you're having problems opening the [!INCLUDE[web_client](includes/web_client.md)], your browser's settings can be the cause of some problems.

The article provides details for setting up Microsoft Edge, but the requirements for JavaScript, cookies, and pop-ups are the same for all supported browsers. For other browsers, refer to the instructions provided by the manufacturer.  

## Use a supported browser

Make sure to use a one of the supported browsers. See [Minimum Requirements for Using Business Central](product-requirements.md#browsers).

We recommend that you use a stable channel version of a web browser as it's the most reliable and stable version that has undergone extensive testing and bug fixing. This ensures that you have the best experience and are less likely to encounter any issues while using the web client.  

## Allow JavaScript from Business Central

*Problem:*

If the browser doesn't allow JavaScript, you see **NotSupported/DisabledJavaScript** in the address bar and an **HTTP Error 404.0 - Not Found** message when you try to open [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], and the 

<!-- http://localhost:8080/NotSupported/DisabledJavaScript HTTP Error 404.0 - Not Found
The resource you are looking for has been removed, had its name changed, or is temporarily unavailable. -->

*Fix:*

1. In Microsoft Edge, go to **Settings** > **Cookies and site permissions** > **JavaScript**.
2. Do one of the following steps. Choose the step that your organization recommends:

    - Move the **Allowed** toggle to the left (Off). Then, select **Add** and type the address (URL) for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in the **Site** box. Select **Add** when done.
    - Move the **Allowed** toggle to the right (On).

## Allow cookies from Business Central

*Problem:*

If the browser doesn't allow cookies, you get the following error:

**Sorry, the page could not be found. Please check the address and try again.** 

*Fix:*

1. In Microsoft Edge, go to **Settings** > **Cookies and site permissions** > **Cookies and site data**.
2. Move the **Allow sites to save and read cookie data** toggle to the right (On).  

## <a name="popup"></a>Allow pop-ups from Business Central

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] integrates with several products. In some cases, like with Microsoft Teams, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] opens, or "pop-ups," within the product. This capability requires that your browser allows pop-ups from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

*Problem:*

If pop-ups for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] are being blocked, you get a message similar to the following message:

**Something went wrong. Your browser may be blocking pop-ups needed by Business Central.**

<!--
Something went wrong
Your browser may be blocking pop-ups needed by Business Central.

Change your browser settings to allow pop-ups or allow this for trusted domains, then try again.
If these settings are managed for your organization, you should contact your administrator for assistance.

Try again
-->
*Fix:*

1. In Microsoft Edge, go to **Settings** > **Cookies and site permissions** > **Pop-ups and redirects**.
2. Move the **Blocked** toggle to the right (On).
3. Select **Add**. In the **Site** box, type `https://businesscentral.dynamics.com`, then select **Add**.

# Import payroll transactions

To account for salary payments and related transactions, you must import and post financial transactions made by your payroll provider to the general ledger. To do this, you first import a file that you receive from the payroll provider into the **General Journal** page. Then you map the external accounts in the payroll file to the relevant G/L accounts. Lastly, you post the payroll transactions according to the account mapping.

> [!NOTE]  
> To use this functionality, an extension for payroll import must be installed and enabled. The Ceridian Payroll and the Quickbooks Payroll File Import extensions are pre-installed in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For more information, see [Customizing [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Using Extensions](ui-extensions.md).

## To import a payroll file

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. In the relevant general journal batch, choose the **Import Payroll Transactions** action. An assisted setup guide opens.
3. Follow the steps on the **Import Payroll Transactions** page.

    > [!TIP]  
    >   In the step about mapping the external payroll records to your G/L accounts, the mappings that you make will be remembered next time the same records are imported. This will save you time as you do not have to manually fill in the **Account No.** field in the general journal every time you have imported recurring payroll transactions.   

    When you choose the **OK** button in the assisted setup guide, the **General Journal** page is filled with lines representing the transactions that the payroll file contains and with the relevant accounts prefilled in the **G/L Account** fields according to mappings you made in the guide.
4. Edit or post the journal lines as for any other general ledger transactions. For more information, see [Post Transactions Directly to the General Ledger](finance-how-post-transactions-directly.md).

# Transfer inventory between locations

You can transfer inventory items between locations by creating transfer orders. Alternatively, you can use the item reclassification journal.

> [!NOTE]
> To transfer items, you must set up locations and transfer routes. To learn more about setting up locations, go to [Set up locations](inventory-how-setup-locations.md). You can't use transfer orders for *blank* locations.

## Transfer orders

You can ship an outbound transfer from one location and receive an inbound transfer at the destination. You can:

* Track a quantity in transit.
* Define calendars, routings, and inbound and outbound handling times for date calculation and planning. To learn more about planning, go to [About Planning Functionality](production-about-planning-functionality.md).
* Use different warehouse features for inbound and outbound locations.
* Use transfer orders for direct transfers, with some limitations.

## Item reclassification journals

You can use the **Item Reclassification Journals** page to:

* Direct transfer of items between locations.
* Move items between bins. To learn more about transferring items between bins, go to [Move Items Unplanned in Basic Warehouse Configurations](warehouse-how-to-move-items-ad-hoc-in-basic-warehousing.md).
* Change a lot or serial number to a new lot or serial number. To learn more about reclassifying serial and lot numbers, go to [Reclassify serial or lot numbers](inventory-how-work-item-tracking.md#to-reclassify-serial-or-lot-numbers).
* Change the expiration date to a new date.
* Reclassify items from a blank location to an actual location.
* Create warehouse entries if you don't manage warehouse activities.

## To transfer items with a transfer order

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Transfer orders**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Transfer Order** page, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

    > [!NOTE]  
    > If you filled in the **In-Transit Code**, **Shipping Agent Code**, and **Shipping Agent Service** fields on the **Trans. Route Spec.** page when you set up the transfer route, the corresponding fields on the transfer order are filled in automatically.

    When you fill in the **Shipping Agent Service** field, the receipt date at the transfer-to location is calculated by adding the shipping time of the shipping agent service to the shipment date.

3. There are several ways to fill in the lines:

    |Option  |Description  |
    |---------|---------|
    |Manually     | On the **Lines** FastTab, fill in a line for an item, or use the **Select items** action to choose multiple items.        |
    |Automatically     | * Choose the **Get Bin Content** action to select existing items from a specific bin at the location.<br><br>* Choose the **Get Receipt Lines** to select items that just arrived at the transfer-from location.        |

    You can now ship the items.
4. Choose the **Post** action, choose the **Ship** option, and then choose the **OK** button.

    The items are now in transit between the specified locations according to the transfer route.

    As a warehouse worker at the transfer-from location, proceed to receive the items. The transfer order lines are the same as when shipped and can't be edited.
5. Choose the **Post** action, choose the **Receive** option, and then choose the **OK** button.

### Undo a transfer shipment

If you find a mistake in a quantity on a posted transfer order, as long as the shipment isn't received you can easily correct the quantity. On the **Posted Transfer Shipment** page, the **Undo Shipment** action creates corrective lines, as follows:

* The value in the **Quantity Shipped** field is decreased by the undone quantity.
* The value in the **Qty. to Ship** field is increased by the undone quantity.
* The **Correction** checkbox is selected for the lines.

If the quantity shipped in a warehouse shipment, a corrective line is created in the posted warehouse shipment.

To complete the correction, reopen the transfer order, enter the correct quantity, and then post the order. If you're using a warehouse shipment to ship the order, create and post a new warehouse shipment.

### Post multiple transfer orders in a batch

The following procedure explains how to post transfer orders in a batch.

1. 1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Transfer orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Transfer Orders** page, select the orders to post.
3. In the **No.** field, open the context menu and choose **Select More**.
4. Select the checkbox for the lines for each order that you want to post.
5. Choose the **Post** action, and then choose **Post Batch**.
6. On the **Batch Post Transfer Order** page, fill in the fields as necessary.

   > [!TIP]
    > For transfer orders that use an in-transit location, you can choose either **Ship** or **Receive**. Repeat this step if you need to do both. For orders where **Direct Posting** is turned on, both options work in the same way and post the order completely.

7. Select **OK**.
8. To view potential issues, open the **Error Message Register** page.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Posting multiple documents might take some time and block other users. Consider enabling background posting. For more information, see [Use Job Queues to Schedule Tasks](/dynamics365/business-central/admin-job-queues-schedule-tasks).

### Schedule a job queue entry to post multiple documents in a batch

Alternatively, you can use the job queue to schedule posting to happen at a time that's convenient for your organization. For example, it might make sense for your business to run certain routines when most of the data entry is done for the day.

The following procedure shows how to set up the **Batch Post Transfer Orders** report to automatically post direct transfer orders at 4 PM on weekdays. That time is just an example. The steps are the same for other documents.  

1. Search for the **Job Queue Entries** page, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. In the **Object Type to Run** field, select **Report**.  
4. In the **Object ID to Run** field, select **5707, Batch Post Transfer Orders**.
5. Select the **Report Request Page** checkbox.
6. On the **Batch Post Transfer Orders** request page, choose the **Ship** option, filter on **Direct Transfer**, and then select **OK**.

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > It's important to set filters. Otherwise, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will post all documents, even if they aren't ready. Consider setting a filter on the **Status** field for the value **Released**, and a filter on the **Posting Date** field for the value **..today**. To learn more about filters, go to [Sorting, Searching, and Filtering](/dynamics365/business-central/ui-enter-criteria-filters).

7. Select all checkboxes from **Run on Mondays** to **Run on Fridays**.
8. In the **Starting Time** field, enter **4 PM**.
9. Choose the **Set Status to Ready** action.

### Comparison of different settings for transfer orders

You can post transfer orders in different modes, with or without an in-transit location. Turn off the **Direct Transfer** toggle and select the temporary location in the **In Transit Code** field on the **Transfer Order** page. When you post the shipment of a transfer order that uses the in-transit location, the items on the line are no longer available at one of your locations because they're in transit. Direct posting ensures that an in-transit location isn't used and the shipment and receipt process simultaneously. The exact behavior of direct posting might can be different based on the value selected in the **Direct Transfer Posting** field on the **Inventory Setup** page.

The following table describes how the combinations differ.

|Capability|The **Direct Transfer** field is disabled in the **Transfer Order** page|**Direct Transfer** is enabled on the **Transfer Order** page</br>**Direct Transfer Posting** is set to **Direct Transfer** on the **Inventory Setup** page|**Direct Transfer** is enabled in the **Transfer Order** page</br>**Direct Transfer Posting** is set to **Receipt and Shipment** on the **Inventory Setup** page|
|---|---|---|---|
|Use in-transit location|Yes|No|No|
|Can post receipt without shipment.</br>Can use **Undo receipt**.|Yes|No|No|
|Partial posting|Yes|No|Yes|
|Item ledger entries|4:</br>Transfer from From-Location,</br>Transfer to In-Transit,</br>Transfer from In-Transit,</br>Transfer to To-Location.|2:</br>Transfer from From-Location,</br>Transfer to To-Location.|4:</br>Transfer from From-Location,</br>Transfer to *blank*,</br>Transfer from *blank*,</br>Transfer to To-Location.|
|Posted documents|Posted transfer shipment,</br>Posted transfer receipt.|Posted direct transfer|Posted transfer shipment,</br>Posted transfer receipt.|
|Reservation: inbound and outbound|Yes|Yes|Yes|
|Item Charges - assign to posted transfer receipt|Yes|No|Yes|
|Warehouse handling|Full|No|Limited, see below|

Warehouse handling matrix for configuration: **Direct Transfer** is enabled on the **Transfer Order** page and **Direct Transfer Posting** is set to **Direct Transfer** on the **Inventory Setup** page.

|From \ To|To: No warehouse handling|To: Warehouse receipt|To: Inventory Put-away|To: Directed put-away and pick|
|-|-|-|-|-|
|**From: No warehouse handling**|1|Not supported|1, 4|Not supported|
|**From: Warehouse shipment**|1, 2|Not supported|1,2,4|Not supported|
|**From: Inventory put-away**|1, 3|Not supported|1,3,4|Not supported|
|**From: Directed put-away and pick**|2|Not supported|2|Not supported|

The numbers in the cells show the posting options that are supported.

1. Post from transfer order. For some combinations, you might need to fill in the **Qty. to Ship** field.
2. Create and post a warehouse shipment.
3. Create and post an inventory pick.
4. Create and post an inventory put-away. For some combinations you might need to fill in the **Qty. to Ship** field.

Regardless of the method, the shipment and receipt transactions are performed. For example you can create a transfer order from a location that requires inventory-pick to a location that requires inventory put-away. You can create and post the inventory put-away, and both the shipment and receipt transactions are created. You can also post such documents from a transfer order or from an inventory pick.  

For more information about warehouse handling, see [Warehouse management overview](design-details-warehouse-management.md).

## To transfer items with the item reclassification journal

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Item Reclass. Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Item Reclass. Journal** page, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
3. In the **Location Code** field, enter the location where the items are currently stored.

    > [!NOTE]  
    > To transfer items that have no location code, leave the **Location Code** field blank.
4. In the **New Location Code** field, enter the location that you want to transfer the items to.
5. Choose the **Post** action.

# Administration Tasks

Central administration tasks are usually performed by one role in the company. The scope of these tasks can depend on the company's size and the administrator's job responsibilities. These tasks can include managing database synchronization of job and email queues, setting up users, and customizing the user interface.  

Entering the correct setup values from the start is important to the success of any new business software. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes a number of setup guides that help you set up core data. For more information, see [Setting Up Business Central](setup.md).

> [!NOTE]
> You can use the data migration tools to migrate existing data to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online. Alternatively, you can set up a new company in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with configuration packages to shorten deployment times, improve quality of implementation, introduce a repeatable approach to implementations, and enhance productivity by automating and simplifying recurring tasks. For more information, see [Migrate On-Premises Data to Business Central Online](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/migrate-data).

You can support your setup decisions with some general recommendations for selected setup fields that are known to potentially cause the solution to be inefficient if defined incorrectly.  

A super user or an administrator can set up the Data Exchange Framework to enable users to export and import data in bank and payroll files, for example for various cash management processes. For more information, see [Exchanging Data Electronically](across-data-exchange.md).

The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the articles that describe them.

# About unit cost calculation

Each item has a unit cost that is calculated based on the company's costing method and other factors. As a rule, with the *Standard* costing method, the **Unit Cost** field value is based on the standard cost for the item. For all other costing methods (*FIFO*, *LIFO*, *Specific*, and *Average*), the unit cost is calculated based on the average unit cost across a period of time.  

## When is the unit cost field updated for item

The chosen costing method influences when the **Unit Cost** field is updated.

When the costing method is set as *Standard*, the **Unit Cost** field is updated whenever the standard cost is changed, and users can't edit the **Unit Cost** field. For more information, see [About Calculating Standard Cost](finance-about-calculating-standard-cost.md).

If the costing method is *FIFO*, *LIFO*, *Specific*, or *Average*, then the **Unit Cost** is updated in the following cases:

* When the item is cost-adjusted, automatically or by an [Adjust Cost](inventory-how-adjust-item-costs.md#to-adjust-item-costs-manually) task.
* During the posting of purchase invoices, output, or positive adjustment if one of the following conditions is true:
  * The net invoiced quantity of the item changes from negative or zero to positive.
  * The current unit cost is zero.

If one of these conditions is true, then the **Unit Cost** field is updated with the value in the **Last Direct Cost** field on the item card.

> [!NOTE]
> The **Unit Cost** field is not updated if the current unit cost is higher than zero and the new unit cost is zero. A unit cost of zero is considered an exception from regular business. Therefore, the current unit cost is retained to provide the last known, relevant value. This exception applies even if the existing inventory has been revalued to zero.

In the **Unit Cost** field on the item card, you can drill down to view the history of transactions that the average cost of units on hand is calculated from in the **Average Cost Calc. Overview** window.

## Impact of unit cost field on purchases and sales
How the contents of the **Costing Method** field influence the unit cost calculation for purchases and sales is described in more detail in the following sections.

### Unit cost calculation for purchases

When you purchase items, the value in the **Last Direct Cost** field on the item card is copied to the **Direct Unit Cost** field on a purchase line or to the **Unit Amount** line on an item journal line.

What you select in the **Costing Method** field influences how [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates the contents of the **Unit Cost** field on the lines.

#### Costing method FIFO, LIFO, Specific, or Average

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates the contents of the **Unit Cost (LCY)** field on the purchase line or the contents of the **Unit Cost** field on the item journal line according to the following formula:

*Unit Cost (LCY) = (Direct Unit Cost – (Discount Amount / Quantity)) x (1 + Indirect Cost % / 100) + Overhead Rate*

#### Costing method Standard

The **Unit Cost (LCY)** field on the purchase line or the **Unit Cost** field is filled on the item journal line by copying the value in the **Unit Cost** field on the item card. By using costing method set as *Standard*, this value is always based on the standard cost.

When you post the purchase, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses the unit cost from the purchase line or item journal line to the purchase item invoice entry. You can see it on the entry list for the item.

#### All costing methods

The unit cost from the source document line is used to calculate the contents of the **Cost Amount (Actual)** field, or if applicable, the **Cost Amount (Expected)** field that relates to this item entry, regardless of the costing method of the item.

### Unit cost calculation for sales

When you sell items, the unit cost is copied from the **Unit Cost** field on the item card to the sales line or the item journal line.

When you post, the unit cost is copied to the sales invoice item entry, and it can be seen on the entry list for the item. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses the unit cost from the source document line to calculate the contents of the **Cost Amount (Actual)** field, or if applicable, the **Cost Amount (Expected)** field in the value entry related to this item entry.

<!--
## To make general changes in the last direct unit cost

If you need to change the direct unit cost for several items, you can use the **Adjust Item Costs/Prices** batch job.  

The batch job changes the contents in the **Unit Price** field on the item card. The batch job changes the content of the field in the same way for all items or selected items. The batch job multiplies the value in the field by an adjustment factor that you specify.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Adjust Item Costs/Prices**, and then choose the related link.  
2. In the **Adjust Field** field, specify which item or SKU card field you want to adjust.  
3. In the **Adjustment Factor** field, specify the factor by which to adjust the value. For example, enter **1.5** to increase the value by 50%.  
4. On the **Item** FastTab, set filters to specify, for example, which items to process with the batch job.  
5. Choose the **OK** button.

# Work with inventory periods

Inventory periods define a period of time in which you can post changes to inventory. An inventory period is defined by the date on which it ends, or the ending date. When you close an inventory period, you can't post any changes to inventory, either expected or invoiced, before this ending date. You can't post any new values to inventory before the ending date. If you have open item entries in the closed period, meaning positive quantities that haven't yet been applied to outbound transactions, you can still apply outbound quantities to these entries, even if the period is closed.  

The following sections describe how to:

* Create inventory periods.  
* Close inventory periods.  
* Reopen inventory periods.  

## To create an inventory period

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Inventory Periods**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Create a new line.  
3. In the **Ending Date** field, enter the last date in the inventory period that you want to define. When the period is closed, you won't be able to post inventory changes before this date.  
4. Enter a descriptive name in the **Name** field. Choose the **OK** button.  

## To close inventory periods

The **Closed** field indicates whether or not the inventory period is closed to inventory value changes. You can't edit this field.  

You can close any inventory period, if the following is true:  

* There are no open outbound item ledger entries, meaning negative inventory, in that period.  
* The cost of all items has been adjusted using the **Adjust Cost – Item Entries** batch job.  

This means that all outbound transaction quantities, such as those from sales orders, outbound transfers, sales invoices, purchase returns, or purchase credit memos, must be applied to existing quantity in inventory.  

### To close an inventory period  

1. Before closing an inventory period, choose the **Adjust Cost – Item Entries** action to ensure that all cost adjustments are posted.

    Run the **Close Inventory Period – Test** report to determine if there are any open outbound item entries within the inventory period or any items whose cost hasn't yet been adjusted.  
2. Choose the **Test Report** action.  

    Run the **Post Inventory Cost to G/L** batch job to ensure that all costs are posted to the general ledger.  
3. Choose the **Post Inventory to G/L** action.  
4. On the **Inventory Periods** page, select the inventory period you want to close.  
5. Choose the **Close Period** action. After the inventory period has been closed, you can't post inventory changes before the ending date. The cost of all items must be adjusted with the **Adjust Cost – Item Entries** batch job before you close the inventory period.  
6. Choose the **Yes** button to confirm that you want to close the period, or choose **No** to cancel the closing.  
7. The inventory period is closed and a confirmation message is displayed when it's finished.  

## Reopening inventory periods  
After you have closed the inventory period, you can't delete the inventory period. You can, however, reopen it, if you would like to allow posting before the ending date of the inventory period. Reopening a period also reopens all inventory periods with ending dates later than the period you reopen.  

### To reopen an inventory period  
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Inventory Periods**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the inventory period you want to reopen.  
3. Choose the **Reopen Period** period action. Confirm that you want to reopen the period.  
4. All inventory periods with ending dates later than the period you selected are reopened.

# Set up sustainability features

To use the sustainability features effectively, you need to set up some basic controls and instructions. This article explains how to do that.

## Role Center  

If your primary responsibilities involve sustainability processes, we recommend that you use the **Sustainability Manager** Role Center. It gives easy access to the core features of sustainability, and the finance and procurement processes. It also shows the most important sustainability-related key performance indicators (KPIs).

To configure the Role Center, follow the steps:  

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **My settings**, and then select the related link.
2. In the **Role** field, select the **Available Roles** page.
3. Choose **Sustainability Manager**.
4. Select **OK**.

## Sustainability setup  

Specify some general settings for sustainability, such as the unit of measure for emissions, the decimal places for amounts, and whether some fields are mandatory.

To configure these settings, follow these steps:

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sustainability Setup**, and then select the related link.
2. On the **General** FastTab, configure the required fields that are related to sustainability.

    | Field | Description |
    |-------|-------------|
    | **Emission Unit of Measure Code** | Enter the unit of measure code that you use to register emissions. |
    | **Waste Unit of Measure Code** | Enter the the waste unit of measure code that you use to register waste intensity. |
    | **Water Unit of Measure Code** | Enter the water unit of measure code that you use to register water intensity. |
    | **Disch. Into Water Unit of Measure Code** | Enter the unit of measure code that you use to register discharged into water. |
    | **Emission Decimal Places** | Enter the number of decimal places that show for emission amounts. The default setting, *2:5*, means that a minimum of two decimal places and a maximum of five decimal places are shown for all amounts. You can also enter a fixed number. For example, if you enter *2*, two decimal places show for all amounts. |
    | **Country/Region Mandatory** | Make the country/region field mandatory. You can set the country/region field in journals even if you don't select this field. However, by selecting it, you require that users set the country/region field before posting. |
    | **Responsibility Center Mandatory** | Make the responsibility center mandatory. The responsibility center can be used as a facility, so that you can measure facility-based emissions. You can set the responsibility center field in journals even if you don't select this field. However, by selecting it, you require that users set the responsibility center field before posting. |
    | **Block Calculation Foundation Change If Ledger Entries Exist** | Prevent changes to the calculation foundation (formula) at the account category level when the formula was already applied to sustainability entries. |
    | **Enable Background Error Check** | Enable validations for sustainability journal lines. The validations run in the background. |

    > [!NOTE]
    > After you turn on or turn off validations in journals, sign in again before you start the new setup.

3. On the **Procurement** FastTab, configure the fields that are required to use sustainability features in the purchase process.  

    | Field | Description |
    |-------|-------------|
    | **Use Emissions In Purchase Documents** | Enable sustainability related fields and features to appear on purchase documents, such as **Sustainability Account** or different emissions. |
    | **Enable Value Chain tracking** | Enable posting of **Sustainability Value Entries** through value chain operations and the visibility of sustainability related fields in operational documents and journals. |
    | **G/L Account Emissions** | Enable a default **Sustainability Account** on the **G/L Account** card page. |
    | **Item Emissions** | Enable default **Sustainability Account** emissions on the **Item** card page. |
    | **Item Charge Emissions** | Enable default **Sustainability Account** emissions on the **Item Charge** (currently not operating) page. |
    | **Resource Emissions** | Enable default **Sustainability Account** emissions on the **Resource Card** page. |
    | **Work Machine Center Emissions** | Specifies the enablement of default **Sustainability Account** emissions on the **Work Center** and **Machine Center** pages. |

    > [!NOTE]
    > The **Use Emissions in Purchase Documents** field makes the **Sustainability Account** and emission fields on purchase documents. However, when you post the document, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] only creates **Sustainability Ledger Entries**. To activate posting to the **Sustainability Value Entries** and enable value chain tracking, you must also select the **Enable Value Chain Tracking** field.

4. On the **Calculations** FastTab, configure the required fields for the formulas that calculate emissions.

    | Field | Description |
    |-------|-------------|
    | **Fuel/Electricity Decimal Places** | Enter the number of decimal places that show for fuel/electricity amounts. The default setting, *2:5*, indicates that a minimum of two decimal places and a maximum of five decimal places show for all amounts. You can also enter a fixed number. For example, if you enter *2*, two decimal places show for all amounts. |
    | **Distance Decimal Places** | Enter the number of decimal places that show for distance measurements. The default setting, *2:5*, indicates that a minimum of two decimal places and a maximum of five decimal places show for all amounts. You can also enter a fixed number. For example, if you enter *2*, two decimal places show for all amounts. |
    | **Custom Amount Decimal Places** | Enter the number of decimal places that show for custom amounts. The default setting, *2:5*, indicates that a minimum of two decimal places and a maximum of five decimal places show for all amounts. You can also enter a fixed number. For example, if you enter *2*, two decimal places show for all amounts. |

5. On the **Reporting** FastTab, complete the setup by configuring the fields that are related to reporting to authorities.

    > [!NOTE]
    > In version 24.0, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't support reporting to any authorities. The fields that are related to the configuration of this functionality on the **Reporting** FastTab are intended for future reporting capabilities. However, partners can also use these fields in localized versions.

    | Field | Description |
    |-------|-------------|
    | **Emission Reporting Unit of Measure Code** | Enter the unit of measure code that you use to report emissions. You can use a different unit of measure when you report to authorities. This field isn't applicable to the standard reports. |
    | **Reporting UOM Factor** | Enter the unit of measure factor that you use to register emissions, if you use a different unit of measure when you report to authorities. |
    | **Emission Rounding Precision** | Enter the size of the interval that you use to round emission amounts when you report to authorities. |
    | **Emission Rounding Type** | Choose how to round emission amounts when you report to authorities. |

## Emission fees

To track internal carbon fees or calculate your emissions using carbon dioxide (CO2) equivalents, configure the **Emission Fees** page.  

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Emission Fees**, and then select the related link. 
2. In the **Emission Type** field, choose the greenhouse gas (GHG) emission you want to configure: **CO2**, **CH4**, or **N2O**. This field is mandatory.
3. Specify the **Scope Type**. If you leave this field blank, it applies to all scopes, but you can configure it for each scope.  
4. Specify a **Starting Date** and **Ending Date**. These dates let you use different configurations for different periods.
5. The **Country/Region Code** and **Responsibility Code** are optional fields that you can use if you want to have different carbon fees or carbon equivalent factors per country/region or per facility (responsibility center).
6. The **Carbon Fee** field represents the internal carbon fee that a company charges itself for each unit of CO2 equivalent that it emits. You can use this field based on some local or regional regulations, or for internal calculations. The **Carbon Fee** is calculated every time you post emissions. This information displays on the **Sustainability Ledger Entries**, without more posting to the **G/L Ledger**. You can set up **Carbon Fee** per unit of measure that you have in the **Sustainability Setup**, and you can fill this field only for the line where the **Emission Type** is **CO2**.
7. The **Carbon Equivalent Factor** specifies the coefficient that converts the effect of various GHGs into the equivalent amount of carbon dioxide based on their global warming potential. If the **Emission Type** is CO2, the **Carbon Equivalent Factor** is always *1* and you can't modify this value because CO2 is the reference gas used for calculating the global warming potential (GWP) of other GHGs. Because CO2 is the baseline, its GWP is set to *1*. For other GHGs, you must configure the values manually.
To calculate the carbon equivalent factor, use the following example. If we assume that 1 kilogram of N2O is equivalent to 298 kilograms of CO2, divide 1 by 298. The result you need to add is 0.00336.  

> [!NOTE]
> The **Carbon Fee** field on the **Sustainability Ledger Entries** isn't calculated based on the **CO2 Emission** values. Instead, as a foundation for this formula, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses the **CO2e Emission** field. The **CO2e Emission** field is calculated based on all emissions posted to an entry. The **Carbon Equivalent Factor** is configured for each of the gases on the **Emission Fees** page.  

> [!TIP]
> To use CO2e for all emissions (*CO2e of CO2*, *CO2e of CH4*, and *CO2e of N2O*), set the **Carbon Equivalent Factor** to **1** for the **CO2**, **CH4**, and **N2O** options. This setting gives you CO2e for all emissions, and the **CO2e** field displays the total carbon equivalent.  

If you didn't configure the **Emission Fees** before you posted sustainability entries, and you want to calculate your carbon fees and CO2e retroactively, run the **Calculate Emission Fees** action to update values on the sustainability ledger entries.  

## Responsibility Center

Use the **Responsibility Center** to post entries related to sustainability, where it represents a specific facility. However, if you want to use water management in sustainability, configure some additional information. You can set up your responsibility center as usual, and fill in the fields on the **Sustainability** FastTab as described in the following table.  

| Field | Description |
|-----------|----------------------------------|
| **Water Capacity Dimension** | Specifies the capacity dimension. For example, Area or Volume. |
| **Water Capacity Quantity (Month)** | Indicates the total water capacity quantity of the responsibility center. |
| **Water Capacity Unit** | Specifies the unit of measure that describes capacity quantity. |

# Manage user profiles

Assign all users to profiles that reflect:

* Their business role
* The department they work in
* Another type of categorization

Profiles allow administrators to centrally define and manage what different types of users can access in Business Central.

The typical business use of a profile is a role. A profile is therefore named *Profile (Role)* in the UI.

As an administrator, you create and manage profiles on the **Profiles (Roles)** page. Each profile has a card where you manage settings for the related role. The card contains the following information:

* Name of the role
* User settings
* The Role Center that the profile uses

For more information about user settings and Role Centers, see [Change Basic Settings](ui-change-basic-settings.md).

Before you can manage user profiles, you must create and add the users through the Microsoft 365 Admin Center. You can then assign permissions to each user or user group. Permissions define the features that users can access. To learn more about permission settings, go to [Assign Permissions to Users and Groups](ui-define-granular-permissions.md).

## Page customization

You can customize page layouts for a profile so that all users assigned the profile sees the customized pages. As an administrator, you customize pages by using the same functionality as users do when they personalize. To learn more about custom page layouts, go to [Customize Pages for Profiles](ui-personalization-manage.md).

## Create a profile

If you can't copy an existing profile, you can create a new one manually.

1. Select the ![Search for Page or Report.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Profiles (Roles)**, and then select the related link.  
2. On the **Profiles (Roles)** page, select the **New** action.  
3. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

> [!TIP]
> If you want a particular profile to be available only for specific users, you can enter **Navigation menu only** in the **Description** field. That setting excludes the profile from the list of available roles on the **My Settings** page.

## Copy a profile

To save time, you can create a new profile by copying an existing one that has similar settings. When you copy a profile, you also copy page customizations, both user-created and those from extensions.

1. On the **Profiles (Roles)** page, select the line for the profile that you want to copy, and then select the **Copy Profile** action.
2. Fill in the **Profile ID** and **Display Name** fields, and then select the **OK** button.
3. On the **Profiles (Roles)** page, open the newly created profile card, and then edit other fields as necessary.

## Edit a profile

You can edit a profile by changing the fields on the **Profiles (Roles)** page. However, the changes aren't available to the user assigned the profile until they sign out and sign in.

> [!Caution]
> Don't rename a profile while users assigned the profile are signed in. They might have to restart [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and sign in again.

## Assign a profile to a user

Users can assign themselves a role (representing a profile) by choosing the **Role** field on the **My Settings** page. As an administrator, you can do the same through the **Profiles (Roles)** page.

1. On the **Profiles (Roles)** page, select the profile that you want to assign, and then select the **User Personalization List** action.
2. On the **User Settings** page, select the user that you want to assign the profile to, and then select the **Edit** action.
3. In the **Profile ID** field, select the relevant profile.

If you assign another profile to a user, any personalizations made by the user with the previous profile are preserved.

## Define user settings for a profile

On the **My Settings** page, users can define basic behavior of their account, such as the Role Center, the language, and which notifications they get. To learn more about user settings, go to [Change Basic Settings](ui-change-basic-settings.md).

As an administrator, you can define settings for a profile. The settings apply to all users assigned to the role.

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Profiles (Roles)**, and then select the related link.
2. Select the line for the profile that you want to change user settings for, and then select the **User Personalizations List** action.
3. On the **User Personalizations** page, open the card for the user whose settings you want to change.
4. On the **User Personalization Card** page, edit the fields as necessary.

## Activate a profile

When you create a profile, you can define if, where, and how the profile and its information are available to users.

On the **Profiles (Roles)** page, select the following checkboxes:

* **Enabled** to specify if the related role is visible in the **Available Roles** page for users to choose from.  
* **Use as default profile** to specify the profile that applies to users who aren't assigned a specific role.
* **Disable personalization** to specify if users of the related role can personalize their workspace.
* **Show in Role Explorer** to specify if actions to business features included in the profile are shown in the extended view of the role explorer, a feature overview. To learn more about Role Explorer, go to [Finding Pages with the Role Explorer](ui-role-explorer.md).

## Export profiles

You can export profiles from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and reuse them in another tenant. The profiles export to a zip file that contains Application Language (AL) files. You can reuse the AL files to develop extensions. To learn more about exporting profiles, go to [Use the Client to Create Profiles and Page Customizations](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-design-profiles-using-client).

* On the **Profiles (Roles)** page, select the **Export Profiles** action.

    This action exports a zip file that contains AL files for all profiles.

## Import profiles

You can import profiles that are exported from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The steps are more or less the opposite of the steps to export profiles.

1. On the **Profiles (Roles)** page, select the **Import Profiles** action.
1. Follow the steps in the **Import Profiles** assisted setup guide.

    If you only want to import selected profiles, use the **Selected** checkbox to indicate which to import.
1. Select the **Import Selected** button.

    This action imports a zip file that contains AL files for the selected profiles.

## Delete a profile

You can delete a profile by choosing the **Delete** action on the **Profiles (Roles)** page. However, the following limitations apply:

* You can't delete a profile that is assigned to a user or a security group.
* You can't delete profiles that originate from extensions. The extension must first be uninstalled.
* You can only delete one profile at a time.

## Delete personalizations

### Delete all personalizations made by a specific user

You can delete all changes that a user makes to any pages, which reverts the pages to the the original layout. Personalizations aren't associated with a profile (role). If a user personalizes a page, they experience the personalizations on the page no matter which role they're using.

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **User Settings**, and then select the related link.

    The **User Settings** page lists all users<!--who make personalizations-->.

2. Select the user whose personalizations you want to delete.
3. On the **User Settings** card page, select the **Clear Personalized Pages** action, and then accept the message that appears.

The user experiences the changes the next time they sign in.

You can also delete all page customizations for a profile. To learn more, go to [To delete all customizations for a profile](ui-personalization-manage.md#delete-all-customizations-for-a-profile).

### Delete personalizations for specific pages

You can delete personalizations that one or more users make to specific pages. Deleting personalizations can be useful, for example, if a business process change means that a personalization isn't relevant. Deletions restore the page layout back to what the profile defines.

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Personalized Pages**, and then select the related link.

    The **Personalized Pages** page lists all personalized pages and the user they belong to.

    <!--A checkmark in the **Legacy Personalization** field indicates that the personalization was done in an older version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], which handled personalization differently. Users who try to personalize these pages are locked from doing so unless they choose to unlock the page.-->

2. Select the line for the page personalization that you want to delete, and then select the **Delete** action.

The user experiences the changes the next time they sign-in.  

You can also delete individual page customizations for a profile. To learn more, go to [To delete customization for specific pages for a profile](ui-personalization-manage.md#delete-customization-for-specific-pages-for-a-profile).

## Managing user sessions

As the administrator of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, you can manage user sessions in the administration center. To learn more, go to [Managing Sessions][def] in the administration content.  

For [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, you can manage sessions using SQL Server Management Studio, for example. To learn more, go to [SQL Server technical documentation](/sql/sql-server).

# Design Details: Item Tracking Posting Structure
To align with inventory costing functionality and to obtain a simpler and more robust solution, item ledger entries are used as the primary carrier of item tracking numbers.  
  
Item tracking numbers on order network entities and non-order network entities are specified in the **Reservation Entry** table (T337). Item tracking numbers that are related to historical information are retrieved directly from the item ledger entries that are related to the transaction in question. This means that item ledger entries reflect the item tracking specification of the posted order line.  
  
The **Item Tracking Lines** page retrieves the information from T337 and the item ledger entries and shows it through the temporary table, **Tracking Specification** (T336). T336 also hold the temporary data in the **Item Tracking Lines page** for item tracking quantities that remain to be invoiced.  
  
## One-to-Many Relation  
The **Item Entry Relation** table, which is used to link a posted document line with its related item ledger entries, consists of two main parts:  
  
* A pointer to the posted document line, the **Order Line No.** field.  
* An entry number pointing to an item ledger entry, the **Item Entry No.** field.  
  
The functionality of the existing **Entry No.** field, which relates an item ledger entry to a posted document line, handles the typical one-to-one relation when no item tracking numbers exist on the posted document line. If item tracking numbers exist, then the **Entry No.** field is left blank, and the one-to-many relation is handled by the **Item Entry Relation** table. If the posted document line carries item tracking numbers but only relates to a single item ledger entry, then the **Entry No.** field handles the relation, and the no record is created in the **Item Entry Relation** table.  
  
## Codeunits 80 (Sales-Post)  and 90 (Purch-Post)
To split the item ledger entries during posting, the code in codeunit 80 and codeunit 90, is encircled by loops that run through global temporary record variables. This code calls codeunit 22 with an item journal line. These variables are initialized when item tracking numbers exist for the document line. To keep the code simple, this looping structure is always used. If no item tracking numbers exist for the document line, then a single record is inserted, and the loop runs only once.  
  
## Posting the Item Journal  
Item tracking numbers are transferred via the reservation entries that relate to the item ledger entry, and the looping through item tracking numbers occurs in codeunit 22  (Item Jnl.-Post Line). This concept works in the same way when an item journal line is used indirectly to post a sale or purchase order as when an item journal line is used directly. When the item journal is used directly, the **Source Row ID** field points to the item journal line itself.  
  
## Code Unit 22  (Item Jnl.-Post Line)
Codeunits 80 (Sales-Post)  and 90 (Purch-Post) loop the call of codeunit 22 (Item Jnl.-Post Line) during the invoice posting of item tracking numbers and during the invoicing of existing shipments or receipts.  
  
During quantity posting of item tracking numbers, codeunit 22 (Item Jnl.-Post Line) retrieves item tracking numbers from the entries in T337 (Reservation Entry) that relate to the posting. These entries are placed directly on the item journal line.  
  
Codeunit 22 (Item Jnl.-Post Line) loops through the item tracking numbers and splits the posting into the respective item ledger entries that carry the item tracking numbers. Information about which item ledger entries are created is returned to T337(Reservation Entry)by using a temporary T336 record, which is called by a procedure in codeunit 22. This procedure is triggered when codeunit 22 has finished its run because at that point, the codeunit 22 object contains the information. When the temporary T336 record is retrieved, Codeunits 80 (Sales-Post)  and 90 (Purch-Post) create records in the **Item Entry Relation** table to link the created item ledger entries to the created shipment or receipt line. Codeunits 80 (Sales-Post)  and 90 (Purch-Post) then converts the temporary T336 (Tracking Specification) records to real T336 (Tracking Specification) records that are related to the line in question. However, this conversion occurs only if the posted document line is not deleted, because it is only partially posted.

# Understanding Assemble to Order and Assemble to Stock

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] lets you supply assembly items in the following ways:

* Assemble to order  
* Assemble to stock  

## Assemble to order

Use the assemble-to-order process for items that you don't want to stock. For example, for the following reasons:

* You'll customize the items for customer requirements.
* You want to minimize the cost of on-hand inventory.

The following list describes some of the benefits of the assemble-to-order process:  

* Customize assembly items when taking a sales order.  
* Overview availability of the assembly item and its components.  
* Reserve assembly components immediately to guarantee order fulfillment.  
* Determine the profitability of the customized order by rolling up price and cost.  
* Integrated with the warehouse to make assembly and shipping easier.  
* Assemble to order when you create a sales quote or a blanket sales order.  
* Combine inventory quantities with assemble-to-order quantities.  

In the assemble-to-order process, you assemble items for a sales order. There's a one-to-one link between the assembly order and the sales order.  

When you enter an assemble-to-order item on a sales order line, an assembly order is automatically created. The assembly order is based on the sales line, and its lines are based on the item's assembly BOM. The quantity of components on the assembly BOM is multiplied by the order quantity. The **Assemble-to-Order Lines** page shows details about the linked assembly order lines. The details can help you customize the assembly item. The delivery date is based on the availability of components. To learn more about assembling items for sales orders, go to [Sell Items Assembled to Order](assembly-how-to-sell-items-assembled-to-order.md).  

> [!NOTE]  
> Although it isn't part of the default process, you can sell inventory quantities and assemble-to-order quantities on the same sales order. To learn more about combining stock and assemble-to-order items, go to [Sell Inventory Items in Assemble-to-Order Flows](assembly-how-to-sell-inventory-items-in-assemble-to-order-flows.md).  

To specify that an item is assembled-to-order, in the **Assembly Policy** field on the **Item Card** page for the item, choose **Assemble-to-Order**.  

## Assemble to stock

Use the assemble-to-stock process for items that you assemble and store for future sales. Assemble-to-stock items are standard items, such as packaged kits, that you don't customize. You can also consume these items as subassembly components. The items are picked and processed as single items and are treated as finished production items. To learn more about assembly items, go to [Assemble Items](assembly-how-to-assemble-items.md).  

When you specify an assemble-to-stock item on a sales line, the item is treated like any other item sold from inventory. For example, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] checks availability only for the assembled item only, and not its components.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Although it isn't part of the default process, you can assemble an item to order even if the item is set up to be assembled to stock. Learn more at [Sell Assemble-to-Order Items and Inventory Items Together](assembly-how-to-sell-assemble-to-order-items-and-inventory-items-together.md).  

To specify that an item is assembled-to-stock, in the **Assembly Policy** field on the **Item Card** page for the item, choose **Assemble-to-Stock**.  

## Combination scenarios

When assemble-to-order and inventory quantities are combined on a sales order, assemble-to-order quantities must be shipped first.  

If an assembly order is linked to a sales order line, the value in the **Qty. to Assemble to Order** field on the sales order line is copied to the **Quantity to Assemble** field via the **Quantity** field on the assembly order. Learn more at [Sell Items Assembled to Order](assembly-how-to-sell-items-assembled-to-order.md).  

The value in the **Quantity to Assemble** field is related to the **Qty. to Ship** field on the sales order line. This relation manages how you ship partial and complete assemble-to-order quantities:

* When the full quantity on the sales order line is assembled to order
* In combination scenarios where part of the quantity is assembled to order and part is shipped from inventory.

The combination scenario allows flexibility for partial shipments. You can use the **Quantity to Assemble** field to specify the quantity to ship partially from inventory and by assembling to order.  

If the full sales line quantity must be assembled to order and shipped, the value in the **Qty. to Ship** field is copied to the **Quantity to Assemble** field on the linked assembly order when you change the quantity to ship. This update ensures that the quantity being shipped is fully supplied by the assemble-to-order quantity.  

However, in combination scenarios, the full value in the **Qty. to Ship** is not copied to the **Quantity to Assemble** field on the assembly order. Instead, a default value is inserted in the **Quantity to Assemble** field. The value is calculated from the **Qty. to Ship** field to ensure the assemble-to-order quantities ship first.

To deviate from the default, for example because you only want to assemble more or less of the quantity in the **Qty. to Ship** field, you can modify the **Quantity to Assemble** field within predefined rules, as illustrated below.  

An example of why you would modify the quantity to assemble is that you want to partially post the shipment of inventory quantities before you ship the assembly output.  

The following tables explain the rules that define the minimum and maximum values that you can enter in the **Quantity to Assemble** field to deviate from the default value in a combination scenario. The table shows a combination scenario where the **Qty. to Ship** field on the linked sales order line is changed from 7 to 4, and the **Quantity to Assemble** is therefore defaulted to 4.  

**Sales Order Line**

|                | **Quantity** | **Qty. to Ship** | **Qty. to Assemble to Order** | **Quantity Shipped** |
|----------------|--------------|------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------|
|**Initial value**| 10          | 7                | 7                             | 0                    |
|**Change**      |              | 4                |                               |                      |

**Assembly Order Header**

|                | **Quantity** | **Qty. to Ship** | **Qty. to Assemble to Order** | **Quantity Shipped** |
|----------------|--------------|------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------|
|**Initial value**| 7           | 7                | 0                             | 7                    |
|**Change**      |              | 4 (inserted by default)|                         |                      |

Based on this example, you can modify the **Quantity to Assemble** field as follows:  

* The minimum quantity you can enter is 1. You must assemble at least one unit to be able to sell the four units, assuming that the remaining three are available in inventory.  
* The maximum quantity that you can enter is 4. This limit ensures that you don't assemble more of the item than you need for the sale.

# Liabilities (Power BI report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Liabilities** report provides an overview of your company's financial obligations, highlighting total liabilities, current liabilities, payroll liabilities, and long-term liabilities. It also shows key performance indicators such as debt ratio and dept-to-equity ratio, along with total assets.

These key performance indicators can help you understand the balance between debt and equity while monitoring liabilities that affect future cash flow and operational flexibility.

Drill through into the **Liabilities Drill-Through** page to explore the underlying ledger entries that make up the balance.

:::image type="content" source="media/finance/liabilities-report.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Liabilities report" lightbox="media/finance/liabilities-report.png":::

## Use the report

The audiences for the report are:

- Executives
- Directors
- Other high-level decision makers

Executives can use the report to evaluate your company's financial position before engaging in a new expansive initiative. By first analyzing current liabilities, you can gauge your immediate debt burden. This analysis helps you determine whether there are enough liquid assets to meet short term obligations, and ensure you have cash-flow to support existing operations and new development.

Next, you could assess the debt ratio and debt-to-equity ratios. These key performance indicators provide insight into the company's leverage and risk profile. For example, a high debt-to-equity ratio could indicate that the company has a high reliance on borrowed funds. This type of data can help inform how you decide to finance the expansion project.  

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The *Liabilities* report includes the following KPIs and measures: 

- [**Liabilities**](finance-powerbi-kpis.md#liabilities)
- [**Current Liabilities**](finance-powerbi-kpis.md#current-liabilities)
- [**Payroll Liabilities**](finance-powerbi-kpis.md#payroll-liabilities)
- [**Longterm Liabilities**](finance-powerbi-kpis.md#longterm-liabilities)
- [**Debt Ratio**](finance-powerbi-kpis.md#debt-ratio)
- [**Debt/Equity Ratio**](finance-powerbi-kpis.md#debtequity-ratio)
- [**Assets**](finance-powerbi-kpis.md#assets)
- [**Balance at Date (Neg)**](finance-powerbi-kpis.md#balance-at-date-neg)

# Troubleshoot Financial Reporting

This article provides resolutions to a few typical problems you might encounter within Financial Reporting.

## Balancing reports to the general ledger

When you create new financial reports, you might find that they don't balance to the general ledger. The following are the most likely reasons why.

* A new general ledger account was added to the chart of accounts, but not the financial reporting.
* General ledger accounts are missing from the Totaling accounts.
* General ledger accounts are listed multiple times in the Totaling accounts.
* A formula is missing.
* A formula points to the wrong row number reference.
* A formula doesn't include all the necessary rows.
* A formula includes rows more than one time.
* A formula is making an incorrect calculation.
* A formula incorrectly shows a positive value as negative or a negative value as positive.
* A totaling account is being used on a row instead of a posting account.

## Testing a financial report against Trial Balance reports

After you double-check the possible causes stated in the [Balancing reports to the general ledger](#balancing-reports-to-the-general-ledger) section, if you still have an imbalance, consider running one of the **Trial Balance** reports. These reports can serve as a reference point because they correctly lists all G/L accounts in your chart of accounts and always balance to zero. You can compare this version of the trial balance to the rows of your financial report to identify and correct the error.

When you run the Trial Balance report, fill out the report options as follows for a clean, simple, and balanced report to review.

* In the **Show Comparison** field, choose **Last Year**.
* Turn on the **Actual Balances** toggle.
* In the **Round to** field, choose the lowest value available for your currency.
* Turn on the **Print to Excel** toggle.
* On the **Filter** FastTab, in the **Account Type** field, choose **Posting**.
* In the **Date Filter** field, enter the date for the report. <!--Need a better description here.-->
* Turn off all other toggles and leave all other fields blank.

## Testing a financial report against a data analysis on G/L entries

A different method for testing a financial report than what is described in the [Testing a financial report against Trial Balance reports](#testing-a-financial-report-against-trial-balance-reports) section is to use the data analysis feature on the [General Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=20&layout=analysis) page. This allows you to group and summarize amounts by G/L account or G/L account category, and set filters on relevant data properties, such as G/L account, G/L account category, or posting date.

Learn more in [Ad-hoc analysis on finance data](ad-hoc-analysis-finance.md).

## Adding check figures

One way to quickly identify errors in the design of your financial reporting is to add check figures to your row definitions. You want the figure to calculate to zero, which indicates that the report is correct. When you run financial reporting, a quick glance at the check figure can confirm whether the report is correct.

## When to use net change or balance at date

A typical mistake that financial reporting users make is to incorrectly combine row and column definitions. When column definitions use net change as the row type, the columns are most appropriately combined with income statement reports. When column definitions use balance at date as the row type, the columns are most appropriately combined with balance sheet reports.

An easy way to remember this rule of thumb is to think about what the goal of each report is to the viewer. People use balance sheet reports to find account balances of accounts on a certain date. So, using a Balance at Date column definition makes more sense.

People use income statement reports to explore the activity of each account during a period of time. So, using a Net Change column definition makes more sense.

For experienced accountants, we know that in some cases we can apply either report to analyze accounts. We might want to initially review the balance sheet using Balance at Date, but also use Net Change to see how much activity happened in each account as we review trends over time. We might review the Income Statement initially using Net Change to see the trend of activity over time. But we might also look at the Balance at Date of these accounts to see how much accumulated in them throughout the year.

While there isn't a single correct answer for how to use these different views, there are general conventions accountants use when they design reports for other viewers. These conventions are that the Balance Sheet uses Balance at Date, and the Income Statement uses Net Change.

> [!TIP]
> When you create column definitions, might include **BS** or **IS** in the definition description. Those tags can help report viewers decide which reports should use which column definitions.

# Set Up Document Sending Profiles
You can set each customer up with a preferred method of sending sales documents, so that you do not have to select a sending option every time you choose the **Post and Send** action.

On the **Document Sending Profiles** page, you set up different sending profiles that you can select from in the **Document Sending Profile** field on a customer card. You can select the **Default** check box to specify that the document sending profile is the default profile for all customers, except for customers where the **Document Sending Profile** field is filled with another sending profile.

When you choose the **Post and Send** action on a sales document, the **Post and Send Confirmation** dialog box shows the sending profile used, either the one set up for the customer or the default for all customers. In the dialog box, you can change the sending profile for the sales document. For more information, see [Invoice Sales](sales-how-invoice-sales.md).

# Purchases Overview (Power BI report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Purchases Overview** report gives a clear picture of your purchasing activities. It highlights important metrics such as

- Total purchase amounts
- Outstanding liabilities
- Invoiced purchases

The report breaks down purchase quantities by location and item category, and provides vendor information to help with financial analysis, budget management, and compliance.

:::image type="content" source="media/purchases/purchases-overview.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Purchases Overview Power BI report" lightbox="media/purchases/purchases-overview.png":::

## Use the report

The report helps leadership and management teams track actual spending on purchasing activities, manage budgets, and evaluate vendor performance.

CEOs can use the report to keep track of purchasing activities. This report gives a clear picture of your total purchase amount, outstanding liabilities, and invoiced purchases. By analyzing purchase quantities by location and item category, and reviewing vendor information, you can gain valuable insights into your financial performance. With this information, you can make informed decisions about budget management and vendor relationships.

Purchasing managers can identify where you might be overspending or underspending. For example, you might notice that your organization spent a lot on a specific item category, but the quantity of purchases was lower than expected. You might review vendor contracts, find alternative vendors with better prices, or negotiate better terms with existing vendors. By taking these actions, you can optimize purchasing activities, reduce costs, and comply with the overall budget.


## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The *Purchases Overview* report includes the following KPIs and measures: 

- [**Purchase Amount**](purchases-powerbi-kpis.md#purchase-amount)
- [**Outstanding Amount (excluding VAT)**](purchases-powerbi-kpis.md#outstanding-amount-excl-vat)
- [**Amount Received but Not Invoiced (excluding VAT)**](purchases-powerbi-kpis.md#amt-rcd-not-invd-excl-vat)
- [**Invoiced Amount**](purchases-powerbi-kpis.md#invoiced-amount)
- [**Purchase Quantity**](purchases-powerbi-kpis.md#purchase-quantity)
- [**No. of Outstanding Purchase Orders**](purchases-powerbi-kpis.md#no-of-outstanding-purchase-orders)
- [**No. of Received Not Invd. Purchase Orders**](purchases-powerbi-kpis.md#no-of-received-not-invd-purchase-orders)
- [**No. of Purchase Invoices**](purchases-powerbi-kpis.md#no-of-purchase-invoices)

# Cloud migration base extension

This extension takes you through the process to configure a connection between your on-premises solution and your [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online environment when you start the migration to the cloud.  

Once the connection is configured, you can migrate data from your on-premises solution to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online. This extension works with a data replication extension available for your specific on-premises solution. For more information, see [Running the Cloud Migration Tool](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/migration-tool).

# Customizing Business Central online using apps

You can change [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online by installing apps that add functionality, changes behavior, or gives you access to new online services, for example. These apps are also called *extensions* because they *extend* [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## Manage apps

When you first launch [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], some apps are already installed for you. Over time, more apps will be made available to you, and you can then choose if you want to use the app or not.

For example, Microsoft provides an app that lets you integrate with PayPal Payments Standard. This extension is installed by default. But, an extension that offers integration with another payment service might come along. In that case, you can install the new extension and then choose which to use.  

To use an app, you must have the permissions to the installed objects.

To install or uninstall apps from AppSource or add per-tenant extensions, you must have the right permissions. You must either be a member of the **D365 Extension Mgt.** user group, or you must have the **EXTEN. MGT. - ADMIN** permission set explicitly. If you're an administrator, you can assign user groups and permissions to other users in your company. Learn more in [Create Users According to Licenses](ui-how-users-permissions.md).  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> For [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, you cannot upload per-tenant extensions or install AppSource apps through the **Extension Management** page. You cannot install AppSource apps on-premises, including in Docker-based deployments.

You manage the apps on the **Extension Management** page. You can access this page from Home. Alternatively, choose the **Search for Page or Report** icon ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") in the top right corner, enter **Extension**, and then choose the related link. Learn more in [Install and Uninstall apps](ui-extensions-install-uninstall.md).

> [!NOTE]  
> If you think you should have access to an app but you cannot find its functionality, check the **Extension Management** page - if the app is not listed there, you can install it as described in the following section.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Sign in to [AppSource.microsoft.com](https://appsource.microsoft.com/) using the email account that you use for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online. Use the same email account for other services and products for a smooth experience.  

You can also get to AppSource from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. On the **Extension Management** page, you can see the apps that are currently installed, and you can open the **Microsoft AppSource Apps** page that shows the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] apps that are currently available in AppSource. If you choose the **View AppSource** action, you're taken to [AppSource.microsoft.com](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2081646). Learn more in [Manage AppSource apps](admin-manage-appsource-apps.md).

If you choose an app, you can read about what the app does, and you can access Help for the app to learn more. When you choose to get an app, you must agree to the terms of use. If you get the app from the AppSource website, sign in to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to complete the installation.  

When you install an app, you might have to set it up, such as specifying an account for use with the **PayPal Payments Standard for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]** extension. Other apps add fields to an existing page, or they add a new page, for example.

If you uninstall an app, and you then change your mind, you can install it again. When you uninstall an app, your data is preserved. If you install the app again, it's still available. There are some apps that are required, and you can't uninstall them from the **Extension Management** page.

> [!NOTE]  
> You can keep an eye out for new apps from Microsoft and other suppliers at [AppSource.microsoft.com](https://appsource.microsoft.com/marketplace/apps?product=dynamics-365%3Bdynamics-365-business-central&page=1).

## Understanding the risks of installing apps

[!INCLUDE [ui-extensions-risk-install-apps](includes/ui-extensions-risk-install-apps.md)]

## Apps and data transfer

When apps communicate with other services, they might transfer data out of the geography of the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] environment. Examples of such apps include banking, payment, payroll, and forecasting services.

The same is true for the base application, such as the following capabilities:

* Cash Flow Forecast
* Document Exchange Service
* Dataverse connections
* OCR Service
* Online Map
* EU VAT Reg. No. Service

## Connect your business

Starting in 2022 release wave 2, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online environments can list one or more apps on the **Connectivity Apps** and **Banking Apps** pages. These apps can connect your business to external services that increase productivity by automating processes. For example, you can connect to your banks and automatically import bank transactions. The apps are easy to install and set up directly from this page. Choose an app to learn more about capabilities and pricing.  

View the list of suggested apps by choosing the **Connectivity Apps** action in the **Extension Management** page.  

> [!NOTE]
> The first person to open the **Connectivity Apps** page must allow the extension to connect to an external service. Allow the connection once or always. If you choose to block the connection, you must find the relevant apps on AppSource. If you allow the connection once or always, be aware that your information might be shared with third parties. Learn more in the section [Understanding the risks of installing apps](#understanding-the-risks-of-installing-apps).

This external service generates a list of relevant apps based on your country or region

## Recommended apps

Microsoft partners and resellers can create an app that they can use to compile lists of apps that they often recommend to their customers. If they do, and they deployed the app to your tenant, the apps are available on the **Recommended Apps** page. There you can read about each app and decide whether to install them.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are a Microsoft partner or reseller, and you're interested in providing a list of recommended apps, see [Recommend Apps from AppSource](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/recommend-apps) in the administration content.

# Block vendors

You can block a vendor, for example because of insolvency, so that people can't select the vendor on purchase documents or post payments to the vendor.

The following table describes the options for blocking vendors.  

|Option|Description|  
|--------------------|------------|  
|**Blank**|Transactions are allowed for this vendor.|
|**Payment**|New payments can't be created for this vendor.|  
|**All**|No transactions are allowed for this vendor.|  

## To block a vendor

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Vendors**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the vendor that you want to block.
3. In the **Blocked** field, choose one of the options for blocking.

## Handling vendor payment disputes

You can out vendor ledger entries **On hold** if there's a dispute about a supplier document.

# Set Up Units of Measure

As part of setting up your [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you set up general units of measure on the **Units of Measure** page. Then, when you register new items, you specify the base unit of measure on the **Item Card** page. You can also add units of measure later.  

You can set up multiple units of measure for an item:

- Assign a base unit of measure to the item on the Item Card page. The base unit of measure defines how you store it in inventory and is the basis for conversion to alternate units of measure.
- Assign alternate units of measure to purchase, production, or sales documents to specify how many units of the base unit of measure you handle at a time in those processes. For example, you might buy the item on pallets and only use single pieces in your production.

If an item is stocked in one unit of measure but produced in another, a production order is created that uses a manufacturing batch unit of measure to calculate the correct quantity of the components during the **Refresh Production Order** batch job. An example of a manufacturing batch unit of measure calculation is when a manufactured item is stocked in pieces but produced in tons. To learn more, go to [Work with Manufacturing Batch Units of Measure](production-how-to-use-the-manufacturing-batch-unit-of-measure.md).  

Another tool that makes it easier to work with multiple units of measure for items is the ability to specify a rounding precision for base units of measure. Specifying a rounding precision provides guidance on what someone should enter for a given business process, and helps reduce rounding issues. When you use alternate units of measure, the value in the **Qty. per Unit of Measure** field helps calculate the quantity in the base unit of measure, which can lead to rounding issues. For example, imagine you're receiving one box that contains six items. When the box arrives at your warehouse, you discover that one of the six items is missing. You decide not to post the receipt of one box, but instead change the quantity received to five of six pieces. That decision would lead to a receipt of 4.99998 pieces, rather than five. On the **Item Units of Measure** page, the **Quantity Rounding Precision** field lets you specify a value that converts the quantity to a number that's easier to understand. Continuing with the example, we would enter **1** in the field to round up to an even five pieces.

## To set up units of measure

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Units of Measure**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action. A new empty line is inserted.  
3. Fill in the fields. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  
4. If you know that your organization sells items with this unit of measure to customers in other countries/regions, you can add translations.  
    1. Select the code for which you want to set up translations, and then choose the **Translations** action.
    2. In the **Language Code** field, select the drop-down arrow to see a list of available language codes. Select the language code for which you want to enter a translation, and then choose the OK button to copy the code to the field.
    3. In the **Description** field, enter the appropriate text.
5. Repeat the previous steps for any other units of measure that you want to add.  

When you register a new item, you can choose the base unit of measure from the list of units of measure that you set up. You can also set up multiple units of measure for an item.  

## To set up multiple item units of measure

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the card of the item for which you want to set up alternate units of measure.
3. Choose the **Units of Measure** action. The **Item Units of Measure** page opens.
4. If the **Base Unit of Measure** field on the item card is filled, then that unit of measure is already set up.
5. Choose the **New** action. A new empty line is inserted.
6. In the **Code** field, enter the name of the unit of measure. Alternatively, choose the field to select from the unit of measure codes that are in the database.
7. In the **Qty. per Unit of Measure** field, enter how many units of the base unit of measure the new unit of measure contains.
8. Optionally, in the **Height**, **Width**, **Length**, and **Weight** fields, specify precise information about the size of one unit of measure so that the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can calculate how many of each item unit can be placed in any given bin. The **Cubage** field is calculated automatically based on **Height**, **Width**, and **Length**.

    If any of these fields contain a value other than 0, then that measure is used during all processes that involve placing items in a bin: put-away, movements, receipts, shipments, picks, and adjustments. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] checks the sum of each physical measure of the items being put away. It also checks the items already in the bin against the maximum size or other measure that can fit into a bin. This information comes from the bin capacity policy on the location card where you store this item. In other words, you must use the same unit measure for each dimension across all item units of measure - use kilograms or pounds for weight, for example, but be consistent.
9. Repeat steps 5 through 7 to set up all the alternate units of measure that you want to use in different processes for this item.

    In the **Base Unit of Measure** field at the bottom of the window, you can view or change the item's base unit of measure. You can also change the base unit of measure in the **Base Unit of Measure** field on the item card. In the **Item Units of Measure** page, the base unit of measure must have the value **1** in the **Qty. per Unit of Measure** field.

You can now use the alternate units of measure on purchase, production, and sales documents. To learn more, go to [To enter a default unit of measure code for sales and purchasing transactions](#to-enter-a-default-unit-of-measure-code-for-sales-and-purchasing-transactions).  

## To set up unit of measure translations

When you sell items to foreign customers, you might want to specify the unit of measure in the customer's language. You can do that by specifying translations for units of measure.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Units of Measure**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the code for which you want to set up translations, and then choose the **Translations** action.
3. In the **Language Code** field, select the drop-down arrow to see a list of available language codes. Select the language code for which you want to enter a translation, and then choose the OK button to copy the code to the field.
4. In the **Description** field, enter the appropriate text.
5. Repeat steps 2 through 4 for the unit of measure codes and the languages for which you want to enter translations.

## To enter a default unit of measure code for sales and purchasing transactions

If you usually buy or sell in units different from the base unit of measure, you can specify separate units of measure for purchases and sales. To use separate units of measure, set up the units of measure on the **Item Units of Measure** page.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the relevant item card for which you want to specify a default sales or purchase unit of measure code.
3. For sales, on the **Invoicing** FastTab, in the **Sales Unit of Measure** field, open the **Item Units of Measure** page.
4. For purchasing, on the **Replenishment** FastTab, in the **Purch. Unit of Measure** field, open the **Item Units of Measure** page.
5. Select the code you want to set up as the default unit of measure for sales or purchasing respectively, and then choose the **OK** button.

# Create recurring purchase lines

If you often need to create purchase lines with similar information, you can set up standard lines that you can then insert on recurring purchase documents, for example, for recurring replenishment orders.

## Set up recurring purchase lines

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Recurring Purchase Lines**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Recurring Purchase Lines** page, choose the **New** action.
3. On the **General** FastTab, fill the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
4. On the **Lines** FastTab, enter the information in the fields that reflect the standard lines you expect to use as recurring lines on purchase documents.

> [!NOTE]
> You cannot define prices on recurring purchase lines because prices, discounts, etc. are calculated on the actual purchase documents after you insert the recurring purchase lines.

[!INCLUDE [line-no-info](includes/line-no-info.md)]

## Assign recurring purchase lines to a vendor

Assign one or more recurring purchase lines to a vendor so that they're available to insert on purchase documents from that vendor.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Vendors**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the card for a relevant vendor.
3. Choose the **Recurring Purchase Lines** action.
4. On the **Recurring Purchase Lines** page, select codes for the recurring purchase lines that you want to be able to insert on purchase documents for the vendor.
5. Fill in the other fields to define when, how, and where the recurring purchase lines are to be used.
6. In the four fields where you select how the lines are inserted on each document type, select one of the following options:

|Option|Description|
|------|-----------|
|**Manual**|You must manually look up and insert a recurring purchase line that exists for the vendor.|
|**Automatic**|If multiple recurring purchase lines exist for the vendor, you'll get a notification from where you can pick which one to insert. If only one recurring purchase line exists, it will be inserted automatically.<br /><br />This only works if the new document was created from a document list, for example by choosing the **New** action on the **Purchase Orders** page. It doesn't work if the document was created from a vendor card, for example.|
|**Always Ask**|A notification appears and all existing recurring purchase lines are shown so that you can select one.

## Insert recurring purchase lines on a purchase invoice

If recurring purchase lines exist for the vendor, you can insert them, or have them automatically added, on all types of purchase documents, such as a purchase invoice. If you have activated the **Always Ask** options while assigning recurring purchase lines to vendors, you'll be informed if recurring purchase lines exist.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Invoices**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the purchase invoice that you want to insert one or more standard purchase lines on.
3. Choose the **Get Recurring Purchase Lines** action.
4. On the **Recurring Purchase Lines** page, choose the lookup button in the **Code** field, and then select a set of standard purchase lines.
5. Choose the **OK** button to insert the standard purchase lines on the invoice where you can reuse them as is or edit the information.

# Use XML Schemas to Prepare Data Exchange Definitions

To enable import/export of data in XML files through the data exchange framework in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can use XML schemas to define which data elements you want to exchange with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. You perform this work on the **XML Schema Viewer** page by loading the XML schema file, selecting the relevant data elements, and then initializing a data exchange definition.  

 When you have defined which data elements to include based on the XML schema, you can use the **Generate Data Exchange Definition** action to initialize a data exchange definition based on the selected data elements, which you then complete in the Data Exchange Framework. This creates a record on the **Posting Exchange Definition** page where you continue by defining which elements in the file map to which fields in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For more information, see [Set Up Data Exchange Definitions](across-how-to-set-up-data-exchange-definitions.md).  

 This topic contains the following procedures:  

- To load an XML schema file  

- To select or clear nodes in an XML schema  

- To generate a data exchange definition that is based on an XML schema  

## To load an XML schema file

1. Make sure that the relevant XML schema file is available. The file extension is .xsd.  

2. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **XML Schemas**, and then choose the related link.  

3. Choose the **New** action.  

4. Fill the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Code**|Specify a code to identify the XML schema.|  
    |**Description**|Specify a description of the XML schema.|  

     The **Target Namespace** field specifies any namespace in the XML schema file that has been loaded for the line.  

5. Choose the **Load Schema** action, and then select the XML schema file.  

     When the file is loaded, the rest of the fields on the line are filled with information from the file, and the **Schema is Loaded** check box is selected.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  The tree of the loaded XML schema is collapsed by default. You expand each node by choosing the **+** button on the node. To expand all nodes, choose **Expand All** on the ribbon.  

### To select or clear nodes in an XML schema  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **XML Schema Viewer**, and then choose the related link.  

2. Fill the fields on the header as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**XML Schema Code**|Specify the XML schema file that you loaded in step 5 in the "To load an XML schema file" section.|  
    |**New XMLport No.**|Specify the number of the XMLport that is created from this XML schema when you choose the **Generate XMLport** action.|  

     The lines are now filled with nodes representing all elements in the XML schema. Nodes for elements that are mandatory according to the XML schema are selected by default.  

3. On the first line, in the **Node Name** column, expand the **Document** node, and then gradually expand underlying nodes that you want to review.  

     Alternatively, right-click on a node and then choose **Expand All**.  

4. Choose either of the following actions to change which nodes are displayed.  

    |**Action**|Description|  
    |----------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Show All**|All nodes are shown.|  
    |**Hide Non-Mandatory**|Only nodes representing elements that are required according to the XML schema are shown. These nodes are typically indicated by a **1** in the **MinOccurs** field.<br /><br /> Choose **Show All** to reverse the view.|  
    |**Hide Non-Selected**|Only nodes where the **Selected** check box is selected are shown.<br /><br /> Choose **Show All** to reverse the view.|  

5. Choose the **Edit** action.  

6. In the **Selected** check box, specify for each node if you want the element to be supported in the data exchange definition for the related SEPA bank file.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  When you select a mandatory child node, all parent nodes above it are also selected.  

7. Choose the **Select All Mandatory Elements** action to reselect all nodes that represent elements that are mandatory according to the XML schema.  

8. Choose the **Deselect All** action to clear all selections.  

     The **Choice** field specifies that the node has two or more sibling nodes that function as options.  

### To generate a data exchange definition that is based on an XML schema  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter  **XML Schemas**, and then choose the related link.  

2. Select the relevant XML schema, and then choose the **Open XML Schema Viewer** action.  

3. Make sure the relevant nodes are selected. For more information, see the "To select or clear nodes in an XML schema" section.  

4. On the **XML Schema Viewer** page, choose the **Generate Data Exchange Definition** action.  

 A data exchange definition is created on the **Posting Exchange Definition** page, which you can complete by specifying which elements in the file map to which fields in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For more information, see [Set Up Data Exchange Definitions](across-how-to-set-up-data-exchange-definitions.md).  

> [!NOTE]  
> You can also use the **Get File Structure** function from the **Posting Exchange Definition** page, which uses the functionality of the **XML Schema Viewer** page to prefill the **Column Definitions** TastTab.  

> [!NOTE]
> In 2019 release wave 1 and earlier versions, you could generate an XMLport that was based on the schema and then import that into your solution. This is no longer supported.

# Assign permissions to users and groups

[!INCLUDE [2023rw1-sec-group-long](includes/2023rw1-sec-group-long.md)]

The [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] security system controls which objects a user can access within each database or environment, in combination with the user's license. For each user you can specify whether they're able to read, modify, or enter data in database objects. For more information, see [Data Security](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/security/data-security?tabs=object-level) in the developer and administration content for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

Before you assign permissions to users and user groups, you must define who can sign in by creating users according to their license. For more information, see [Create Users According to Licenses](ui-how-users-permissions.md).

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], there are two levels of permissions to database objects:

- Overall permissions according to the license, also referred to as the entitlement.

  The licenses include default permission sets. Starting in 2022 release wave 1, admins can customize these default permissions for the relevant license types. For more information, see [Configure permissions based on licenses](ui-how-users-permissions.md#licensespermissions).  

- Detailed permissions that you assign in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

This article describes how to define, use, and apply permissions in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to change the default configuration.  

[!INCLUDE [admin-gdap-users](includes/admin-gdap-users.md)]  
For more information, see [Delegated administrator access to Business Central Online](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/delegated-admin).  

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online includes default user groups that are assigned to users automatically based on their license. You can change the default configuration by modifying or adding security groups, permission sets, and permissions. The following table outlines key scenarios for modifying the default permissions.

> [!NOTE]
> An broader way to define which features users have access to is by setting the **Experience** field on the **Company Information** page. For more information, see [Change Which Features are Displayed](ui-experiences.md).
>
> You can also define the features that are available to users in the user interface and how they interact with them through pages. You do this through profiles that you assign to different types of users according to their job role or department. For more information, see [Manage Profiles](admin-users-profiles-roles.md) and [Customizing [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]](ui-customizing-overview.md).

## Create a permission set

> [!NOTE]
> In 2022 release wave 2 we made it easier to add permissions to permission sets. Rather than adding permissions individually, you can add entire permission sets. If needed, you can then exclude individual permissions in them. For more information, see [To add other permission sets](#to-add-other-permission-sets). To make that possible, we replaced the Permission Set page with a new one. The key differences are the new **Permission Sets** and **Results** panes, and the **Included permissions** FactBox. To continue using the replaced Permissions page, on the **Permission Sets** page, choose the **Permissions (legacy)** action.

Maintenance is also easier. When you add a system permission, your user-defined permission set will be automatically updated with any changes that Microsoft makes to those permissions.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Permission Sets**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action.
3. On the new line, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
4. Choose the **Permissions** action.
5. On the **Permission Set** page, in the **Type** field, include or exclude permissions to the object as follows:

  To include the permission, choose **Include**, and then choose level of access to give in the **Read Permission**, **Insert Permission**, **Modify Permission**, **Delete Permission**, and **Execute Permission** fields. The following table describes the options.

  |Option|Description|Ranking|
  |------|-----------|-------|
  |**Blank**|The user can't perform the action on the object.|Lowest|  
  |**Yes**|The user can perform the action on the object.|Highest|
  |**Indirect**|The user can perform the action on the object, but only through another related object that the user has full access to. For more information, see [Example - Indirect Permission](#example---indirect-permission) in this article, and [Permissions Property](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/properties/devenv-permissions-property#example---indirect-permission) in Developer and IT-Pro Help.|Second highest|
  
  To exclude the permission, or one or more access levels, choose **Exclude**, and then choose the level of access to give. The following table describes the options.

  |Option|Description|
  |------|-----------|-------|
  |**Blank**|Use the access level based on the hierarchy of permissions in the set.  |
  |**Exclude**|Remove the specific access level for the object.|
  |**Reduce to indirect**|Change the access level to Indirect if any permission sets give Direct access to the object. For example, choose this option if the permission set gives Direct access to G/L entries but you don't want users to have full access to the entries.|
  
  > [!NOTE]
  > If a permission is in a permission set that is included, and is also in a permission set that is excluded, the permission will be excluded.

6. Use the **Object Type** and **Object ID** fields to specify the object you're giving access to.

  > [!TIP]
  > New lines show default values. For example, the **Object Type** field contains **Table Data**, and the **Object ID** field contains **0**. The default values are just placeholders, and aren't used. You must choose a type of object and an object in the **Object ID** field before you can create another new line.

7. Optional: If you're defining permissions for a Table Data object type, in the **Security Filter** field you can filter the data that a user can access in fields on the selected table. For example, you might want to let a user access only records that contain information about a particular customer. For more information, see [Security filters limit a user's access to specific records in a table](#security-filters-limit-a-users-access-to-specific-records-in-a-table) and [Using Security Filters](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/security/security-filters).
8. Optional: On the **Permission Sets** pane, add one or more other permission sets. For more information, see [To add other permission sets](#to-add-other-permission-sets).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Use caution when assigning **Insert Permission** or **Modify Permission** to the **9001 User Group Member** or **9003 User Group Permission Set** table. Any users assigned to the permission set could potentially assign themselves to other user groups, which in turn might give them unintended permissions.

### Example - Indirect Permission

You can assign Indirect permission to allow a user to use an object, but only through another object. For example, a user has permission to run codeunit 80, Sales-Post. The Sales-Post codeunit performs many tasks, including modifying table 37, Sales Line. When the user posts a sales document using the Sales-Post codeunit, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] checks whether the user has permission to modify the Sales Line table. If not, the codeunit can't complete its tasks, and the user receives an error message. If so, the codeunit runs successfully.

However, the user doesn't need to have full access to the Sales Line table to run the codeunit. If the user has Indirect permission for the Sales Line table, the Sales-Post codeunit runs successfully. When a user has Indirect permission, they can only modify the Sales Line table by running the Sales-Post codeunit or another object that has permission to modify the Sales Line table. The user can only modify the Sales Line table when doing so from supported application areas. The user can't run the feature inadvertently or maliciously by other methods.

### To add other permission sets

Expand a permission set by adding other permission sets to it. Afterward, you can include or exclude specific permissions, or entire permission sets, in each set you add. This includes permissions in the Extension and System type permission sets, which otherwise isn't allowed. Exclusions apply only to the permission set you're expanding. The original set isn't affected.

On the **Permission Set** page, add a permission set on the **Permission Sets** pane. The **Result** pane lists all added permission sets. To explore the permissions that are included in a set you've added, choose the set on the Result pane and the **Included permissions** FactBox will show the permissions.

On the **Result** pane, use the **Inclusion Status** field to identify the permission sets in which you've excluded permissions or permission sets. If something's been excluded, the status will be **Partial**.

For an overall view of permissions in the permission set, choose the **View all permissions** action. The **Expanded Permissions** page shows all permissions that were already assigned to the permission set and the permissions in the added permission sets.

To fully exclude all permissions from a permission set, on the **Result** pane, select the line, choose **Show more options**, and then choose **Exclude**. When you exclude a permission set, a line is created on the **Permission Sets** pane of the type Excluded. If you've excluded a permission set, but want to include it again, delete the line on the **Permission Sets** pane.

To fully or partially exclude a specific permission in a set you've added, under **Permissions**, create a line for the object. The access level fields, Insert Permission, Modify Permission, and so on, will all contain **Exclude**. To allow a certain access level, choose the appropriate option.

Excluding a permission set excludes all of the permissions in the set. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates permissions as follows:

1. Calculate the full list of included permissions
2. Calculate the full list of excluded permissions
3. Remove excluded permissions from the list of included permissions (removing an indirect permission is the same as Reduce to Indirect)

## Copy a permission set

Create a new permission set by copying another. The new set will include all of the permissions and permission sets from the set you copied. How the permissions and permission sets are arranged in the new permission set differs, depending on your choice in the **Copy operation** field. The following table describes the options.

|Option  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|**Copy by reference**     | The original permission set and all of the permission sets that were added to it are listed on the **Results** pane.       |
|**Flat permission copy**  | All permissions from all permission sets are included in a flat list on the **Permissions pane**. Permissions are not organized by permission set.        |
|**Clone**     | Create an exact copy of the original permission set.        |

1. On the **Permission Sets** page, select the line for a permission set that you want to copy, and then choose the **Copy Permission Set** action.
2. On the **Copy Permission Set** page, specify the name of the new permission set.
3. In the **Copy operation** field, specify how to arrange permission in the new permission set.
4. Optional: If you're adding a System permission set, you might want to be notified if the name or content of the original permission set changes in a future version. This lets you consider whether to update your user-defined permission set. To receive a notification, turn on the **Notify on Changed Permission Set** toggle.

> [!NOTE]
> The notification requires that the **Original System permission set changed** notification is enabled on the **My Notifications** page.

## Create or modify permissions by recording your actions

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Permission Sets**, and then choose the related link.

    Alternatively, on the **Users** page, choose the **Permission Sets** action.
2. On the **Permission Sets** page, choose the **New** Action.
3. On a new line, fill in the fields as necessary.
4. Choose the **Permissions** action.
5. On the **Permissions** page, choose the **Record Permissions** action, and then choose the **Start** action.  
    Recording must be done either by using the **Open this page in a new windows** (pop-out) feature to have the **Permissions** recording window side-by-side, or by working within the same tab.  
    A recording process now starts and captures all of your actions in the user interface.
6. Go to the various pages and activities in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] that you want users with this permission set to access. You must carry out the tasks that you want to record permissions for.
7. When you want to finish the recording, return to the **Permissions** page, and then choose the **Stop** action.
8. Choose the **Yes** button to add the recorded permissions to the new permission set.
9. For each object in the recorded list, specify whether users are able to insert, modify, or delete records in the recorded tables.

### To export and import a permission set

To quickly set up permissions, you can import permission sets that you exported from another [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] tenant.

In multi-tenant environments, a permission set will be imported into a specific tenant. In other words, the scope of the import is *Tenant*.

1. In tenant 1, on the **Permission Sets** page, select the line or lines for the permission sets to export, and then choose the **Export Permission Sets** action.

    An XML file is created in the download folder on your machine. By default, the name is *Export Permission Sets.xml*.

2. In tenant 2, on the **Permission Sets** page, select the **Import Permission Sets** action.
3. On the **Import Permission Sets** dialog page, consider if you want to merge existing permission sets with any new permission sets in the XML file.

    If you select the **Update existing permissions** checkbox, existing permission sets that match names in the XML file will be merged with the imported permission sets.

    If you don't select the **Update existing permissions** checkbox, permission sets that match names in the XML file will be skipped during import. In that case, you'll be notified about permission sets that are skipped.

4. From the **Import** dialog page, find and select the XML file to be imported, and then choose the **Open** action.

The permission sets are imported.

## Remove obsolete permissions from all permission sets

On the **Permission Sets** page, choose the **Remove Obsolete Permissions** action.

## Set up time constraints for users

Administrators can define periods of time during which specified users are able to post. Administrators can also specify if the system logs how much time users are signed in. Similarly, administrators can assign responsibility centers to users. For more information, see [Work with Responsibility Centers](inventory-responsibility-centers.md).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **User Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **User Setup** page opens, choose the **New** action.
3. In the **User ID** field, enter the ID of a user, or choose the field to see all current Windows users in the system.
4. Fill in the fields as necessary.

## Control access to specific companies

When you have multiple companies in Business Central, managing permissions across companies requires extra consideration. You might not want users to have identical access rights to all companies. Instead, you may need to grant users' permissions based on their company affiliations. To support this scenario, when you assign permission sets to individual users or security groups, you have the option to select a specific company to which the permission set applies. The company isn't explicitly specified within the permission set, but rather when the permission set is assigned to the user or security group.

If you don't specify the company when assigning a permission set, the permission set then applies to all companies. If you want a permission set to apply to more than one company, but not all companies, add the permission set specifically for each company separately.

Learn how at [Assign permission sets to users](#assign-permission-sets-to-users) or [Assign permissions to a security group](ui-security-groups.md#assign-permissions-to-a-security-group).

## Manage permissions through user groups

User groups help you manage permission sets across the company. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online includes default user groups that are assigned to users automatically based on their license. You can add users manually to a user group, and you can create new user groups as copies of existing ones.  

You start by creating a user group. Then you assign permission sets to the group to define which object users of the group can access. When you add user to the group, the permission sets defined for the group will apply to the user.

Permission sets assigned to a user through a user group stay synchronized. A change to the user group permissions is automatically propagated to the users. If you remove a user from a user group, the involved permissions are automatically revoked.

### To add users to a user group

The following procedure explains how to create user groups manually. To create user groups automatically, see [To copy a user group and all its permission sets](#to-copy-a-user-group-and-all-its-permission-sets).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **User Groups**, and then choose the related link.

    1. Alternatively, on the **Users** page, choose the **User Groups** action.
2. On the **User Group** page, choose the **User Group Members** action.
3. On the **User Group Members** page, choose the **Add Users** action.

### To copy a user group and all its permission sets

To quickly define a new user group, you can copy all permission sets from an existing user group to your new user group.

> [!NOTE]
> The user group members are not copied to the new user group. You must add them manually afterwards. For more information, see the [To add users to a user group](#to-add-users-to-a-user-group) section.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **User Groups**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the user group that you want to copy, and then choose the **Copy User Group** action.
3. In the **New User Group Code** field, enter a name for the group, and then choose the **OK** button.

The new user group is added to the **User Groups** page. Proceed to add users. For more information, see the [To add users to a user group](#to-add-users-to-a-user-group) section.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You'll get a validation error if you're trying to assign a user group to the user that refers to a permission set which was defined in an uninstalled extension. It's because the App ID of the extension is validated whenever it's referenced. To assign that user group to a user, you can either re-install the extension, remove the reference of the uninstalled extension from the permission set, or remove that permission set from the user group.

### To assign permission sets to user groups

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **User Groups**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the user group that you want to assign permission to.  

    Any permission sets that are already assigned to the user are displayed in the **Permission Sets** FactBox.
3. Choose the **User Permission Sets** action to open the **User Permission Sets** page.
4. On the **User Permission Sets** page, on a new line, fill in the fields as necessary.

### To assign a permission set on the Permission Set by User Group page

The following procedure explains how to assign permission sets to a user group on the **Permission Set by User Group** page.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Users**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Users** page, select the relevant user, and then choose the **Permission Set by User Group** action.
3. On the **Permission Set by User Group** page, select the **[user group name]** field on a line for the relevant permission set to assign the set to the user group.
4. Select the **All User Groups** checkbox to assign the permission set to all user groups.

You can also assign permissions sets directly to a user.

## Assign permission sets to users

A permission set is a collection of permissions for specific database objects. All users must be assigned one or more permission sets before they can access [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

A [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] solution contains predefined permission sets that are added by Microsoft or by your solution provider. You can also add new permission sets tailored to meet the needs of your organization. For more information, see the [Create a permission set](#create-a-permission-set) section.

> [!NOTE]
> If you do not want to restrict a user's access more than already defined by the license, you can assign a special permission set called SUPER to the user. This permission set ensures that the user can access all objects specified in the license.
>
> A user with the Essential license and the SUPER permission set has access to more functionality than users with the Team Member license and the SUPER permission set.

You can assign permissions sets to users in two ways:

- From the **User Card** page by selecting permission sets to assign to the user.
- From the **Permission Set by User** page by selecting users that a permission set is assigned to.

### To assign a permission set on a user card

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Users**, and then choose the related link.
1. Select the user that you want to assign permission to.

   Any permission sets that are already assigned to the user are displayed in the **Permission Sets** FactBox.
1. Choose the **Edit** action to open the **User Card** page.
1. On the **User Permission Sets** FastTab, on a new line, fill in the fields as necessary. For more information, see [Create or edit a permission set](ui-define-granular-permissions.md#create-a-permission-set).

   If you want the permission set to apply to a specific company, set the **Company** field to that company. If you want the permission set to apply to all companies, leave the **Company** field blank. [Learn more](#control-access-to-specific-companies).

## To assign a permission set on the Permission Set by User page

This method makes it easier for you to assign different permission sets to multiple users. 

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Users**, and then choose the related link.
1. On the **Users** page, choose the **Permission Set by User** action.
1. If you want the permission sets to apply only to a specific company, set the **Company name** field to that company. If you want the permission set to apply to all companies, leave the **Company name** field blank. [Learn more](#control-access-to-specific-companies).
1. On the **Permission Set by User** page, select the **[user name]** checkbox on a line for the relevant permission set to assign the set to the user.

    Select the **All Users** checkbox to assign the permission set to all users.

## Get an overview of a user's permissions

You can view other users' effective permissions only if you're assigned to the SECURITY or SUPER permissions. 

The **Effective Permissions** page offers additional information about the source of each permission. For example, whether the source is a security group, or a permission is inherited. The page also contains a column where administrators can review the security filters that are applied. To learn more about security filters, go to [Security filters limit a user's access to specific records in a table](#security-filters-limit-a-users-access-to-specific-records-in-a-table).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Users**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the card of the relevant user.
3. Choose the **Effective Permissions** action.

    The **Permissions** part lists all the database objects that the user has access to. You can't edit this section.

    The **By Permission Set** part shows the assigned permission sets through which the permissions are granted to the user, the source and type of the permission set, and to which extent the different access types are permitted.

    For each row that you select in the **Permissions** section, the **By Permission Set** section shows which permission set or sets that the permission is granted through. In this section, you can edit the value in each of the five access type fields, **Read Permission**, **Insert Permission**, **Modify Permission**, **Delete Permission**, **Execute Permission**.

    > [!NOTE]  
    > Only permission sets of type **User-Defined** can be edited.
    >
    > Rows of source Entitlement originate from the subscription license. The permission values of the entitlement overrule values in other permission sets if they have a higher ranking. A value in a non-entitlement permission set that has a higher ranking than the related value in the entitlement will be surrounded by brackets to indicate that it is not effective as it is overruled by the entitlement.
    >
    > For an explanation of ranking, see [Create a permission set](ui-define-granular-permissions.md#create-a-permission-set).  

4. To edit a permission set, in the **By Permission Set** part, on the line for a relevant permission set of type **User-Defined**, choose one of the five access type fields and select a different value.

5. To edit individual permissions within the permission set, choose the value in the **Permission Set** field to open the **Permissions** page.

> [!NOTE]  
> When you edit a permission set, the changes will also apply to other users that have the permission set assigned.

### Security filters limit a user's access to specific records in a table

For record-level security in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], use security filters to limit a user's access to data in a table. You create security filters on table data. A security filter describes a set of records in a table that a user has permission to access. You can specify, for example, that a user can only read the records that contain information about a particular customer. In this way, the user can't access the records that contain information about other customers. For more information, see [Using Security Filters](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/security/security-filters) in the administration content.


## View permission changes telemetry

You can set up [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to send changes that are done to permission to an Application Insights resource in Microsoft Azure. Then, using Azure Monitor, you create reports and set up alerts on the gathered data. For more information, see the following articles in the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Developer and admin help:

- [Monitoring and Analyzing Telemetry - Enabling Application Insights](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/telemetry-overview#enable)

# Track Relations Between Demand and Supply

From any supply or demand document in the so-called order network, you can track the order demand (tracked quantity), forecast, blanket sales order, or planning parameter (untracked quantity) that has given rise to the planning line in question.

The planning worksheets also offers supporting planning information about non-order entities to help the planner obtain an optimal supply plan. For more information, see [Untracked Planning Elements](production-how-track-demand-supply.md#untracked-planning-elements).

## To track linked items
Order tracking shows how sales orders, production orders, and purchase orders are related to the manufacturing order through the planning and reservation systems.

The following describes how to track linked items on a firm planned production order. The steps are similar for all other order types, and from planning worksheet lines.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Firm Planned Prod. Order**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the relevant firm planned production order from the list.
3. On the **Lines** FastTab, choose the **Functions** action, and then choose the **Order Tracking** action.

The lines in the **Order Tracking** display the documents that are related to the current production order line.

## Untracked Planning Elements
The **Untracked Planning Elements** page opens when you choose the **Untracked Qty.** field on the **order Planning** page. It serves two purposes:

1. To hold information about untracked quantities displayed when the user looks up from the Order Tracking page to see untracked quantities.
2. To hold warning messages displayed when the user chooses the **Warning** icon on the **Planning Worksheet** page.

The page contains entries which account for an untracked surplus quantity in order tracking network. These entries are generated during the planning run and explain where the untracked surplus quantity in the order tracking lines came from. This untracked surplus can come from:

- Production forecast
- Blanket orders
- Safety stock quantity
- Reorder point
- Maximum inventory
- Reorder quantity
- Maximum order quantity
- Minimum order quantity
- Order multiple
- Dampener (% of lot size)

# Create Sales Opportunities
You can create opportunities for the sales opportunities you have on your contacts. All opportunities must be assigned to a salesperson or purchaser and must have a contact.

You can create opportunities from the **Opportunity List** page. But you typically will create opportunities from the specific contact or salespeople.

Before you can create opportunities, you must set up opportunity sales cycles. For more information see [Set Up Opportunity Sales Cycles and Stages](marketing-how-setup-opportunity-sales-cycles-stages.md).

## To create an opportunity from a salesperson
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Salespeople**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the salesperson from the list for whom you want to create an opportunity.
3. Choose the **Opportunities** action, and then choose **List**.
4. Choose **New**, and then fill in the fields as relevant. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  



## To create an opportunity from a contact
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Contacts**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the contact from the list for whom you want to create an opportunity.
3. Do one of the following:
   * Choose the **Create Opportunity** action.
   * Choose the  **Opportunities** action, and then choose **New**.
4. Fill in the relevant fields.

# Synchronizing data in Business Central with Microsoft Dataverse

When you integrate [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can decide whether to synchronize data in selected fields of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] (such as customers, contacts, and sales people) with equivalent rows in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] (such as accounts, contacts, and users). Depending on the type of row, you can synchronize data from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], or vice versa. For more information, see [Integrating with Dynamics 365 Sales](admin-prepare-dynamics-365-for-sales-for-integration.md).  

Synchronization uses the following elements:

* Integration table mappings
* Integration field mappings
* Synchronization rules
* Coupled records

When synchronization is set up you can couple [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] records to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] rows to synchronize their data. You can start a synchronization manually, or based on a schedule. The following table provides an overview of the ways you can synchronize.  

|  Type  |  Method  |  See  |  
|--------|----------|-------|  
|Manual synchronization|Synchronize on a row-by-row basis.<br /><br /> You can synchronize individual records in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], such as a customer, with a corresponding [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] row, such as an account. This is typically how users will work with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] data in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].|[Couple and Synchronize Records Manually](admin-manual-synchronization-of-table-mappings.md#synchronize-individual-table-mappings)|  
|  |Synchronize on a table mapping basis.<br /><br /> You can synchronize all records in a [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] table with an table [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] table.|[Synchronize Individual Table Mappings](admin-manual-synchronization-of-table-mappings.md#synchronize-individual-table-mappings)|  
||Synchronize all modified records for all table mappings.<br /><br /> You can synchronize all of the records that have been modified in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] tables since the last synchronization.|[Synchronizing All Modified Records](admin-manual-synchronization-of-table-mappings.md#synchronizing-all-modified-records)|
||Full synchronization of all data for all table mappings.<br /><br /> You can synchronize all of the data in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] tables that are mapped, and create new records or rows in the destination solution for uncoupled records in the source solution.<br /><br /> Full synchronization synchronizes all data and ignores coupling. Typically, you do a full synchronization when you set up the integration and only one of solutions contains data. A full synchronization can also be useful in a demonstration environment.|[Run a Full Synchronization](admin-manual-synchronization-of-table-mappings.md#run-a-full-synchronization)|  
|Scheduled synchronization|Synchronize all changes to data for all table mappings.<br /><br /> You can synchronize [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] on scheduled intervals by setting up jobs in the job queue.|[Schedule a Synchronization](admin-scheduled-synchronization-using-the-synchronization-job-queue-entries.md)|  

> [!NOTE]
> The synchronization between [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is based on the scheduled execution of job queue entries and does not guarantee real time data consistency between two services. For real time data conistency you should explore [Business Central Virtual Tables](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/powerplatform/powerplat-overview) or Business Central APIs.   

## Standard table mapping for synchronization

Tables in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)], such as accounts, are integrated with equivalent types of tables in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], such as customers. To work with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] data you set up links, called couplings, between tables in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)].

The following table lists the standard mapping between tables in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)].

> [!TIP]
> You can reset configuration changes made to integration table and field mappings to their default settings by selecting the mappings, and then choosing **Use Default Synchronization Setup**.

| [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] | [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] | Synchronization Direction | Default Filter |
|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------|----------------|
| Salesperson/Purchaser | User | [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] -> [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] | [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] contact filter: **Status** is **No**, **User Licensed** is **Yes**, Integration user mode is **No** |
| Customer | Account | [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] -> [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] -> [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] | [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] account filter: **Relationship Type** is **Customer** and **Status** is **Active**. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] filter: **Blocked** is blank (Customer is not blocked). |
| Vendor | Account | [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] -> [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] -> [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] | [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] account filter: **Relationship Type** is **Vendor** and **Status** is **Active**. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] filter: **Blocked** is blank (Vendor is not blocked). |
| Contact | Contact | [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] -> [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] -> [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] | [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] contact filter: **Type** is **Person** and the contact is assigned to a company. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] contact filter: The contact is assigned to a company and the parent customer type is **Customer**. |
| Currency | Transaction Currency | [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] -> [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] |  |

> [!NOTE]
> The **Dataverse** actions will not be available on pages, for example, the Customer Card page, for records that do not respect the table filter on the integration table mapping.

### Tip for admins: viewing table mappings

You can view the mapping between the tables in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on the **Integration Table Mappings** page, where you can also apply filters. You define the mapping between the fields in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] tables and the columns in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] tables on the **Integration Field Mapping** page, where you can add additional mapping logic. For example, this can be useful if you need to troubleshoot synchronization.

## Use virtual tables to get more data

When you're setting up your integration, you can use virtual tables to make more data available in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)], without help from a developer.

A virtual table is a custom table that has columns and rows that contain data from an external data source, such as [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The columns and rows in a virtual table look like a regular table, however, the data isn't stored in a physical table in the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] database. Instead, the data is retrieved at runtime.

> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] contains objects that are also called virtual tables. Those table objects are not related to the virtual tables that you use with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)].

To learn more about virtual tables, go to the following articles:

* [Create and edit virtual tables that contain data from an external data source](/power-apps/maker/data-platform/create-edit-virtual-entities) (Power Apps documentation)
* [Business Central Virtual Table for Microsoft Dataverse Admin Reference](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/powerplatform/powerplat-admin-reference) ([!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] documentation)

To use virtual tables, you must install the **Business Central Virtual Entity** app from [AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-US/product/dynamics-365/microsoftdynsmb.businesscentral_virtualentity). 

After you install the app, you can enable virtual tables from one of the following pages in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]:

* When you run the **Set up Dataverse connection** assisted setup guide, you can use the **Dataverse Available Virtual Tables** page to select multiple virtual tables. Afterward, the tables are available in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] and the PowerApps Maker Portal. 
* From the **Dataverse Connection Setup**, **Virtual Tables**, and **Available Virtual Tables** pages.  
* From the Power App Maker Portal.

## Synchronize data from multiple companies or environments

You can synchronize data from multiple [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] companies or environments with a [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] environment. In multi-company synchronization scenarios, there are several things to consider.

### Set company IDs

When you synchronize records, we set a company ID on the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] entity to clarify the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] company the records came from. Integration table mappings have integration table filter fields that take the company ID into account. To include a table mapping in a multi-company setup, on the **Integration Table Mapping** page, choose the **Multi-Company Synchronization Enabled** checkbox. The setting optimizes how integration table filter fields filter company IDs in a multi-company setup.

For integration table mappings that synchronize documents, such as orders, quotes, and opportunities, if you choose the **Multi-Company Synchronization Enabled** checkbox the integration only considers entities that have the company ID of the current [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] company. To synchronize documents, for example, between Business Central and Sales, users in Sales must specify the company ID on the documents. Otherwise, the documents won't synchronize.  

For all other integration table mappings, choosing the **Multi-Company Synchronization Enabled** checkbox removes the filter on company ID. The synchronization will consider related entities, regardless of their company ID.

### Specify the synchronization direction

If you enable multi-company support on an integration table mapping, we recommend that you set the direction of the mapping to **FromIntegration**. If you set the direction to **ToIntegration** or **Bidirectional**, it's a good idea to use **Table Filter** and **Integration Table Filter** to control which entities synchronize with which company. It's also a good idea to use match-based coupling to avoid creating duplicate records. To learn more about match-based coupling, go to [Customize the match-based coupling](/dynamics365/business-central/admin-how-to-set-up-a-dynamics-crm-connection#customize-the-match-based-coupling).

### Use unique numbers

If your number series doesn't guarantee that primary key values are unique to each company, we recommend that you use prefixes. To start using prefixes, create a transformation rule on the integration field mapping. To learn more about transformation rules, go to [Handle differences in field values](admin-how-to-modify-table-mappings-for-synchronization.md#handle-differences-in-field-values).

# Data ownership models for synchronization

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] requires that you specify an owner for the data you store. For more information, see [Types of tables](/powerapps/maker/data-platform/types-of-entities) in the Power Apps documentation. When you set up integration between [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] you must choose the **User or team** ownership for records that are synchronized. Actions that can be performed on these records can be controlled on a user level. <!--We recommend the Team ownership model because it makes it easier to manage ownership for multiple people.NO LONGER TRUE IN DATAVERSE-->

## Team Ownership
In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], a company is a legal and business table that offers ways to secure and visualize business data. Users always work in the context of a company. The closest that [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] comes to this concept is the business unit table, which does not have legal or business implications.

Because business units lack legal and business implications, you cannot force a one-to-one (1:1) mapping to synchronize data between a company and a business unit, either one-way or bi-directional. To make synchronization possible, when you enable synchronization for a company in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the following happens in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)]:

* We create a company table that is equivalent to the company table in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The name of the company is suffixed with "BC Company ID." For example, Cronus International Ltd. (93555b1a-af3e-ea11-bb35-000d3a492db1).
* We create a default business unit that has the same name as the company. For example, Cronus International Ltd. (93555b1a-af3e-ea11-bb35-000d3a492db1).
* We create separate owner team with the same name as the company and associate it with the business unit. The name of the team is prefixed with "BCI -." For example, BCI - Cronus International Ltd. (93555b1a-af3e-ea11-bb35-000d3a492db1).
* Records that are created and synchronized to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] are assigned to the "BCI Owner" team that is linked to the business unit.

> [!NOTE]
> If you rename a company in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the names of the company, business, and team that we create automatically in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] are not updated. Because only the company ID is used for integration, this does not affect synchronization. If you want the names to match you must update the company, business unit, and team in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)].

The following image shows an example of this data setup in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)].

![The root business unit is on top, the teams are in the center, and then the companies are at the bottom.](media/cds_bu_team_company.png)

In this configuration, records that are related to the Cronus US company will be owned by a team that is linked to the Cronus US business unit in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)]. Users who can access that business unit through a security role that is set to business unit–level visibility in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] can now see those records. The following example shows how to use teams to provide access to those records.

* The Sales Manager role is assigned to members of the Cronus US Sales team.
* Users who have the Sales Manager role can access account records for members of the same business unit.
* The Cronus US Sales team is linked to the Cronus US business unit that was mentioned earlier. Members of the Cronus US Sales team can see any account that is owned by the Cronus US user, which would have come from the Cronus US company table in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

However, the 1:1 mapping between business unit, company, and team is just a starting point, as shown in the following image.

![The security role controls data visibility.](media/cds_bu_team_company_2.png)

In this example, a new EUR (Europe) root business unit is created in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] as the parent for both Cronus DE (Gernamy) and Cronus ES (Spain). The EUR business unit is not related to synchronization. However, it can give members of the EUR Sales team access to account data in both Cronus DE and Cronus ES by setting the data visibility to **Parent/Child BU** on the associated security role in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)].

Synchronization determines which team should own records. This is controlled by the **Default owning team** field on the BCI row. When a BCI record is enabled for synchronization we automatically create the associated business unit and owner team (if it doesn't already exist), and set the **Default owning team** field. When synchronization is enabled for an table, administrators can change the owning team, but a team must always be assigned.

> [!NOTE]
> Records become read-only after a company is added and saved, so be sure to choose the correct company.

## Choosing a different business unit
You can change the business unit selection if you are using the Teams ownership model. If you use the Person ownership model, the default business unit is always selected. 

If you choose another business unit, for example, one that you created earlier in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)], it will keep its original name. That is, it will not be suffixed with the company ID. We will create a team that does use the naming convention.

When changing a business unit, you can choose only the business units that are one level below the root business unit.

## Person Ownership
If you choose the Person ownership model you must specify each salesperson who will own new records. The business unit and team are created as described in the [Team Ownership](admin-cds-company-concept.md#team-ownership) section.

The default business unit is used when the Person ownership model is chosen, and you cannot choose another business unit. The team that is associated with the default business unit will own records for common tables, such as the Product table, that are not related to specific salespersons.

When you couple salespersons in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to users in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)], [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will add the user to the default team in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)]. You can verify that users are added by looking at the **Default Team Member** column on the **Users - Common Data Service** page. If the user is not added, you can add them manually by using the **Add Coupled Users to Team** action. For more information, see [Synchronizing Data in Business Central with Dataverse](admin-synchronizing-business-central-and-sales.md).

# Set Up a Colored Indicator on Cues for the Company or Individual Users

As an administrator, you can set up Cues that appear on the users' Role Centers to include an indicator that changes color based on the data values in the Cues.  

The indicator appears as a colored bar along the top border of the Cue tile. It provides a visual signal of the status of the Cue's activity, which can indicate favorable or unfavorable conditions to prompt the user to take action. For example, if a Cue displays ongoing sales invoices, you can set up the indicator to appear green (favorable) when total number of ongoing sales invoices is below 10, and appears red (unfavorable) when the total is greater than 20.  

From the **Cue Setup** page, you set up indicators for all the Cues that are available in the company database. You can set up the indicators to apply to all users in the company or an individual user only. The indicator settings on the **Cue Setup** page act as the default indicator settings. If the **Cue Setup End User** page is made available to users, then they can personalize the indicators settings that you define on the **Cue Setup** page.  

To set up the indicator, you specify up to two threshold values that define three ranges of data values (low, middle, and high) to which you can apply a different color (or style).  

### To set up colored indicators on Cues  
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Cue Setup**, and then choose the related link.  

     The **Cue Setup** page appears. The page lists the indicators that are currently setup up on Cues. Indicators that apply to all users in the company have a blank **User Name** field. Indicators that apply to a specific user include the user's name in the **User Name** field.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  If you set up a company-wide indicator and a user modifies the indicator later on, then a separate entry for the indicator appears in list for that user.  

2. Choose **Edit List** action.  
3. To set up an indicator for a Cue that is not listed on the page, choose the **New** action, and then fill in the fields as described in the following. If you want to modify an existing indicator, go to the next step.  

    |  Field  |  Description  |    
    |---------|---------------|  
    |**User Name**|If you want to set up the indicator for all users, leave this field blank.<br /><br /> If you want to set up the indicator for a specific user, then set this field to the user name.|  
    |**Table No**|Specifies the ID of the table object that contains the Cue. Use the drop down list to find the table. The drop down list includes all Cue tables in the company database.<br /><br /> The **Table Name** field will be automatically filled in based on your selection.|  
    |**Field No**|Specifies the ID of the Cue that you want to set up an indicator on. Use the drop down list to find the Cue that you want. **Note:**  The Cue ID corresponds to the field number that is assigned to the Cue in the table. <br /><br /> The **Field Name** field is automatically filled in based on your selection|  

4. To set up the indicator for a Cue, set the fields as described in the following table.  

    |  Field  |  Description  |    
    |---------|---------------|  
    |**LowStyle**|Specifies the color of the indicator when the Cue's value is below the value of the **Threshold 1** field.|  
    |**LowThreshold**|Specifies the value at or above which the indicator changes to the color specified by the **Middle Range Style** field.|  
    |**MiddleStyle**|Specifies the color of the indicator when Cue's value is greater than or equal to the value of the **Threshold 1** field but less than or equal to the value of the **Threshold 2** field.|  
    |**HighThreshold**|Specifies the value above which the indicator changes to the color specified by the **High Range Style** field.|  
    |**HighStyle**|Specifies the color to use when the Cue's value is above the value of the **Threshold 2** field.|  

     The following table lists the colors that correspond to the options of the **LowStyle**, **MiddleStyle**, and **HighStyle** fields.  

    |  Option  |  Color  |  
    |----------|---------|  
    |**None**|No color (same color as the Cue tile)|  
    |**Favorable**|Green|  
    |**Unfavorable**|Red|  
    |**Ambiguous**|Yellow|  
    |**Subordinate**|Gray|

# Correct prepayments

You can make a correction to an order after you have posted a prepayment invoice for the order. You can add new lines to an order after issuing a prepayment, and then you can post another prepayment invoice, but you can't delete a line from an order after a prepayment has been invoiced for the line.  

> [!TIP]
> If you have posted a prepayment invoice for a sales invoice that you then correct or cancel, you must correct or cancel the prepayment as well.

## To correct a prepayment

The following procedure shows how to issue a prepayment credit memo to cancel all invoiced prepayments for a sales order.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the relevant sales order.
3. Choose the **Prepayment** action, and then choose the **Post Prepayment Credit Memo** action or the **Post and Print Prepmt. Cr. Memo** action.  
4. On the **Sales Credit Memo** page, proceed to correct the relevant entries, as for any sales credit memo. For more information, see [Process Sales Returns or Cancellations](sales-how-process-sales-returns-cancellations.md).  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > To reduce the amount in the **Line Amount** field, you must first increase the prepayment percentage on the line so that the value in the **Prepmt. Line Amount** field is not decreased below the value in the **Prepmt. Amt. Inv.** field.

5. To make a prepayment invoice for any new lines in the sales credit memo, choose the **Prepayment** action, and then choose the **Post Prepayment Invoice** action or the **Post and Print Prepmt. Invoice** action.  
6. To issue an additional prepayment invoice, increase the prepayment amount on one or more lines and post the prepayment invoice. A new invoice will be created for the difference between the prepayment amounts invoiced and the new prepayment amounts.

# Azure OpenAI Service and Business Central data 

Copilot in Business Central uses AI from the Azure OpenAI Service, hosted and operated by Microsoft and built with enterprise-grade security, privacy, and compliance controls. This article explains the data that the service processes when you use Copilot.

## How Business Central communicates with Azure OpenAI Service

Each time you use Copilot, your inputs (prompts) and outputs (results), including any data needed for Copilot to perform the task, are sent to the Azure OpenAI Service endpoint.

- Each request to Copilot, such as a chat message or a request to match records, is converted to one or more service calls to the endpoint.
- Prompts, results, and data from any one call is never shared or accessible to other calls by other users of the service. Including business data with prompts improves the quality of Copilot responses by grounding them in the latest information from the Business Central database. Business Central selects this data and retrieves it using Business Central's standard mechanisms for data access, ensuring that Copilot can only access the same data as the user operating Copilot. Copilot has no way to circumvent Business Central’s security, privacy, and compliance controls.  
- User input and business data might include personal information, depending on the task.
- Prompt and output data might be stored for up to 24 hours to monitor for abuse, but Microsoft only reviews the data if the automated systems flag it for review.
- Microsoft doesn't use your data to train, retrain, or improve Azure OpenAI Service foundation models.

> [!NOTE]
> When administrators activate a Copilot feature or enable data movement to Azure OpenAI Service, the entire company database remains in its location:
>
> - It isn't transferred to the Azure OpenAI Service.
> - It isn't moved to another geographic region.
> - AI isn't trained on that data.  

## Example Copilot features and their data flow

For a high-level understanding of the data sent to Azure OpenAI Service, the following table provides three examples of how Business Central sends prompts and data to the service.

The table isn't an exhaustive list of features and doesn't provide a complete and accurate picture of every data point sent to the service.

|Copilot feature|Example of user interaction|Example of data sent to Azure OpenAI Service|
|-|-|-|
|Chat|User asks Copilot to "show customer Adatum" |<ul><li>System instructions to interpret and act on the user's message, including system-defined constraints and AI safeguards.</li><li>The list of most likely table and page names, the list of available field names for those objects, along with descriptive information such as teaching tips and tooltips.</li></ul>| 
|Analysis assist|While viewing the Items list, the user asks Copilot to display "items by category" |<ul><li>System instructions to generate an analysis tab, constraints, and AI safeguards.</li><li>The list of column captions from the Items list, along with tooltips and similar descriptive information.</li><li>If the list includes option fields with predefined values, the possible values are included</li></ul>|
|Bank account reconciliation assist|User activates the **Reconcile** Copilot action on the details page |<ul><li>System instructions to compare records, constraints, and AI safeguards.</li><li>The list of bank statement lines (transaction descriptions, dates, and amounts) that the user requested Copilot to process. Additionally, the minimal list of bank account ledger entry records or G/L account names they're compared with.</li></ul>|

# Work with Word Layouts

A Word report layout determines the content and format of a report when it is previewed and printed from Business Central. You create and modify these layouts using Microsoft Word.

[![Example of a word report layout document for Business Central.](media/word-layout.png)](media/word-layout.png#lightbox) 

When you modify a Word report layout, you specify the fields of the report dataset to include on report and how the fields are arranged. You also define the general format of the report, such as text font and size, margins, and background images. You will typically arrange the content of the report by adding tables to the layout.

To make general formatting and layout changes, such as changing text font, adding and modifying a table, or removing a data field, just use the basic editing features of Word, like you do with any Word document.

If you're designing a Word report layout from scratch or adding new data fields, then start by adding a table that includes rows and columns that will eventually hold the data fields.

> [!TIP]  
> Show the table gridlines so that you see the boundaries of table cells. Remember to hide the gridlines when you're done editing. To show or hide table gridlines, select the table, and then under **Layout** on the **Table** tab, choose **View Gridlines**.

## Embedding Fonts in Word Layouts for Consistency

To ensure that reports always display and print with the intended fonts, wherever users open or print the reports, you can embed the fonts in the Word document. However, embedding fonts can significantly increase the size of the Word files. Learn more about embedding fonts in Word at [Embed fonts in Word, PowerPoint, or Excel](https://support.office.com/article/Embed-fonts-in-Word-PowerPoint-or-Excel-cb3982aa-ea76-4323-b008-86670f222dbc).

## Adding data fields

A report dataset can consist of fields that display labels, data, and images. This topic describes the procedure for adding fields of a report dataset to an existing Word report layout for a report. You add fields by using the Word custom XML part for the report and adding content controls that map to the fields of the report dataset. Adding fields requires that you have some knowledge of the report's dataset so that you can identify the fields that you want to add to the layout.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
> You cannot modify built-in report layouts<!--Onprem. Built-in layouts can only be modified by using the development environment-->.  

###  <a name="OpenXMLPart"></a> To open the Custom XML part for the Report in Word  
  
1. If it's not already open, then open the Word report layout document in Word.  
  
     For more information, see [Create and Modify a Custom Report Layout](ui-how-create-custom-report-layout.md).  
  
2. Display the **Developer** tab in the ribbon of Microsoft Word.  
  
     By default, the **Developer** tab is not shown in the ribbon. Learn more at [Show the Developer Tab on the Ribbon](/visualstudio/vsto/how-to-show-the-developer-tab-on-the-ribbon).  
  
3. On the **Developer** tab, select **XML Mapping Pane**.  
  
4. In the **XML Mapping** pane, in the **Custom XML Part** dropdown list, choose the custom XML part for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] report, which is typically last in the list. The name of the custom XML part has the following format:  
  
     `urn:microsoft-dynamics-nav/reports/<report_name>/<ID>`  

     `<report_name>` is the name that is assigned to the report 

     `<ID>` is the identification number of the report.  
  
     After you select the custom XML part, the XML Mapping pane displays the labels and field controls that are available for the report.  
  
### To add a label or data field  
  
1. Place your cursor in the document where you want to add the control.  
  
2. In the **XML Mapping** pane, right-click the control that you want to add, choose **Insert Content Control**, and then choose **Plain Text**.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    > You cannot add a field by manually typing the dataset field name in the content control. You must use the **XML Mapping** pane to map the fields.  
  
### To add repeating rows of data fields to create a list  
  
1. In a table, add a table row that includes a column for each field that you want repeated.  
  
   This row will act as a placeholder for the repeating fields.  
  
2. Select the entire row.  
  
3. In the **XML Mapping** pane, right-click the control that corresponds to the report data item that contains the fields that you want repeated, choose **Insert Content Control**, and then choose **Repeating**.  
  
4. Add the repeating fields to the row as follows:  
  
    1. Place your pointer in a column.  
  
    2. In the **XML Mapping** pane, right-click the control that you want to add, choose **Insert Content Control**, and then choose **Plain Text**.  
  
    3. For each field, repeat steps a and b.  
  
## Adding image fields

A report dataset can include a field that contains an image, such as a company logo or a picture of an item. To add an image from the report dataset, you insert a **Picture** content control.  
  
Images align in the top-left corner of the content control and resize automatically in proportion to fit the boundary of the content control.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
> You can only add images that have a format that is supported by Word, such as .bmp, .jpeg, and .png file types. If you add an image that has a format that is not supported by Word, you will get an error when you run the report from the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] client.  
  
### To add an image  
  
1. Place your pointer in the document where you want to add the control.  
  
2. In the **XML Mapping** pane, right-click the control that you want to add, choose **Insert Content Control**, and then choose **Picture**.  
  
3. To increase or decrease the image size, drag a sizing handle away from or towards the center of the content control.  

##  <a name="RemoveField"></a> Removing label and data fields

Label and data fields of a report are contained in content controls in Word. The following figure illustrates a content control when it's selected in the Word document.  

![Content control for field in Word report layout.](media/nav_wordreportlayouts_contentcontrol.png "NAV_WordReportLayouts_ContentControl")  

The name of the label or data field name displays in the content control. In the example, the field name is CompanyAddr1.  

### To remove a label or data field  

1. Right-click the field that you want to delete, and then choose **Remove Content Control**.  

     The content control is removed, but the field name remains as text.  

2. Delete the remaining text as needed.

## Custom XML Part Overview

Word report layouts are built on *custom XML parts*. A custom XML part for a report consists of elements that correspond to the data items, columns, and labels that comprise the report's dataset. <!--OnPrem The data as defined in the Report Dataset Designer in Microsoft Dynamics NAV Development Environment. -->The custom XML part is used to map the data into a report when the report is run.

### XML structure of custom XML part

The following table provides a simplified overview of the XML of a custom XML part.  
  
|XML Elements|Description|  
|------------------|-----------------|  
|`<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?>`|Header|  
|`<WordReportXmlPart xmlns="urn:microsoft-dynamics-365/report/<reportname>/<id>/"`|XML namespace specification. `<reportname>` is the name that is assigned to the report. `<id>` is the ID that is assigned to the report.|  
|`..<Labels>`<br /><br /> `....<ColumnNameCaption>ColumnNameCaption</ColumnNameCaption>`<br /><br /> `....<LabelName>LabelCaption</LabelName>`<br /><br /> `..</Labels>`|Contains all the labels for the report.<!--OnPren The element includes labels that are related to columns that have the IncludeCaption Property.--><br />-   Label elements that are related to columns have the format `<ColumnNameCaption>ColumnNameCaption</ColumnNameCaption>`<!--OnPrem where `ColumnName` is determined by the column's Name Property.-->.<br />-  Label elements have the format `<LabelName>LabelName</LabelName`<!--OnPrem where LabelName is determined by the label's Name Property.-->.<br />-   Labels are listed in alphabetical order.|  
|`..<DataItem1>`<br /><br /> `....<DataItem1Column1>DataItem1Column1</DataItem1Column1>`|Top-level data item and columns. Columns are listed in alphabetical order.<!--OnPrem <br /><br /> The element names and values are determined by the Name Property of the data item or column.-->|  
|`....<DataItem2>`<br /><br /> `......<DataItem2Column1>DataItem2Column1</DataItem2Column1>`<br /><br /> `....</DataItem2>`<br /><br /> `....<DataItem3>`<br /><br /> `......<DataItem3Column1>DataItem3Column1</DataItem3Column1>`<br /><br /> `....</DataItem3>`|Data items and columns that are nested in the top-level data item. Columns are listed in alphabetical order under the respective data item.|  
|`..</DataItem1>`<br /><br /> `</WordReportXmlPart>`|Closing element.|  
  
### Custom XML part in Word

 In Word, you open the custom XML part in the **XML Mapping** pane, and then use the pane to map elements to content controls in the Word document. The **XML Mapping** pane is accessible from the **Developer** tab (learn more at [Show the Developer Tab on the Ribbon](/visualstudio/vsto/how-to-show-the-developer-tab-on-the-ribbon)).  
  
 The elements in the **XML Mapping** pane appear in a structure that is similar to the XML source. Label fields are grouped under a common **Labels** element and data item and columns are arranged in a hierarchal structure that corresponds to the XML source, with columns listed in alphabetical order. Elements are identified by their column name as defined in the report's dataset in AL code. Learn more in [Defining a Report Dataset](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-report-dataset).  
  
 The following figure illustrates the simple custom XML part from the previous section in the **XML Mapping** pane of a Word document.  
  
 ![Clip of the XML Mapping pane in word.](media/nav_reportlayout_xmlmappingpane.png "NAV_ReportLayout_XMLMappingPane")  
  
* To add a label or field to the layout, you insert a content control that maps to the element in the **XML Mapping** pane.  
  
* To create repeating rows of columns, insert a **Repeating** content control for the parent data item element, and then add content control for the columns.  
  
* For labels, the actual text that appears in the generated report is the value of the **Caption** property for the field in the data item table (if the label is related to the column in the report dataset) or a label in the Report Label Designer (if the label is not related to a column in the dataset).  
  
* The language of the label that is displayed when you run the report depends on the language setting of the report object.

# Set Up Service Items and Service Item Components
To work with service items, you must set up the following

* Service item groups.
* Optional

## To set up service item groups
You can set up groups of items that are related in terms of repair and maintenance. You can define default values for service items in a service item group, such as response time, contract discount percent, and service price group. For items in a service item group, you can select whether you want them to be automatically registered as service items when they are sold.  

You assign service item groups to items on the **Item** card, and to service items on the **Service Item** card.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Item Groups**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Create a new service item group.  
3. Fill in the **Code** and **Description** fields.  
4. In the **Default Contract Discount %** field, enter the default contract discount percentage that you want the service items in the group to have.  
5. In the **Default Serv. Price Group Code** field, enter the default service price group code that you want the service items in the group to have.  
6. In the **Default Response Time (Hours)** field, enter the default response time in hours that you want the service items in the group to have.  
7. If you want to register the items in the group as service items when they are sold, select the **Create Service Item** field.  

## To set up service item components
A service item can consist of several components, which can be replaced with spare parts when the item is serviced. These components are set up on the **Service Item Component List** page. Additionally, if you want to set up components for service items that are BOMs, you can copy the BOM items and create them as service item components.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Items**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the service item for which you want to set up components.  
3. Choose the **Components** action. The **Service Item Component List** page opens.  
4. Add a new component.  
5. In the **Type** field, choose **Service Item** if the component itself is a registered service item. Otherwise, select **Item**.  
6. In the **No.** field, choose the item or service item that is a component of the service item.  

## To set up service item components from a BOM
1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Items**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the service item for which you want to set up components from a BOM.  
3. Choose the **Components** action. The **Service Item Component List** page opens.  
4. Choose the **Copy from BOM** action.  

    If the item that the service item is linked to is a BOM, the components for all the items in the BOM are created automatically.  

## To set up a service shelf
You can set up service shelves that identify where you store your service items. You assign service shelves to service items on the **Service Order** and **Service Item Worksheet** pages.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Shelves**, and then choose the related link.
2. Fill in the fields as necessary.

# Track item cost adjustments

It's important to keep item costs accurate and shorten the time between when you post an entry and when the general ledger reflects its cost. You can track the performance of the cost adjustments for individual adjustment runs and items. If errors happen, you can identify the problematic items and make corrections. For example, you can exclude the items from calculations to ensure adjustments aren't interrupted for other items. You can adjust costs for individual items or create batches of items and adjust them all at the same time.

## Start tracking cost adjustments

It's easy to get started. On the **Inventory Setup** page, the **Cost Adjustment Logging** field offers a few options:

* **Disabled** means you don't log cost adjustment runs.
* **Errors Only** means you log only runs that failed.
* **All** means you log all runs.

> [!NOTE]
> To minimize the size of the log, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't log the adjustments that happen automatically when someone posts an item.

You must also set up the **Post Inventory Cost to G/L (1002)** job queue entry. This job queue entry automatically adjusts costs according to a schedule. To learn more about job queue entries, go to [Use job queues to schedule tasks](admin-job-queues-schedule-tasks.md).

## Manage cost adjustments

Use the **Inventory Cost Adjustment** page to manage and monitor the cost adjustment process. This page displays items along with their costing parameters and cost adjustment status. You can filter the list to focus on items that require adjustment or that are excluded from the cost adjustment process.

### About item batches

You can run cost adjustments for several items by grouping them into batches. Batches make it easy to adjust some items separately, for example, because they take longer to adjust. Batches can also help identify items that have issues.

To create a batch, on the **Inventory Cost Adjustment** page:

* Select the items in the list, choose **Run cost adjustment**, and then choose **Add Batch**.

To create a batch and run cost adjustment immediately:
* Select the items in the list, choose **Run cost adjustment**, and then choose **Add batch and run**.
* Choose **Run cost adjustment**, choose **Item Batches**, and then enter a filter in the **Item Filter** field.
  
> [!TIP]
> To quickly create another batch for all items that aren't already included in a batch, on the **Cost Adjustment - Item Batches** page, choose **Add Missing Items**.

When a run for a batch finishes, the batch has one of the following status on the **Item Batches** page:

* **Success**: The cost adjustment is successful.
* **Failed**: If the cost adjustment fails, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] identifies the item that caused the error and then splits the current batch into two. One batch with the problematic item, and another with the remaining items. Cost adjustment reruns for the batch with the remaining items. If it fails again, the process repeats. You define the maximum number of splits in the **Max. Retry Attempts** field. The default value for retries is 10, but you can enter a new limit.
* **Timed out**: If the cost adjustment for a batch doesn't finish within the period specified in the **Timeout (Minutes)** field (ranging from 1 to 720 minutes), the session terminates and changes are rolled back. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] then splits the current batch in half and reruns the cost adjustment process for each half. This process continues until the cost adjustment is successful or reaches the maximum retry attempts.

> [TIP!]
> Each batch runs in a separate session. To monitor progress, use the **Refresh** action.

### Run cost adjustment

Use the **Inventory Cost Adjustment** page to make adjustments.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Inventory Cost Adjustment**, and then choose the related link.
1. Depending on what you want to do, use one of the following options:

  * For one or more items immediately, select the items in the list and then choose **Run cost adjustment**.
  * For batches, use one of the following options:

    * To create a batch and adjust costs immediately, choose the items in the list, choose **Run cost adjustment**, and then **Add batch and run**.
    * To run it for all batches, choose **Run cost adjustment**, **Item Batches**, and then choose **Run**. To learn more about batches, go to [About item batches](#about-item-batches).
  * For all items on an item-by-item basis, which saves the results after each item is processed. For example, this option is useful for handling a large number of items, reducing lock times, and preventing full reruns if something goes wrong. To use this option, run the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** report, and turn on the **Item-by-Item Adjustment** toggle.

### Explore item details

Use the **Item** menu to access information about cost adjustments for a selected item.

* **Item Ledger Entries**: List item entries for the item. The **Mark for Adjustment** action lets you force the rerun of cost adjustment for items directly or indirectly linked to the inbound entries you select. Forcing a rerun can be helpful if previous runs led to incorrect costs.
* **Value Entries**: List value entries for the item.
* **Cost Adjmt. Entry Points**: Open the **Avg. Cost Adjmt. Entry Point** page, which you primarily use to calculate average cost. The page displays combinations of items, locations, variants, and valuation dates for which cost adjustments are, or must be, run.
* **Cost Adjmt. Orders**: Open the **Inventory Adjmt. Entry (Order)** page, where you adjust production and assembly orders. It shows the orders are adjusted or require adjustment.
* **Item Application Entries**: Open the **Item Application Entries** page for details about quantity and cost applications. You can use the **Reset Outbound Entry is Updated** action in combination with the **Mark for Adjustment** setting on the **Item Ledger Entries** page to force a rerun of cost adjustment.

### View the outcome

Use the **Log per** menu to view the outcome of cost adjustments:

* **Run**: Show cost adjustment logs for each run. The log includes data about the item filter, status (Success/Failed/Timed out), start and end date/time, duration, and the cost differences produced by the run.
* **Item**: Show detailed information about the adjustment process for the selected item.

### Include or exclude items from adjustments

If one or more items fail, you can exclude the items from the adjustment run and then include them in later runs. On the **Functions** menu, choose one of the following:

* **Exclude item from adjustment** and **Include item in adjustment**: Temporarily disable and then re-enable cost adjustment for a selected item. Cost adjustment continues to keep costs accurate for other items while you investigate an issue with a specific item.

### Use iterative cost adjustments

To manage the processing scope of cost adjustments for items that have a high volume of transactions, you can do the adjustments on a period-by-period basis. You can do that in just a few steps. On the **Inventory Cost Adjustment** page, select the item to adjust, choose the **Cost Adjmt. Entry Points** action. Next, choose the **Valuation Date** until you want to complete the adjustment and then choose the **Adjust Cost Until Valuation Date** action.

These steps adjust entries for the selected item up to the chosen date and affects entries across all locations and variants. The item is marked as adjusted when all periods are fully adjusted.

You can also adjust costs for individual production and assembly orders. On the **Inventory Cost Adjustment** page, select one or more production or assembly orders, and then choose the **Adjust Cost for Selected Orders** action.

## Post adjusted costs to the general ledger

Typically, new value entries are posted to the general ledger according to the schedule for the **Post Inventory Cost to G/L (1002)** job queue entry. However, you can post adjustments to the general ledger immediately from the **Inventory Cost Adjustment** page. On the **Functions** menu, choose **Post Inventory Cost to G/L**.

## Troubleshoot cost adjustments

Use the following options on the **Diagnostics** menu to troubleshoot cost adjustment runs.

* **Export item data**: Export item-related data to a text file. You can use the file for further analysis in a sandbox environment or attach it to a support request when investigating costing calculation issues.
* **Import item data**: Import the previously exported text file back into the database. This action is only enabled in sandbox environments or evaluation companies.
* **Reset Cost Is Adjusted**: Reset the **Cost Is Adjusted** toggle on items, production orders, or assembly orders. This setting allows you to force the rerun of the cost adjustment for them.
* **Costing Issues Detection report**: Diagnose typical data issues cause calculation errors in costing. It checks whether the item ledger entries, value entries, item application entries, and capacity ledger entries are correct.
* **Delete item data**: Clear all item-related tables in the database. This action is only available in sandbox environments or evaluation companies.

### Self-diagnostics for potential issues and performance pitfalls

During posting and cost adjustment, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] scans the current setup and data to identify inefficiencies that might affect the accuracy and performance of cost adjustment.

When you open the **Inventory Cost Adjustment** page, a notification might state that issues were found. You can view the issues on the **Action Messages** page by selecting **Action Messages** in the **Diagnostics** section.

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] issues warnings in the following scenarios:

* Cost adjustment isn't set for automatic runs or run manually.
* Average cost adjustment settings aren't optimal for performance.
* Inventory periods aren't in use.
* Many periods require adjustment.
* Many production and assembly orders require adjustment.
* Cost adjustment for a single item takes more than five minutes to complete.
* One or more items are excluded from cost adjustment.
* Data discrepancies remain after cost adjustment completes.

Scanning happens automatically during normal system usage, but you can start it manually at any time by selecting the **Run Tests** action on the **Cost Adjmt. Action Messages** page. You can't turn off diagnostics completely but you can pause it for up to 30 days by choosing **Snooze for 30 days**.

## Use the Cost Adjustment Tracer feature

Cost adjustment can take time to complete. For example, due to a high volume of entries, data errors, or a setup that isn't optimal. Because the cause is often unclear, you can use the Cost Adjustment Tracer feature to gain visibility and get some help to diagnose data-related issues.

To use the Cost Adjustment Tracer feature, on the **Inventory Cost Adjustment** page, choose **Item Batches**. Create a batch for one or more items, fill in the **Timeout (minutes)** field, select the **Trace** checkbox, and then choose the **Run** action.

During the cost adjustment process, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] records AL events, items, locations, variants, entries, and orders it processes. When the cost adjustment completes or reaches the specified time-out, it saves the results in the **Trace Log**. To access the recorded details, select **Trace Log**. Due to the potentially large volume of log entries, we recommend that you turn on the **Analysis View** mode to summarize the data.

# Using key performance indicators (KPIs) to meet your business goals

A key performance indicator (KPI) is a measurable value that shows how effectively you’re meeting your goals. Think of KPIs as your company’s scorecard, a way of measuring whether or not you’re delivering on your objectives.

## Why KPIs matter

Identifying and tracking KPIs lets you know if your business is on the right path—or if you should change course to avoid losing valuable time and money. When used properly, KPIs are powerful tools that help you:

- Monitor company financial health.
- Measure progress against strategic goals.
- Spot problems early on.
- Make timely adjustments to tactics.
- Motivate team members.
- Make better decisions, faster.

## Get started identifying your KPIs

So how do you begin to identify the KPIs that are important to your business? Start by clarifying your strategic objectives—collectively or by department.

These goals help you identify which KPIs matter for your company. Picking KPIs that are relevant depends entirely on these objectives and the ability you have to measure your performance against them.

Next, identify the KPI targets that you’re working toward, and how you measure them. Keep in mind that targets can be short and long-term.

Talk to your team and encourage open dialogue about the KPIs and their targets. Are they too aggressive? Too easy? Targets should be challenging but achievable. You should explore the activities and tactics your company uses to achieve them. Take time to understand your current state, so you have a starting point for your KPI.

## Get to know the different types of KPIs

Identifying which KPIs you should track becomes easier when you have a better understanding of the types of KPIs that are most commonly used to measure progress.

- Quantitative KPIs are all about measurable facts that can be represented with a number. Think stats, percentages, and dollar signs.
- Qualitative KPIs involve human interpretations and can’t be quantified with numbers. Think opinions, feelings, and experiences.
- Lagging KPIs measure what happened in the past to predict success or failure. Think of looking back at what you accomplished, or where you struggled.
- Leading KPIs measure performance to predict future success and long-term trends. Think of looking forward to where you’re headed.
- Leading and lagging KPIs are commonly used together. Along with quantitative and qualitative KPIs, they’re a good place to start.

For each KPI that you choose to track, assign an owner and agree on tracking frequency. Whatever KPIs you decide to track, using a KPI platform or tool is key for collaborating with your team on KPI definitions. By collectively defining each KPI, then capturing contextual data and unifying it into a single view, you enable spot-on, real-time actions.

## KPI reporting

KPI reports take the information presented on the KPI dashboard to a new level. They go deeper into the data to pull out more detailed insights and analysis.

A KPI report helps stakeholders and team members identify trends or bottlenecks over a specific time period, so that they’re able to make better decisions. Reporting subjects could include:

- Insights into the company’s day-to-day operations.
- Financial health of the company against targeted KPIs.
- Notable trends or patterns presented by the data.
- Deeper analysis of the data to assist with strategic decision-making.

To create your KPI report, first determine your audience and the objective for the report. For example, you might want to show company stakeholders Q3 progress toward your revenue target. Make sure that all the KPIs featured in your report point back to that central theme.

Other considerations for creating your KPI reports include:

- Explore KPI report templates that might already be included in your KPI tool or platform.
- Set a cadence for reporting frequency.
- Decide whether your report is static or interactive, for more dynamic drill-downs into data.
- Present only the relevant KPIs so you don’t overload the report with KPIs that don’t map back to the reporting - goals.
- Make sure your reporting is clear, easy to understand, and actionable for the intended audience.

## KPI best practices

To help you successfully harness the power of KPIs, here are a few tips to get you started.

Identify KPIs:

- Only pick KPIs that align to your specific goals. It's difficult to match KPIs to unclear objectives.
- Use different KPIs for the same goals if they stretch across departments. For example, the marketing department has different KPIs than the sales team.
- Make sure that for whatever KPIs you pick, there’s a core team responsible for defining them.

Monitoring KPIs:

- Explore the different dashboards, visualization charts, and templates available in your KPI tool or platform. Select the right ones for your goals.
- Make sure to include starting data for comparison, so that your dashboard shows a true representation of company performance and progress over time.
- Determine a cadence for monitoring and acting on KPIs. Are KPI dashboards monitored daily or weekly? Do actions only come after reporting or are stakeholders and/or team members empowered to adjust tactics along the way?
- Be sure you have simple, end-to-end data protection for data dashboards, with controls for sharing outside the organization.

## Common KPI mistakes

Avoid these common KPI mistakes:

- Selecting KPIs that aren’t key to your strategic goals. While it’s smart to track your relevant business metrics, not all of your metrics are worthy of KPI status.
- Adopting poorly defined or vague KPIs. Collaborate with your team to define the KPIs with specific details on how they're measured. Having everyone onboard makes it easier to meet your goals.
- Setting lofty or unrealistic KPI targets. It’s better to set more realistic targets based on historical data, resources, and current tactics. Consider focusing on a specific timeframe or set short- and long-term targets.
- Tracking KPIs without owners. Accountability matters, not just for the results but also for the process. Each KPI should have an owner responsible for monitoring, reporting, analysis, and action.
- Failing to take action on your KPIs. Whether you’re meeting your goals or falling behind, KPIs are tools to help you make better decisions. So don’t track just for tracking’s sake—take action.

# Set up nondeductible VAT

Nondeductible value-added tax (VAT) is the VAT that's payable by a purchaser but that isn't deductible from the purchaser's own VAT liability. Companies can usually recover VAT on the purchase of goods and services that are related to their business activities. However, in some situations, a business incurs VAT that isn't deductible. These situations are typically related to the local regulations and can differ among countries/regions. However, the model of using nondeductible or partially deductible VAT is similar. You can use proportional VAT to calculate VAT when there's deductible and nondeductible VAT.

In general, VAT can't be deducted for some purchases because of the following factors:

- **The type of goods or services that are purchased** – VAT is fully or partially nondeductible according to the law about goods such as cars, mobile phones, and food purchased at restaurants.
- **Partially deductible pro-rated VAT** – VAT is pro-rated according to the ratio between the sales operations that VAT is owed for and all performed operations. VAT that exceeds this ratio can't be deducted.

Because it can be difficult to know where and how an item is used, contact the local tax authorities in your country/region. They can help determine whether you can deduct a specified percentage of the VAT, based on historical data.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This global feature is available in all countries with enabled VAT **except for Belgium, Italy, and Norway**. These localizations already have existing local feature and will be upgraded in the future. Don't run this feature in these countries because the upgrade procedure doesn't exist.

## Use nondeductible VAT

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 3.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Setup**, and then select the related link.
2. Select the **Enable Non-Deductible VAT** checkbox.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > After you enable non-deductible VAT, you can't turn it off, because the feature might include changes to data and might initiate an upgrade of some database tables. Microsoft strongly recommends that you first enable and test this feature in the sandbox environment before you enable it in the production environment.

3. Configure how the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] treats nondeductible VAT values.

    1. In the **Use For Item Cost** field, specify whether the nondeductible VAT must be added to the item cost when you purchase items. Otherwise, the nondeductible VAT won't influence the item cost and the full amount is recorded only at the general ledger level.
    2. Select the **Use For Fixed Asset Cost** checkbox to add the nondeductible VAT to the fixed asset cost when you purchase new fixed assets. Otherwise, the nondeductible VAT won't influence the fixed asset cost and the full amount is recorded only at the general ledger level.
    3. Select the **Use For Job Cost** checkbox to specify that the nondeductible VAT must be added to the project cost when you purchase items for the project. Otherwise, the nondeductible VAT  won't influence the project cost and the full amount is recorded only at the general ledger level.
    4. Select the **Show Non-Ded. VAT In Lines** checkbox to specify that the nondeductible VAT must be shown on document line pages for easier manipulation of VAT amounts.

## Use the nondeductible VAT percentage

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 3.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Posting Setup**, and then select the related link.
2. On the **VAT Posting Setup** page, set the fields as described in the following table.

    | Field | Description |
    |-------|-------------|
    | **Allow Non-Deductible VAT** | Specify whether the nondeductible VAT is considered for the current combination of a VAT business posting group and a VAT product posting group. |
    | **Non-Deductible VAT %** | Specify the percentage of the transaction amount that VAT isn't applied to. |
    | **Non- Deductible Purchase VAT Account** | Specify the account associated with the VAT amount that isn't deducted because of the type of goods or services that are purchased. |

    > [!NOTE]
    > To have general ledger (G/L) entries that use the dedicated account instead of the sales/purchase account, you can either leave the **Non-Deductible Purchase VAT Account** field blank or set the **G/L Account** field.

3. Select **OK**.

> [!NOTE]
> You can't use unrealized VAT together with non-deductible VAT.
>
> Don't use the same **VAT identifier** value for both normal VAT where the **Non-Deductible VAT %** field is set to **0** (zero) and normal VAT where the **Non-Deductible VAT %** field is set to a non-zero value. Otherwise, the total non-deductible VAT amount will be incorrectly calculated.

# Detecting Mandatory Fields

When you enter data, you might see a red asterisk next to a field. The asterisk means that the field is required for a certain process. For example, you're about to post a transaction, but you've not filled in an important field.

The visual clue doesn't force you to fill in the field. The red asterisk is a reminder that you're blocked from completing a process.

## Examples

On the **Customer Card** page, the red asterisk appears in the **Name** field, in the **Tax Area Code** field, and in the posting group fields to indicate that you can't post a sales transaction for the customer unless the fields are filled.

On the **Item Card** page, the red asterisk appears in the **Description** field to indicate that you can't enter the item on a document line, such as a sales order, unless this field is filled.

# Set up data exchange definitions

You can set up [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to exchange data in specific tables with data on external files. For example to send and receive electronic documents, import and export bank data or other data, such as payroll, and item catalogs. Learn more at [Exchanging Data Electronically](across-data-exchange.md).  

To create a data exchange definition for a data file or stream, you can use the related XML schema to define which data elements to include on the **Column Definitions** FastTab. See step 6 in [To describe the formatting of lines and columns in the file](across-how-to-set-up-data-exchange-definitions.md#to-describe-the-formatting-of-lines-and-columns-in-the-file). Learn more at [Use XML Schemas to Prepare Data Exchange Definitions](across-how-to-use-xml-schemas-to-prepare-data-exchange-definitions.md).  

Normally, you set up data exchange definitions on the **Data Exchange Definition** page. However, for updating currency exchange rates, it's faster to use a currency exchange rate service. Learn more at [Update Currency Exchange Rates](finance-how-update-currencies.md#set-up-a-currency-exchange-rate-service).

> [!NOTE]  
> If the file that is being converted is in the XML format, the term *"column"* in this article should be interpreted as an *"XML element containing data"*.  

This article includes the following procedures:  

* Create a data exchange definition.
* Export a data exchange definition as an XML file for use by others.
* Import an XML file for an existing data exchange definition.

## Create a data exchange definition

Creating a data exchange definition involves two tasks:  

1. On the **Data Exchange Definition** page, describe the formatting of lines and columns in the file. Learn more in the [To describe the formatting of lines and columns in the file](#formatlinescolumns) section.  
2. On the **Data Exchange Mapping** page, map columns in the data file to fields in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Learn more in the [To map columns in the data file to fields in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]](#mapfields) section.  

### <a name=formatlinescolumns></a>To describe the formatting of lines and columns in the file

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Data Exchange Definitions**, then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. On the **General** FastTab, describe the data exchange definition and the data file type by filling the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Definition|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Code**|Enter a code to identify the data exchange definition.|  
    |**Name**|Enter a name for the data exchange definition.|  
    |**File Type**|Specify what type of file the data exchange definition is used for. You can select between four file types:<br /><br /> -   **XML**: Layered strings of content and markup surrounded by tags indicating function.<br />-   **Variable Text**: Records have variable length and are separated by a character, such as a comma or semi\-colon, also known as *delimited file*.<br />-   **Fixed Text**: Records have the same length, using pad characters, and each record is on a separate line, also known as *fixed-width file*.<br />- **Json**: Layered strings of content in JavaScript.|  
    |**Type**|Specify what type of business activity the data exchange definition is used for, such as **Payment Export**.|  
    |**Data Handling Codeunit**|Specify the codeunit that transfers data in and out of tables in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].|  
    |**Validation Codeunit**|Specify the codeunit that is used to validate data against predefined business rules.|  
    |**Reading/Writing Codeunit**|Specify the codeunit that processes imported data before mapping and the exported data afterward.|  
    |**Reading/Writing XMLport**|Specify the XMLport through which an imported data file or service enters before mapping, and through which exported data is written to a data file or service afterward.|  
    |**Ext. Data Handling Codeunit**|Specify the codeunit that transfers external data in and out of the data exchange framework.|  
    |**User Feedback Codeunit**|Specify the codeunit that does various clean-up after mapping, such as marks the lines as exported and deletes temporary records.|  
    |**File Encoding**|Specify the encoding of the file. **Note:** This field is only relevant for import.|  
    |**Column Separator**|Specify how columns in the data file are separated, if the file is of type **Variable Text**.|  
    |**Header Lines**|Specify how many header lines exist in the file.<br /><br /> This setting makes sure that the header data isn't imported. **Note:** This field is only relevant for import.|  
    |**Header Tag**|If a header line exists in several positions in the file, enter the text of the first column on the header line.<br /><br /> This option makes sure that the header data isn't imported. **Note:** This field is only relevant for import.|  
    |**Footer Tag**|If a footer line exists in several positions in the file, enter the text of the first column on the footer line.<br /><br /> This option makes sure that the footer data isn't imported. **Note:** This field is only relevant for import.|  

   > [!TIP]
   > To see which codeunits Microsoft uses in existing definitions in the standard product, review the three **Codeunit** fields on the **Field Mapping** page, under the **General** FastTab, for each definition.  

4. On the **Line Definitions** FastTab, describe the formatting of lines in the data file by filling the fields as described in the following table.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > For import of bank statements, you only create one line for the single format of the bank statement file that you want to import.  
    >
    > For export of payments, you can create a line for each payment type that you want to export. In that case, the **Column Definitions** FastTab shows different columns for each payment type.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Line Type**|Specifies the type of the line in the file.|  
    |**Code**|Enter a code to identify the line in the file.|  
    |**Name**|Enter a name that describes the line in the file.|  
    |**Column Count**|Specify how many columns the line in the data file has. **Note:** This field is only relevant for import.|  
    |**Data Line Tag**|Specify the position in the related XML schema of the element that represents the main entry of the data file. **Note:** This field is only relevant for import.|  
    |**Namespace**|Specify the namespace that's expected in the file to enable namespace validation. You can leave this field blank if you don't want to enable namespace validation.|  
    |**Parent Code**|Specify the line's parent, as displayed in the **Code** field in cases where the data exchange setup is for files with parent and children entries, such as a document header and lines.

5. Repeat step 4 to create a line for every type of file data that you want to export.  

     Proceed to describe the formatting of columns in the data file by filling the fields on the **Column Definitions** FastTab as described in the table in step 8. You can use a structure file, such as an .xsd file, for the data file to prefill the FastTab with the relevant elements. Learn more at [Use XML Schemas to Prepare Data Exchange Definitions](across-how-to-use-xml-schemas-to-prepare-data-exchange-definitions.md).

6. On the **Column Definitions** FastTab, choose the **Get File Structure** action.  
7. On the **Get File Structure** page, select the related structure file, then choose **OK**. The lines on the **Column Definitions** FastTab are filled according to the structure of the data file.  
8. On the **Column Definitions** FastTab, edit or fill the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Column No.**|Specify the number that reflects the column's position on the line in the file.<br /><br /> For XML files, specify the number that reflects the type of element in the file that contains the data.|  
    |**Name**|Specify the name of the column.<br /><br /> For XML files, specify the markup that marks the data to be exchanged.|  
    |**Data Type**|Specify if the data to be exchanged is of type **Text**, **Date**, or **Decimal**.|  
    |**Data Format**|Specify the format of the data, if any. For example, **MM-dd-yyyy** if the data type is **Date**. **Note:** For export, specify the data format according to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For import, specify the data format according to the .NET Framework. Learn more at [Standard Date and Time Format Strings](/dotnet/standard/base-types/standard-date-and-time-format-strings).|  
    |**Data Formatting Culture**|Specify the regional data format, if any. For example, **en-US** if the data type is **Decimal** to make sure that comma is used as the 0.000 separator, according to the US format. Learn more at [Standard Date and Time Format Strings](/dotnet/standard/base-types/standard-date-and-time-format-strings). **Note:** This field is only relevant for import.|  
    |**Length**|Specify the length of the fixed-width line that holds the column if the data file is of type **Fixed Text**.|  
    |**Description**|Specifies a description of the column, for informational purposes.|  
    |**Path**|Specify the position of the element in the related XML schema.|  
    |**Negative-Sign Identifier**|Enter the value that is used in the data file to identify negative amounts, in data files that can't contain negative signs. This identifier is then used to reverse the identified amounts to negative signs during import. **Note:** This field is only relevant for import.|  
    |**Constant**|Specify any data that you want to export in this column, such as extra information about the payment type. **Note:** This field is only relevant for export.|  
    |**Text Padding Required**|Specify that the data must include text padding.|  
    |**Pad Character**|Specify the text padding character.|  
    |**Justification**|Specify if the column justification is left or right.|  

9. Repeat step 8 for every column or XML element in the data file that has data that you want to exchange with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

The next step in creating a data exchange definition is to decide which columns or XML elements in the data file map to which fields in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

> [!NOTE]  
> The specific mapping depends on the business purpose of the data file to be exchanged and on local variations. Even the SEPA bank standard has local variations. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports import of SEPA CAMT bank statement files out\-of\-the\-box. This is represented by the **SEPA CAMT** data exchange definition record code on the **Data Exchange Definitions** page. For information about the specific field mapping of this SEPA CAMT support, see [Field Mapping When Importing SEPA CAMT Files](across-field-mapping-when-importing-sepa-camt-files.md).  

### <a name=mapfields></a>To map columns in the data file to fields in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]

> [!TIP]
> Sometimes the values in the fields that you want to map are different. For example, in one business app the language code for the United States is "U.S.," but in another it's "US." That means you must transform the value when you exchange data. This happens through transformation rules that you define for the fields. Learn more at [Transformation Rules](across-how-to-set-up-data-exchange-definitions.md#transformation-rules).

You can also group by any field, use the key index to sort results, and the new transformation types **Rounding** and **Field Lookup**.

1. On the **Line Definitions** FastTab, select the line for which you want to map columns to fields, then choose **Field Mapping**. The **Data Exchange Mapping** page opens.  
2. On the **General** FastTab, specify the mapping setup by filling the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Table ID**|Specify the table that holds the fields to or from which data is exchanged according to the mapping.|  
    |**Use as Intermediate Table**|Specify if the table that you select in the **Table ID** field is an intermediate table where the imported data is stored before it's mapped to the target table.<br/><br/> You typically use an intermediate table when the data exchange definition imports and converts electronic documents in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For example, documents such as vendor invoices into purchase invoices. Learn more at [Exchanging Data Electronically](across-data-exchange.md).|  
    |**Name**|Enter a name for the mapping setup.|  
    |**Key Index**|Specify the key index to sort the source records before exporting.|
    |**Pre-Mapping Codeunit**|Specify the codeunit that prepares the mapping between fields in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and external data.|  
    |**Mapping Codeunit**|Specify the codeunit that is used to map the specified columns or XML data elements to fields in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].|  
    |**Post-Mapping Codeunit**|Specify the codeunit that completes the mapping between fields in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and external data. **Note:**  When you use the AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals extension feature, the codeunit converts exported data from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to a generic format that's ready for export. For import, the codeunit converts external data to a format that is ready for import into [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].|
3. On the **Field Mapping** FastTab, specify which columns map to which fields in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] by filling the fields as described in the following tables, depending on whether the **Use as Intermediate Table** field was enabled or not.  
   * With the **Use as Intermediate Table** toggle off:

     |Field|Description|  
     |--------------------------------- |---------------------------------------|  
     |**Column No.**|Specify which column in the data file that you want to define a map for.<br /><br /> You can only select columns that are represented by lines on the **Column Definitions** FastTab on the **Data Exchange Definition** page.|
     |**Column Caption**|Specify the caption of the column in the external file that is mapped to the field in the **Target Table ID** field when you're using an intermediate table for data import.|
     |**Field ID**|Specify which field the column in the **Column No.** field maps to.<br /><br /> You can only select from fields that exist in the table that you specified in the **Table ID** field on the **General** FastTab.|
     |**Field Caption**|Specify the caption of the field in the external file that is mapped to the field in the **Target Table ID** field, when you're using an intermediate table for data import.|
     |**Optional**|Specify if the map should be skipped if the field is empty. If you don't select this option, then an export error occurs if the field is empty.|  
     |**Transformation Rule**|Specify the rule that transforms imported text to a supported value before it can be mapped to a specified field. When you choose a value in this field, the same value is entered in the **Transformation Rule** field in the **Data Exch. Field Mapping Buf.** table and vice versa. To learn more about how to apply transformation rules, go to [Transformation Rules](#transformation-rules).|
     |**Overwrite Value**|Specify that the new value can overwrite the current value.|
     |**Priority**|Specify the order that the field mappings must be processed. The field mapping with the highest priority number is processed first.|
     |**Multiplier**|Specify a multiplier to be applied on numeric data, including negative values.|

   * With the **Use as Intermediate Table** toggle enabled:

     |Field|Description|  
     |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
     |**Column No.**|Specify which column in the data file that you want to define a map for.<br /><br /> You can only select columns that are represented by lines on the **Column Definitions** FastTab on the **Data Exchange Definition** page.|
     |**Column Caption**|Specify the caption of the column in the external file that is mapped to the field in the **Target Table ID** field when you're using an intermediate table for data import.|
     |**Target Table ID**|Specify the table that the value in the **Column Caption** field is mapped to, when you're using an intermediate table for data import.|
     |**Table Caption**|Specify the name of the table in the **Target Table ID** field, which is the table that the value in the **Column Caption** field is mapped to, when you're using an intermediate table for data import.|
     |**Target Field ID**|Specify the field in the target table that the value in the **Column Caption** field is mapped to, when you're using an intermediate table for data import.|
     |**Field Caption**|Specify the name of the field in the target table that the value in the **Column Caption** field is mapped to, when you're using an intermediate table for data import.|
     |**Validate Only**|Specify that the element-to-field map isn't used to convert data, but only to validate data.|
     |**Transformation Rule**|Specify the rule that transforms imported text to a supported value before it can be mapped to a specified field. When you choose a value in this field, the same value is entered in the **Transformation Rule** field in the **Data Exch. Field Mapping Buf.** table and vice versa. To learn more about transformation rules, go to [Transformation Rules](#transformation-rules).|
     |**Priority**|Specify the order that the field mappings must be processed. The field mapping with the highest priority number is processed first.|

4. On the **Field Grouping** FastTab, specify rules you want to use to group your fields when you create the file by filling the fields as described in the following table.  

     |Field|Description|  
     |--------------------------------- |---------------------------------------|  
     |**Field ID**|Specify the number of the field in the external file that is used for grouping, and that the user must set this field.|
     |**Field Caption**|Specify the caption of the field in the external file that is used for grouping.|

## Transformation Rules

If the values in the fields you're mapping differ, you must use transformation rules for data exchange definitions to make them the same. You define transformation rules for data exchange definitions by opening an existing definition, or creating a new definition, and then on the **Line Definitions** FastTab, choosing **Manage**, and then **Field Mapping**. Predefined rules are provided, but you can also create your own. The following table describes the types of transformations that you can perform.

|Option|Description|
|---------|---------|
|**Uppercase**|Capitalize all letters.|
|**Lowercase**|Make all letters lowercase.|
|**Title Case**|Capitalize the first letter of each word.|
|**Trim**|Remove empty spaces before and after the value.|
|**Substring**|Transform a specific portion of a value. To specify where to start the transformation, choose either a **Start Position** or **Starting Text**. The starting position is a number that represents the first character to transform. The starting text is the letter immediately before the letter to replace. If you want to start with the first letter in the value, use a starting position instead. To specify where to stop the transformation, you choose either **Length**, which is the number of characters to replace, or the **Ending Text**, which is the character that is immediately after the last character to transform.|
|**Replace**|Find a value and replace it with another. This transformation is useful for replacing simple values, such as a particular word.|
|**Regular Expression - Replace**|Use a regular expression as part of a find and replace operation. This transformation is useful for replacing multiple, or more complex, values.|
|**Remove Non-Alphanumeric Characters**|Delete characters that aren't letters or numbers, such as symbols or special characters.|
|**Date Formatting**|Specify how to display dates. For example, you can transform DD-MM-YYYY to YYYY-MM-DD.|
|**Decimal Formatting**|Define rules for decimal placement and rounding precision.|
|**Regular Expression - Match**|Use a regular expression to find one or more values. This rule is similar to the **Substring** and **Regular Expression - Replace** options.|
|**Custom**|This transformation rule is an advanced option that requires assistance from a developer. It enables an integration event that you can subscribe to if you want to use your own transformation code. If you're a developer and want to use this option, go to [Tip for developers: Example of the custom option](#tip-for-developers-example-of-the-custom-option).|
|**Date and Time Formatting**|Define how to display the current date and the time of day.|
|**Field Lookup**|Use fields from different tables. To use it, you need to follow some rules. First, use **Table ID** to specify the ID of the table that contains the record for the field lookup. Then, in the **Source Field ID** field, specify the ID of the field that contains the record for the field lookup. Finally, in the **Target Field ID** field, specify the ID of the field to find the record for the field lookup. Optionally, use the **Field Lookup Rule** field to specify the type of the field lookup. For the **Target** field, the value from the **Target Field ID** is used, even if it's blank. For the **Original If Target Is Blank** field, the original value is used if the target is blank.|
|**Round**|Round the value in this field using some extra rules. First, in the **Precision** field, specify a rounding precision. Then, in the **Direction** field, specify the rounding direction.|

> [!NOTE]  
> Learn more about date and time formatting at [Standard Date and Time Format Strings](/dotnet/standard/base-types/standard-date-and-time-format-strings).

### Tip for developers: Example of the custom option

The following example shows how to implement your own transformation code.

```AL
codeunit 60100 "Hello World"
{
    [EventSubscriber(ObjectType::Table, Database::"Transformation Rule", 'OnTransformation', '', false, false)]
    procedure OnTransformation(TransformationCode: Code[20]; InputText: Text; var OutputText: Text)
    begin
        if TransformationCode = 'CUST' then
            OutputText := InputText + ' testing';
    end;
}
```

After you define your rules, you can test them. In the **Test** FastTab, enter an example of a value that you want to transform, then check the results by choosing **Update**.

## Export a data exchange definition as an XML file for use by others

After you create the data exchange definition for a specific data file, you can export the data exchange definition as an XML file that you can import. This task is described in the following procedure.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Data Exchange Definitions**, then choose the related link.  
2. Select the data exchange definition that you want to export.  
3. Choose the **Export Data Exchange Definition** action.  
4. Save the XML file that represents the data exchange definition in an appropriate location.  

    If a data exchange definition was already created, you just have to import the XML file into the Data Exchange Framework. This task is described in the following procedure.  

## Import an existing data exchange definition

1. Save the XML file that represents the data exchange definition in an appropriate location.  
2. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Data Exchange Definitions**, then choose the related link.  
3. Choose the **Import Data Exchange Definition** action.  
4. Choose the file that you saved in step 1.

# Design Details: Inventory Posting

Each inventory transaction, such as a purchase receipt or a sales shipment, posts two entries of different types.  

|Entry type|Description|  
|----------|-----------|  
|Quantity|Reflects the change of quantity in inventory. This information is stored in item ledger entries.<br /><br /> Accompanied by item application entries.|  
|Value|Reflects the change of inventory value. This information is stored in value entries.<br /><br /> One or more value entries can exist for each item ledger entry or capacity ledger entry.<br /><br /> For information about capacity value entries related to the use of production or assembly resources, see [Design Details: Production Order Posting](design-details-production-order-posting.md).|  

 In relation to quantity postings, item application entries exist to link inventory increase with inventory decrease. This enables the costing engine to forward costs from increases to the related decreases and vice versa. For more information, see [Design Details: Item Application](design-details-item-application.md).  

 Item ledger entries, value entries, and item application entries are created as a result of posting an item journal line, either indirectly by posting an order line or directly in the Item Journal page.  

 At regular intervals, value entries that are created in the inventory ledger are posted to the general ledger to reconcile the two ledgers for financial control reasons. For more information, see [Design Details: Reconciliation with the General Ledger](design-details-reconciliation-with-the-general-ledger.md).  

 ![Entry flow when reconciling inventory with G/L.](media/design_details_inventory_costing_1_entry_flow.png "Entry flow when reconciling inventory with G/L")  

## Example

The following example shows how item ledger entries, value entries, and item application entries result in general ledger entries.  

 You post a purchase order as received and invoiced for 10 items with a direct unit cost of LCY 7 and an overhead rate of LCY 1. The posting date is 01-01-20. The following entries are created.  

### Item Ledger Entries (1)

|Posting Date|Entry Type|Cost Amount (Actual)|Quantity|Entry No.|  
|------------|----------|--------------------|--------|---------|  
|01-01-20|Purchase|80.00|10|1|  

### Value Entries (1)

|Posting Date|Entry Type|Cost Amount (Actual)|Item Ledger Entry No.|Entry No.|  
|------------|----------|--------------------|---------------------|---------|  
|01-01-20|Direct Cost|70.00|1|1|  
|01-01-20|Indirect Cost|10.00|1|2|  

### Item Application Entries (1)

|Entry No.|Item Ledger Entry No.|Inbound Item Entry No.|Outbound Item Entry No.|Quantity|  
|---------|---------------------|----------------------|-----------------------|--------|  
|1|1|1|0|10|  

 Next, you post a sale of 10 units of the item with a posting date of 01-15-20.  

### Item Ledger Entries (2)

|Posting Date|Entry Type|Cost Amount (Actual)|Quantity|Entry No.|  
|------------|----------|--------------------|--------|---------|  
|01-15-20|Sale|-80.00|-10|2|  

### Value Entries (2)

|Posting Date|Entry Type|Cost Amount (Actual)|Item Ledger Entry No.|Entry No.|  
|------------|----------|--------------------|---------------------|---------|  
|01-15-20|Direct Cost|-80.00|2|3|  

### Item Application Entries (2)

|Entry No.|Item Ledger Entry No.|Inbound Item Entry No.|Outbound Item Entry No.|Quantity|  
|---------|---------------------|----------------------|-----------------------|--------|  
|2|2|1|2|-10|  

At the end of the accounting period, you run the **Post Inventory Cost to G/L** batch job to reconcile these inventory transactions with the general ledger.  

 For more information, see [Design Details: Accounts in the General Ledger](design-details-accounts-in-the-general-ledger.md).  

 The following tables show the result of reconciling the inventory transactions in this example with the general ledger.  

### Value Entries (3)  

|Posting Date|Entry Type|Cost Amount (Actual)|Cost Posted to G/L|Item Ledger Entry No.|Entry No.|  
|------------|----------|--------------------|------------------|---------------------|---------|  
|01-01-20|Direct Cost|70.00|70.00|1|1|  
|01-01-20|Indirect Cost|10.00|10.00|1|2|  
|01-15-20|Direct Cost|-80.00|-80.00|2|3|  

### General Ledger Entries (3)

|Posting Date|G/L Account|Account No. (En-US Demo)|Amount|Entry No.|  
|------------|-----------|------------------------|------|---------|  
|01-01-20|[Inventory Account]|2130|70.00|1|  
|01-01-20|[Direct Cost Applied Account]|7291|-70.00|2|  
|01-01-20|[Inventory Account]|2130|10.00|3|  
|01-01-07|[Overhead Applied Account]|7292|-10.00|4|  
|01-15-20|[Inventory Account]|2130|-80.00|5|  
|01-15-20|[COGS Account]|7290|80.00|6|  

> [!NOTE]  
> The posting date of the general ledger entries is the same as for the related value entries.  
> 
> The **Cost Posted to G/L** field in the **Value Entry** table is filled.  

 The relation between value entries and general ledger entries is stored in the **G/L - Item Ledger Relation** table.  

### Relation Entries in the G/L – Item Ledger Relation table (3)

|G/L Entry No.|Value Entry No.|G/L Register No.|  
|-------------|---------------|----------------|  
|1|1|1|  
|2|1|1|  
|3|2|1|  
|4|2|1|  
|5|3|1|  
|6|3|1|  

## Assembly and Production Posting

Capacity and resource ledger entries represent the time that is posted as consumed in production or assembly. These process costs are posted as value entries to the general ledger along with the involved material costs in a similar structure as described for item ledger entries in this topic.  

For more information, see [Design Details: Assembly Order Posting](design-details-assembly-order-posting.md).

# Ad-hoc analyses in purchasing

This article explains how to analyze purchasing data from list pages and queries using the **Data Analysis** feature. The feature lets you analyze data directly from the page, without having to run a report or open another application, such as Excel. Data Analysis provides an interactive and versatile way to calculate, summarize, and examine data. Instead of running reports using options and filters, you can add multiple tabs that represent different tasks or views on the data. Some examples are "My vendors," or "Purchasing statistics," or any other view you can imagine. To learn more about how to use the **Data Analysis** feature, go to [Analyze list and query data with analysis mode](analysis-mode.md).

Use the following list pages for ad-hoc analysis of purchase processes:

- [Purchase Orders](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=9307&layout=analysis)
- [Purchase lines](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=518&layout=analysis)
- [Posted Purchase Invoices](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=146&layout=analysis)
- [Vendor Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=29&layout=analysis)
- [General Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=20&layout=analysis)

## Ad-hoc analysis scenarios for purchasing

Use the **Data Analysis** feature for quick fact checking and ad-hoc analysis:

- If you don't want to run a report
- If there isn't a report for your specific needs
- If you want to quickly iterate to get a good overview on a part of your business.

The following sections provide examples of purchasing scenarios in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

| Area | To... | Open this page in analysis mode | Using these fields |
| ---- | ----- | ------------------------------- |------------------- |
| [GRNI overview](#example-goods-received-not-invoiced-grni-overview) | Get a Goods Received, Not Invoiced (GRNI) overview across vendors. | [Purchase lines](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=518&layout=analysis) | **Type**, **Amt. Rec. Not Invoiced (LCY)** (filter on these fields), **Vendor No.**, **Document No.**, **No.**, and **Amt. Rec. Not Invoiced (LCY)** <br><br> **NOTE:** You must personalize the page to add these fields. To learn more, go to [Personalize your workspace](ui-personalization-user.md). | 
| [Finance (Accounts Payable)](#example-finance-accounts-payable) | See what you owe your vendors, maybe broken down into time intervals for when amounts are due. | [Vendor Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=29&layout=analysis) | **Vendor Name**, **Document Type**, **Document No.**, **Due Date Year**, **Due Date Month**, and **Remaining Amount**. |
| [Finance (Accounts Payable)](#example-finance-accounts-payable---vendor-ledger-entries-on-hold) | Get an overview of vendor ledger entries that have been marked On Hold | [Vendor Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=29&layout=analysis) | **Vendor Name**, **Document Type**, **Document No.**, **On Hold**, and **Remaining Amount**. |


## Example: goods received, not invoiced (GRNI) overview

To create a goods received, not invoiced (GRNI) overview across vendors, follow these steps:

1. Open the [Purchase lines](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=518) list page.
1. Personalize the page to add the **Amount Received Not Invoiced** field. To personalize the page, choose **Settings**, and then **Personalize**.
1. Choose :::image type="content" source="media/analysis-mode-icon.png" alt-text="Enter analysis mode."::: to turn on analysis mode.
1. Go to the **Columns** menu and remove all columns (select the box next to the **Search** field on the right).
1. In the **Additional Filters** menu (located below the **Columns** menu on the right), set the following filters:
    - **Type = Item**
    - **Amt. Rec. Not Invoiced (LCY) > 0**. 
1. Drag the **Vendor No.**, **Document No.**, and **No.** fields to the **Row Groups** area. Drag the fields in that order.
1. Add the **Amt. Rec. Not Invoiced (LCY)** field to include it on the overview.
1. To do the analysis for a given year or quarter, apply a filter in the **Analysis Filters** menu. The menu is on the right of the page, just below the **Columns** menu.
1. Rename your analysis tab to **Goods Received, Not Invoiced (GRNI)**, or something that describes this analysis.

## Example: finance (accounts payable)

To see what you owe your vendors, maybe broken down into time intervals for when amounts are due, follow these steps:

1. Open the [Vendor Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=29&layout=analysis) list page, and turn on analysis mode.
1. Go to the **Columns** menu and remove all columns (select the box next to the **Search** field on the right).
1. Turn on the **Pivot Mode** toggle (located above the **Search** field on the right).
1. Drag the **Vendor Name**, **Document Type**, and **Document No.** fields to the **Row Groups** area, and then drag the **Remaining Amount** field to the **Values** area.
1. Drag the **Due Date Year** and **Due Date Month** fields to the **Column Labels** area. Drag the fields in that order.
1. To do the analysis for a given year or quarter, apply a filter in the **Analysis Filters** menu (located below the **Columns** menu on the right).
1. Rename your analysis tab to **Aged Payable Accounts by Month**, or something that describes this analysis.

The following image shows the result of these steps.

:::image type="content" source="media/data-analysis-vendor-ledger-entries.png" alt-text="Example of how to do data analysis on the Customer Ledger Entries page." lightbox="media/data-analysis-vendor-ledger-entries.png":::

## Example: finance (accounts payable) - vendor ledger entries on hold

To see vendor ledger entries on hold, follow these steps:

1. Open the [Vendor Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=29&layout=analysis) list page, and turn on analysis mode.
1. Go to the **Columns** menu and remove all columns (select the box next to the **Search** field on the right).
1. Turn on the **Pivot Mode** toggle (located above the **Search** field on the right).
1. Drag the **Vendor Name**, **Document Type**, and **Document No.** fields to the **Row Groups** area, and then drag the **Remaining Amount** field to the **Values** area.
1. Drag the **On Hold** field to the **Column Labels** area.
1. Rename your analysis tab to **Payments On Hold**, or something that describes this analysis.

The following image shows the result of these steps.

:::image type="content" source="media/data-analysis-vendor-ledger-entries-payments-on-hold-example.png" alt-text="Example of how to do data analysis on the Vendor Ledger Entries page to find On hold entries." lightbox="media/data-analysis-vendor-ledger-entries-payments-on-hold-example.png":::


## Data foundation for ad-hoc analysis on purchasing

When you post a purchase document, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] updates the vendor's account, general ledger (G/L), item ledger entries, and resource ledger entries:

- For each purchase document, a purchase entry is created in the **G/L Entry** table. An entry is also created in the vendor's account in the **Supplier Ledger Entry** table, and a G/L entry is created in the relevant payables account. In addition, posting the purchase might result in a value-added tax (VAT) entry and a G/L entry for the discount amount.

- For each purchase line, as applicable, entries are created in the:
  - **Item Ledger Entry** table, if the purchase line is of the Item type.
  - **G/L Entry** table, if the purchase line is of the G/L Account type.
  - **Resource Ledger Entry** table, if the purchase line is of the Resource type.
- In addition, purchase documents are always recorded in the **Purch. Recpt. Header** and **Purch. Inv. Header** tables.

# Make sales quotes

You create a sales quote to record your offer to a customer or a prospect to sell certain products on certain delivery and payment terms. You can send the sales quote to the customer to communicate the offer. You can email the document as a PDF attachment. You can also have the email body prefilled with a summary of the quote. For more information, see [Send Documents by Email](ui-how-send-documents-email.md#to-send-documents-by-email).

While you negotiate with the customer or prospect, you can change and resend the sales quote as much as needed. When the customer accepts the quote, you convert the sales quote to a sales invoice or a sales order in which you process the sale. For more information, see [Invoice Sales](sales-how-invoice-sales.md) or [Sell Products](sales-how-sell-products.md).

In most cases, you send sales quotes to prospective customers. You often have a contact person that you negotiate with. If they then accept your offer, you turn the sales quote into an order and register the prospect as a customer in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. In the following procedure, we focus on contacts, but you can also send quotes to existing customers.  

## To create a sales quote

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Quotes**, and then choose the related link.
2. Specify the contact or customer that you want to send the sales quote to.

    - If the sales quote is for an existing contact, then specify the name in the **Contact No.** field.  

        If the sales quote is for an existing customer, specify the customer in the **Customer** field.
    - If the contact isn't registered, follow these steps:

        1. In the **Contact No.** field, choose the edit button :::image type="icon" source="media/assist-edit-icon.png" border="false":::.
        2. In the dialog box about selecting the contact, choose the **New** action, and then fill in the relevant fields. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)] For more information, see [Create Contacts](marketing-create-contact-companies.md).  
        3. When you have completed the contact card, select the newly created contact in the list of contacts, and then choose the OK button to return to the sales quote.

        Several fields on the sales quote are now filled with information that you specified on the new contact card.

        > [!NOTE]
        > To correctly calculate taxes and prices for a quote, you must choose the relevant customer template in the **Customer Template Code** field. The template will be used to convert the contact to a customer once the quote is converted to a sales order or invoice.
    -  If the quote is for new customer, you must add the customer. For more information, see [Register New Customers](sales-how-register-new-customers.md).  

3. Fill in the remaining fields on the **Sales Quote** page as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  

    You're now ready to fill in the sales lines for products that you're selling or for any transaction with the customer or prospect that you want to record in a G/L account.  

    If you have set up recurring sales lines for the customer, such as a monthly replenishment order, then you can insert these lines on the order by choosing the **Get Recurring Sales Lines** action.  

4. On the **Lines** FastTab, in the **Type** field, select what type of product, charge, or transaction that you'll post for the customer with the sales line.
5. In the **No.** field, select a record to post according to the value in the **Type** field.

    You leave the **No.** field empty in the following cases:
    - If the line is for a comment. Write the comment in the **Description** field.
    - If the line is for a catalog item. Choose the **Select Catalog Items** action. For more information, see [Work With Catalog Items](inventory-how-work-nonstock-items.md).

6. In the **Quantity** field, enter how many units of the product, charge, or transaction that the line will record for the customer.

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  If the item is of type **Service**, or the **Type** field contains **Resource**, then the quantity is a time unit, such as hours, as indicated in the **Unit of Measure Code** field on the line. For more information, see [Set Up Item Units of Measure](inventory-how-setup-units-of-measure.md)

    The value in the **Line Amount** field is calculated as *Unit Price* x *Quantity*.  

    The price and line amounts are with or without sales tax, depending on what you selected in the **Prices Including Tax** field on the customer card.  
7. If you want to give a discount, enter a percentage in the **Line Discount %** field. The value in the **Line Amount** field updates accordingly.  

    If special item prices are set up on the **Sales Prices and Sales Line Discounts** FastTab on the customer or item card, the price and amount on the sales line automatically update if the price criteria is met. For more information, see [Record Sales Price, Discount, and Payment Agreements](sales-how-record-sales-price-discount-payment-agreements.md).  
8. Repeat steps 4 through 7 for every product you want to offer the contact.

    The totals under the lines are automatically calculated as you create or modify lines.  
9. In the **Inv. Discount Amount** field, enter an amount that should be deducted from the value shown in the **Total Incl. Tax** field.

    If you have set up invoice discounts for the customer, then the specified percentage value is automatically inserted in the **Invoice Discount %** field if the criteria are met, and the related amount is inserted in the **Inv. Discount Amount Excl. Tax** field. For more information, see [Record Sales Price, Discount, and Payment Agreements](sales-how-record-sales-price-discount-payment-agreements.md).

    > [!TIP]
    > To have the **Quote Valid Until Date** filled in automatically with a certain number of days after quote creation, you can fill in the **Quote Validity Calculation** field on the **Sales & Receivables** page.

10. When the sales quote lines are completed, choose the **Send by Email** action.
11. On the **Send Email** page, fill in any remaining fields and review the embedded sales quote. For more information, see [Send Documents by Email](ui-how-send-documents-email.md#to-send-documents-by-email).
12. If the contact accepts the quote, choose the **Make Order** action.  

    Alternatively, if your organization prefers that process, choose the **Make Invoice** action.  
    > [!NOTE]
    > If you added a customer in step 2, you'll be asked to confirm the conversion of the quote to an order.  
    >
    > If you added a contact from a prospective customer in step 2, you'll be asked to take the following steps:
    >
    >  - Convert the contact or prospect to a customer by choosing one of contact conversion templates. For more information, see [To create a customer, vendor, employee, or bank account from a contact](marketing-create-contact-companies.md#to-create-a-customer-vendor-employee-or-bank-account-from-a-contact).  
    > - Confirm the conversion of the quote to an order.

The conversion removes the sales quote from the database. A sales invoice or a sales order is created based on the information in the sales quote so that you can process the sale. In the **Quote No.** field on the sales invoice or sales order, you can see the number of the sales quote that it was made from. For more information, see [Invoice Sales](sales-how-invoice-sales.md) or [Sell Products](sales-how-sell-products.md).

# Sustainability management overview

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This feature is available in Business Central starting from **2024 release wave 1**.  

Business Central offers a sustainability management feature that helps you monitor and manage your organization's and its effect on the environment. This feature is designed to oversee and regulate an organization's environmental footprint by tracking various greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In this way, it facilitates proper insights. The feature supports the basic process of collecting emission data via sustainability journals or purchase documents, and recalculation of emissions to CO2 equivalent. You can either manually enter known data or use built-in methods for calculating emissions footprints; calculation using formulas are available for use only when using sustainability journals.   

> [!NOTE]
> This solution is still in early stages of development and new set of features will be added with the next release.  

The first version of the feature focuses on GHG emissions. The environmental, social, and governance (ESG) standard defines three emission scopes:

- **Scope 1 emissions** include emissions from stationary and mobile combustion, and from inadvertent fugitive emissions.
- **Scope 2 emissions** include indirect emissions from the generation of energy that is purchased from utility providers.
- **Scope 3 emissions** include a wide spectrum of emissions, from purchased goods and services and capital goods, to fuel and energy–related activities, to upstream and downstream transportation, to generated waste, to business travel and employee commuting, and so on.

With this feature, you can:

- Set up emission factors for different sources and categories of GHG emissions.
- Record emission data in sustainability journals, either manually or by using predefined calculation methods.
- Record emission data directly working with purchase documents.
- Record purchase of carbon credit using purchase documents.
- Calculate internal carbon fee.
- Recalculate emission of all gasses to CO2 equivalent using formulas.
- Post emission entries (and carbon credits) to the sustainability ledger, where you can view and analyze the emission data by various dimensions.
- Set scorecards and goals and compare them with baseline and targeted values.
- Generate sustainability reports that show your organization's GHG emissions performance.
- Use financial reports for cross functional reporting.

# The Basic Experience extension

[!INCLUDE[azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id](~/../shared-content/shared/azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id.md)]

If you have been using Microsoft Dynamics C5, Microsoft partners can help you transition to a more modern solution that is based on [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], so you can continue to enjoy the same streamlined capabilities as Dynamics C5.

This extension is intended for small businesses and can support up to three users. If you need more users, you must upgrade to a [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] license and uninstall this extension.

> [!NOTE]
> As of now, this extension is available only to customers in Denmark and Iceland.

## What's available

The following table describes the capabilities that are available if you install the Basic Experience extension.

|Area  |Functionality  |
|---------|---------|
|**General Ledger** |Basic finance, financial reports, fixed assets, bank management, bank reconciliation, payments, direct debit, dimensions, multiple currencies, budgets, workflow, document management/OCR, consolidation, unlimited companies|
|**Accounts Receivable/Sales** |Basic receivables, sales invoicing, sales discounts, pricing, sales tax, contact management |
|**Accounts Payable/Purchase** |Basic payables, purchase invoicing |
|**Project Management** |Jobs, job pricing, time sheets, assignments, tasks, resources |
|**Inventory** |Basic inventory, item substitutions, item cross reference |

## Getting started

This extension is a bit different than most, and you'll need help from a Microsoft partner to install and set it up. So that you know what to expect, here's a high-level view of what the Microsoft partner does.

1. Create a new [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] tenant. This can be either a trial or a Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) version.
2. Add at least one user who is assigned to a Basic Experience license in your Microsoft Entra account.
3. Remove all companies, including the sample Cronus company.
4. Create a new company that doesn't contain any sample data or setups.
5. Add the **Demo RapidStart** package. <!--what does the package contain?-->
6. Download and install the Basic Experience extension from AppSource.

## Migrating data

Bring your Dynamics C5 data along. After your Microsoft partner installs the Basic Experience extension, you'll have an empty company. An easy way to move your data from Dynamics C5 to Basic Experience is to use the C5 Data Migration extension, which is included in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The extension migrates customers, vendors, items, and your general ledger accounts and their entries.

# Changing your language and region settings

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is available in many markets and languages, and [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers features to help companies comply with local regulatory requirements. You can use [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in different languages, and can change the language for display texts. If you change your language setting, sign out and sign in again to apply the change. The new setting applies only to you, and not to everyone else in your company.  

[!INCLUDE [about-ui-learn](includes/about-ui-learn.md)]

For example, you're using the Canadian version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. You can use [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in English, German, French, or another language, but it's still the Canadian version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. It isn't the same as [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in Germany, where features are adapted for German requirements.  

To change the language of the user interface, go to the **My Settings** page. To learn more, go to [Change Basic Settings](ui-change-basic-settings.md#language).

> [!NOTE]  
> The choice of languages resets to your setting on your Microsoft 365 profile if your administrator synchronizes users from Microsoft 365 to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

You can't change the texts that are stored as application data. Examples of such texts are the names of items in inventory, or the comments for a customer. In other words, these types of text aren't translated.  

> [!NOTE]  
> [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] only supports a single character set for data. Some characters might not be supported in your environment. You might experience problems when you try to view data that was entered using a different character set. For instance, your environment might support only English and Russian characters. In this case, if you enter data in a different language, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] might not store it correctly. Contact your system administrator to make sure you understand which languages are supported by your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

## Changing your region setting

Region is different from both language and legal requirements in local markets. Region determines how your data presents itself, such as the decimal separator, and how text aligns to the left or right. The region also determines some of the system elements in the browser, such as the action to create a new item in a list.  

You can change the region in the browser tab that you're using to work in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The change applies only to you and not to the other users in your company. The choice of region is reset to your setting on your Microsoft 365 profile if your administrator synchronizes users from Microsoft 365 into [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> When you change the region, you'll see a long list of languages and regions. However, the language isn't influenced by the choice of region.  

To change the region, go to the **My Settings** page. To learn more, go to [Change Basic Settings](ui-change-basic-settings.md).  

## Changing the region setting for customers, contacts, and vendors

Some businesses use an external service that validates address information in their country or region. However, when you need to update address information, the structured approach that these services use might not always be what's right for some scenarios. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers a more flexible means of entering address details.

On the **General Ledger Setup** page, if you turn on the **Require Country/Region Code in Address** toggle, changes to the **Country/Region Code** field on addresses for customers, contacts, or vendors resets the values in other address fields.

## Custom address formats for countries/regions

The countries and regions in which you do business might have different formats for addresses. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] lets you customize the format in which postal addresses show for each region. To define a custom format, on the **Countries/Regions** page, choose the **Custom Address Format** action. You can adjust the order of the address information by using the **Move Up** and **Move Down** actions. To change the field on a line, in the **Field ID** field, choose :::image type="content" source="media/assist-edit-icon.png" alt-text="The assist edit icon.":::, and then choose the field.

In some cases, you might need to add multiple fields on a line. By default, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] lets you combine the city, postal code, and country. To add multiple fields on a line, enter **0** in the **Field ID** field, and then choose the value in the **Line Format** field to open the **Custom Address Format Lines** page. Add a new line for each piece of information.

## Application version

In the **Help and Support** page, you can see the version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] that your company is based on. If you want to base a company on a different version, your administrator can create a new production environment. For more information, see [Create a new production environment](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/tenant-admin-center-environments#create-a-new-production-environment) in the developer- and IT Pro content.  

## Languages of the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Help

The Help content for the default version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] publishes to Microsoft Learn. The content is available in different languages. If you access the documentation while you're using [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the content displays in your language. By default, if a particular page isn't available in your language yet, it shows in English.

### How do I change the language of the Microsoft Learn site?

Scroll to the bottom of the browser page and choose the globe symbol in the bottom left corner.

> [!NOTE]  
> The list shows all languages that are supported by the Microsoft Learn site. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is available in a limited number of countries/regions, and the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Help content is not available in all languages that the Microsoft Learn site supports.

# Responding to requests about users' personal data

Data subjects can request several types of actions regarding their personal data. For example, under some privacy laws and regulations, they have the right to request the export, deletion, and modification of their personal data. These requests are called *Data Subject Requests*. If you have classified the sensitivity of your data, and are sure they are correct, an administrator can respond to requests by using the options in the **Data Privacy** tab in the **Administration of users, security groups and permissions** Role Center.

## Types of requests

The following table provides examples of the types of requests administrators can respond to.

> [!Note]
> While we provide capabilities for responding to these types of request, and thereby accessing, personal data, it's your responsibility to ensure that personal and sensitive data are located and classified appropriately.

|Request Type|Description and Suggested Response|
|-----|-----|
|Portability requests|A data subject can make a data portability request. You must export the data subject's personal data from your systems and provide it in a structured, commonly used format. To respond to these requests, you can use the **Data Privacy Utility** to export personal data to an Excel file or a RapidStart configuration package. Using Excel, you can edit the personal data and save it in a commonly used, machine-readable format, such as .csv or .xml. For RapidStart configuration packages, you can configure master data tables and their related tables that contain personal data. <br><br> **Note:** When you export data, you specify a minimum sensitivity level. The export includes the minimum and all sensitivity levels above it. For example, if you export data that is classified as Personal, the export also includes data classified as Sensitive. <br><br>When exporting data related to a data subject, the **Data Privacy Utility** looks for direct relationships between the data subject and data related to the data subject. Indirect relationships between data related to the data subject and other data are not exported automatically by the **Data Privacy Utility**. For example, the Contact table has directly related Contact Profile Answers data, and the Contact Profile Answers table is further related to Profile Questions data. If you want to export Profile Questions as well, you must add this table manually as a row with the appropriate filters in the configuration package that the **Data Privacy Utility** creates.<br><br>The **Data Privacy Utility** only considers tables of the type **Normal**. Data in other types of tables, such as CDS, CRM, ExternalSQL, and others resides in external systems, and portability requests should be handled in those systems.|
|Requests for deletion|A data subject can request that you delete their personal data. There are several ways to delete personal data using the customization capabilities, but the decision and implementation is your responsibility. In some cases, you might choose to directly edit your data. For example, delete a contact and then run the Delete Canceled Interaction batch job to delete interactions for the contact. <br><br> **Note:** If you've specified a date in the **Allow Document Deletion Before** field on the **Sales & Receivables Setup** or **Purchases & Payables Setup** pages, you might need to change the date so that you can delete posted sales and purchase documents that have posting dates on or before that date.|
|Requests for correction|A data subject can request that you correct inaccurate personal data. There are several ways to do so. In some cases, you can export lists to Excel to quickly bulk-edit multiple records, and then import the updated data. For more information, see [Exporting your Business Data to Excel](about-export-data.md). You can also manually edit fields that contain personal data, such as editing information about a customer in the Customer card. However, records such as general, customer, and tax ledger entries are important. If you store personal data in business transaction records, consider using the customization capabilities to modify such personal data.|

## Restrict data processing for a data subject

A data subject can request that you temporarily stop processing their personal data. To honor such requests, you can mark their record as blocked due to privacy to stop processing their data. When a record is marked as blocked, you cannot create new transactions that use that record. For example, you cannot create a new invoice for a customer when either the customer or the salesperson is blocked. To mark a data subject as blocked, open the card for the data subject, for example the Customer, Vendor, or Contact cards, and choose the **Privacy Blocked** check box. You may need to choose **Show More** to display the field.  

## Handling data subject requests when using a trial version

Certain types of personal data are part of a Microsoft 365 account, and only administrators can export the data. The process for handling data subject requests is different depending on the type of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] tenant.

If you have a paid subscription for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], users must contact their organization's tenant administrator to make a data subject request. Administrators have the administrative rights and tools to fulfill data subject requests.

If you signed up for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] from the [Trials](https://trials.dynamics.com/) page, and you're still using the trial version, users can download and export their own data in the [Work and School Privacy page in the Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/GDPRViralBlade).

On the Work and School Privacy page, you can also close your account. However, we recommend that you export and delete all data first. Deleting your account means that you lose access to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

You can still mark people as blocked due to privacy and export, edit, or delete transactions as explained elsewhere in this article.  

## Exporting data from tables not classified by data subject

If you must export data that isn't classified in a way so that it's automatically exported, such as data from the Profile Answers table, you must take the following actions:

* Consider whether you really must export supplemental data that isn't directly related to the contact.
* Add the table and relationship manually to the Rapid Start package and export it directly from the Rapid Start package. We generate a Rapid Start package for you, so that you can tweak it in such situations.

## Handling data about minors

If a contact person's age is below the age of legal consent according to the laws in your region, you can indicate that by choosing the **Minor** check box on the **Contact** card. When you do, the **Privacy Blocked** check box is automatically selected. When you receive consent from the minor's parent or legal guardian, you can choose the **Parental Consent Received** check box to unblock the contact. Though you can process personal data for minors, you cannot use the profiling functionality in Dynamics 365 Sales.

> [!Note]
> The Change Log can record details such as when, and by whom, the **Parental Consent Received** check box was chosen. An administrator can set that up by using the **Change Log Setup** guide, and also choosing the **Log Modification for Parental Consent Received** check box on the **Contact** card. For more information, see [Logging Changes](across-log-changes.md).

# Use non-deductible VAT

This article explains how to use and report non-deductible VAT.

## Create a purchase invoice with non-deductible VAT

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 3.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Invoices**, and then select the related link.
2. Select **New** to create a purchase invoice, and enter the appropriate information on the invoice header.
3. In the **Lines** section, create a new line of any type, based on the VAT business posting group and the VAT product posting group where you configure non-deductible VAT.
4. In the **Quantity** and **Direct Unit Cost** fields, enter appropriate values.

    If you selected the **Show Non-Ded. VAT In Lines** checkbox on the **VAT Setup** page, the amounts in the **Non-Deductible VAT Base** and **Non-Deductible VAT Amount** fields are calculated based on the **Non-Deductible VAT %** field on the **VAT Posting Setup** page.

5. Post the invoice.

## Create a purchase order with non-deductible VAT

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 3.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Orders** and then select the related link.
2. Select **New** to create a purchase order, and enter the appropriate information on the document header.
3. In the **Lines** section, create a new line of any type, based on the VAT business posting group and the VAT product posting group where you configure non-deductible VAT.
4. In the **Quantity** and **Direct Unit Cost** fields, enter appropriate values.

    If you selected the **Show Non-Ded. VAT In Lines** checkbox on the **VAT Setup** page, the amounts in the **Non-Deductible VAT Base** and **Non-Deductible VAT Amount** fields are calculated based on the **Non-Deductible VAT %** field on the **VAT Posting Setup** page.

5. Post the purchase order.

## Adjust rounded VAT amounts before document posting

If VAT amounts aren't rounded in the same way in your environment and in the external accounting system (the original invoice document), you can adjust the VAT amount before you post the document. To make this adjustment, follow these steps before you post the document.

1. On the Action Pane, select **Statistic**.
2. If you're working with a purchase invoice, follow these steps:

    1. On the **Lines** FastTab, select the VAT amount or non-deductible VAT amount.
    2. Set the values that you need from the original document, and then close the **Purchase Invoice Statistics** page.

3.	If you're working with the purchase order, follow these steps:

    1. On the **Invoicing** FastTab, select **No. of Tax Lines** to open the **VAT Amounts Lines** page.
    2. Select the VAT amount or non-deductible VAT amount that you want to correct.
    3. Enter the values that you need from the original document, close the **VAT Amount lines** page, and then close the **Purchase Order Statistics** page.

To use adjustments of VAT amounts, you must enable the adjustments. On the **General Ledger Setup** page, in the **Max. VAT Difference Allowed** field, enter the maximum allowed VAT amount for correction. Then, on the **Purchases & Payables Setup** page, select **Allow VAT Difference**.

You can adjust the values of the **VAT Amount** and **Non-Deductible VAT Amount** fields. The value of the **Deductible VAT Amount** field is the result of these two values. The amount that you enter in the **Non-Deductible VAT Amount** field can't be more than the amount that you enter in the **VAT Amount** field. The **Max. VAT Difference Allowed** field on the **General Ledger Setup** page works independently for deductible and non-deductible VAT amounts on statistic pages when you want to adjust VAT amounts.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You can't use non-deductible VAT on the prepayment invoices.

# Check amounts on purchase invoices and credit memos

> [!NOTE]
> Businesses around the world can benefit from this functionality, so in 2025 release wave 1 we moved it out of the Dutch version and made it available to everyone.

Before posting a purchase invoice or credit memo, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] checks whether the amount including VAT and the VAT amount on the document equals the total amount on the purchase lines. This check requires that you fill in the **Doc. Amount Incl. VAT** and **Doc. Amount VAT** fields on the purchase invoice or credit memo.  

When the document has only one purchase line, or all lines are subject to the same VAT percentage, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates the value in the **Doc. Amount VAT** field when you add purchase lines and fill in the **Doc. Amount Incl. VAT** field. If there are several lines with different VAT percentages, you must manually enter the value in the **Doc. Amount VAT** field.  

By default, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] checks the total amounts. If you prefer that it doesn't, you can turn off the **Check Doc. Total Amounts** toggle on the **Purchases & Payables Setup** page.  

If the total amount on the document differs from the total amount of its lines, you can add a few values to the page that can help you find out why. You can add the total amount, total base amount, total VAT amount, and total amount including VAT values. The values display at the bottom of the document. To avoid clutter on the page during daily work, these values are hidden. To add these values to the document, turn on the **Show Totals on Purch. Inv.-CM.** toggle on the **Purchases & Payables Setup** page.  

> [!NOTE]  
> If you turn on this feature, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] recalculates totals on all purchase invoices and credit memos which, depending on the number of documents, might take some time.
>
> You can't turn on this feature if you have purchase invoices or credit memos that don't have lines, or where a quantity isn't specified on the lines.

title: Using the Sales and Inventory Forecast extension to manage inventory

# The Sales and Inventory Forecast extension

Inventory management is a trade-off between customer service and managing your cost. On one hand, a low inventory requires less working capital, but, on the other hand, stock-outs potentially lead to missed sales. The Sales and Inventory Forecast extension predicts potential sales using historical data and gives a clear overview of expected stock-outs. Based on the forecast, the extension helps create replenishment requests to your vendors and saves you time.  

## Setting up forecasting

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the connection to [Azure AI](https://azure.microsoft.com/overview/ai-platform/) is already set up for you. But you can configure the forecast to use a different type of period to report by, such as changing from forecasting by month to forecasting by quarter. You can also choose the number of periods to calculate the forecast by, depending on how granular you want the forecast to be. We suggest that you forecast by month and with a 12 month horizon for the forecast.

> [!TIP]  
> Consider the length of the periods that the service will use in its calculations. The more data you provide, the more accurate the predictions will be. Also, watch out for large variances in periods. They will also impact predictions. If Azure AI does not find enough data, or the data varies a lot, the service will not make a prediction.

## Use the forecasts

The extension uses Azure AI to predict future sales based on your sales history to help you avoid inventory shortage. For example, when you choose an item on the **Items** page, the chart in the **Item Forecast** pane shows the estimated sales of this item in the coming period. This way you can see if you're likely to run out of stock of the item soon.  

You can also use the extension to suggest when to stock up on inventory. For example, you might create a purchase order for Fabrikam to buy their new desk chair. The Sales and Inventory Forecast extension might suggest that you also restock on the LONDON swivel chair that you usually buy from this vendor. The extension can forecast that you'll soon run out of stock of the LONDON swivel chair, so you might order more chairs already now.  

## Design details

Subscriptions for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] come with access to several predictive web services in all regions where [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is available. For more information, see the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central Licensing Guide. The guide is available for download on the [Business Central](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/en-us/business-central/overview/) website.

These web services are stateless, meaning they use data only to calculate predictions on demand. They don't store data.

> [!NOTE]  
> You can also use your own predictive web service instead of ours. For more information, see [Create and use your own predictive web service for sales and inventory forecasts](#AnchorText). 

### Data required for forecast

To make predictions about future sales, the web service requires quantitative data about past sales. That data comes from the **Posting Date**, **Item No**, and **Quantity** fields on the **Item Ledger Entries** page, where:

- The entry type is "Sale."
- The posting date is between the date that is calculated based on the values in the **Historical Periods** and **Period Type** fields on the **Sales and Inventory Forecast Setup** page and the work date.

Before is uses the web service, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] compresses transactions by **Item No.** and **Posting Date** based on the value in the **Period Type** field in the **Sales and Inventory Forecast Setup** page.

## <a name="AnchorText"> </a>Create and use your own predictive web service for sales and inventory forecasts

For [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, the model is published by Microsoft and connected to the Microsoft subscription. For other deployment options, you must create Machine Learning resources in your own Azure subscription. You can find sample steps in the [sample repo](https://github.com/microsoft/BCTech/tree/master/samples/MachineLearning). The purpose of this task is to get the API URI and API key.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales and Inventory Forecast Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Expand the **General** FastTab, and then fill in the API URL and API key fields.

> [!NOTE]
> You can always switch back to resources managed by Microsoft by removing values from API URL and API Key fields.  

## Limitations of the Sales and Inventory Forecast extension

The Sales and Inventory Forecast extension produces aggregated forecast for all locations and variants. If you have multiple locations, for example, that represent different stores, you can't get a forecast for each location. You must distribute amounts afterwards.

Regarding throughput, we estimate that [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can process approximately 50000 items in 12 hours, which is defined as the *Max Execution Timeout*. The exact number depends on the data and settings for extensions. For more information about report limits in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and how they're configured in the online service, see [Report limits in Business Central](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/operational-limits-online#Reports).

The Sales and Inventory Forecast extension doesn't support filtering, means you can't split items into separate batches.

# Map e-documents to purchase order lines with Copilot (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]

As procurement processes become more digital, the e-documents feature in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] plays a key role in automating how companies receive and process vendor invoices. Copilot can help by improving the mapping and matching of lines on vendor invoices to purchase orders. Copilot can reduce the time you spend on tasks that would normally require extensive search, lookup, and data entry. Another benefit is when vendor invoices don't relate exactly with purchase orders. Copilot can identify the corresponding purchase orders. Enhanced matching capabilities particularly benefit small and mid-sized organizations that need efficient document tracking for purchase order lines.

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/production-ready-preview-dynamics365.md)]

The **E-Document** app supports scenarios for e-documents throughout the sales process. Copilot can also refine how you manage e-documents in the purchase process, particularly with respect to purchase orders. The app lets you specify the type of purchase document to create for each vendor when you receive e-invoices from them.

You can update existing purchase orders in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with the information from you received in the e-invoice.

## Supported languages

[!INCLUDE[copilot-language-support-en-only](includes/copilot-language-support-en-only.md)]

## Prerequisites

- Your admin must activate the **E-Document Matching Assistance** capability. Learn more in [Configure Copilot and agent capabilities](enable-ai.md).  

## Identify purchase orders

First, you can identify the purchase orders that you can automatically match. If your **Vendor** configured the **Receive E-Document To** field to work with **Purchase Orders**, when the electronic document is created in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] (manually or from an external endpoint), [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] does the following:

1. If the purchase order for this vendor exists and there's a purchase order number in the received e-document file, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically links the e-document with the purchase order. The **Document Status** of this **E-Document** is **In Progress**, and the **E-Document Status** in the **Service Status** subpage is **Order linked**.  
The link shows in the **Document** field on the e-document. If you need to change the purchase order, you can use the **Update Purchase Order Link** action and then manually choose another purchase order for this vendor. You can only do so before you match the lines on the e-document and purchase order.  
2. If the purchase order for this vendor exists but there isn't a purchase order number in the received e-document file, if you manually upload the document you can choose an existing purchase order by opening the **Purchase Orders** list from the orders that you got from vendors that contain only e-document. If you don't select the correct purchase order, or if you received the e-document automatically from an external endpoint using the **Job Queue**, the new e-document isn't linked with a purchase document and the **Document Status** field shows **Error** and the **E-Document Status** in the **Service Status** subpage is **Imported document processing error**. To finish linking the purchase order, choose the **Update Purchase Order Link** action, and then choose a purchase order for the vendor.  

## Map lines

Copilot helps you automatically match e-invoice lines with purchase order lines, and offers extra matching intelligence to improve the matches.

After they're matched and mapped, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] updates the matched purchase order with the relevant receipt information to ensure the correct quantities are received on the order lines.

You can match your received electronic documents with purchase order lines from two different places, from the **E-Documents** page or from the **Purchase Order** page. The easiest way to find purchase orders that are already linked is to use the **Linked Purchase Orders** tile on your Role Center. To find documents that aren't linked, use the **Waiting Purchase E-Invoices** tile to open a list of e-documents that are waiting for review.  

> [!NOTE]
> The **E-Document Activities** group with these two tiles is available in the following Role Centers:
>
> - Business Manager Evaluation
> - Business Manager
> - Accountant
> - Inventory Manager
> - Shipping and Receiving

When you want to run matching from a purchase order, select the **Map E-Document Lines with Copilot** action. The action is available on the **Purchase Orders** list page and the **Purchase Order** page. If you want to run matching from the **E-Documents** page, select the **Match Purchase Order with Copilot** action. To process with matching, follow these steps:

1. Select the **Map E-Document Lines with Copilot** or **Match Purchase Order with Copilot** action for documents that are already linked.  
1. The **E-Document Match Order Lines with Copilot** prompt displays and the **Purchase Order Matching** page in the background. Copilot is automatically creating the mapping for you.
1. After a few seconds, the **E-Document Match Order Lines with Copilot** page suggests lines for matching with a few details:

    1. The prompt header has the following information:

    |Field name |Description |
    |--------|-----------------|
    |Auto-matched | Specifies the number of matches proposed automatically. This number is based on a string comparison. If 80% or more of the descriptions overlap, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] matches them automatically without using Copilot capabilities. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] also shows lines as auto-matched as item references exist with appropriate conditions. |
    |Copilot matched | Specifies the number of matches proposed by Copilot using both string and semantic comparison. |
    |E-Document No. | Specifies the linked e-document number. |
    |Invoice Total Amount Excl. VAT | Specifies the total invoice amount excluding VAT. |
    |Matched Total Amount Incl. VAT | Specifies the matched amount excluding VAT. |

    1. If all lines match, the following text displays in green font in the upper-right corner, **All lines (100%) are matched. Review match proposals**.  
    1. The **Matched proposal** lines contain the following information:  

       |Field name |Description |
       |--------|-----------------|
       |E-Document Line No. | Specifies the e-document line number from the original e-document file. |
       |E-Document Line Description | Specifies the e-document line description from the original e-document file. |

# Design Details: Reconciliation with the General Ledger
When you post inventory transactions, such as sales shipments, production output, or negative adjustments, the quantity and value changes to the inventory are recorded in the item ledger entries and the value entries, respectively. The next step in the process is to post the inventory values to the inventory accounts in the general ledger.  

There are two ways to reconcile the inventory ledger with the general ledger:  

* Manually, by running the **Post Inventory Cost to G/L** batch job.  
* Automatically, every time that you post an inventory transaction.  

## Post Inventory Cost to G/L Batch Job  
When you run the **Post Inventory Cost to G/L** batch job, the general ledger entries are created based on value entries. You have the option to summarize general ledger entries for each value entry, or create general ledger entries for each combination of posting date, location code, inventory posting group, general business posting group, and general product posting group.  

The posting dates of the general ledger entries are set to the posting date of the corresponding value entry, except when the value entry falls in a closed accounting period. In this case, the value entry is skipped, and you must change either the general ledger setup or the user setup to enable posting in the date range.  

When you run the **Post Inventory Cost to G/L** batch job, you might receive errors because of missing setup or incompatible dimension setup. If the batch job encounters errors in the dimension setup, it overrides these errors and uses the dimensions of the value entry. For other errors, the batch job does not post the value entries and lists them at the end of the report in a section titled, **Skipped Entries**. To post these entries, you must first fix the errors. To see a list of errors before you run the batch job, you can run the **Post Invt. Cost to G/L - Test** report. This report lists all of the errors that are encountered during a test posting. You can fix the errors, and then run the inventory cost posting batch job without skipping any entries.  

## Automatic Cost Posting  
To set up cost posting to the general ledger to run automatically when you post an inventory transaction, select the **Automatic Cost Posting** check box on the **Inventory Setup** page. The posting date of the general ledger entry is the same as the posting date of the item ledger entry.  

## Account Types  
During reconciliation, inventory values are posted to the inventory account in the balance sheet. The same amount, but with the reverse sign, is posted to the relevant balancing account. Usually the balancing account is an income statement account. However, when you post direct cost related to consumption or output, the balancing account is a balance sheet account. The type of the item ledger entry and value entry determines which general ledger account to post to.  

The entry type indicates which general ledger account to post to. This is determined either by the sign of the quantity on the item ledger entry or the valued quantity on the value entry, since the quantities always have the same sign. For example, a sales entry with a positive quantity describes an inventory decrease caused by a sale, and a sales entry with a negative quantity describes an inventory increase caused by a sales return.  

### Example  
The following example shows a bike chain that is manufactured from purchased links. This example shows how the various general ledger account types are used in a typical scenario.  

The **Expected Cost Posting to G/L** check box on the **Inventory Setup** page is selected, and the following setup is defined.  

The following table shows how the link is set up on the item card.  

|Setup Field|Value|  
|-----------------|-----------|  
|**Costing Method**|Standard|  
|**Standard Cost**|LCY 1.00|  
|**Overhead Rate**|LCY 0.02|  

The following table shows how the chain is set up on the item card.  

|Setup Field|Value|  
|-----------------|-----------|  
|**Costing Method**|Standard|  
|**Standard Cost**|LCY 150.00|  
|**Overhead Rate**|LCY 25.00|  

The following table shows how the work center is set up on the work center card.  

|Setup Field|Value|  
|-----------------|-----------|  
|**Direct Unit Cost**|LCY 2.00|  
|**Indirect Cost Percentage**|10|  

##### Scenario  
1. The user purchases 150 links and posts the purchase order as received. (Purchase)  
2. The user posts the purchase order as invoiced. This creates an overhead amount of LCY 3.00 to be allocated and a variance amount of LCY 18.00. (Purchase)  

    1. The interim accounts are cleared. (Purchase)  
    2. The direct cost is posted. (Purchase)  
    3. The indirect cost is calculated and posted. (Purchase)  
    4. The purchase variance is calculated and posted (only for standard-cost items). (Purchase)  
3. The user sells one chain and posts the sales order as shipped. (Sale)  
4. The user posts the sales order as invoiced. (Sale)  

    1. The interim accounts are cleared. (Sale)  
    2. Cost of goods sold (COGS) is posted. (Sale)  

        ![Results of sales posting to GL accounts.](media/design_details_inventory_costing_3_gl_posting_sales.png "Results of sales posting to GL accounts")  
5. The user posts consumption of 150 links, which is the number of links used to produce one chain. (Consumption, Material)  

    ![Results of material posting to GL accounts.](media/design_details_inventory_costing_3_gl_posting_material.png "Results of material posting to GL accounts")  
6. The work center used 60 minutes to produce the chain. The user posts the conversion cost. (Consumption, Capacity)  

    1. The direct costs are posted. (Consumption, Capacity)  
    2. The indirect costs are calculated and posted. (Consumption, Capacity)  

        ![Results of capacity posting to GL accounts.](media/design_details_inventory_costing_3_gl_posting_capacity.png "Results of capacity posting to GL accounts")  
7. The user posts the expected cost of one chain. (Output)  
8. The user finishes the production order and runs the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job. (Output)  

    1. The interim accounts are cleared. (Output)  
    2. The direct cost is transferred from the WIP account to the inventory account. (Output)  
    3. The indirect cost (overhead) is transferred from the indirect cost account to the inventory account. (Output)  
    4. This results in a variance amount of LCY 157.00. Variances are only calculated for standard-cost items. (Output)  

        ![Results of output posting to GL accounts.](media/design_details_inventory_costing_3_gl_posting_output.png "Results of output posting to GL accounts")  

        > [!NOTE]  
        >  For the sake of simplicity, only one variance account is shown. In reality, five different accounts exist:  
        >   
        >  * Material Variance  
        >  * Capacity Variance  
        >  * Capacity Overhead Variance  
        >  * Subcontracting Variance  
        >  * Manufacturing Overhead Variance  

9. The user revalues the chain from LCY 150.00 to LCY 140.00. (Adjustment/Revaluation/Rounding/Transfer)  

    ![Results of adjustment posting to GL accounts.](media/design_details_inventory_costing_3_gl_posting_adjustment.png "Results of adjustment posting to GL accounts")  

For more information about the relationship between the account types and the different types of value entries, see [Design Details: Accounts in the General Ledger](design-details-accounts-in-the-general-ledger.md).

# Set Up Business Central Access in Teams with Microsoft 365 Licenses

[!INCLUDE[azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id](~/../shared-content/shared/azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id.md)]

Administrators must complete multiple activities before users can access [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with their Microsoft 365 license. The steps below represent the minimum setup required to get started. To learn more about access with Microsoft 365 licenses, go to [Business Central Access with Microsoft 365 Licenses](admin-access-with-m365-license.md).

## Guidelines

Setting up access with Microsoft 365 licenses involves the following tasks:

|Step|Task|Required|
|-|-|-|
|1|[Configure which Business Central data the Microsoft 365 licensed users have permission to view](#configure-permissions)|![check mark](media/check.png "check")|
|2|[Enable access with Microsoft 365 licenses on the Business Central environment](#enable-access-with-microsoft-365-licenses)|![check mark](media/check.png "check")|
|3|[Assign security group to the environment](#choose-who-gets-access-by-using-security-group)|
|4|[Deploy the Business Central app for Teams to users](#deploy-the-business-central-app-for-teams)|![check mark](media/check.png "check")|
|5|[Test the setup](#test-your-setup)||

> [!TIP]
> Except for the last task, you can complete the tasks in any order. You can do tasks separately, as described in the sections that follow or use the **Access with Microsoft 365 licenses** assisted setup guide to walk you through them.
>
> To run the assisted setup, do the following steps:
>
> 1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Assisted Setup**, and then choose the related link.
> 2. On the **Assisted Setup** page, go to the **Do more with Business Central** section and select **Access with Microsoft 365 licenses**.
> 3. Follow the instructions.  

## Configure permissions

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is secure by design and minimizes risk by granting no permissions to Microsoft 365 users out of the box. Administrators must configure object permissions that determine which tables, pages and reports can be accessed in Teams with only a Microsoft 365 license. These permissions are the starting permissions assigned when a user signs in for the first time with their Microsoft 365 license. 

To configure starting permissions:

1. In [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], search for **License Configuration**.
2. Select the Microsoft 365 license.
3. At the top of the **Microsoft 365** license page, select the edit icon ![Edit icon](media/edit-pencil.png), then turn on **Customize permissions**. 
4. In the **Custom Permission Sets** section, add the appropriate permission sets and choose whether they're applicable to a single company or all companies within the environment.

With this configuration, users with only a Microsoft 365 license are added to the **Users** list when they access [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] for the first time. For more information about users, go to [Creating Users According to Licenses](ui-how-users-permissions.md).

> [!NOTE]
> When synchronizing the users list in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with users in Microsoft 365, only users that have a [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] license are added to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]'s users list. For more administrative control over permissions and profiles, you can assign a security group to the environment. When environments are secured using a security group and enable access with Microsoft 365 licenses, the **Update users from Microsoft 365** action in the **Users** page will also include users that only have a Microsoft 365 license. To learn about securing environments, see [Manage access using Microsoft Entra groups](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/tenant-admin-center-manage-access#manage-access-using-azure-active-directory-groups) in the developer and IT pro help.

> [!TIP]
> Looking for a quicker way to get started when trying out this feature on a sandbox or evaluation company? Assign the **D365 Read** permission set, which grants permission to most objects.  

When working with multiple environments, license configuration must be applied to each environment and can be different on each environment.

Learn more at [Assign Permissions to Users and Groups](ui-define-granular-permissions.md) and [Composing Permission Sets](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-permissionset-composing).

## Enable access with Microsoft 365 licenses

Access with Microsoft 365 licenses is off by default. Access must be enabled for each environment independently, giving administrators control and allowing for staged rollout across the organization. You turn on access by using the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] admin center: 

1. In the upper-right corner, select **Settings** ![Settings.](media/ui-experience/settings_icon_small.png "Settings icon for role center") > **Admin Center**.  
2. In the admin center, select **Environments**, then select the environment on which you want to change license access. 
3. On the **Environment details** page, select **Modify** for the **Access with Microsoft 365 licenses** setting.
4. In the **Microsoft 365 licenses** pane, turn on the switch. 
5. Select **Save** when done and accept the confirmation. The change comes into effect immediately.

## Choose who gets access by using security group

[!INCLUDE[azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id](~/../shared-content/shared/azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id.md)]

In the Business Center admin center, an environment can be assigned to one or more security groups to control access. You can assign a Microsoft Entra group to the environment. By assigning a Microsoft Entra group to an environment, only direct and indirect members of the group are granted access to the environment. Indirect members are users in another group, which itself is a member of the group assigned to the environment. Although all licensed users in Microsoft Entra ID will be added to the environment when it's synchronized with Microsoft 365, only group members can sign in. Learn more in [Manage access using Microsoft Entra groups](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/tenant-admin-center-manage-access#manage-access-using-azure-active-directory-groups) in the developer and IT pro help.

People in the security group must also have an applicable Microsoft 365 license to access Business Central from within Microsoft Teams. Get a list of applicable licenses in [Business Central access with Microsoft 365 licenses](admin-access-with-m365-license.md#requirements-for-individual-users-to-access-data-in-teams).

## Deploy the Business Central app for Teams

For [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] license holders to share data in Teams, and for Microsoft 365 license holders to access that data, each must have the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams installed. Although users can install the app by themselves, it's recommended that administrators use centralized deployment. Centralized deployment lets you roll out the app to a broader audience across the organization and minimize individual user effort. Laern more in [Installing the Business Central app by using Centralized Deployment](admin-teams-integration.md#installing-the-business-central-app-by-using-centralized-deployment).

> [!NOTE]
> If you have run centralized deployment before and only deployed the app to the security group of licensed [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] users, you'll need to run it again to deploy to additional groups or the whole organization, depending on how you are configuring access.

> [!TIP]
> Looking for a quicker way to get started when trying out this feature? Test users can install the app at [aka.ms/BCgetTeamsApp](https://aka.ms/BCgetTeamsApp).

## Test your setup

To verify that your setup is ready for production, the following steps will help you build the confidence that everything works as it should.

1. Create or identify two test users (A and B).

   - Test user A must have a [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] license and Microsoft 365 license with access to Teams.
   - Test user B must have only a Microsoft 365 license with access to Teams.

2. Sign in to the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] web client as test user A.

   1. Open a record that test user B should have access to, such as an **Item** card in the appropriate company and environment.
   2. Select **Share** ![!Share to other apps action on pages.](media/share-icon.png) > **Share to Teams** to bring up the Share to Teams window.
   3. In the **Share to** field, add test user B as the recipient.
   4. Wait for the link to expand to a card and select Share.

3. Sign into Microsoft Teams as test user B.

   1. Select Chat and open the conversation with test user A.
   2. In the message sent by test user A, select the Details button on the card. If the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] client is displayed and is read-only, your setup was successful.

# Update standard costs
You must periodically update the standard costs of components and roll the new costs up to the parent item. The process typically consists of the following four steps:  

1.  Update costs at the component and capacity levels. For more information, see the **Suggest Item Standard Cost** batch job.  
2.  Consolidate and roll up the component and capacity costs to calculate the total manufacturing or assembly cost of the items.  
3.  Implement the standard costs that are entered when you run the previous batch jobs. The standard costs don't take effect until they're implemented. Use the **Implement Standard Cost Changes** batch job, which updates the changes in the standard cost on items with the ones in the Standard Cost Worksheet table.  
4.  Implement the changes to update the **Unit Cost** field on the item card and perform inventory revaluation. For more information, see [Revalue Inventory](inventory-how-revalue-inventory.md).  

For more information, see [About Calculating Standard Cost](finance-about-calculating-standard-cost.md).
  
## To update standard costs

1.  Run the **Adjust Cost-Item Entries** batch job. To start the batch job, choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Adjust Cost-Item Entries**, and then choose the related link. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)] Review the results and make changes as necessary.  
2.  Run the **Post Inventory Cost to G/L** batch job. To start the batch job, choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Post Inventory Cost to G/L**, and then choose the related link. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)] Review the results and make changes as necessary.  
3.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Standard Cost Worksheet**, and then use one or more of the following actions:

    1.  Run the **Suggest Item Standard Cost** batch job.  
    2.  Review the results and make changes as necessary.  
    3.  Run the **Suggest Capacity Standard Cost** batch job.  
    4.  Review the results and make changes as necessary.
    5. Run the **Roll Up Standard Cost** batch job.
    6.  Review the results and make changes as necessary.
    7.  Run the **Implement Standard Cost Changes** batch job.  
4.  Review and post the **Item Revaluation Journals** page, which has been populated with entries from the previous steps in this process.

# Create new companies in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the container for business data that belongs to a business unit or legal entity is referred to as a *company*. When you sign up for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you're given a demonstration company and an empty company, *My Company*. Switching between the companies is easy: just go to **My Settings** and move to the other company. But you can also create new companies in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] depending on your business needs.  

> [!NOTE]
> To create a new company, you must be assigned to the **Super** permission set.

When you create a new company, an assisted setup guide helps you get the basics in place. Then, you can import data from your legacy system or another company in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

[!INCLUDE [about-ui-learn](includes/about-ui-learn.md)]

## Choose the right template

If you decide to add a company to your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can use the **Create New Company** assisted setup guide to get started. The setup guide is available from the **Companies** page and from the lookup in the **Company** field on the **My Settings** page.  

The setup guide offers three templates and a blank option:

- **Evaluation - Sample Data**  
    Create a company that's similar to the demonstration company with sample data and setup data. This type of company is available to you without switching to a 30-day trial period, which the other types do.  
- **Advanced Evaluation - Complete Sample Data**
    Create a company with the Advanced functionality scope, which has everything you need to evaluate the product for companies with advanced processes. This type of company is available to you without switching to a 30-day trial period, which the other types do.
- **Production - Setup Data Only**  
    Create a company that's similar to **My Company**, with setup data such as a chart of accounts, payment methods, and financial report definitions, but without sample data. You can use this company for a 30-day trial period.
- **Create New - No Data**  
    Create a blank company without setup data. You can use this company for a 30-day trial period.  

If you want to get started easily with a new company, choose **Production - Setup Data Only** and then import your own business data, such as customers, items, and vendors. Choose the **New** template if you want to set up everything from scratch. In that case, you can use the **Company Setup** assisted setup guide to help you get started with essential setup data.  

> [!NOTE]  
> When you create a new company, it takes a few minutes before you can access it in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The setup status on the **Companies** page shows when the new company is ready for you. Then, you can switch to the new company by using **My Settings**.  

During your 30 day trial, you can create any number of new companies, but they're only available during your trial. For more information, contact your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] partner. See also the [Dynamics 365 Business Central trial FAQ](trial-faq.md) article.  

Your administrator can learn more about trials and subscriptions [here](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/trials-subscriptions).  

## Copy a company

On the **Companies** page, you can use the **Copy** action to create a second company based on the contents of an existing company. Copying a company is useful, for example, when you want to test a company without disrupting production data.

> [!Important]
> Don't use the Copy action to take a backup of a company. To take a backup, start by exporting the database as a .bacpac file. For more information, see [Exporting Databases](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/tenant-admin-center-database-export) in the development and administration help.

[!INCLUDE [email-copy-company](includes/email-copy-company.md)]

[!INCLUDE [dataverse-copy-company](includes/dataverse-copy-company.md)]

## Set up the company

When you sign in to a new company, the **Company Setup** assisted setup guide helps you get started. The guide asks for information about your business, such as the address, bank details, and inventory costing method. This information forms the basis for many areas in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] so you won't have to set them up manually.  

For example, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes your company address in invoices and other documents and your bank information in payments. The costing method is used to calculate prices and inventory valuation.  

After the basics are in place, you can set up the remaining core areas. Then, you're ready to add business data, such as customers and vendors. For more information, see [Set Up [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]](setup.md).  

## Companies and environments

[!INCLUDE [company_environment](includes/company_environment.md)]

For more information, see [Switching to Another Company or Environment](ui-organization-switch.md). For more information about environments, see [Understanding the Infrastructure of Business Central Online](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/tenant-environment-topology) (in English only).  

## Changing a company's name

After you create a company, you can't change its name. You can, however, change its **Display Name**, which is text that shows for the company throughout the application.  

> [!TIP]
> You can rename a company if you're using [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises.

## Add Contoso Coffee

The Contoso Coffee app provides demonstration data to help you explore the advanced capabilities of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Find the app in AppSource, and install it in an empty company, for example a company in a sandbox environment. For more information, see [Introduction to Contoso Coffee Demo Data](contoso-coffee/contoso-coffee-intro.md).

# Selling Inventory Items in Assemble-to-Order Flows

If the **Assembly Policy** field on the item card of an assembly item contains **Assemble-to-Order**, the sales order process assumes that the item isn't in inventory and must be assembled for sales orders. When you add the item to a line on a sales order, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates an assembly order that's linked to the sales order. To learn more about how to sell assemble-to-order items, go to [Sell Items Assembled to Order](assembly-how-to-sell-items-assembled-to-order.md). However, if some of the sales order quantity is already available in inventory, you can decrease the assembly order quantity by changing the **Qty. to Assemble to Order** field on the sales order line.  

It's relatively rare for businesses to sell inventory items as assemble-to-order items. Assemble-to-order items typically aren't standard. They're customized to meet specific customer requirements. However, you might have quantities of assemble-to-order items in inventory due to returns or order cancellations. Those quantities should be picked and sold before new ones are assembled.  

> [!NOTE]  
> To check whether whether assemble-to-order items are already available for assembly orders, use the **Sales Line Details** FactBox on the sales order.  

You can do similar things when you're selling assembly items from inventory and some or all of the quantity isn't available. You can supply the missing quantity through an assembly order. To learn more about selling inventory and assembly items, go to [Sell Assemble-to-Order Items and Inventory Items Together](assembly-how-to-sell-assemble-to-order-items-and-inventory-items-together.md).  

> [!NOTE]  
> There are rules that apply to the **Qty. to Ship** field on sales order lines that contain a combination of assemble-to-order quantities and inventory quantities. To learn more about the rules, go to [Combination scenarios](assembly-assemble-to-order-or-assemble-to-stock.md#combination-scenarios).  

In this procedure, you replace assemble-to-order quantities with inventory quantities on a sales order line. The following steps provide an overview:

1. Determine availability.
2. Reducing that quantity from the linked assembly order.
3. Reserve the inventory quantity to make sure that it's picked and shipped for the order.  

## To sell inventory items in assemble-to-order flows

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Create a sales order. To learn about creating sales orders, go to [Sell Products](sales-how-sell-products.md).  
3. On a sales order line that contains an assemble-to-order item, in the **Quantity** field, enter the quantity.  
4. In the **Sales Line Details** FactBox, determine whether some of all of the quantity is available.  
5. In the **Qty. to Assemble to Order** field, deduct the available quantity so that only the unavailable quantity is assembled to the order. The **Reserved Quantity** field is decreased accordingly to reflect that the order-to-order link, or reservation, only applies to the quantity to be assembled.  
6. On the **Lines** FastTab, choose **Functions**, and then choose the **Reserve** action.  
7. On the **Reservation** page, select the item ledger entry line or lines that contain the available quantities, choose the **Reserve from Current Line** action, and then choose the **OK** button.  

    On the **Sales Order** page, the **Reserved Quantity** field now shows that the full quantity for the order line is reserved. The **Qty. to Assemble to Order** field still reflects the quantity to assemble.  

8. Release the sales order to make the items available for picking and for assembly of the unavailable items. To learn more about assembling items, go to [Assemble Items](assembly-how-to-assemble-items.md).  

> [!CAUTION]  
> The **Bin Code** field on the sales order might contain the value from the **Assemble-to-Order Shpt. Bin Code** or **From-Assembly Bin Code** fields on the location card. If it does, the **Bin Code** field on the sales order line might be incorrect for this combination of assemble-to-order and assemble-to-stock quantities. It's a good idea to double-check that the bin in the **Bin Code** field works for all quantities. Alternatively, enter the two different quantities on separate sales order lines.

# Business Central for Multi-Site and International Organizations
Organizations that have multiple sites often use a hub-and-spoke business model where a parent company, or headquarters, manages the overall operations of the business while each site functions as a single, standalone entity. Sites are often geographically distributed and have different needs for sharing information with the headquarter company. Additionally, sites typically don't need the same level of complexity, and often lack the resources to maintain a large system.

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] gives small and mid-sized businesses a business management solution that's easy-to-use and maintain at a low cost of ownership.

This article introduces some of the ways in which [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports a hub-and-spoke business model.

## Integrating the Headquarter Company and the Sites

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can integrate with the headquarter company's accounting system while meeting the varying needs of different sites, regardless of size, location, or type of business.

The following diagram is an example of different sites integrated with a headquarter company.

![Diagram Description automatically generated.](media/multisite-headquarter-sites.png)

## Meet the Needs of Domestic and International Sites

Business needs at sites often differ based on industry, business methods, or their relationship to the headquarter company. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can be easily adapted and extended for various types of businesses and locales. Microsoft AppSource offers a wealth of apps from Microsoft and our partners, and partners can quickly deploy [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with minimal disruption to daily operations.

For multi-national organizations, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports local legal requirements and business practices.

* For online versions, there are more than [40 localized country/region versions](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/compliance/apptest-countries-and-translations?toc=/dynamics365/business-central/toc.json) that you can install as extensions from Microsoft AppSource.  
* For on-premises versions, [country/region versions](/azure/architecture/solution-ideas/articles/business-central) are available either as Microsoft-localized versions or partner-led add-on localizations.

A network of more than 4,000 Microsoft partners world-wide provides local expertise.

## Respond Quickly to New Business Conditions

The headquarter company must be able to react quickly to business changes at each site. Combined with Power Automate, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can serve as an early warning mechanism.

# Add Business Central tab in Microsoft Teams

[!INCLUDE [online_only](includes/online_only.md)]

In Teams, tabs appear at the top of channels and chats, giving participants quick access to pertinent information. This article explains different ways to add a tab that displays [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] data.

![Tabs in Teams](media/teams-tab-border-2.png)

## About Business Central tabs

A [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] tab provides a focused view of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] list and card pages. The tab doesn't display the full [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] web client. There's no browser border, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] banner (for example with Tell Me, search, help) or top navigation menu&mdash;just page content and its actions. The content is interactive, meaning that you can select actions and links, change data, and more. You're limited to what you see and can do by the same permissions assigned to your account in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

Learn more about who can view the content of a [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] tab in [Who can see the content of a tab?](/dynamics365/business-central/teams-faq?tabs=tabs#who-can-view).

> [!TIP]
> Are you a developer? You can also add tabs programmatically using the Microsoft Graph API. Learn more in [Add Business Central Tabs to Teams](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-develop-for-teams-tabs).  

## Prerequisites

To add a [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] tab, the following requirements must be met:

- You have access to Microsoft Teams.
- You have a [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] license.
- You've installed the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app in Teams. Learn more in [Install the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] App for Microsoft Teams](across-install-app-for-teams.md).

To view [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] tab that was added by another participant in the channel or chat, the following requirements must be met:

- You have access to Microsoft Teams.
- You have a [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] license or limited access to Business Central with a Microsoft 365 license only. Learn more in [Business Central Access with Microsoft 365 Licenses](admin-access-with-m365-license.md).
- You've installed the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app in Teams.

## Add tab using recommended content

Use these steps to add a tab by choosing what to display from a readily available list of recommended content that's based your role center&mdash;without leaving Teams. Learn more about the content that you can choose from in [Where does the recommended content come from?](/dynamics365/business-central/teams-faq?tabs=tabs#where-does-the-recommended-content-come-from).

1. At the top of a channel or chat in Teams, select **+ Add a tab**.
2. In the **Search** box, type *business central*, then select the **[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]** icon and wait for the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] tab configuration window to appear.

   ![Shows the Business Central tab configuration window in Teams](media/teams-bc-tab-config-window.png)

3. The **Choose from content recommended for** option shows the company in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] that you working with. If you want to show content from another company, select the current company, then use the **Environment** and **Company** options to specify company you want to work with.
4. Select down arrow in the **Tab content** option and choose the content that you want to display.

   <!-- The list shows all pages that are bookmarked on your role center in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. To learn more about the content that you can choose from, see [Where does the recommended content come from?](teams-faq.md#recommended-content).-->
5. Some pages may include different views, which are variations of the page that's filtered to show specific data. To change the view for the content, select the down arrow for the **Preferred view** option and choose the view from the list.

   Learn more in [Save and Personalize Views](ui-views.md).
6. Select **Post to the channel about this tab** to automatically post an announcement in the Teams channel or chat to let participants know that you've added this tab.
7. Select **Save**.

## Add tab using a page link

Another way to add a tab by using a link (URL) to the page that you want to show. This way is useful when you want to display a specific [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] record or a list page that isn't bookmarked on your role center.

1. At the top of a channel or chat in Teams, select **+ Add a tab**.
2. In the **Search** box, type *business central*, then select the **[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]** icon.
3. Wait for the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] tab configuration window to appear, then select **Paste a [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] link instead** option.

   ![Shows the Business Central tab configuration window in Teams and highlights the link option](media/teams-bc-tab-config-window-page-link.png)
4. Go to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], and open the page that you want to display in the tab.
5. Copy the link to the page.

   There are two ways to copy the link. The easiest and preferred way is to select **Share** ![Share icon in Business Central](media/share-icon.png) > **Copy Link**. The other way is to copy the entire URL from the browser's address bar. Learn more in [Sharing Business Central Records and Page Links](across-working-with-teams.md).

6. Go back to Teams and paste the link in the **URL** box.
7. In the **Tab name** box, enter a name that displays on the tab.
8. Select **Post to the channel about this tab** to automatically post an announcement in the Teams channel or chat to let participants know that you've added this tab.
9. Select **Save**.

## Change a tab and its content

After a tab has been added, you can make certain changes to the tab. For example, you can rename the tab, move it, and remove it. You find these actions in the tab options that are available by selecting the down arrow on the tab.

![Shows the Business Central tab configuration window in Teams and the tab options menu](media/teams-bc-tab-config-window-options-2.png)

As for the content of a tab, you can modify the data, if you have permission. If you change the data, others won't see the changes until they leave the tab and come back. The same is true for you if someone else makes changes to data. You can't change the page that displays on the tab, so just remove the tab and add another one the suits.

You can also change your view of the page and its data, like sorting and switching the layout between list and tile views. When you make these kinds of changes, they won't affect what others see. They see what you originally posted, until they make similar changes themselves.

# Power BI FAQ

This article answers some of the questions you might have about working with Power BI and [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

<!-- ## [General questions](#tab/general) -->
## General questions

<!-- 26 -->
### I selected a report for my role center in Business Central. If I later make changes to the report's visuals online, does the role center automatically update to my changes?

Yes. The reports you see inside [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] are embedded directly from Power BI, and not a copy.

<!-- 3 -->
### Are the Business Central apps for Power BI available in languages other than English?

No. These apps are currently only available in English.

<!-- 24 -->
### Once a report is published on my powerbi.com workspace, can I download its pbix? 

Yes. Learn more at [Download a report from the Power BI service to Power BI Desktop](/power-bi/create-reports/service-export-to-pbix).  

<!-- 27 -->
### Can I download the apps as pbix files?

No. Currently, we don’t offer downloading pbix files for the official Power BI apps, because they're published on AppSource.

<!-- ## [User access and licensing](#tab/license) -->
## Questions about user access and licensing


<!-- 14 -->
### Do I need a Power BI Pro license to publish reports?

<!-- todo What does " or for every user that consults the published report" mean? fixed -->
No. A Pro license isn't needed to publish reports. The standard (free) Power BI license is enough. Learn more in [Power BI Licensing](admin-powerbi-setup.md#license).

<!-- 15 -->
### Is there anything I can't do with the free license?

You can't share reports or install the Business Central apps for Power BI. The free license allows you to create almost all variations of charts and reports.

<!-- 16 -->
### If someone shares a report with another person, then that person needs a Pro license to see the report. Are there plans to make this capability possible with the free license?

We don't have control over this requirement. Power BI sets this requirement. Learn more at [Share Power BI dashboards and reports with coworkers and others](/power-bi/collaborate-share/service-share-dashboards).  

### How do guest users and delegated admins access my organization's data and reports?

There are some differences and limitations for external users, like guest users and delegated admins. For instance, external users typically have a Power BI license assigned by their own organization. When they sign in to Power BI or Power BI Desktop, they connect to their organization's tenant and shared workspaces by default.

To access your organization's data and shared workspaces or reports, external users must connect to your Microsoft 365 tenant. From Power BI service, they can use the tenant switcher (preview) to connect. Power BI Desktop doesn't support connecting to a provider tenant's data source or service for creating and publishing reports. External users need to use the Power BI service to upload Power BI Desktop files.

## Questions about the Power BI Designer

<!-- 7 -->
### Does the connector work with pages exposed as web services?

Web services are an old technology and aren't recommended to use with Power BI. The Power BI connector supports both Business Central web services and API pages, but API pages generally have better performances and are more suited for making data available to other systems. Learn more at [Enable Power BI connector to work with Business Central APIs, instead of with web services only](/dynamics365-release-plan/2021wave1/smb/dynamics365-business-central/enable-power-bi-connector-work-business-central-apis-instead-web-services-only).

### Can I build a Power BI report using the Sales Invoice Lines or Journal Lines APIs?

The most commonly used line records are available in the [Business Central APIs v2.0](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/api-reference/v2.0/)). So you can use them to build reports in Power BI by selecting them in the **Dynamics 365 Business Central** connector. However, the **Lines** APIs are designed for use with specific filters only, and might not work in your scenario. You might get an error similar to "You must specify an ID or a Document ID to get the lines." To fix this problem, do the following steps when getting data from Business Central for the report in Power BI Desktop:

1. Instead of including the data source for the lines entity, add the parent data source. For example, add **Sales Invoice** instead of **Sales Invoice Lines**.
2. Select **Transform Data** in the Power BI Desktop action bar.
3. Select the query you just added, for example **Sales Invoices**.
4. To reduce the number of records loaded in your report, apply any needed filtering on the records.
5. Scroll vertically until you find a column named as the lines, for example **SalesInvoiceLines**.
6. Select the expand button in the header of the column, next to the column name.

   :::image type="content" source="media/saleinvoicelines.png" alt-text="Shows the SalesInvoiceLines column in Power BI Desktop.":::
<!-- 11 --> 
### Is it possible to choose which Business Central environment to get data from for Power BI, for example, like a sandbox or production environment? 

Yes. It can be easily chosen. When you connect to Business Central using the connector, you have to choose the environment and company name.

<!-- 6 --> 
### Can I merge data from several production environments of the same tenant?

Yes. In Power BI, just run the "get data" operation again and choose the environment you want.

<!-- 25 -->
### Which pages in Business Central have the Power BI Report part?  

Currently, there are a few selected pages that have a FactBox with a **Power BI Reports** part for displaying a report. 

On list pages, the **Power BI Reports** part is filtered to show reports that pertain to data in the list. Here's the list type pages that include the **Power BI Reports** part:

|Page ID|Name|
|-------|----|
|22|Customer List|
|27|Vendor List|
|31|Item List|
|9305|Sales Order List|
|9308|Purchase Invoices|

Here are other pages that contain the larger, nonfiltered **Power BI Reports** part:

|Page ID|Name|
|-------|----|
|1156|Company Detail|
|4013|Intelligent Cloud Insights |
|9006|Order Processor Role Center|
|9008|Whse. Basic Role Center|
|9010|Production Planner Role Center|
|9015|Job Project Manager RC|
|9016|Service Dispatcher Role Center|
|9022|Business Manager Role Center|
|9024|Security Admin Role Center|
|9026|Sales & Relationship Mgr. RC|
|9027|Accountant Role Center|

> [!TIP]
> We don't have plans to add it to all list pages at the moment. However, you can create a simple page extension that adds the **Power BI Reports** part in a FactBox. Learn more at [Adding Power BI Report Parts to Pages](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-power-bi-report-parts) in the Developer and IT Pro help.

<!-- 5 -->
### Is there any way to filter a dataset from Business Central *before* I pull it into Power BI, instead of applying filters afterwards?

To filter larger datasets, the easiest way is to set a filter on your Power BI report by editing directly the Power Query formula. Most of the filters you set this way are passed on to Business Central through query folding. See [Incremental refresh for datasets](/power-bi/admin/service-premium-incremental-refresh).

There's currently no way of setting a filter for the web service data from within Business Central. If your application needs to set a filter from within Business Central, you must create a custom Business Central App for this purpose.

<!-- 10 -->
### From Power BI, besides using a query, is there another way to get data from Business Central tables that don't have an associated page? For example, like the *Item Attributes Value Mapping* table.

No. Not at this point.

<!-- 12 --> 
### Are published queries faster to use than published pages?

When it comes to web services, published queries are usually faster than equivalent published pages. The reason is that queries are optimized for reading data and don’t contain expensive triggers like OnAfterGetRecord.

Web services are based on pages or queries that are built for access from the web and not optimized for access from external services. Even though the Business Central connector still supports getting data from web services, we encourage you to use API pages instead of web services whenever possible.

<!-- 13 --> 
### Is there a way for an end user to create a web service with a column that's in a Business Central table, but not a page? Or does the developer have to create a custom query? 

There's currently no way of adding a new field to a web service. API pages offer full flexibility on the page structure, so a developer can create a new API page to meet this requirement. 

<!-- 28 --> 
### Can I connect Power BI to a read-only database server of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online? 

By default, the Power BI connector reads data from a read-only replica of the Business Central database, which is the case for all reports created after February 2022. This behavior causes your reports to refresh faster and has less impact on performance if you're using Business Central while a report is refreshing. We still recommend that you schedule your reports to refresh outside of normal working hours whenever possible.

If you have old reports based on Business Central data, they don't connect to the read-only database replica. In this case, consider recreating the query inside Power BI so that it uses the latest defaults.

### <a name="databasemods"></a>When I use the Power BI connector to connect to my custom [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] API page, I get the error "Cannot insert a record. Current connection intent is Read-Only." How can I fix it?

Reports that use Business Central data connect to a read-only replica of the Business Central database by default. In rare cases, this behavior might cause the error "Current connection intent is Read-Only.". This error typically happens because your custom API is making modifications to Business Central records while Power BI tries to get the data. In particular, it happens as part of the AL triggers: OnInit, OnOpenPage, OnFindRecord, OnNextRecord, OnAfterGetRecord, and OnAfterGetCurrRecord.

To fix this issue by forcing the Business Central connector to allow this behavior, see [Building Power BI Reports to Display Business Central Data - Fixing Problems](across-how-use-financials-data-source-powerbi.md#fixing-problems).

<!--
In general, we recommend avoiding any database modifications in API pages when they're opening or loading records, because they cause performance issues and might cause your report refresh to fail. In some cases, you might still need to make a database modification when your custom API page opens or loads records. You can force the Business Central connector to allow this behavior. Do the following steps when getting data from Business Central for the report in Power BI Desktop:

1. Start Power BI Desktop.
2. In the ribbon, select **Get Data** > **Online Services**.
3. In the **Online Services** pane, select **Dynamics 365 Business Central**, then **Connect**.
4. In the **Navigator** window, select the API endpoint that you want to load data from.
5. In the preview pane on the right, you'll see the following error:

   *Dynamics365BusinessCentral: Request failed: The remote server returned an error: (400) Bad Request. (Cannot insert a record. Current connection intent is Read-Only. CorrelationId: [...])".*

6.	Select **Transform Data** instead of **Load** as you might normally do.
7. In **Power Query Editor**, select **Advanced Editor** from the ribbon.
8.	Replace the following line:

   ```
   Source = Dynamics365BusinessCentral.ApiContentsWithOptions(null, null, null, null),
   ```

   with the line:

   ```
   Source = Dynamics365BusinessCentral.ApiContentsWithOptions(null, null, null, [UseReadOnlyReplica = false]),
   ```

9.	Select **Done**.
10. Select **Close & Apply** from the ribbon to save the changes and close Power Query Editor.

-->
### <a name="perms"></a>How do I change or clear the user account I'm currently using to connect to Business Central from Power BI Desktop?

In Power BI Desktop, do the following steps:

1. In the File menu, select **Options and settings** > **Data source settings**.
2. Select **Dynamics Business Central** from the list, then select **Clear permissions** > **Delete**.

Then next time you connect to Business Central to get data, you'll be asked to sign in.


<!-- ## [Performance](#tab/performance) -->
## Questions about data refresh performance

<!-- 17 -->

### Is it faster to get data using API pages than using web services?

Yes. Our tests indicate that API pages are up to 25% more performant than web services.

<!-- 18 -->
### Are there plans to have a mirror on the Azure SQL Database instance, which I can connect to directly?

No. Not at this point. You can only communicate with Business Central through APIs.

<!-- 19 -->
### Loading data from Business Central web services seems slow. Is there any way to get data directly from the SQL database table?

No. Direct access to the database isn't possible, but switching to API pages helps greatly.

## Troubleshooting questions

### My semantic model does not refresh. How do I see what is wrong?

[!INCLUDE [powerbi-refresh-tsg-include](includes/powerbi-refresh-tsg-include.md)]

<!-- ## [Advanced](#tab/advanced) -->
## Advanced questions
<!-- 1 -->

### Are there plans for the Power BI connector to support the incremental refresh features in the Power BI Service?

Yes. It's on our roadmap.

<!-- 2 -->
### If a Business Central on-premises solution doesn't have internet access, can I still use Power BI?
<!-- todo: please explain this one-->

Yes. In this case, you use Power BI Desktop locally and connect to the Business Central on-premises. Once connected, can create and view reports, but you just can't publish them to the Power BI Service. 
<!-- 20 -->
### Are there any plans to make it possible to replicate Business Central online databases so they're accessible for read-only SQL queries? This capability would support incremental refresh and be a lot faster than APIs or web services.

<!-- todo: what does "BC-Saas-DB-replicated DB accessible" mean? fixe-->
Yes. We have this feature on our long-term roadmap. 

<!-- 21 -->
### If I use Azure Data Factory to get data from Business Central and consume it on Power BI, does that help in increase in performance? 

Yes. This advanced scenario helps Business Central stay performant, because the data access would be done via the Azure Data Factory.

<!-- 22 -->
### Are there any plans to support Power BI deployment pipelines or a way to build deployment pipelines for PBI reports, similar to extensions? Or maybe even a simple API in the Business Admin Center? 

We're looking into this feature. Power BI offers rich APIs to control report deployments. Learn more at [Introduction to deployment pipelines](/power-bi/create-reports/deployment-pipelines-overview).

### When I get data from Business Central to use in my Power BI reports, I see some values like "_x0020_". What are these values?

Some API pages, including most API v2.0 pages, have fields based on [AL Enum objects](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-extensible-enums). Fields based on AL enum objects must have names that are consistent and always the same, so that filters on the report always work&mdash;no matter the language or operating system you're using. For this reason, the fields based on AL enums aren't translated and are encoded to avoid any special character, including the space. In particular, whenever there's an empty option in the AL Enum object, it's encoded to "_x0020_". You can always apply a transformation to your data on Power BI if you want to display some different value for these fields, for example "Empty".

# Use pre-closing reports

There are many standard reports that you can use to verify the accuracy of the accounts before closing the books at the end of a year or period. For example, you can use the **Customer - Trial Balance** report to verify that the balance for a customer posting group is equal to the balance on the corresponding general ledger account on a certain date.

The following table describes a number of reports that might be useful in this process.

| To | See this report |
| --- | --- |
| Print a detailed trial balance report for one or more bank accounts with additional information about individual entries. |Bank Acc. - Detail Trial Bal. |
| Print a detail trial balance for selected customers. |Customer - Trial Balance |

# Analyze data by dimensions

In financial analysis, a dimension is data you add to an entry as a kind of marker to group entries with similar characteristics. For example, dimensions often group entries for customers, regions, products, and salespeople. The groups let you easily retrieve data about them for analysis. You can use dimensions on entries in journals, documents, and budgets.

Each dimension describes the focus of analysis. So, a two-dimensional analysis, for example, would be sales per area. By using more than two dimensions when you create an entry, you can carry out a more complex analysis. An example of a complex analysis is exploring sales per sales campaign per customer group per area. That gives you greater insight into your business, such as how well your business is operating, where it is or isn't thriving, and where you should allocate more resources. That insight helps you make more informed business decisions. Learn more at [Work with Dimensions](finance-dimensions.md).

> [!TIP]
> As a quick way to analyze transactional data by dimensions, you can filter totals in the chart of accounts (COA) and entries in all **Entries** pages by dimensions. Look for the **Set Dimension Filter** action.

> [!NOTE]
> If you discover that an incorrect dimension value was used on posted general ledger entries, you can correct it and update your analysis views. To learn more, go to [Troubleshooting and Correcting Dimensions](finance-troubleshooting-correcting-dimensions.md#changing-dimension-assignments-after-posting).

## Set up an analysis view

An analysis by dimensions uses a selected combination of dimensions. You store, retrieve, and update that dimension set by creating an **Analysis View** card.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Analysis Views**, then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Analysis View List** page, choose the **New** action.
3. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
4. To add other dimension codes in addition to the four on the **Dimensions** FastTab, choose the **Filter** action, fill in the fields, then choose the **OK** button.  
5. To update the view, choose the **Update** action.

## Analyze by dimensions

Use analysis views you've already set up with the **Analysis by Dimensions** matrix to view the amounts in your general ledger.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Analysis Views**, then choose the related link.  
2. Select the relevant analysis view, then choose the **Analysis by Dimensions** action.
3. On the **Analysis by Dimensions** page, fill in the fields to define what data to show, and how.
4. Choose the **Show Matrix** action to open the matrix page for the analysis view.
5. To access details of an amount in the matrix page, choose the amount.  

- The columns on the left contain information based on what you've selected in the **Show as Lines** field in the header.  
- The columns on the right contain information based on what you've selected in the **Show as Columns** field in the header.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> You can't select a period length that's shorter than the period specified for the date compression on the **Analysis View** card. The **Next Set** and **Previous Set** actions aren't available if you've selected **Period** in either the **Show as Lines** or **Show as Columns** fields.  

> [!NOTE]  
> You can use the **Dimensions - Detail** report to display a detailed classification of how dimensions have been used on entries over a selected period. You can use the **Dimensions - Total** report to display only the total amounts.  

> [!TIP]  
> You can also change the view by changing the contents of the **Show as Lines** and **Show as Columns** fields. To reverse a view setting, choose the **Reverse Lines and Columns** action.

## Update an analysis view

The amounts on the **Analysis by Dimensions** page give you a picture of the company's state at the time of the last update. To get the current state, run the update action to update the analysis view.

Use the following procedure to update an analysis view from the **Analysis by Dimensions** page. The steps are similar to those for updating the **Analysis View Card** and **Analysis View List** pages.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Analysis Views**, then choose the related link.
2. Select the relevant analysis view, then choose the **Analysis by Dimensions** action.
3. On the **Analysis by Dimensions** page, choose the **Analysis View Code** field.  
4. Select the line with the relevant analysis view.  
5. On the **Analysis Views** page, select the analysis view, then choose the **Update** action.  

> [!TIP]  
> If you select the **Update on Posting** checkbox on an analysis view card, the view automatically updates when someone posts an associated transaction.

> [!NOTE]  
> To update some or all analysis views at the same time, use the **Update Analysis Views** batch job.

# Primary capabilities of financial reporting

This article describes the capabilities that are most widely used for the financial reporting features in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## Out of the box financial reporting

To help you get started with financial reporting, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides account categories, subcategories, and mappings to the company’s chart of accounts for basic financial reporting.

## Custom financial reporting

If you're already familiar with financial reporting and you want more complex reports, you can create your own.

## Comparative views

Beyond monthly balances or net changes, you can apply multiple views to any report you create. For example, you can use formula combinations for standard month to date and year to date views, view trends over the last 12 months, compare current amounts with the prior month or year, and more.

## Direct tie to the general ledger

Financial reporting is tied directly to detailed transactional postings from the general ledger.

## Use dimensions

Dimensions are data tags you can attach to postings to the general ledger to provide more business insights to financial reporting. Adding dimensions enriches the reports and expands them into operational reporting.

## Budget integration

Financial reporting can easily compare budget and actual financial results. You can do the comparisons for any date range and view the results at the general ledger and dimension levels.

## Ability to drill down

Numbers in financial reporting that aren't calculated by a formula can take you to the original transactions. You can make active analyses from the financial report to the account level, and from there to the invoices, credit memos, and ledger entries. This quick research tool lets you determine where the number came from, when it happened, what type of document was used, and even which user created the entry.

## Export to Excel

The Export to Excel feature lets you format financial reporting so that it looks the same every month, without manual work. Export to Excel makes it easy to produce a professional-looking financial package where values update each period.

## No coding needed

Financial reporting doesn't require that you know how to code. Finance professionals can build their own reports and make changes exactly when they need to. It's helpful, however, to understand:

* The structure of the chart of accounts.
* The dimensions that are used.
* The budget amounts.
* The basic differences between balance sheet and income statement accounts.
* Basic formulas.

# Configure Copilot and agent capabilities

This article explains how to control Microsoft Copilot and agent capabilities in Dynamics 365 Business Central. An administrator must complete these tasks.

Copilot is a system feature and an integral part of Business Central. Like most system features, you can't turn Copilot on or off. However, Business Central provides extensive transparency and control for administrators, including:

- Understand which Copilot and agent capabilities are available to your environment.
- Deactivate individual capabilities.
- Grant or deny access to individual users for each capability.
- Data governance controls.

There are different levels of access control for agent capabilities, depending on the feature:

- Allow data movement across geographical regions.

    This task is required only if your Business Central environment is in a different geography than the Azure OpenAI Service it uses. [Learn more about this task](#allow-data-movement-across-geographies).

- Activate the feature on the **Copilot & agent capabilities** page. [Learn more about this task](#activate-features).

If any of these requirements aren't met, the feature isn't available for use.

> [!NOTE]
> By default, starting with update 25.0, data movement across geographies is enabled, and all features are activated. This setup means Copilot is ready to use without any configuration unless you choose to deactivate specific features.

## Prerequisites

- You use Business Central online.
- You're an [administrator](#requirements-for-being-an-administrator) in Business Central.

## Allow data movement across geographies

This section applies only if the **Allow data movement** toggle switch appears near the top of the **Copilot & agent capabilities** page. If the **How do I govern my copilot data?** link appears instead of the **Allow data movement** option, skip this task.

![Screenshot that shows the Allow data movement option on the Copilot & agent capabilities page.](media/allow-data-movement-v3.png)

The presence of the **Allow data movement** toggle indicates that the location of your Business Central environment (where data is processed and stored) differs from the Azure OpenAI Service geography that Copilot uses. To enable Copilot, you must allow data movement between geographies. Learn more in [Copilot data movement across geographies](ai-copilot-data-movement.md).

You can choose to disallow data movement, which deactivates Copilot and all features. To allow or disallow data movement across geographies:

1. In Business Central, search for and open the **Copilot & agent capabilities** page.
1. Switch the **Allow data movement** toggle on or off as desired.

After an Azure OpenAI Service becomes available in the geography of your Business Central environment, your environment is automatically connected to it. At that point, the **Allow data movement** toggle no longer appears on the **Copilot & agent capabilities** page.

## Activate features

Copilot and agent capabilities are active by default when they're made available in preview or become generally available. On the **Copilot & agent capabilities** page, you can turn individual features off or on again for all users.

1. In Business Central, search for and open the **Copilot & agent capabilities** page.
1. The page lists all available Copilot and AI-related features and their status (*Active* or *Inactive*). The features are divided into two sections: preview and generally available.

    - To turn on a feature, select it in the list, and then select **Activate**.
    - To turn off a feature, select it in the list, and then select **Deactivate**.

    [![Screenshot that shows the Activate and Deactivate buttons for the feature lists on the Copilot & agent capabilities page.](media/copilot-agent-capabilities-page.svg)](media/copilot-agent-capabilities-page.svg#lightbox)

## Granting user access

Copilot and agent capabilities can offer functionality that is intended for any users across your organization or for specific user roles. Most Copilot and agent capabilities offer access control through permissions and permission sets in Business Central's permission management system. Learn more about permissions and permission sets in [Assign permissions to users and groups](ui-define-granular-permissions.md).

The following table lists the permissions that are required to use the Copilot features that Business Central provides.

| Copilot feature | Required permissions |
|---|---|
| Analysis assist | **DATA ANALYSIS - EXEC** permission set or execute permission on system object 9640 **Allow Data Analysis mode**. These permissions are the same permissions that are required to access the analysis mode. |
| Autofill | **Copilot Sys Features** permission set or execute permission on system object 9700 **Allow Copilot Autofill**. |
| Bank reconciliation assist | Permission on page 7250 **Bank Acc. Rec. AI Proposal** and page 7252 **Trans. To GL Acc. AI Proposal**. |
| Chat |**Copilot Sys Features** permission set or execute permission on system object 9690 **Allow Copilot Chat**. |
| Suggest substitute items| Permission on page 7410 **Item Subst. Suggestion** and page 7411 **Item Subst. Suggestion Sub**.|
| Summarize |**Copilot Sys Features** permission set or execute permission on system object 9680 **Allow Copilot Summary**. |
| Map e-documents | Permission on page 6166 **E-Doc. PO Copilot Prop**. |
| Marketing text suggestions | Permission on page 5836 **Copilot Marketing Text**. |
| Sales line suggestions | Permission on page 7275 **Sales Line AI Suggestions** and page 7276 **Sales Line AI Suggestions Sub**. |
|Sales Order Agent|Learn more in [Manage agent permissions and user access](sales-order-agent-setup.md#manage-agent-permissions-to-objects-data-and-ui-elements).|

To grant or deny access to specific non-Microsoft Copilot and agent capabilities, consult the feature's documentation or publisher for the required permissions.

## Requirements for being an administrator

You need SUPER permission in your Business Central user account or one of the following Business Central licenses:

- Delegated Admin agent - Partner
- Delegated Helpdesk agent - Partner
- Internal Admin
- Internal BC Administrator
- Dynamics 365 Administrator

Business Central doesn't yet offer granular, object-level permissions so that only specific administrators can configure Copilot.

## Next steps

For the Sales Order Agent, there are a few more steps you must complete before the agent is ready for use. Learn more in [Set up Sales Order Agent](sales-order-agent-setup.md#configure-and-activate-sales-order-agent).

For other Copilot features, you're ready to try them out. Learn more in the following articles:

# Manage Project Budgets

You can set up a budget for each project. The budget is used to plan the resources that you allocate to a project. The budget can be either general with few entries or it can contain more entries that are divided into activity levels. You can then compare the budgeted amounts with the actual usage as recorded in the project journal. By monitoring differences between actual usage and budgeted usage, you can control an ongoing project and improve the quality of future projects by reducing the risk of underestimating costs.

The following procedure describes how to estimate budgeted costs during planning. For information about recording budgeted versus actual project prices and costs, see [Record Usage for Projects](projects-how-record-job-usage.md).  

## <a name="JobBudgetCosts"></a> To estimate the budgeted costs for a project

When a customer wants to know the price of a project that will be invoiced based on usage, you must determine the budgeted costs for the project. Use the **Project Task Lines** page to do that.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Projects**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open a relevant project.
3. Select a task line of type Posting, and then choose the **Project Planning Lines** action.
4. On a new line, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

For the **Line Type** field, refer to the following information.  

| Line Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Both Budget and Billable** |The cost and price amounts entered on the planning line are the budgeted costs for the particular planning line. The price amount will be invoiced. |
| **Budget** |The customer is not charged for usage. Usage isn't transferred to an invoice, but is used to calculate WIP. |
| **Billable** |The customer is charged for usage. Usage is transferred to the invoice, based on the quantity specified in the **Qty. to Transfer to Invoice** field. |

> [!NOTE]  
> The **Planned Delivery Date** field for the planning line contains the date when usage related to the planning line is expected to be completed. It is also the date when the planning line may be transferred to a sales invoice and posted. <br /><br /> On the underlying project task on the **Project Card** page, the **Start Date** and **End Date** fields respectively contain the value of the **Planned Delivery Date** field on the earliest and latest project planning lines in the related **Project Planning Lines** page.

> [!NOTE]  
> When you fill in the **Quantity** field, all total price and total cost information will be calculated and filled in for that planning line. You can edit them at any time.

On the **Project Card** page, you can now see a summary of the total budgeted costs, budgeted price, billable cost and billable price for each task.

For information about recording budgeted versus actual project prices and costs, see [Record Usage for Projects](projects-how-record-job-usage.md).

# Work with Intrastat reporting

All companies in the European Union (EU) must report their trade with other EU countries/regions. You must report the movement of goods to the statistics authorities in your country/region every month, and the report must be delivered to the tax authorities. Intrastat is the system for collecting trade statistics of goods within these countries/regions. You use **Intrastat Report** to complete periodic Intrastat reporting (typically monthly), collecting, recording, and reporting trade of goods as per local government legislation.

Intrastat reporting is based on basic EU regulations that apply to all countries/regions; however, in practice, there are some differences within the individual countries/regions. Each country/region has its rules of what exactly and how to report.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This article describes the new Intrastat experience available in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] starting in the 2022 release wave 2, which includes extended features, but if you didn't upgrade your solution, read the previous version's Intrastat setup and usage article at [Set Up and Report Intrastat](finance-how-setup-report-intrastat-v20.md).

> Intrastat information doesn't apply to the movement of services between countries/regions, but only goods (Items and Fixed Assets). If the local government requires registering  the movement of services between countries/regions, it can be done using the **Service Declaration** feature.
>
> This features is available as an app at [AppSource](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2081646). At that time, to use it, you must first install it on the **Extension Management** page. Learn more about this functionality [here](finance-how-setup-use-service-declaration.md).  

## Fill in the Intrastat report

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Intrastat Report List**, and choose the related link.
2. Choose **New** action to create a new **Intrastat Report**.
3. If you need to enter some internal information about the **Intrastat Report**, fill in this information in the **Description** field.
4. In the **Statistic Period** field, specify the month to report data for. Enter the period as a four-digit number with no spaces or symbols. Depending on your country/region, enter either the month first and then the year, or vice versa. For example, enter either *2206* or *0622* for June 2022.
5. Choose the **Suggest Lines** action. The **Starting Date** and **Ending Date** fields will already contain the dates specified for the statistics period on the Intrastat report header.
6. In the **Cost Regulation %** field, you can enter a percentage to cover transport and insurance. If you enter a percentage, the content of the **Statistical Value** field in the journal is proportionally higher. But if you want to use this feature, you must switch the **Amount incl. Item Charges** field to **Yes**.
7. You can eventually set up extra configurations on the **Additional** FastTab:
   1. **Skip Recalculation for Zero Amounts** to specify that lines without amounts won't be recalculated during the batch job.
   2. **Skip Zero Amounts** to specify that item ledger entries without amounts won't be included in the batch job.
   3. **Skip Non-Invoiced Entries** to specify if item ledger entries that are shipped or received but not yet invoiced must be excluded from the process.
8. Choose **OK** to start the batch job.

The batch job retrieves all the item entries in the statistics period and inserts them as lines in the **Intrastat Report** lines. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

## Modify the Intrastat report

If needed, you can modify the lines, but whenever you change a value in the Intrastat report line, the **Correction** field will be automatically marked as **Yes**. Eventually, you can add a new line manually if there's a reason for that. To add a new line manually:

1. On the **Intrastat Report** page, choose the **New Line** action in the **Lines** FastTab.
2. Choose the **Receipt** or **Shipment** option in the **Type** field.
3. In the **Source Type** field, choose one of the sources: **Item Entry**, **FA Entry**, or **Job Entry**.
4. Based on the **Source Type** in the **Item No.** field, you can choose an **Item** (in both cases, **Item Entry** or **Job Entry**) or **Fixed Assets**.
5. Fill in other fields as you need for the Intrastat reporting.

> [!NOTE]  
> When you manually add a new line to the Intrastat report, the **Date** field in the line must be inside the **Statistic Period** range you added on the header.

## Validate Intrastat lines

After you fill in the **Intrastat Report**, you can run the **Checklist Report** action to ensure that all information in the **Intrastat Report** is correct. Mandatory fields you have set on Intrastat Report Checklist page that is missing values will be shown in **Errors and warning** FactBox on the **Intrastat Report** page.

Run the **Intrastat Report Checklist** report to check Intrastat lines before they're exported to the required format. The check is run inside the **Intrastat Report**.

## Recalculate weight or supplementary unit of measure

If you got the error message *'Total Weight' in Intrastat Report Line must not be blank*, it's probably because you didn't set the **Net Weight** field on the used source, item, or fixed asset. In this case, search for the item or fixed asset card and add the required value. After that, you just need to reopen the **Intrastat Report** and follow these steps:

1. Choose the **Recalc. Weight/Suppl. UOM** action to recalculate the **Total Weight** and/or **Supplementary Quantity**.
2. Choose one of the options:

    1. **Weight** – to recalculate only the **Total Weight**, based on the current information about **Net Weight** on the item and fixed asset cards.
    2. **Supplemental UOM Qty** – to recalculate only the **Supplementary Quantity** on the **Intrastat Report** line if it exists, based on the current information about **Supplementary UOM** on the item and fixed asset cards.
    3. **Both** – to recalculate both **Total Weight** and **Supplementary Quantity**, based on the current information on the item and fixed asset cards.
3. Choose **OK** to start the batch job.

## Report Intrastat in a file

You can submit the Intrastat report as a file based on different local authorities' requirements. Before creating the file, you should run the **Checklist Report** to check if all lines contain all necessary and valid information. To create a file:

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Intrastat List**, then choose the related link.
2. Choose **Intrastat Report** you want to report as a file.
3. If you haven't already done this, fill in the **Intrastat Report** manually or choose the **Suggest Lines** action.
4. Choose the **Create File** action.
5. The Intrastat file will be saved in the required format.

Once you create the file, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will automatically fill in the following details about reporting:

* The **Export Date** to specify the date when the report has been exported.
* The **Export Time** to specify the time when the report has been exported.

> [!NOTE]  
> Next time you create a file, the **Export Date** and **Export Time** fields will only keep information about the last file you created.

## Intrastat rules

### Grouping lines

In **Intrastat Report** lines, there's no grouping by any fields. All entries are copied from the original source, so you can quickly locate them based on the combination of **Source Type** and **Source Entry No**.

Grouping required by authorities will be provided in the exported file. You need to configure this in the **Data Exchange Definition**, which is fully configurable. Learn more at [Set Up Data Exchange Definitions](across-how-to-set-up-data-exchange-definitions.md).

### Fixed assets reporting

Fixed assets will be shown in the Intrastat lines only if:

* The **FA Posting Type** in the **FA Ledger Entry** field is **Acquisition Cost** and if the **Document Type** is **Invoice** in the case of purchases, and
* The **FA Posting Type** in the **FA Ledger Entry** field is **Proceeds on Disposal** and if the **Document Type** is **Invoice** in the case of sales.

### Intrastat report statuses

When you work with the **Intrastat Report** you'll see a **Status** field on the document header. You can find the following statuses together with related rules:

* **Open**: This status is created automatically when you create a new Intrastat report and you can make all operations in this status.
* **Released**: [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically changes the status to *Released* when you create a file. From that moment, you can't modify your **Intrastat Report**. If you need to change something and report again, you can use the **Reopen** action to reopen the Intrastat report. Once the document is reopened, you can use the **Release** action to release the document again.
* **Reported**: Specifies whether the entry has already been reported to the tax authorities. This isn't a regular status but an independent field, and even if you reopened the Intrastat report, it would still show that the file is already created for this report.

### Locations in Intrastat reporting 

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] always uses the information in the **Country/Region Code** field on the **Location Card** page as the country for **send from** or for **receive to** goods. When this information doesn't exist or location wasn't used, the system uses the information from the **Company Information** page.   

> [!NOTE]  
> If the company operates from more than one country, Intrastat reporting desn't work for all countries where locations are configured. Reporting is based only for the main country, as it's not currently possible to use multi-country reporting.  

### Triangular trade in Intrastat

Triangular trade involves trade between three countries or regions where goods bypass the reporting company's country. In Business Central, this can be facilitated through the [Drop Shipment](sales-how-drop-shipment.md) functionality. To enable this option, activate the **Include Drop Shipment** field in the **Intrastat Report Setup**.  

When you enable this option, the system uses the following rules, but only if you have the **Drop Shipment** marked in the **Sales Order**: 

| Receiving from | Delivering to | Expected Intrastat Result |
|----------|------------|----------------------|
| Country as in the **Company Information** | Country as in the **Company Information** | No Intrastat lines |  
| Country as in the **Company Information** | EU country different from the country in the **Company Information** | Intrastat shipping line | 
| Country as in the **Company Information** | Non-EU country | No Intrastat lines |   
| EU country different from the country in the **Company Information** | Country as in the **Company Information** | Intrastat receiving line | 
| EU country different from the country in the **Company Information** | EU country different from the country in the **Company Information** | No Intrastat lines |
| EU country different from the country in the **Company Information** | Non-EU country | No Intrastat lines | 
| Non-EU country | Country as in the **Company Information** | No Intrastat lines |  
| Non-EU country | EU country different from the country in the **Company Information** | No Intrastat lines |
| Non-EU country | Non-EU country | No Intrastat lines |

# Gross Requirement (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Gross Requirement** report looks at all outbound transactions to determine the quantity required per item.

The report shows the gross requirement for an item and the different documents that include it. This information is coupled with the **Project Available Balance** that calculates the balance at any point in time.

:::image type="content" source="media/inventory/gross-requirement.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Gross Requirement Power BI Report" lightbox="media/inventory/gross-requirement.png":::

## Use the report

The report helps management and procurement officers to determine whether the organization is keeping up with demand.

Managers can use the report to ensure that stock levels are high enough to maintain the production schedule and sales demand for each item. The report helps identify bottlenecks in production by showing items where the available inventory doesn't meet the gross requirement.

Procurement officers can view sales and production volumes and ensure your available balance meets the requirements for each item. With this information, you can make informed decisions on the items you should replenish.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The *Gross Requirement* report includes the following KPIs:

- [**Gross Requirement**](inventory-powerbi-kpis.md#gross-requirement)
- [**Project Available Balance**](inventory-powerbi-kpis.md#projected-available-balance)
- [**Qty. on Sales Order**](inventory-powerbi-kpis.md#qty-on-sales-order)
- [**Qty. on Purch. Return**](inventory-powerbi-kpis.md#qty-on-purch-return)
- [**Qty. on Service Order**](inventory-powerbi-kpis.md#qty-on-service-order)

# About item types

In the **Type** field on the **Item Card** page, you can select what the item is used for in your business, which affects the degree to which you can manage the item in inventory. The following table lists and describes the three types of items that are available.

|Option|Typical Purpose|
|------|-----------|
|Inventory|Physical things, such as bicycles, telephones, and desks, for which you want to be able to use all inventory processes. Inventory items can also include nonphysical items, such as software licenses and subscriptions, if the items have identification numbers, such as serial numbers. You can fully track item values and availability in inventory.|
|Non-Inventory|Typically, noninventory items are physical things, such as bolts or pens, that your business consumes but doesn't fully track in inventory. For example, because they're low-cost items and only used internally.|
|Service|A labor time unit, such as a consultancy hour, for limited business support.|

> [!NOTE]
> The **Service** and **Non-Inventory** types don't let you track inventory quantities and values. Only selected item transaction types and features are supported. The following table lists the features that the three item types support.

|Item Type|Sales|Purchasing|Job Consumption|Service Consumption|Assembly Consumption|Production Consumption|Assembly Output|Production Output|Location Transfer|Physical Counting|Inventory Revaluation|Inventory Costing|Item Tracking|Reservation|Warehousing|Planning|Order Planning|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|Inventory|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|
|Non-Inventory|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|No|No|No|No|No|No|No|No|No|No|Yes|
|Service|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|No|No|No|No|No|No|No|No|No|No|No|No|Yes|

## Costing methods for types of items

When you post inventory transactions, the quantity and value changes to the inventory are recorded in the item ledger entries and the value entries, respectively.

You record the cost of inventory items in the **Cost Amount (Actual)** field on the **Value Entries** page. When you reconcile the entry to the general ledger, the cost shows in the **Cost Posted to G/L** field. To learn more about inventory costing, go to [Design Details: Inventory Costing](design-details-inventory-costing.md).

For noninventory and service items, cost is recorded in the **Cost Amount (Non-Invtbl.)** field on the **Value Entries** page. For noninventory and service items, specify cost on sales, assembly, and production documents and journals. Specify the default cost in the **Unit Cost** field on the **Item Card** and **Stockkeeping Unit** pages. Costs for these types of items aren't reconciled to the general ledger.

## Catalog and service items

You can set up items that you offer to your customers but you don't manage in until you sell them as catalog items. Although catalog items are similar to regular items of the type **Non-Inventory** in this respect, don't confuse the two because there are differences. To learn more, go to [Work with Catalog Items](inventory-how-work-nonstock-items.md).

Customer items that you service, such as a printer, are called service items. Service items have nothing to do with regular or catalog items. However, service components can be regular items. To learn more, go to [Set Up Service Items and Service Item Components](service-how-setup-service-items.md).

## Resources

In addition to the item type *Item*, sales and purchase documents also allow you to use the item type *Resource*. Like items, resources support dimensions, price lists, and units of measure. <!--With introduction of types *Service* and *Non-Inventory* we do not have any intention to add any extra capabilities for type Resource in purchase and sales processes. We recommend using items of applicable type instead. Resources will continue get new functionality to track the time and effort that is involved with performing and providing services and will stay important part of project and service management. Because many partner solutions use resources, we do not plan to deprecate them in the sales or purchase documents.-->

# Transfer, split, or combine fixed assets

You can reclassify a fixed asset to transfer it to a different department, split it up, or combine it with other fixed assets. These registrations are done using the fixed asset reclassification journal.

To explore the results of fixed asset reclassifications, use the [Fixed Asset Book Value 02](reports/report-5606.md) report.

## To transfer a fixed asset to a different department

You might need to transfer a fixed asset to a different department. For example, when you put an asset in the production department for assembly and then move it to the administration department afterward.  

1. Set up a new fixed asset. Enter the new department as a dimension.  
2. Assign a fixed asset depreciation book to the new fixed asset. For more information, see [Acquire Fixed Assets](fa-how-acquire.md).
3. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Fixed Asset Reclassification Journals**, and then choose the related link.
4. Create a journal line where the **FA No.** field contains the original fixed asset, and the **New FA No.** field contains the new fixed asset to be moved. Fill in the other fields as appropriate.  
5. Choose the **Reclassify** action.

    Two lines are now created in the fixed asset G/L journal using the template and batch that you specify on the **FA Journal Setup** page for the depreciation book. For more information, see [Set Up Fixed Asset Depreciation](fa-how-setup-depreciation.md).
6. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **FA G/L Journals**, and then choose the related link.    
7. On the **Fixed Asset G/L Journal** page, choose the **Post** action to post the reclassification that you performed in steps 4 and 5.

If you posted an acquisition cost for an asset, you can use the fixed asset reclassification journal to split the acquisition cost among several assets.  

## To split a fixed asset into three fixed assets

You can split one fixed asset into multiple fixed assets. For example, when you need to distribute a fixed asset across three departments. In that case, you might move 25 percent of the acquisition cost and depreciation for the original fixed asset to the second fixed asset, and 45 percent to the third asset. The remaining 30 percent remains on the original fixed asset.

1. Set up two new fixed assets. Enter the relevant departments as dimensions.  
2. Assign fixed asset depreciation books to the new fixed assets. For more information, see [Acquire Fixed Assets](fa-how-acquire.md).
3. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Fixed Asset Reclassification Journals**, and then choose the related link.
4. Create two reclassification journal lines, one for each new fixed asset.
5. On the first line, enter the second fixed asset in the **New FA No.** field and **25** in the **Reclassify Acq. Cost %** field.
6. On the second line, enter the third fixed asset in the **New FA No.** field and **40** in the **Reclassify Acq. Cost %** field.
7. On both lines, select the **Reclassify Acquisition Cost** and **Reclassify Depreciation** checkboxes.  
8. Choose the **Reclassify** action.  

    Two lines are now created in the fixed asset G/L journal using the template and batch that you specified on the **FA Journal Setup** page for the specified depreciation book. For more information, see [Set Up Fixed Asset Depreciation](fa-how-setup-depreciation.md).    
9. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **FA G/L Journals**, and then choose the related link.
10. On the **Fixed Asset G/L Journal** page, choose the **Post** action to post the reclassification that you performed in steps 4 through 8.


## To combine two fixed assets into one

You can combine multiple fixed assets into one fixed asset, for example when you move distributed fixed assets into one department. If you posted acquisition costs and depreciation for the fixed asset to move, those values are combined in the single fixed asset.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Fixed Asset Reclassification Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. Create a reclassification journal where the **FA No.** field contains the fixed asset to move or combine, and the **New FA No.** field contains the combined fixed asset.
3. Leave the **Reclassify Acq. Cost %** field empty to move/combine the entire acquisition cost.  
4. Select the **Reclassify Acquisition Cost** and **Reclassify Depreciation** checkboxes.
5. Choose the **Reclassify** action.

    Two lines are now created in the fixed asset G/L journal using the template and batch that you specified on the **Fixed Asset Journal Setup** page for the specified depreciation book. For more information, see [Set Up Fixed Asset Depreciation](fa-how-setup-depreciation.md).  
6. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Fixed Asset G/L Journals**, and then choose the related link.
7. On the **Fixed Asset G/L Journal** page, choose the **Post** action to post the reclassification that you performed in steps 2 through 5.

## To view changed depreciation book values due to fixed asset reclassification

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Fixed Asset Book Value 02**, and then choose the related link.
2. Fill in the fields as necessary.
3. Choose the **Print** or **Preview** button.  

For more information, see [Fixed Asset Book Value 02 (report)](reports/report-5606.md).

# Get the Business Central desktop app

If you have a Windows (PC) or macOS computer, you can install a [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app on your desktop. The app works with [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online and on-premises.

## Why use the app?

The [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app resembles the web client, but it provides a few benefits like:

- The app is readily available from the **Start** menu, you can easily pin it to the task bar, or have it launch by default when you start your computer.
- In general, the app also is a faster and smoother to render on screen, with no performance differences, compared to running [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in the browser.
- The app opens in its own window, independent of any browser windows. This feature makes it easier to find when running a large number many apps or browser tabs.
- If there's more than one [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] environment (online only), you can install the app separately for each environment.

     When you open the app for specific environment, the environment name is included in the window title. When working across multiple [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] environments, each app window is displayed separately. The name makes it easier for you to see which window is associated with each environment.

## Install the app for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online

There are two ways to install the app for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online. You can install it directly from the browser or from Microsoft Store. Whichever approach you use, it's the same app. The difference is that  installing from the browser lets you install the app for each environment when there's more than one.

### From Microsoft Store

1. Go to [Microsoft Store](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2182870).
2. Choose **Get** > **Install**. 
3. When the app has been installed, choose **Open**, then sign in to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

The next time you want to open the app, look for it in **Start** menu.

### From the browser

1. Open the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] web client in either Microsoft Edge or Google Chrome.

2. If the page for selecting the environment appears, you can do one of two things:

   - Select the environment and go to the next step to install the app. In this case, the installed app will open the environment you select.
   - Don't select the environment, and just go to next step to install the app. In this case, the installed app will open the environment selection page, instead of a specific environment.

3. To install the app, depending on your browser, select ![Icon for installing an app in Edge.](media/ui-edge-install-app-icon.png) **App available. Install Business Central** or ![Icon for installing an app in Chrome.](media/ui-chrome-install-app-icon.png) **Install Business Central**, then **Install**.

  > [!TIP]
  > With Edge, you can also install the app by going to the **Settings and more** menu in the browser, then selecting **Apps** > **Install this site as an app** > **Install**.

Once installed, the app appears in the **Start** menu. If you've selected a specific environment for the app, the environment name is added to the app name in the **Start** menu.

## Install the app for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises

Installing the desktop app when you're using [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises is done directly from the browser as [described above](#from-the-browser). If you only have one tenant, just open [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in your browser, and select either ![Icon for installing an app in Edge.](media/ui-edge-install-app-icon.png) **App available. Install Business Central** or ![Icon for installing an app in Chrome.](media/ui-chrome-install-app-icon.png) **Install Business Central** as shown above.

The difference is when you have multiple tenants. Unlike [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, where you can install the app for different environments, you can only install the app for one tenant. So before you install the app when you have multiple tenants, be sure to switch to the correct tenant. Once installed, when you open the app, it will directly open the tenant.

# Setting up fixed assets

Before you can work with fixed assets (FA), you need to define a few things:  

* How you depreciate fixed assets.  
* How you record acquisition costs, depreciations, and other values in the general ledger.  
* Optionally, how to record insurance and maintenance on fixed assets.

The sections in this article link to more information about how to set up fixed assets. After you finish the setup, you can start working with fixed assets. For more information, see [Using Fixed Assets](fa-manage.md).  

> [!NOTE]  
> You can record fixed asset transactions in the **Fixed Asset G/L Journal** or **Fixed Asset Journal** pages, depending on whether the transactions are for financial reporting or for internal management. The help articles for fixed assets only describes how to use the **Fixed Asset G/L Journal** page.  

When you enable a fixed asset activity in the **G/L Integration** section on the **Depreciation Book Card** page, use the **Fixed Asset G/L Journal** page to post transactions for the activity.

## Required setup tasks

The following table contains a sequence of tasks to set up fixed assets, and links to related articles.

# Set up unrealized VAT for cash-based accounting

If you're using cash-based accounting methods, you can set up [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to handle unrealized VAT.

## To use general ledger accounts for unrealized VAT

You can choose to have VAT amounts calculated and posted to a temporary general ledger account when an invoice is posted, and then posted to the correct general ledger account and included in VAT statements when the actual payment of the invoice is posted. Before you can do this, you must complete the [VAT posting setup](finance-setup-vat.md).

To use accounts for unrealized VAT, follow these steps:

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, and enter **General Ledger Setup**.
2. On the **General Ledger Setup** page, select the **Unrealized VAT** check box.
3. Choose the **Search for Page or Report** icon ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do"), and enter **VAT Posting Setup**.
4. On the **VAT Posting Setup** page, choose the VAT posting group, and then choose the **Edit** action.
5. In the **Unrealized VAT Type** field, choose an option to specify how to allocate payments to the invoice amount (excluding VAT) and the VAT amount itself, and how to transfer VAT amounts from the unrealized VAT account to the realized account. The following table describes the options.

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Blank | Choose this option if you don't want to use the unrealized VAT feature. |
| Percentage | Payments cover both VAT and the invoice amount in proportion to the payment's percentage of the remaining invoice amount. The paid VAT amount is transferred from the unrealized VAT account to the realized VAT account. |
| First | Payments cover VAT first and then invoice amounts. In this case, the amount transferred from the unrealized VAT account to the VAT account will equal the amount of the payment until the total VAT has been paid. |
| Last | Payments cover the invoice amount first and then VAT. In this case, no amount will be transferred from the unrealized VAT account to the VAT account until the total amount of the invoice, excluding VAT, has been paid. |
| First (Fully Paid) | Payments will cover VAT first (like the _First_ option), but no amount will be transferred to the VAT account until the full amount of VAT has been paid. |
| Last (Fully Paid) | Payments will cover invoice amount first (like the _Last_ option), but no amount will be transferred to the VAT account until the full amount of VAT has been paid. |

6. In the **Sales VAT Unreal. Account** field, choose the account for unrealized sales VAT.

    > [!NOTE]  
    > The VAT amount will be posted to this account, and stay there until the customer payment is posted. The amount is then transferred to the account for sales VAT.
7. In the **Purch. VAT Unreal. Account** field, enter the general ledger account for unrealized purchase VAT.

> [!NOTE]  
> The VAT amount will be posted to this account, and stay there until the customer payment is posted. The amount is then transferred to the account for purchase VAT.

# Set Up Base Calendars

You can assign a base calendar to your company and its business partners, such as customers, vendors, or locations. Delivery and receipt dates on future sales order, purchase order, transfer order, and production order lines are calculated according to the calendar’s specified working days. The main task in setting up a new base calendar is to specify and define the non-working days that you want to apply.  

## To set up a base calendar

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Base Calendar**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Choose the **New** action.  
3.  Fill in the **Code** field.  
4. Choose the **Maintain Base Calendar Changes** action.
5. On the **Base Calendar Changes** page, use the **Recurring System** field to mark a particular date or day as a recurring nonworking day. You can select either the **Annual Recurring** or **Weekly Recurring** option.  

    If you select **Annual Recurring**, you must also enter the relevant date in the **Date** field.  

    If you select **Weekly Recurring**, you must also select the relevant day of the week in the **Day** field. If you leave the field empty, you must fill in the **Date** field. The **Day** field is filled in automatically.  

When you make an entry, the **Nonworking** field is selected. You can choose to clear the check mark to make it a working day.  
 When you return to the base calendar card, you will observe that the nonworking day entries that you made have been updated. These entries now appear in red and the **Nonworking** field is selected.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  When setting up a new base calendar, you can select and copy lines from an existing calendar. You do this in the relevant **Base Calendar Changes** page.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  Any base calendar defined for the vendor or the location affects how the dates are calculated and rounded to working days.
Specifies a date formula for the time that it takes to replenish the item. It is used to calculate the **Planned Receipt Date** field, if calculating forward, and **Order Date** field, if calculating backwards. See [Lead Time Calculation](across-how-to-assign-base-calendars.md#lead-time-calculation).

## Lead Time Calculation

Any base calendar defined for the vendor or the location affects how the dates are calculated and rounded to working days. Accordingly, the two date fields on purchase order lines are calculated as follows under different conditions.

|Calculation Direction|Vendor Calendar Defined|Vendor Calendar Not Defined|
|---------------------|-----------------------|---------------------------|
|Forward|planned receipt date = order date + vendor lead time (per the vendor calendar and rounded to the next working day in first the vendor calendar and then the location calendar)|planned receipt date = order date + vendor lead time (per the location calendar)|
|Backward|order date = planned receipt date - vendor lead time (per the vendor calendar and rounded to the previous working day in first the vendor calendar and then the location calendar)|order date = planned receipt date - vendor lead time (per the location calendar)|

> [!NOTE]
> In addition to the lead time calculation that affects the planned receipt date and order date, as shown in the above table, warehouse handling time and safety lead time may be added to the formulas to make up the value in the **Expected Receipt Date** field, as follows: Planned Receipt Date + Safety Lead Time + Inbound Warehouse Handling Time = Expected Receipt Date.

> [!Important]
> If your location uses a significantly different calendar than your vendors do, then it is important that you set up specific calendars for those vendors, to calculate optimal vendor lead times. For information about how to set up vendor calendars, see [To assign a base calendar](across-how-to-assign-base-calendars.md#to-assign-a-base-calendar).

The contents of the **Lead Time Calculation** field is copied from either the item card or the SKU card, if the lead time is defined for the item, or on the **Item Vendor Catalog** page, if the lead time is defined for the vendor.

## To customize a calendar
The main task in customizing a base calendar for your company, or one of its business partners, is to enter any changes to working and nonworking day status.

For example, while a base calendar would typically list all Saturdays as non-working days, the customized calendar for a particular location may list all Saturdays during the months of November and December, and leading up to the holiday season, as working days.

The following procedure uses the case of the location as an example. Note that at this point, you have already assigned a base calendar to the location.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Locations**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the location that you want to update, and then select the **Customized Calendar** field. Note that a calendar must be selected in the **Base Calendar Code** field.
3. On the **Customized Calendar Entries** page opens, choose the **Maintain Customized Calendar Changes** action.
4. In the **Customized Calendar Changes**, add lines for customized calendar entries.

    When you enter a line, the **Nonworking** check box is selected. You can clear the check box if you want to change the status to a working day.

    You can use the **Recurring System** field to set a particular date or day as a recurring nonworking day. You can select either the **Annual Recurring** or **Weekly Recurring** option.

    If you select **Annual Recurring**, you must also enter the relevant date in the **Date** field. If you select **Weekly Recurring**, you must also select the relevant day of the week in the **Day** field. If you leave the field empty, you must fill in the **Date** field. The **Day** field is then filled in automatically. This could be useful if you want to mark an individual date as a nonworking or working day.

5. Choose the **OK** button.

On the **Customized Calendar Entries** page, you will observe that the date entries are updated with the changes that you made.

On the Location card, you will observe that the **Customized Calendar** field contains **Yes**, indicating that a customized calendar has been set up.

> [!Important]
> If you do not fill in the **Location Code** field on an order line, your company’s calendar is used.


If you do not fill in the **Shipping Agent Code** field on the order line, your company’s calendar is used.

> [!NOTE]  
> If you make changes to a base calendar for which customized calendar changes exist, all existing customized calendars are updated automatically.

## To assign a base calendar  
The following procedure schedules delivery dates on sales order lines for a customer as an example.

Base calendars are assigned to your own company, customers, vendors, locations, and shipping agents as follows:  

-   On the **Company Information** and **Customer** cards, the base calendar is assigned on the **Shipping** FastTab.  
-   On the **Vendor** card, the base calendar is assigned on the **Receiving** FastTab.  
-   On the **Location** card, the base calendar is assigned on the **Warehouse** FastTab.  
-   On the **Shipping Agents** page, the base calendar is assigned on the **Shipping Agent Services** page.  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customers**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Open the **Customer** card for whom you will assign a base calendar.  
3.  On the **Shipping** FastTab, in the **Base Calendar Code** field, select the base calendar that you want to assign.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  -   If you do not assign a base calendar to a company, all dates are calculated as working days.  
> -   If you enter a blank location on an order line, all dates are calculated as working days.  
> -   Any base calendar defined for the vendor or the location affects how the dates are calculated and rounded to working days.

> [!NOTE]  
>  Before you can make customized calendar entries, you must first assign a base calendar to the company.

# Manufacturing analytics

Businesses capture lots of data during daily activities that supports business intelligence (BI) for manufacturing, such as:

- Utilization
- Capacity
- Work center load
- Production time
- Production scrap

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides features to help you gather, analyze, and share your organization's manufacturing data:

- Power BI reports for manufacturing
- Ad-hoc analysis on lists
- Ad-hoc analysis of data in Excel (using Open in Excel)
- Built-in manufacturing analytics tools
- Built-in manufacturing reports

Each feature has its advantages and disadvantages, depending on the type of analysis you want to do and your role. To learn more, go to [Analytics, business intelligence, and reporting overview](reports-bi-reporting.md).

This article introduces how you can use these analytical features to gain insights into your manufacturing processes.

## Analytics needs in manufacturing

When you think about analytics in manufacturing, it might help to use a persona-based model that describes different needs at a high-level.

:::image type="content" source="/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/media/analytics-personas.svg" alt-text="Illustration of different personas for analytics" lightbox="/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/media/analytics-personas.svg":::

People in different roles have different needs when it comes to data, and they use data in different ways. For example, people in manufacturing interact with data differently than people in finance.

:::image type="content" source="/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/media/analytics-personas-scenarios.svg" alt-text="Illustration of how different personas have different analytics needs." lightbox="/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/media/analytics-personas-scenarios.svg":::

| Role  | Data aggregation | Typical ways to consume data          | 
|------------------- |-------------------| ---------------------- |
| COO / CFO / CEO | Performance data  | KPIs, dashboards, financial reports               |
| Plant Manager     | Trends, summaries | Built-in managerial reports, ad-hoc analysis      |
| Factory worker | Detailed data     | Built-in operational reports, on-screen task data |

## Using Power BI to monitor key performance indicators in manufacturing

A key performance indicator (KPI) is a measurable value that shows how effectively you’re meeting your goals. Businesses often use the following KPIs to monitor production performance:

- Capacity used (hours), either current or historical
- Utilization percentage, either current or historical
- Work center load percentage, allocated time (hours), or available capacity (hours)
- Cost amount variance or deviation percentage

:::image type="content" source="media/manufacturing/finished-production-order-breakdown.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Finished Production Order Breakdown Power BI Report" lightbox="media/manufacturing/finished-production-order-breakdown.png":::

These KPIs (and more) are available for manufacturing in the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-manufacturing-app-name](includes/power-bi-manufacturing-app-name.md)] for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

To learn more, go to [Manufacturing KPIs](manufacturing-powerbi-kpis.md)

### Reports in the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-manufacturing-app-name](includes/power-bi-manufacturing-app-name.md)]

[!INCLUDE [power-bi-manufacturing-app](includes/power-bi-manufacturing-app.md)]

To learn more, go to [Power BI Manufacturing app](manufacturing-powerbi-app.md).

## Ad-hoc analysis of manufacturing data

Sometimes you just need to check whether the numbers add up correctly, or quickly confirm a figure. The following features are great for ad-hoc analyses:

- Data analysis on ledger list pages
- Open in Excel

The Data Analysis feature lets you open almost any list page, such as **Item Ledger Entries** or **Capacity Ledger Entries**, enter analysis mode, and then group, filter, and pivot data as you see fit.

Similarly, you can use the **Open in Excel** action to open a list page, optionally filter the list to a subset of the data, and then use Excel to work with the data. For example, by using features such as Analyze Data, What-If Analysis, or Forecast Sheet.

> [!TIP]
> If you configure OneDrive for system features, the Excel workbook opens in your browser.

<!-- coming later
To learn more about how to do ad-hoc analysis on production data, go to [Ad hoc analysis of inventory data](ad-hoc-analysis-manufacturing.md).

## Built-in reports for manufacturing

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes several built-in reports to help manufacturing organizations report on their data.

[!INCLUDE [report-explorer-manufacturing](includes/report-explorer-manufacturing.md)]

To learn more about reports that are relevant for manufacturing, go to [Built-in production report overview](production-reports.md).

## On-screen manufacturing analytics

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] has several pages that give you manufacturing overviews and tasks to do, such as:

- [View the load in work and machine centers](production-how-to-view-the-load-on-work-centers.md)  

## Print barcodes for finished goods on production orders

To remove a step or two from the process of tracking finished goods, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers a **Print Label** action on the **Released Production Order** and **Finished Production Order** pages. The action prints a report that includes the **Item No.**, **Description**, **Unit of Measure**, and 1D and 2D barcode information from the orders. On the request page, you can also specify whether to print the **Lot No.**, **Serial No.** or **Package No.** values as barcodes.

> [!NOTE]
> Some printers and barcode/QR code formats require a specific implementation. You might need to upload a different Word template.
>
> Check with your equipment supplier to learn how to print Word documents on your device.
 If you decide to clone the report to create your own custom version, you can easily connect if you select **Prod. Output Item Label** on the **Report Selection Production Order** page.

# Manage storage by deleting documents or compressing data

A central role, such as the application administrator, must regularly deal with accumulating historic documents by deleting or compressing them.  

> [!TIP]
> Learn more about other ways to reduce the amount of data stored in a database by reading [Reducing Data Stored in Business Central Databases](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/database-reduce-data) in our Developer and IT pro documentation.

## Delete documents

In certain situations, you might need to delete invoiced purchase orders. However, you can't delete them unless you fully invoice and received the items in the purchase orders. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] helps you out by checking for that.

Businesses usually delete return orders after they're invoiced. When you post an invoice, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] transfers it to the **Posted Purchase Credit Memo** page. If you selected the **Return Shipment on Credit Memo** check box on the **Purchases & Payable Setup** page, the invoice is transferred to the **Posted Return Shipment** page. You can delete the documents using the **Delete Invd Purch. Ret. Orders** batch job. Before it deletes documents, the batch job checks whether the purchase return orders are fully shipped and invoiced.  

Blanket purchase orders aren't automatically deleted after you process and invoice all the related purchase orders. Instead, you can delete them with the **Delete Invoiced Blanket Purchase Orders** batch job.  

Businesses typically delete invoiced service orders automatically after they're fully invoiced. When an invoice is posted, a corresponding entry is created and can then be viewed on the **Posted Service Invoices** page.  

Service orders aren't deleted automatically, however, if the total quantity on the order was posted from the **Service Invoice** page rather than from service order itself. You might need to manually delete such invoiced orders by running the **Delete Invoiced Service Orders** batch job.  

## Compress data with date compression

You can compress data in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to save space in the database&mdash;which in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online can even save you money. The compression, based on dates and functions, combines several old entries into one new entry.

You can compress entries that meet all of the following conditions:

* They're from closed fiscal years.
* The **Open** field is set to **No**.
* They're at least five years old. If you want to compress data less than five years old, contact your Microsoft partner.

So, for example, vendor ledger entries from previous fiscal years can be compressed so there's only one credit and one debit entry per account per month. The amount in the new entry is the sum of all the compressed entries. The date assigned is the starting date for the compressed period, such as the first day of the month (if you compress entries by month). After compression, you can still see the net change for each account in the previous fiscal year.

The number of entries that result from a date compression depends on how many filters you set, which fields are combined, and which period length you choose. There's always at least one entry. When the batch job is finished, you can see the result on the **Date Compr. Registers** page.

You can compress the following data types using batch jobs.

* Finance entries - general ledger (G/L) entries, value added tax (VAT) entries, bank account ledger entries, G/L budget entries, customer ledger entries, and vendor ledger entries.
* Warehouse entries
* Resource entries
* Item budget entries
* Fixed asset (FA) ledger entries, FA maintenance ledger entries, and FA insurance ledger entries.

When you're defining criteria for the compression, you can keep the contents of certain fields using the options under **Retain Field Contents**. The available fields depend on the data you're compressing.

> [!NOTE]
> Before you can run date compression, your analysis views must be current. Learn more in the [Update an analysis view](bi-how-analyze-data-dimension.md#update-an-analysis-view) section.

After the compression, the contents of the following fields are always retained: **Posting Date**, **Vendor No.**, **Document Type**, **Currency Code**, **Posting Group**, **Amount**, **Remaining Amount**, **Original Amt. (LCY)**, **Remaining Amt. (LCY)**, **Amount (LCY)**, **Purchase (LCY)**, **Inv. Discount (LCY)**, **Pmt. Disc. Given (LCY)**, and **Pmt. Disc. Possible**.

## Posting compressed entries

Compressed entries are posted a little differently than standard posting. This difference is to reduce the number of new general ledger entries created by date compression, and is especially important when you keep information such as dimensions and document numbers. Date compression creates new entries as follows:

* On the **General Ledger Entries** page, new entries are created for the compressed entries. The **Description** field contains **Date Compressed** so the compressed entries are easy to identify. 
* On ledger pages, such as the **Customer Ledger Entries** page, one or more new entries are created. 

The posting process creates gaps in the number series for entries on the **General Ledger Entries** page. Those numbers are assigned to the entries on the ledger pages only. The number range assigned to the entries is available on the **G/L Register** page in the **From Entry No.** and **To Entry No.** fields. 

> [!NOTE]
> After you run date compression, you can't reverse vendor or bank ledger entries for any transactions that are affected by the compression.

The number of entries that result from a date compression depends on how many filters you set, which fields are combined, and the length of the time period you choose. There's always at least one entry.

> [!WARNING]
> Date compression deletes entries, so you should always make a backup copy of the database before you run the batch job.

# View Archived Workflow Step Instances

All completed workflow step instances are saved on the **Archived Workflow Step Instances** page.  

On the **Workflow** page, you create a workflow by listing the involved steps on the lines. Each step consists of a workflow event, moderated by event conditions, and a workflow response, moderated by response options. You define workflow steps by filling in fields on workflow lines using fixed lists of event and response values representing scenarios supported by the application code. Learn more at [Create Approval Workflows](across-how-to-create-workflows.md).

# Analyze cash flow in your company
The charts on the Accountant Role Center provide insights that can help you make solid decisions about what to do with your cash.  

| To answer questions like these | Use this chart |
| --- | --- |
| How long does the sales process tie up my cash?</br> Should I increase or reduce inventory levels? |Cash Cycle |
| When did cash move in and out of my company?</br> Are some periods better than others? |Cash Flow |
| Do the numbers seem off for a period?</br> Should I investigate? |Income & Expense |
| When might a cash surplus or deficit happens?</br> Should I pay down debt, or borrow to meet upcoming expenses? |Cash Flow Forecasts |

On the Accountant Role Center, under **Finance Performance**, the **Cash Cycle**, **Cash Flow**, and **Income & Expense** charts offer ways to analyze cash flow:  

* See figures for a period by using the timeline slider.  
* Filter the chart by choosing the source in the legend.  
* Change the length of the period, or go to the previous or next period, by choosing options on the **Finance Performance** drop down.  
* View the entries by choosing a point in the chart. For example, a point on the timeline or a column segment. If the numbers seem off, this is where you can make adjustments.  

Although it's separate, the **Cash Flow Forecast** chart is similar. You view details, filter results, and change what is displayed in the same ways. If you change a setting, you can refresh the forecast by choosing **Cash Flow Forecast**, and then **Recalculate Forecast**.

If you want to examine the forecast, in addition to forecast entries, you can also look at the cash flow worksheet. For example, you can see how the forecast:

* Handles confirmed sales and purchases.  
* Subtracts payables and adds receivables.  
* Skips duplicate sales orders and purchase orders.  

## To view a cash flow worksheet

1. Search for **Cash Flow Forecasts**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose a cash flow forecast, and then choose the **Cash Flow Worksheet** action.  
3. On the **Cash Flow Worksheet** page, choose the **Suggest Worksheet Lines** action.

# Marketing text suggestions with Copilot overview

<!--[!INCLUDE[ai-preview](includes/ai-preview.md)]-->

This article gives an overview the AI-powered capability provided by Copilot in Business Central.

## What is AI-powered item marketing text with Copilot

Copilot provides AI-powered writing assistance for Business Central users responsible for authoring marketing text (product descriptions) on items sold in online shops, like Shopify. With the click of a button, Copilot generates text that's engaging and creative, and that highlights key attributes of the specific item. With a bit of reviewing and editing, it's ready to publish.

Copilot uses Microsoft Azure OpenAI Service to access language models that recognize, predict, and generate text that's based on trained datasets. Learn more at [Microsoft Azure OpenAI Service](/azure/cognitive-services/openai/overview).

<br><br>  

> [!Video https://learn-video.azurefd.net/vod/player?id=aeb1c87f-2489-41f8-a3cf-28ed5e4196e4]

*The video doesn't exactly reflect how the feature currently works or looks in the product. The feature has changed since the video was produced. But it gives you a general idea of the feature and what you can use it for.*
  
## Where it's used

Copilot is available on item cards in Business Central. In Business Central, items are like products in other applications and shops. Each item can be managed from a card where you enter details about the item, like its dimensions, cost, or picture. This card also includes a box for entering marketing text. This marketing text can be published to your online shop to promote the item. Here's where Copilot comes in. By just selecting the **Draft with Copilot** action on the item card, Copilot will generate an intelligent draft text for you. Once you get the first draft, you can run Copilot again and again until you get a draft you like. When you have suggestion you like, you review and edit it for accuracy, then save it.

If Business Central is set up to connect to your online store on Shopify, you can take this text even further by publishing it with the item directly to your store by selecting **Add to Shopify**.

## Why and how to use it

AI-generated text can help you accelerate the time-to-market of products in online shops by limiting time used on copy writing. Some key benefits include:

- Helps users overcome writer's block by getting them started with an intelligent draft.
- Unlocks creativity to provide more engaging product descriptions.
- Improves consistency of marketing content for product lines.

You should consider the AI-generated text as a *suggestion only*. Suggestions can, in some cases, contain mistakes and even inappropriate text, so human oversight and review are required. Before you make the text publicly available, you must review it for accuracy and make appropriate changes.

## Supported languages

[!INCLUDE[copilot-language-support.md](includes/copilot-language-support.md)]

## Current limitations

Poor suggestions can result when vague or generic product names are used and specifics about an item are missing, like key attributes or a category.

<!-- Partner extensibility of the AI capability by using AL code isn't supported.-->

## Next steps

To get started, you'll need a Business Central (v23.1 and later) environment that's enabled with Copilot.

- If you're an existing Business Central customer, your Business Central admin will have to set up an environment that's enabled for marketing text suggestions. Learn more in [Configure Copilot and agent capabilities](enable-ai.md).

- If you're not a Business Central customer but want to try it out, you can sign up for a free trial. Learn more in [Sign up for a free Dynamics 365 Business Central trial](trial-signup.md).

Once you have an environment or trail that ready, go to [Add marketing text to items with Copilot](item-marketing-text.md).

# Create workflows to connect tasks in business processes

You can create workflows that connect tasks in business processes that are performed by different users. You can include system tasks, such as automatic posting, as steps in workflows that are preceded or followed by user tasks. Requesting and granting approval to create new records are typical workflow steps.  

On the **Workflow** page, create a workflow by listing the steps on the lines. Each step consists of a trigger and a response:

* An event that specifies the conditions that will start the workflow.
* A workflow response that defines what the workflow does.

[!INCLUDE[workflow](includes/workflow.md)]

When you create workflows, you can copy the steps from existing workflows or from workflow templates. Workflow templates are non-editable workflows [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides. The identifiers for workflow templates are prefixed with "MS-", such as in "MS-PIW". Learn more at [Create Workflows from Workflow Templates](across-how-to-create-workflows-from-workflow-templates.md).  

> [!NOTE]  
> All notifications about workflow steps are sent through a job queue. Make sure the job queue reflects your business needs. Learn more at [Use Job Queues to Schedule Tasks](admin-job-queues-schedule-tasks.md).  

:::image type="content" source="media/Workflows/workflow-example.png" alt-text="Illustration of a workflow example.":::

A workflow is divided into three sections:

1. **When Event**  
   This is where the trigger is selected.  
   Examples of a trigger:
   * A master data record is changed
   * A journal line is created
   * An incoming document is created or released
   * Approval of a document is requested
2. **On Condition**  
   The **conditions** are related to the event and allows creating filters to decide on how the workflow continues.
3. **Then Response**  
   The **responses** specify the next steps in the workflow.

The options for events and responses are system-defined. To add new options, you'll need to develop an extension.

## To create a workflow

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Workflows**, then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action. The **Workflow** page opens.  
3. In the **Code** field, enter a maximum of 20 characters to identify the workflow.  
4. To create the workflow from a workflow template, on the **Workflows** page, choose the **New Workflow from Template** action. Learn more at [Create Workflows from Workflow Templates](across-how-to-create-workflows-from-workflow-templates.md).  
5. In the **Description** field, describe the workflow.  
6. In the **Category** field, specify which category the workflow belongs to.  
7. In the **When Event** field, specify the event that must occur to start the workflow step.  

   When you choose the field, the **Workflow Events** page lists all available workflow events.  
8. In the **On Condition** field, specify one or more conditions that must be met before the event in the **When Event** field can occur.  

   When you choose the field, the **Event Conditions** page lists filter fields that can be conditions for the event. You can add new filter fields if you want.  

   If the workflow event is the change of a specific field on a record, use the **Event Conditions** page to select the field and the type of change.  

   1. To specify a field change for the event, on the **Event Conditions** page, in the **Field** field, select the field that changes.  
   2. In the **Operator** field, select either **Decreased**, **Increased**, or **Changed**.  
9. In the **Then Response** field, specify the response that will follow when the workflow event occurs.  

   When you choose the field, the **Workflow Responses** page lists all available workflow responses and response options.  
10. On the **Options for the Selected Response** FastTab, specify options for the workflow response by selecting values in the different fields that appear, as follows:  

    1. To specify options for a workflow response that involves sending a notification, fill the fields as described in the following table.  

    > [!NOTE]
    > These fields vary, depending on the response you've chosen.

       |Field|Description|
       |-----|-----------|
       |**Notify Sender**|Specify whether to notify the approval requestor instead of the approval request recipient. If you select the checkbox, the **Recipient User ID** field is disabled because the requestor of the approval, the sender, will be notified instead. The name of the workflow response changes accordingly, to **Create Notification for &lt;Sender&gt;**. If the checkbox isn't selected, the name of the workflow response is **Create Notification for &lt;User&gt;**.|
       |**Recipient User ID**|Specify the user the notification must be sent to. **Note**: This option is only available for workflow responses with a placeholder for a specific user. For workflow responses without placeholders for users, the notification recipient is typically defined by the **Approval User Setup**.|
       |**Notification Entry Type**|Specify a trigger for the workflow notification. The trigger can be a record change, an approval request, or passed due date.|
       |**Link Target Page**|Specify the page that the link in the notification opens. The page must have the same source table as the record involved.|
       |**Custom Link**|Specify the URL of a link included in the notification in addition to the link to the page.|

    2. To specify options for a workflow response that involves creating an approval request, fill the fields as described in the following table.  

       |Field|Description|  
       |-----|-----------|  
       |**Due Date Formula**|Specify the number of days the approver has to resolve the request. The period starts when the request is sent.|
       |**Delegate After**|Specify if and when an approval request is automatically delegated to the substitute. You can select to automatically delegate one, two, or five days after the date when the approval was requested.|
       |**Approver Type**|Specify who the approver is, according to the setup of approval users and workflow users. When the field is set to **Salesperson/Purchaser**, the user specified in the **Salespers./Purch. Code** field on the **Approval User Setup** page determines the approver. Approval request entries are then created according to the value in the **Approver Limit Type** field. Learn more at [Set Up Approval Users](across-how-to-set-up-workflow-users.md).|
       |**Show Confirmation Message**|Specify whether to show a confirmation message after a user requests an approval.|
       |**Approver Limit Type**|Specify the effect of limits for approvers. An approver's approval limit must be above the value on the request. The following options exist: <ol><li>**Approver Chain** specifies that approval request entries are created for all the requester's approvers up to and including the first qualified approver</li><li>**Direct Approver** specifies that an approval request entry is only created for the requester's immediate approver, regardless of the approver's approval limit.</li><li>**First Qualified Approver** specifies that an approval request entry is only created for the requester's first approver.</li><li>**Specific Approver** specifies that you notify the user chosen in the **Approver ID** field.</li></ol>|

    3. To specify options for a workflow response that involves creating journal lines, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

       |Field|Description|  
       |-----|-----------|  
       |**General Journal Template Name**|Specify the name of the general journal template that the specified journal lines are created in.|  
       |**General Journal Batch Name**|Specify the name of the general journal batch that the specified journal lines are created in.|  

11. Choose the **Increase Indent** and **Decrease Indent** buttons to indent the event name in the **When** field to define the step's position in the workflow.  

    1. Indent the event under the name of the previous step to indicate that it's the next step.  
    2. Indicate the step is one of several alternative steps that may start, depending on its condition, by indenting the event name to match the other alternative steps. Order such optional steps according to priority by placing the most important step first.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  You can only change the indent of a step that doesn't have a subsequent step.  

12. Repeat steps 7 through 11 to add more workflow steps, either before or after the step you've created.  
13. Turn on the **Enabled** toggle to specify that the workflow will start when the event on the first step of type **Entry Point** occurs. Learn more at [Use Workflows](across-use-workflows.md).  

> [!NOTE]  
> Don't enable a workflow until you're sure it's ready.  

> [!TIP]  
> To explore the relations between the tables used in workflows, choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, then enter **Workflow – Table Relations**.  

## Example of creating a new workflow using existing events

The following example creates a workflow to approve a change to the name of a vendor:

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Workflows**, then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action. The **Workflow** page opens.
3. In the workflow section, fill in the fields as described in the following table.

    |Field  |Value  |
    |---------|---------|
    |**Code**|**VENDAPN-01**|
    |**Description**|**Vendor Name Change Approval** |
    |**Category**|**PURCH**|

4. To create the first workflow step, do the following.

    1. In the **When Event** field, specify *A vendor record is changed*.  
    2. In the **On Condition** field, choose the word **Always**. Then, on the **Event Conditions** page, choose the **Add a condition for when a field value changes** link, then select the **Name** field. The result of this step is that the condition reads as *Name is Changed*.  
    3. In the **Then Response** field, choose the **Select Response** link. Then, on the **Workflow Responses** page, in the **Select Response** field, choose the **Revert the value of the \<Field\> field on the record and save the change** response. Then, in the **Options for the Selected Response** section, specify the **Name** field.  
    4. Choose the **Add More Responses** link, then add an entry for the **Create an approval request for the record using approver type <%1> and <%2>** response.  
    5. In the **Options for the Selected Response** section for the new response, change the **Approver type** field to **Workflow User Group**. Then, in the **Workflow User Group** field, specify the user group. Learn more at [Set Up Approval Users](across-how-to-set-up-approval-users.md).  
    6. Add a third response, **Send approval request for the record and create a notification**.  
    7. Add a fourth response, **Show message "%1"**. Then, in the **Options for the Selected Response** section, in the **Message** field, specify **An approval request has been sent**.  
    8. Choose **OK** to return to the workflow step.  

5. In the next line, add a new workflow step for the **An approval request is approved** event.

    1. In the **When Event** field, specify **An approval request is approved**.  
    2. Choose the line menu, then choose **Increase Indent**.  
    3. In the **On Condition** field, choose **Always**. Then, in the **Pending Approvals** field, specify **0**. The condition reads as **Pending Approvals:0** to indicate that the request doesn't require more approvers.  
    4. In the **Then Response** field, choose the **Select Response** link. Then, on the **Workflow Responses** page, in the **Select Response** field, choose the **Send approval request for the record and create a notification** response.  
    5. Choose **OK**.  
6. In the next line, add a second workflow step for the **An approval request is approved** event.  

    1. In the **When Event** field, specify **An approval request is approved**.
    2. In the **On Condition** field, choose **Always**. Then, in the **Pending Approvals** field, specify **>0**. The condition reads as **Pending Approvals:>0** to indicate that this isn't the last approver.  
    3. In the **Then Response** field, choose the **Select Response** link. Then, on the **Workflow Responses** page, in the **Select Response** field, choose the **Send approval request for the record and create a notification** response.  
    4. Choose **OK**.  
7. In the next line, add a workflow step for the **An approval request is delegated** event.  

    1. In the **When Event** field, specify **An approval request is delegated**.  
    2. In the **On Condition** field, leave the value as **Always**.  
    3. In the **Then Response** field, choose the **Select Response** link. Then, on the **Workflow Responses** page, in the **Select Response** field, choose the **Send approval request for the record and create a notification** response.  
    4. Choose **OK**.  
8. In the next line, add a second workflow step for the **An approval request is rejected** event.  

    1. In the **When Event** field, specify **An approval request is rejected**.  
    2. In the **On Condition** field,  leave the value as **Always**.  
    3. In the **Then Response** field, choose the **Select Response** link. Then, on the **Workflow Responses** page, in the **Select Response** field, choose the **Discard the new values** response.  
    4. Choose the **Add More Responses** link, then add an entry for the **Reject the approval request for the record and create a notification** response
    5. Choose **OK**.  
9. To enable the workflow, turn on the **Enabled** toggle.  

The following illustration provides an overview of the result of this procedure.  

:::image type="content" source="media/Workflows/workflow-example-2.png" alt-text="Illustration of the Vendor Name Approval workflow.":::

Next, test the workflow by opening an existing vendor card and changing their name. Verify that an approval request is sent after changing the vendor name.

# Service Price Management
The service price management functionality lets you apply the best price to service orders, set up personalized service price agreements for customers, improve service employees' efficiency, and accelerate the invoicing process.  
  
Service price management lets you set up different service price groups so you can consider the service item or service item group, in addition to the type of fault that the service task involves. You can set up these groups for a limited period of time, or for a specific customer or currency. You can use price calculation structures as templates to assign a specific price to a specific service task.  
  
For example, this makes it possible to assign specific items included in the service price, in addition to the type of work included. This also makes it possible to use different VAT and discount amounts for different service price groups. To make sure that the correct prices are applied, you can assign fixed, minimum, or maximum prices, depending on the agreements that you have with your customers.  
  
Before adjusting the price of a service item on a service order, you are provided with an overview of what the results of the price adjustment will be. You can approve of these results, or you can make additional changes, if you want to have a different result. The whole adjustment is performed line by line, which means that there are no additional lines created.  
  
Finally, service price group statistics and standard reports let you keep track of the profitability of each service price group.  
  
## Service Price Adjustment Groups  
You use service price adjustment groups to set up the different types of price adjustments for service lines. For example, you can set up a service price adjustment group that adjusts prices for spare parts, one that adjusts prices for labor, one that adjusts prices for costs, and so on. You can also specify whether the service price adjustment should be applied to just one specific item or resource, or to all items or resources.  
  
The service price adjustment function does not apply to service items under the following conditions:

* The item belongs to service contracts. You can only adjust the service prices of items that are part of a service order. 
* If the service item has a warranty. 
* If the service line has been posted as invoice, either fully or partially.  
  
When you run the service price adjustment function, all of the discounts in the order will be replaced by the values of the service price adjustment.  
  
## Service Price Groups  
You can set up service price groups to create groups of service items that receive the same special service pricing. When you have set up service price groups, you can then assign them to service items on service item lines. You can also assign service price groups to service item groups.  
  
Before you can assign a service price group to a service item, you have to determine to which fault area, currency, or service price adjustment group the service price group applies. You have to determine to which amount the service price should be adjusted, and whether this amount should include VAT and discounts. You also have to determine whether this adjustment concerns a fixed amount, or should only be applied under certain conditions.  
  
When you assign a service price group to a service item, all the special service pricing that you set up in this group will then apply for this service item.  
  
## Service Pricing  
You set up the actual types of service pricing (price adjustment type and price) for a combination of service price groups and customer price groups. For each type of service pricing, you select a service price adjustment group. You also specify the service price adjustment type, fixed, maximum, or minimum, and the actual price.  
  
For example, you can set up types of service pricing for a radio service price group. For customers without a price group, you can decide to have service pricing with maximum price on labor, which is the labor price adjustment group. For customers with a particular price group, you can decide to have service pricing with a fixed price on labor, the same labor price adjustment group.  

#### [Current Experience](#tab/current-experience)
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Items**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the service item, expand the **Prices and Sales** FastTab, choose the **Resource**, **Item**, or **G/L Account** action.
3. On the **Project Resource Prices**, **Project Item Prices**, or **Project G/L Account Prices** pages, fill in the fields as necessary.

  
## Service Price Adjustment  
Service price adjustment lets you adjust the price of an item, resource, general ledger account, or cost on a service order.  
  
After you have entered an item on the service item line, you then enter all information about the costs of this item on the service lines. When you run the Adjust Service Price function, you can preview the price adjustments. You can make modifications if you have to. When you acknowledge the modifications, the adjustments are calculated, and are then transferred to the service lines. You then post the service order.  
  
Depending on the type of service price adjustment, the total amount of the adjustments is calculated.  
  
The following table describes the calculations.  
  
|Option | Description |  
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
|**Fixed Price**|This means that you charge a fixed price for the service item, resource, general ledger account, or cost, regardless of the real costs or regular charges. Selecting this option means that the service price adjustment will reach the exact amount specified in the service price group.|  
|**Maximum**|This means that you put an upper limit on the charge to your customer, regardless of the real costs or regular charges. Selecting this option means that the service price adjustment will only be performed if the total price exceeds the amount specified in the service price group.|  
|**Minimum**|This means that you put a lower limit on the charge to your customer, regardless of the real costs or regular charges. Selecting this option means that the service price adjustment will only be performed if the total amount is less than the amount specified on the service price group.|

# Control add-in resiliency in Business Central

From update 20.0 of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], control add-ins that perform slowly are automatically detected and a dialog similar to the following is displayed.

![Busy control add-in.](media/controladdin-resiliency.png "Busy control add-in.")

An unhealthy control add-in might affect your Business Central experience and cause the page you're working on to start slowly. It has no impact on data and your changes are always saved. If you see the warning as shown above, you can hide it, but it might come back and if the problem persists, you should contact your administrator.

# Work with payment tolerances and payment discount tolerances

You can set up a payment tolerance to close an invoice when the payment doesn't fully cover the amount on the invoice. For example, payment tolerances are typically for small amounts that would cost more to correct than to just accept. You can set up a payment discount tolerance to grant a payment discount after the payment discount date.  

Use payment tolerances so that every outstanding amount has a set maximum allowed payment tolerance. If the payment tolerance is met, the payment amount is analyzed. If the payment amount is an underpayment, the underpayment fully closes the outstanding amount. A detailed ledger entry is posted to the payment entry so that no remaining amount is left on the applied invoice entry. If the payment amount is an overpayment, then a new detailed ledger entry is posted to the payment entry so that no remaining amount is left on the payment entry.

You can set up payment discount tolerances so that if you accept a discount after the payment discount date, it always posts to a payment discount or payment tolerance account.

## Applying payment tolerance to multiple documents

A single document has the same payment tolerance, regardless of whether you apply it on its own or with other documents. Acceptance of a late payment discount when you're applying payment tolerance to multiple documents automatically occurs for each document where the following rule is true:  

*payment discount date < payment date on the selected entry <= payment tolerance date*  

This rule also determines whether to display warnings when you apply payment tolerance to multiple documents. The payment discount tolerance warning displays for each entry that meets the date criteria. For more information, see [Example 2 - Tolerance Calculations for Multiple Documents](finance-payment-tolerance-and-payment-discount-tolerance.md#example-2---tolerance-calculations-for-multiple-documents).

You can choose to display a warning that is based on different tolerance situations.  

- The first warning is for the payment discount tolerance. You're informed that you can accept a late payment discount. You can then choose whether to accept tolerance on the discount date.  
- The second warning is for the payment tolerance. You're informed that all entries can be closed because the difference is in the sum of the maximum payment tolerance for the applied entries. You can then choose whether to accept tolerance on the payment amount.

> [!NOTE]
> Enabling the warning message will let choose how to process payments that are within tolerance. If you do not enable the message, and a tolerance level is specified, invoices with amounts that are within tolerance will be automatically closed and you cannot choose to leave the remaining amount. 

For more information, see [To enable or disable payment tolerance warning](finance-payment-tolerance-and-payment-discount-tolerance.md#to-enable-or-disable-payment-tolerance-warnings). 

## To set up tolerances

Tolerance on days and amounts allows you to close an invoice even though the payment doesn't fully cover the amount on the invoice. For example, because the due date for the payment discount has past, goods were deducted, or because of a minor error. This principle also applies to refunds and credit memos.  

To set up tolerance you have to set up various tolerance accounts, specify both payment discount tolerance and payment tolerance posting methods and then run the **Change Payment Tolerance** batch job.  
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Posting Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **General Posting Setup** page, set up a debit and a credit sales payment tolerance account and a debit and a credit purchase payment tolerance account.  
3. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customer Posting Groups**, and then choose the related link.    
4. On the **Customer Posting Groups** page, set up a debit and a credit payment tolerance account. For more information, see [Setting Up Posting Groups](finance-posting-groups.md).  
5. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Vendor Posting Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
6. On the **Vendor Posting Groups** page, set up a debit and a credit payment tolerance account.  
7. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Ledger Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
8. Open the **General Ledger Setup** page.  
9. On the **Application** FastTab, fill in the **Payment Disc. Tolerance Posting**, **Payment Discount Grace Period** and **Payment Tolerance Posting** fields.   
10. Choose the **Change Payment Tolerance** action.

    > [!NOTE]
    > When you choose **Apply to Oldest** in the **Application Method** field on a **Customer Card** page, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will not automatically post payment tolerances, even when they're within the thresholds set on the **General Ledger Setup** page. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] assumes that  the Apply to Oldest setting indicates that the customer (or you as a customer of your vendor) has an account with you where they regularly pay the balance. Therefore, remaining amounts shouldn't be removed by posting a payment tolerance entry.

11. On the **Change Payment Tolerance** page, fill in the **Payment Tolerance %** and **Max Pmt. Tolerance Amount** fields, and then choose the **OK** button.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> You have now set up tolerance for local currency only. If you want [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to handle tolerance on payments, credit memos, and refunds in a foreign currency, you must run the **Change Payment Tolerance** batch job with a value in the **Currency Code** field.  

> [!NOTE]  
> To get a payment tolerance warning every time that you post an application in the tolerance, you must activate the payment tolerance warning. For more information, see [To enable or disable payment tolerance warning](finance-payment-tolerance-and-payment-discount-tolerance.md#to-enable-or-disable-payment-tolerance-warnings) section.  
>
> To deactivate tolerance for a customer or vendor, block tolerances on the relevant customer or vendor card. For more information, see [To block payment tolerance for customers](finance-payment-tolerance-and-payment-discount-tolerance.md#to-block-payment-tolerance-for-customers).  
>
> When you set up tolerance, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] also checks if there are any open entries and calculates the tolerance for these entries.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> When you enable the **Adjust for Payment Discount** field on the **VAT Posting Setup** page, the VAT amount is considered as it relates to the **Payment Tolerances** and **Payment Discounts** amounts, and VAT will be reduced for both of transaction amounts if they exist. The system can't be configured to use VAT reducing only for one type of transaction.  

## To enable or disable payment tolerance warnings

The payment tolerance warning appears when you post an application that has a balance in the allowed tolerance. You can then choose how you want to post and document the balance.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Ledger Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **General Ledger Setup** page, on the **Application** FastTab, turn on the **Payment Tolerance Warning** toggle to activate the warning. To deactivate the warning, turn off the toggle.  

> [!NOTE]  
> The default option for the **Payment Tolerance Warning** page is **Leave the Balance as Remaining Amount**. The default option for the **Payment Discount Tolerance Warning** page the is **Do Not Accept the Late Payment Discount**.

## To block payment tolerance for customers

The default setting for payment tolerance is allowed. To disallow a certain customer or vendor payment tolerance, block the tolerance on the respective customer or vendor card. The following steps describe how to do it for a customer. The steps are similar for a vendor.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customer** or **Vendor**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Payments** FastTab, select the **Block Payment Tolerance** check box.  

> [!NOTE]  
> If the customer or vendor has open entries, you must first remove payment tolerance from entries that are currently open.

## Example 1 - Tolerance calculations for a single document

The following are some example scenarios showing the expected tolerance calculations and postings occurring in different situations.  

The **G/L Setup** page contains the following setup:

- Payment Discount Grace Period: 5D  
- Max Payment Tolerance: 5  

Scenarios with alternative A or B represent:  

- **A** In this case, the payment discount tolerance warning is turned off, or the user has the warning on and chose to allow the late payment discount (Post the Balance as Payment Tolerance).  
- **B** In this case, the user has the warning on and chose not to allow the late payment discount (Leave the Balance as Remaining Amount).

Remaining Amount per  

Normal Application Rules  

![Single payment tolerance rules 2.](media/singlePmtTolRules_GracePeriod.gif "Single payment tolerance rules 2")  

(1) If payment falls in these ranges, all application entries can be closed with or without tolerance.  

(2) If payment falls in these ranges, all application entries can't be closed, even with tolerance.  

#### (3) Payment Date is after 01/20/03 (Scenarios 10-15)

Remaining Amount per  

Normal Application Rules  

![Single payment tolerance rules 3.](media/singlePmtTolRules_Post0120.gif "Single payment tolerance rules 3")  

(1) If payment falls in these ranges, all application entries can be closed with or without tolerance.  

(2) If payment falls in these ranges, all application entries can't be closed even with tolerance.  

## Example 2 - Tolerance calculations for multiple documents

The following are some example scenarios showing the expected tolerance calculations and postings occurring in different situations. The examples are limited to scenarios that result in all entries in the application being closed.  

The **G/L Setup** page contains the following setup:
- Payment Discount Grace Period 5D  
- Max Payment Tolerance 5  

Scenarios with alternative A, B, C, or D represent the following:  

- **A** In this case the payment discount tolerance warning is turned off, or the user has the warning on and chose to allow the late payment discount (Post as Tolerance) in any invoice.  
- **B** In this case, the user has the warning on and chose not to allow the late payment discount on any invoice.  
- **C** - In this case, the user has the warning on and chose to allow the late payment discount on the first invoice but not the second.  
- **D** - In this case, the user has the warning on and chose not to allow the late payment discount on the first invoice but allowed it on the second.

# Manage and reconcile your bank accounts

A bank reconciliation should be completed at regular intervals for all your bank accounts to ensure that the company's cash records are correct. You do this by comparing and matching entries in your internal bank accounts with bank transactions at your bank, and then posting the balances to your internal bank accounts to make totals available to finance managers. Bank reconciliation is also a practical way to discover and resolve missing payments and bookkeeping errors.

You can perform the task on the **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** page where you match (reconcile) bank statement lines in the left-hand pane with your internal bank account ledger entries in the right-hand pane. Alternatively, you can perform this task on the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page as part of processing the payments that are represented on a bank statement. On both pages, you can fill in the bank statement information by importing a file or feed and you can use automatic matching suggestions.

> [!NOTE]  
> In the North American versions, you can also perform bank reconciliation on the **Bank Rec. Worksheet** page, which is better suited for checks and deposits but does not offer import of bank statement files. To use this page instead of the **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** page, deselect the **Bank Recon. with Auto. Match** field on the **General Ledger Setup** page. For more information, see [Reconcile Bank Accounts](LocalFunctionality/UnitedStates/how-to-reconcile-bank-accounts.md) under United States Local Functionality.

Before you can manage your bank accounts within [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you must set up each bank account as a bank account card. In addition, you must set up electronic services that you may use for bank statement import and payment file export. For more information, see [Setting Up Banking](bank-setup-banking.md).

The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the articles that describe them.

| Reconcile bank accounts in connection with payment processing on the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page. |[Applying Payments Automatically and Reconciling Bank Accounts](receivables-apply-payments-auto-reconcile-bank-accounts.md) |

> [!TIP]
> Use bank reconciliation to help verify that your books are up-to-date, and do not post the reconciliation until you are satisfied with the reconciliation.

# Depreciation methods for fixed assets

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports eight different methods of depreciation for fixed assets:

* Straight-Line (SL)
* Declining-Balance 1 (DB1)
* Declining-Balance 2 (DB2)
* DB1/SL
* DB2/SL
* Half-Year Convention
* Manual
* User-defined depreciation

## Straight-Line depreciation

With Straight-Line depreciation, you deprecate the asset value either with a fixed yearly percentage or with a fixed yearly amount over the depreciation period. When you use the straight-line method, you must specify one of the following options in the fixed asset depreciation book:  

* The depreciation period (years or months) or a depreciation ending date  
* A fixed yearly percentage  
* A fixed yearly amount  
* Depreciation period  

### Depreciation period

If you enter the depreciation period (the number of depreciation years, the number of depreciation months, or the depreciation ending date), the following formula calculates the depreciation amount:  

* Depreciation Amount = ((Book value - Salvage Value) x Number of Depreciation Days) / Remaining Depreciation Days*  

The remaining depreciation days are calculated as the number of depreciation days minus the number of days between the depreciation starting date and the last fixed asset entry date.  

Book value can be reduced by posted appreciation, write-down, custom 1, or custom 2 amounts depending on whether the **Include in Depr. Calculation** field is deactivated and whether the **Part of Book Value** field is activated on the **FA Posting Type Setup** page. This calculation ensures that the fixed asset is fully depreciated at the depreciation ending date.  

### Fixed yearly percentage

If you enter a fixed yearly percentage, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses the following formula to calculate the depreciation amount:  

* Depreciation Amount = (Straight-Line % x Depreciable Basis x Number of Depr. Days) / (100 x 360)*  

### Fixed yearly amount

If you enter a fixed yearly amount, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses the following formula to calculate the depreciation amount:  

* Depreciation Amount = (Fixed Depreciation Amount x Number of Depreciation Days) / 360*  

### Example - Straight-Line depreciation

A fixed asset has an acquisition cost of LCY 100,000. The estimated life is eight years. The **Calculate Depreciation** batch job is run biannually.  

For this example, the fixed asset ledger entry looks like this:  

| Date | FA Posting Type | Days | Amount | Book Value |
| ---- | --------------- | ---- | ------ | ---------- |
| 01/01/20 |Acquisition Cost |(Depreciation starting date) |100,000.00 |100,000.00 |
| 06/30/20 |Depreciation |180 |-6,250.00 |93,750.00 |
| 12/31/20 |Depreciation |180 |-6,250.00 |87,500.00 |
| 06/30/21 |Depreciation |180 |-6,250.00 |81,250.00 |
| 12/31/21 |Depreciation |180 |-6,250.00 |75,000.00 |
| ...      |             |    |          |          |
| 06/30/27 |Depreciation |180 |-6,250.00 |6,250.00  |
| 12/31/27 |Depreciation |180 |-6,250.00 |0         |

## Declining-Balance 1 depreciation

This depreciation method allocates the largest part of an asset's cost to the early years of its useful lifetime. If you use this method, you must enter a fixed yearly percentage.  

The following formula calculates depreciation amounts:  

* Depreciation Amount = (Declining-Bal. % x Number of Depreciation Days x Depr. Basis) / (100 x 360)*  

The depreciable basis is calculated as the book value at the beginning of the year. The number of depreciation days are the number of days between the posting date and the last depreciation date. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates depreciation assuming that any depreciation done in the fiscal year is done with this formula.  

The posted depreciation amount can contain entries with various posting types (write-down, custom1, and custom2) posted since the starting date of the current fiscal year. These posting types are included in the posted depreciation amount if there are check marks in the **Depreciation Type** and the **Part of Book Value** fields on the **FA Posting Type Setup** page.  

### Example 1 - Declining-Balance 1 depreciation

A fixed asset has an acquisition cost of LCY 100,000. The **Declining-Balance %** field is 25. The **Calculate Depreciation** batch job is run biannually.  

The following table shows how the fixed asset ledger entries look.  

| Date | FA Posting Type | Days | Amount | Book Value |
| ---- | --------------- | ---- | ------ | ---------- |
| 01/01/20 |Acquisition Costs |(Depreciation starting date) |100,000.00 |100,000.00 |
| 06/30/20 |Depreciation |180 |-12,500.00 |87,500.00 |
| 12/31/20 |Depreciation |180 |-12,500.00 |75,000.00 |
| 06/30/21 |Depreciation |180 |-9,375.00 |65,625.00 |
| 12/31/21 |Depreciation |180 |-9,375.00 |56,250.00 |
| 06/30/22 |Depreciation |180 |-7,031.25 |49,218.75 |
| 12/31/22 |Depreciation |180 |-7,031.25 |42,187.50 |
| 06/30/23 |Depreciation |180 |-5,273.44 |36,914.06 |
| 12/31/23 |Depreciation |180 |-5,273.44 |31,640.62 |
| 06/30/24 |Depreciation |180 |-3,955.08 |27,685.54 |
| 12/31/24 |Depreciation |180 |-3,955.08 |23,730.46 |
| ...      |             |    |          |          |

Calculation method:  

* Year 1: *25% of 100,000 = 25,000 = 12,500 + 12,500*
* Year 2: *25% of 75,000 = 18,750 = 9,375 + 9,375*
* Year 3: *25% of 56,250 = 14,062.50 = 7,031.25 + 7,031.25*
* ...

The calculation continues until the book value equals the final rounding amount or the salvage value that you entered.  

### Example 2 - Declining-Balance 1 depreciation

An asset's book value is 100,000 on 12/31/2022. You post a depreciation of 1,778 on 2/2/23, which is the expected (proportional) amount of the year's depreciation at 32 days. If you run depreciation on 6/30/2023 [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will suggest 8,222, because there are 148 days from 2/2/2023 until 6/30/2023. The expected remaining depreciation for 6/30/2023 is calculated using the following formula:

* *148/360 x 0.20 x 100,000 = 8,222*

### Example 3 - Declining-Balance 1 depreciation

If you post an amount that doesn't align with the Declining Balance 1 depreciation method, for example, 5,000, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] suggests the remainder of the expected amount.

An asset's book value is 100,000 on 12/31/2022. You post a depreciation of 5,000 on 2/2/2023, which is more than the expected (proportional) amount on 2/2/2023 at 32 days. If you run depreciation on 6/30/2023, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will suggest 8,222, because there are 148 days from 2/2/2023 until 6/30/2023. The expected remaining depreciation for 6/30/2023 is calculated using the following formula:

* *148/360 x 0.20 x 100,000 = 8,222*

### Example 4 - Declining-Balance 1 depreciation

An asset's book value is 100,000 on 12/31/2023. You post a depreciation of 95,000 on 2/2/2023, which exceeds the allowed depreciation amount for the year. If you run depreciation on 6/30/2023, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will suggest 5000, because there are 148 days from 2/2/2023 until 6/30/2023. The expected remaining depreciation for 6/30/2023 is calculated using the following formula: 

* *148/360 x 0.20 x 100,000 = 8,222*

However, the remaining book value is only 5,000, so [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will suggest 5,000 because a book value can't be negative.

## Declining-Balance 2 depreciation

The Declining-Balance 1 and Declining-Balance 2 methods calculate the same total depreciation amount for each year. However, if you run the **Calculate Depreciation** batch job more than once a year, the Declining-Balance 1 method results in equal depreciation amounts for each depreciation period. The Declining-Balance 2 method, on the other hand, results in depreciation amounts that decline for each period.  

### Example - Declining-Balance 2 depreciation

A fixed asset has an acquisition cost of LCY 100,000. The **Declining-Balance %** field is 25. The **Calculate Depreciation** batch job is run biannually. The fixed asset ledger entries look like this:  

| Date     | FA Posting Type  | Days                       | Amount    | Book Value |
| -------- | ---------------- | -------------------------  | --------- | ---------- |
| 01/01/20 |Acquisition Costs |(Depreciation starting date)|100,000.00 |100,000.00 |
| 06/30/20 |Depreciation      |180                         |-13,397.46 | 86,602.54 |
| 12/31/20 |Depreciation      |180                         |-11,602.54 | 75,000.00 |
| 06/30/21 |Depreciation      |180                         |-10,048.09 | 64,951.91 |
| 12/31/21 |Depreciation      |180                         |-8,701.91  | 56,250.00 |
| ...      |                  |                            |           |           |

Calculation Method:  

* *BV* = Book value  
* *ND* = Number of depreciation days  
* *DBP* = Declining-balance percent  
* *P* = *DBP*/100  
* *D* = *ND*/360  

The formula to calculate the depreciation amounts is:  

* *DA* = *BV* x (1 – (1 –P)<sup>D</sup>)

The depreciation values are:  

| Date     | Calculation                                                |
| -------- | -----------                                                |
| 06/30/20 |DA = 100,000.00 x (1 -(1 - 0.25)<sup>0.5</sup>) = 13,397.46 |
| 12/31/20 |DA = 86,602.54 x (1 - (1 - 0.25)<sup>0.5</sup>) = 11,602.54 |
| 06/30/21 |DA = 75,000.00 x (1 - (1 - 0.25)<sup>0.5</sup>) = 10,048.09 |
| 12/31/21 |DA = 64,951.91 x (1 - (1 - 0.25)<sup>0.5</sup>) = 8,701.91  |
| ...      |                                                            |

## DB1/SL depreciation

DB1/SL is an abbreviated combination of Declining-Balance 1 and Straight-Line. The calculation continues until the book value equals the final rounding amount, or the salvage value that you entered.  

The **Calculate Depreciation** batch job calculates a straight-line amount and a declining balance amount, but only the greater of the two amounts are transferred to the journal.  

You can use various percentages to calculate declining-balance.  

If you use this method, you must enter the estimated useful lifetime and a declining balance percentage on the **FA Depreciation Books** page.  

> [!NOTE]
> If you use any of the declining balance depreciation methods, and you want to run depreciation for multiple years, you must run each year's depreciation separately. If you run depreciation for the whole period from acquisition date to the end of the last fiscal year or last accounting period, it's likely that the results will be incorrect. For example, you might want to run it for multiple years if you have imported legacy data and you use the actual acquisition dates for your assets and want to catch up on accumulated depreciation. For declining balance methods, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates the allowed depreciation per year, starting with the registered book value for each year. It can't do a multi-year depreciation in one step.
>
> The **Fixed asset - Projected Value** report can project depreciations for multi-year periods, which might be confusing compared to the results you get if you run depreciations for multiple years using one of the declining balance methods. 

### Example - DB1-SL depreciation

A fixed asset has an acquisition cost of LCY 100,000. On the **FA Depreciation Books** page, the **Declining-Balance %** field contains 25 and the **No. of Depreciation Years** field contains **8**. The **Calculate Depreciation** batch job is run biannually.  

The fixed asset ledger entries look like this:  

| Date | FA Posting Type | Days | Amount | Book Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 01/01/20 |Acquisition Costs |(Depreciation starting date) |100,000.00 |100,000.00 |
| 06/30/20 |Depreciation |180 |-12,500.00 |87,500.00 |
| 12/31/20 |Depreciation |180 |-12,500.00 |75,000.00 |
| 06/30/21 |Depreciation |180 |-9,375.00 |65,625.00 |
| 12/31/21 |Depreciation |180 |-9,375.00 |56,250.00 |
| 06/30/22 |Depreciation |180 |-7,031.25 |49,218.75 |
| 12/31/22 |Depreciation |180 |-7,031.25 |42,187.50 |
| 06/30/23 |Depreciation |180 |-5,273.44 |36,914.06 |
| 12/31/23 |Depreciation |180 |-5,273.44 |31,640.62 |
| 06/30/24 |Depreciation |180 |-3,955.08 |27,685.54 |
| 12/31/24 |Depreciation |180 |-3,955.08 |23,730.46 |
| 06/30/25 |Depreciation |180 |-3,955.08 |19,775.38 SL |
| 12/31/25 |Depreciation |180 |-3,955.08 |15,820.30 SL |
| 06/30/26 |Depreciation |180 |-3,955.08 |11,865.22 SL |
| 12/31/26 |Depreciation |180 |-3,955.07 |7,910.15 SL |
| 06/30/27 |Depreciation |180 |-3,955.08 |3,955.07 SL |
| 12/31/27 |Depreciation |180 |-3,955.07 |0.00 SL |

`SL` after the book value means that the straight-line method was used.  

Calculation method:  

* Year 1 (2020):  

    *Declining-balance amount: 25% of 100,000 = 25,000 = 12,500 + 12,500*  

    *Straight-line amount = 100,000 / 8 = 12,500 = 6,250 + 6,250*  

    The declining-balance amount is used because it's the greater amount.  
* ...
* Year 5 (2025):  

    *Declining-balance amount: 25% of 23,730.46 = 4,943.85= 2,471.92 + 2,471.92*  

    *Straight-line amount = 23,730.46/3 = 7,910.15 = 3,995.07 + 3,995.08*  

    The straight-line amount is used because it's the greater amount.  

## Half-Year Convention depreciation

The Half-Year Convention method is only applied if you turn on the **Use Half-Year Convention** toggle for the fixed asset on the **Fixed Asset Card** page.  

You can use this depreciation method with the following depreciation methods:  

* Straight-Line  
* Declining-Balance 1  
* DB1/SL  

When you apply the Half-Year Convention method, a fixed asset has six months of depreciation in the first fiscal year, regardless of the contents of the **Depreciation Starting Date** field.  

> [!NOTE]  
> The estimated life of the fixed asset that is remaining after the first fiscal year will always contain a half-year using the Half-Year Convention Method. Thus, for the Half-Year Convention method to be applied correctly, the **Depreciation Ending Date** field on the **FA Depreciation Book** page must always contain a date which is exactly six months before the final date of the fiscal year in which the fixed asset will fully depreciate.  

### Example - Half-Year Convention depreciation

A fixed asset has an acquisition cost of LCY 100,000. The **Depreciation Starting Date** is 03/01/20. The estimated life is five years, so the **Depreciation Ending Date** must be 06/30/25. The **Calculate Depreciation** batch job is run annually. This example is based on a calendar fiscal year.  

The fixed asset ledger entries look like this:  

| Date | FA Posting Type | Days | Amount | Book Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 03/01/20 |Acquisition Cost |(Depreciation starting date) |100,000.00 |100,000.00 |
| 12/31/20 |Depreciation |270 |-10,000.00 |90,000.00 |
| 12/31/21 |Depreciation |360 |-20,000.00 |70,000.00 |
| 12/31/22 |Depreciation |360 |-20,000.00 |50,000.00 |
| 12/31/23 |Depreciation |360 |-20,000.00 |30,000.00 |
| 12/31/24 |Depreciation |360 |-20,000.00 |10,000.00 |
| 12/31/25 |Depreciation |180 |-10,000.00 |0.00 |

## Example - DB1/SL depreciation using Half-Year Convention

A fixed asset has an acquisition cost of LCY 100,000. The **Depreciation Starting Date** is 11/01/20. The estimated life is five years, so the **Depreciation Ending Date** must be 06/30/25. On the **FA Depreciation Books** page, the **Declining-Balance %** field contains 40. The **Calculate Depreciation** batch job is run annually. This example is based on a calendar fiscal year.  

The fixed asset ledger entries look like this:  

| Date | FA Posting Type | Days | Amount | Book Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 11/01/20 |Acquisition Cost |(Depreciation starting date) |100,000.00 |100,000.00 |
| 12/31/20 |Depreciation |60 |-20,000.00 |80,000.00 |
| 12/31/21 |Depreciation |360 |-32,000.00 |48,000.00 |
| 12/31/22 |Depreciation |360 |-19,200.00 |28,800.00 |
| 12/31/23 |Depreciation |360 |-11,520.00 |17,280.00 |
| 12/31/24 |Depreciation |360 |-11,520.00 |5,760.00 SL |
| 12/31/25 |Depreciation |180 |-5,760.00 |0.00 SL |

`SL` after the book value means that the straight-line method was used.  

Calculation method:  

* Year 1:  

    *Declining-balance amount = Full year amount = 40% of 100,000 = 40,000.* Thus, for half a year 40,000 / 2 = 20,000  

    *Straight-line amount = Full year amount = 100,000 / 5 = 20,000.* Thus, for half a year = 20,000 / 2 = 10,000  

    The declining-balance amount is used because it's the greater amount.  
* ...
* Year 5 (2024):  

    *Declining-balance amount = 40% of 17,280.00 = 6,912.00*  

    *Straight-line amount = 28,800 / 1.5 = 11,520.00*  

    The straight-line amount is used because it's the greater amount.  

## Duplicate entries to other depreciation books

If you have three depreciation books, B1, B2 and B3, and you want to duplicate entries from B1 to B2 and B3, you can turn on the **Part of Duplication List** toggle on the depreciation book cards for B2 and B3. For example, this setting can be useful in the following situations:

* Depreciation book B1 integrates with the general ledger and uses the fixed asset G/L journal.
* Depreciation books B2 and B3 don't integrate with the general ledger and use the fixed asset journal.  

When you make an entry in B1 in the fixed asset G/L journal, and turn on the **Part of Duplication List** toggle, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] duplicates the entry in book B2 and B3 in the fixed asset journal when you post the entry.  

> [!NOTE]  
> You can't duplicate in the same journal and journal batch as you're duplicating from. If you post entries in the fixed asset G/L journal, you can duplicate them in the fixed asset journal or in the fixed asset G/L journal using another batch.  

> [!NOTE]  
> You can't use the same number series in the fixed asset G/L journal and the fixed asset journal. When you post entries in the fixed asset G/L journal, you must leave the **Document No.** field empty. If you enter a number in the field, the number is duplicated in the fixed asset journal. You'll have to manually change the document number before you can post the journal.  

## Manual depreciation

Use the manual method for assets that aren't subject to depreciation, for example, land. You must enter depreciation in the fixed asset G/L journal. The **Calculate Depreciation** batch job omits fixed assets that use the manual depreciation method.

## User-defined depreciation

If the built-in depreciation methods don't meet your needs, you can define your own depreciation method by using depreciation tables. To learn more about applying a user-defined depreciation method, go to [Set Up User-Defined Depreciation Method](fa-how-setup-user-defined-depreciation-method.md).
