   | :----------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
   | **Code**                 | Enter the code for an agreement. Enter a maximum of 20 characters, both numbers and letters. It is created by default from the number series set up in the General Ledger Setup form. |

# Bank management

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], you can create bank directory structures to keep bank reference information in one location. Also, create budget classifications, add bank account details to specific general ledger accounts, and print and post required documents.

## Creating bank directory structures

You can use a bank directory structure to keep reference information about all the banks in one location. This information can be used to automatically fill in the corresponding fields in the **Bank Account Card**, **Vendor Bank Account Card**, and **Customer Bank Account Card** windows.

## Creating budget classification codes

You can use a budget classification codes catalog in bank payments that are made to the state budget, such as tax payments. These codes allow you to track the classification of budget payment types in the state budget.

 
## Creating bank account details records

You can use bank account details to define dimensions and other codes that are pertinent to bank payment orders and bank statements. Records in a bank operation that have the account type information set to **G/L Account** can have bank account details attached to the specified account. Bank account details are set up in the **Bank Account Details** window.

 
## Printing and posting required documents

By copying procedures from the posted bank payment order and cash order documents, you can prepare bank payment order documents, cash order documents, and payments in the payment journal. Then you can create the printed documents and post them in the required format.

 
You can print the following required bank management documents. 

| Report                        | Description                                                  |
| :---------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Bank Payment Order**        | This report is a copy of the bank payment order.             |
| **Bank Account G/L Turnover** | This report is a list of general ledger turnover information. |
| **Bank Account Card**         | This report contains information about bank operations.      |

By specifying SIE dimensions and file types, you can define the level of detail that's covered by import or export transactions. Learn more about Standard Import Export Group [here](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=164870&clcid=0x41d).

> [!NOTE]
> SIE Audit Files Export is part of the Swedish localization. However, as of version 22.1, the Swedish localization is based on the W1 base app, and the SIE functionality has been moved to the extension that's installed by default. This functionality is based on the Audit Files Export app that has the preinstalled SIE format. Learn more about Audit Files Export [here](../../finance-how-to-export-audit-files.md).

Even if the feature is preinstalled, it isn't enabled by default. To enable the feature, follow these steps.

1. Select the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, go to the **Feature Management** workspace, and then select the related link.
1. Find the **Feature update: Enable using SIE Audit Files Exports** feature. Then, in the **Enabled for** column, select **All users**.

## Audit files export

When you enable **SIE Audit Files Export** in Feature Management, you're guided through a wizard to set up the feature. However, you can set up the feature later by running the **SIE Audit File Export Setup Guide** page. If you want to manually set up the system, follow the steps in the [Audit files export](../../finance-how-to-export-audit-files.md) article.

### Set up SIE dimensions

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Dimensions SIE**, and then select the related link.
1. In the **Dimension Code** field, select one of the standard dimensions that you want to map.
1. In the **SIE Dimension** field, specify the number that you want to assign to the dimension.
1. In the **Selected** field, specify whether the dimension should be used when General ledger (G/L) data is imported or exported.

### Audit file export document for SIE

The **Audit File Export Document** page includes a few fields that are specific to SIE. You must set these fields before you begin.

- On the **SIE** FastTab, in the **File type** field, select one of the following values to specify the type of SIE file to create:

   - Year - End Balances
   - Periodic Balances
   - Object Balances
   - Transactions

    All other fields are set by default, based on your previous setup.

# Set up EU third-party purchase transactions in the Swedish version

European Union (EU) third-party trade occurs when you receive a purchase invoice from a customer in one EU country/region and the products are sent to a different EU country/region without entering Sweden. The transaction amount must be identified and reported separately to comply with Swedish VAT reporting and VAT Information Exchange System (VIES) requirements. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] includes Swedish enhancements that allow purchase transactions to be set up as EU third-party trade. Posted EU third-party transactions can then be filtered in VAT statements and excluded from the amount in the **Sales to Customer** column in the **VAT- VIES Declaration Tax Auth** report.  

> [!NOTE]
> **EU Third-Party Purchase Transactions** is a part of the Swedish localization. However, starting from version 22.1, Swedish localization is based on the W1 base app. The **EU Third-Party Purchase Transactions** functionality is moved to the global W1 extension installed by default. There are some minor functional changes. Learn more about EU third-party purchase transactions global feature [here](../../finance-how-to-eu3party-trade-purchase.md). The new feature can be used after you enable it in Feature Management. The old feature is automatically replaced with version 25.0.  

## Set up EU third-party purchase transactions  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Invoices**, and then choose the related link.  
1. Select an existing purchase invoice, or choose the **New** action to create a new one.  
1. On the **Invoice Details** FastTab, select the **EU 3-Party Trade** check box.  
1. Choose the **OK** button.

# Fixed asset posting of disposal

Czech accounting standards require specific posting when a fixed asset is being disposed of or being sold. After selling or posting fixed assets, the posting of disposal ensures that the fixed asset value remains the same as the acquired value after depreciation.

The fixed asset remains unchanged even after it's put to use. When the fixed asset is depreciated periodically, a corresponding sum is debited from the acquired cost at the time of disposal. The balance amount is the current fixed asset value.

On the **Depreciation Book** page, select the **Corresponding G/L Entries on Disposal** check box to make this feature operational. Also select the **Corresponding FA Entries on Disposal** check box to retain the correspondence between G/L entries and FA entries.

# Finance in the Czech version

In the Czech Republic, you can track and manage your finances with these specific [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] features.

## Corrections posting (Red Storno)

According to legal requirements, costs and revenues are typically only posted to either the debit or credit side of a general ledger (G/L) account. Companies in Eastern Europe usually enforce accounting policies requiring you to post certain inventory and G/L transactions as corrections. The reason for this is that auditors and revenue authorities conduct accounting controls against this rule.  

The purpose of the corrections posting feature is to allow the:

- Accounting manager to enforce corrective posting on desired G/L accounts.  
- Accounting manager to enforce corrective posting in inventory postings (such as negative transfer entries and expected costs posting).  
- Accounting manager to enforce corrective posting of canceling in fixed assets.
- User to enforce corrective posting with one select (in G/L, inventory, and project postings).  

## Statutory company information

Many documents are circulating within and outside company structures. Local legislations set the minimum statutory requirements for such documents. It's possible to divide such requirements into roughly three groups:

- Company officials' names must be present on some internal and external documents.
- Document footers, which most external documents must contain, consists of basic company information, usually in the company's partner language.
- Registration numbers must be visible in internal and external documents.

This statutory company information feature provides a solution for each group requirement. You can:

- Define company officials and designate them as General Manager, Accounting Managers, and Finance Managers for use in internal and external documents.
- Define document footers in different languages, which can be used on different reports and documents.
- Store additional company registration numbers and other registration information on the **Company Information** page for use in documents.

## Internal financial documents

Users perform general ledger operations and must have the capability to print documents for these operations, in a layout in compliance with legal requirements. You might also want to print a document for posted general ledger operations. For these reasons, this internal financial documents feature provides the following reports:

- General Journal – Test Report - Used to print documents from G/L journals.
- General Ledger Document Report - Used to print posted general ledger operations.

## Accounting output documents  

In order to comply with legislation, reporting features, and local reporting practices of Czech companies, this feature provides the following reports:

- General journal
- General ledger
- Accounting sheets
- Turnover report by global dimension
- Open G/L entries to date
- Inventory account to date
- Joining bank account adjustment
- Joining G/L account adjustment
- G/L value-added tax (VAT) reconciliation
- All payments on hold
- Open customer entries at date
- Open vendor entries at date
- Fiscal year balance – standard adjusted report 
- Trial balance by period – standard adjusted report 

## Financial reports

As one of the most extensively used features for analysis and reporting, Eastern European countries/regions often ask for the following improvements of the standard financial reports feature:

- Common list of expressions – This capability creates named lines for use in formulas in all financial reports. This is achieved by defining one of the financial reports as a common list of expressions called a *shared financial report.*
- Saving results (current state) of analysis – This improvement enables you to store results of analysis to use later in financial reports, modification of results, and the retrieval of results.
- Formula drill-down – With this capability you can drill down on the results of formulas, including totaling type formulas. When you drill down on the result of a formula, you see a new page containing the list of elements used to calculate the results and their description.
- Additional data sources – In addition to being able to perform analysis on G/L entries, now you can also perform analysis on VAT, customer, vendor, and value entries.

## Statutory statements

Companies must create financial statements according to accounting law 563/1991, specifically the balance sheet and the profit and loss statement. The statutory statements feature enables the creation of those reports:

- Balance sheet
- Income statement

These reports use the financial report feature with the statement structure defined.

The **Acc. Schedule Name** table contains this new field in the Czech version:

- **Acc. Schedule Type** – Balance sheet or income statement option

The **Acc. Schedule Line** table contains these new fields in the Czech version:

- **Row Correction** – Links to another line for balance sheet setup.

# Unreliable payer in the Czech version

The amendment of VAT Law 235/2004 (§106a) introduced the concept of *Unreliable Payer*. The treasury department is obliged to publish the names of unreliable payers.

This feature uses this service to obtain published information and indicate payer status on vendor cards and purchase documents.
The treasury department also publishes information about registered bank accounts of the payer (only these accounts are allowed for payments). Information about payer registered bank accounts is stored on the vendor bank account cards and used in cash management.

# Finance - VAT in the Czech version

## VAT date

The VAT date is important for tax documents according to §28 of VAT Law 235/2004. The VAT date can be different from the posting date or the document date. The VAT date is an important field for the VAT reporting.  

This feature focuses on improving the following:

### Setup of the VAT Date feature

- Enabling VAT date usage in the system generally.
- Select the way the system defaults the VAT date’s value in different areas (Posting Date or Document Date).
- Periods for reporting VAT and company accounting periods are often different. To allow users to seamlessly report and post VAT according to VAT periods, and to issue internal and other statutory reporting based on accounting periods, this VAT Date feature introduces VAT periods.
- Allow VAT Posting From/To – enter a date range in from/to fields to prevent mistakes of posting to closed accounting or VAT periods.

### Posting Sales, Purchase, and Service Transactions with VAT Date

To post transactions using a VAT date, the user must fill in the **VAT Date** field on the document headers and journal lines throughout the application.
After the posting of the VAT date, it becomes a part of the posted documents and G/L entries and VAT entries.

### Calculating and posting VAT settlement

The system filters VAT entries by the **VAT Date** field (instead of **Posting Date**) by selecting the VAT period and preparing a report showing which entries are transferred to the Settlement account. Printouts also contain VAT date information.

### Reconciling VAT and G/L entries

Users frequently reconcile amounts kept in VAT entries and VAT amounts posted to GL entries.
Amounts shown in new Net Change (VAT Date) columns on all the following pages are filtered by the **VAT Date** field:

- Chart of Accounts form
- G/L Balance form
- G/L Account Balance form

## VAT Statement

The VAT Statement report contains many improvements, which enable the user to:

- Add Stat. Reporting Setup with general setup for VAT reporting.
- Add two new operation rows (Row Division and Row Multiplication) in the **Type** field.
- Add setup for VAT from advances.
- Filter the **VAT Entries** selection for the VAT statement line by the **EU Triangular Trade** field. This is required, as EU (European Union) triangular trade (middle person – 1 debtor) must be reported in separate rows.
- Print the VAT Statement report with a new option to round off calculated amounts in the VAT statement to the nearest whole value.
- Filter data based on VAT date using VAT periods.
- Filter data for the posted VAT statement of later date.
- More VAT statement types – Recapitulative, Corrective, Supplementary (by §43 part 1 of VAT Law 235/2004) – payer can submit a supplementary VAT statement.
- Export the VAT statement to an .xml file.
- Add comments and attachments to export to the tax authorities.

## Supplementary VAT Statement

According to §43 part 1 of VAT Law 235/2004, the payer can submit a supplementary VAT statement. In case the user wants to issue the **Supplementary VAT Statement** report, they must choose the **Supplementary** type of VAT statement when exporting the statement.
In the Calculate and Post VAT Settlement functionality, the posted document number is stored in closed VAT entries in the **VAT Settlement No.** field for further filtering in VAT statements and reports. This feature allows calculation and printing VAT statement for different VAT statements posted and submitted in one VAT period.

## VIES

The VIES report is used for sales declaration to tax authorities in EU (European Union) countries/regions. According to §102 of VAT Law 235/2004, payers are obliged to submit VIES declaration („Souhrnné hlášení“). The VIES declaration has to be submitted to the tax authorities electronically.
The VIES functionality allows you to:

- Set up state reporting
- Select combinations of VAT business/product posting group (on the **VAT Posting Setup** page) to include in the VIES reporting
- Keep the VIES reporting history
- Input all information needed for electronic file submission
- Suggest Lines for VIES reporting
- Support corrective declarations
- Export data into file for electronic submission

## Unreliable payer

The amendment of VAT Law 235/2004 (§106a) introduced the concept of *Unreliable Payer*. The treasury department is obliged to publish the names of unreliable payers.

This feature uses this service to obtain published information and indicate payer status on vendor cards and purchase documents.
The treasury department also publishes information about registered bank accounts of the payer (only these accounts are allowed for payments). Information about payer registered bank accounts is stored on the vendor bank account cards and used in cash management.

## VAT exchange rate
The exchange rate is located in documents, but Czech Republic requires the possibility to set different exchange rates for posting and VAT in sales and purchase documents. This feature adds the **VAT Currency Code** and **VAT Exchange Rate** fields in documents. Users can change the exchange rate for VAT before document posting.

## [VAT control report](vat-control-report.md)

The VAT Control Report extends the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] functionality. The VAT date or posting date (according to the general ledger setup) loads the VAT items into the page for the selected period. To process the control report, you must set up VAT control report sections, tariff numbers, VAT statement, stat. reporting setup, and extend the VAT posting setup.  

## VAT reports

To fulfill the requirements in legislation reporting and local reporting practices of Czech companies, this feature provides the following reports:

- Calc. and Post VAT Settlement – standard report adjusted
- Documentation for VAT
- VAT Document List
- VAT List on Sales Adv. Letter
- VAT List on Purch. Adv. Letter

# Financial report feature in the Czech version

Financial reports are one of the most extensively used features for analysis and reporting to which Eastern European countries/regions often ask for these improvements:

- Common list of expressions – Contains named lines for use in formulas in all financial reports. You do this by defining one of the financial reports as a common list of expressions called a shared financial report.
- Saving results (current state) of analysis – Allows you to store the results of analysis done using financial reports, modification of results, and retrieval of results later on.
- Formulas drill-down – Allows you to drill down on the results of formulas, including for totaling type formulas. By drilling down on the result of the formula, you get a new page containing the list of elements used to calculate the results and their descriptions.
- Additional data sources – Enables you to perform analysis on value-added tax (VAT), customer, vendor, and value entries in addition to performing analysis on general ledger (G/L) entries.

# Calculation of depreciation basis in fixed assets in the Czech version

Due to Czech legislation, it's necessary to calculate tax depreciations from the depreciable basis, which can be different from acquisition costs. According to the requirements, the formula mentioned above that is defined in the Income Tax Act, is modified to calculate depreciation amounts using the Czech declining-balance depreciation method for the second and following years of a fixed asset's life.

The tax depreciation is calculated annually and the **Force No. of Days** option is recommended for calculating the correct depreciation amount.

# Two-Step fixed asset acquisition

There are two steps to accomplish when acquiring a fixed asset in Czech accounting. When a company gets an invoice for a fixed asset acquisition, it must be posted. Since the initial use of the fixed asset, the used fixed asset is posted. Both the acquisition and put-to-use steps are required and connected with G/L entries. Fixed assets aren't depreciated until they're put to use.

For this process, use the **Custom 2** fixed asset posting type for the first step (acquisition) and **Acquisition** fixed asset posting type for the second step (put to use). Select the **Fixed Asset Acquisition as Custom2** check box on the **Fixed Asset Setup** page to start using this feature.

The value **Custom 2** is renamed in Czech language from "Vlastní 2" to "Pořízení" for correct FA purchase identification and better accountant understanding.

# General Ledger Entries Application in the Czech Version

Apart from the application of customer and vendor ledger entries, a new functionality for general ledger entry application has been introduced. Application of G/L entries is typically used to allow companies to work with temporary and transfer accounts in the general ledger. Temporary and transfer accounts are used as a temporary “storage” and contain amounts (ledger entries) pending further processing. The new application functionality enables the user to match general expenses to distributed expenses (transferred earlier from account general for all amounts) by using the new applying and unapplying functions, and for companies to see analytic subtotals by using the new **Open G/L Entries on Date** or **Inventory Account to Date** reports for a specific date.

The G/L entries structure has been redesigned by adding the new storage for application information of a G/L entry. The **Detailed G/L Entry** table contains all entries related to the original G/L entry and stores the application amount, while the **G/L Entry** table contains overalls of this amount in the **Applied Amount** FlowField.  

The **Apply Entries** and **Unapply Entries** functions on the **G/L Entries** page have been added to the user interface.

Partial application is allowed. The remaining amount for applying is shown on the G/L entry. Users can apply G/L entries before posting the general journal or the cash desk.

User can run batch application by using the **G/L Entry Applying** report .

# Multiple payables/receivables accounts in the Czech version

Users often post transactions like bad debt or other types of receivable/payable transactions that need to be recorded in Customer and Vendor Ledgers, but at the same time posted to different receivable/payable GL accounts, other than the one specified on Customer or Vendor posting groups. The easiest way to enable such functionality is to allow users to change Customer and Vendor posting groups in the moment of posing a particular transaction.

# Exchange rates adjustment feature (recalculation of receivables and payables) 

Most companies in the Czech Republic request the following improvements to be implemented in Exchange Rates Adjustment:

- Ability to run Exchange Rates Adjustment for Customers, Vendors and Bank Accounts separately
- Ability to have Exchange Rates Adjustment batch post adjustments in detail and summarized per currency
- Ability to run Exchange Rates Adjustment just as simulation (without posting) in Test Mode

On standard report Adjust Exchange Rates is now possible to:

- Set Bank Account, Customer, Vendor filter for adjustment
- Choose adjustment for Customer or Vendor or Bank Account
- Choose the test mode
- Choose to summarize entries
- Choose the method for dimensions transfer

The Adjust Exchange Rate report feature also modifies the calculation principle for implemented gains and losses based on the Income Tax Act. This feature calculates the implemented gain or loss against the recently adjusted amount.
This feature in the standard version of Microsoft [!INCLUDE[d365fin](../../includes/d365fin_long_md.md)] reverses the unrealized gain or loss first, and calculates the realized gain or loss afterwards. The calculation is made against the amount in the original exchange rate during the application of the payment and the invoice.
The new calculation principle handles deviations from the currently adjusted exchange rate.
The Adjust Exchange Rates batch job was extended to include the Czech Advance Payments module.

# Inventory Movement Templates in the Czech Version

Movements of items from item journals must be posted with the defined Inventory Adjmt. Account, that corresponds to the given type of movement.

Within the template, it is possible to set the type of transaction (negative adjmt., positive adjmt., transfer, etc.)  and the Gen. Bus. Posting Group (define Inventory Adjmt. Account).
These settings are automatically copied to the item journal line based on the selected inventory movement template.
Inventory movement templates can be used mainly for posting movements in the item journal and  journal. They have other uses in posting differences in the physical inventory of items.

# Czech Intrastat Reporting

[!INCLUDE[intrastat-2022w2](../../includes/intrastat-2022w2.md)]

Dynamics 365 Business Central provides features that allow you to collect statistics on the trade in goods among EU member nations and to prepare Intrastat report file for submitting.

- Setting up Items and Fixed Assets for Intrastat reporting
- Setting up Intrastat Checklist for validation Intrastat rules
- Setting up Data Exchange Definition to create Intrastat file exports
- Creating and Submitting Intrastat report file

- **Intrastat Delivery Groups** - the code list is added to Delivery Methods, Intrastat report lines and report export.
- **Item Charges** - the field **Include in Intrastat amount** has been added to allow the user to specify which charges should be included in the Intrastat amount. The application or non-application of the Intrastat charge amount can also be affected retrospectively for items already posted.
- For Intrastat purposes, the **Item Card** is extended with the **Specific Movement** and **Statistic Indication** fields.

## Intrastat reporting settings

The following fields have been added to the Intrastat reporting settings:

- **Intrastat Rounding Type** - specifies the rounding type for calculating amounts when creating Intrastat reports and allows you to set the rounding to Up, Down or Nearest.

# Registration of Sales (EET) in the Czech Version

Registration of sales (EET) is registration of sales coming from business activities and paid in cash. Information about these transactions are sent to the tax authorities. At the time of payment is created data message and sent online to the server of Tax office. As answer from the server is message with unique transaction ID, which has to be printed on the receipt for customer.

Payment methods included in EET:

- In cash  
- By card  
- Check  
- Bill of Exchange  
- Other similar types like gift cards, coupons, bitcoin etc.  

For more information see official portal [www.etrzby.cz](http://www.etrzby.cz).  

## How it Works in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)]

The following sales documents are covered in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)]:

- Sales invoice payment  
- Payment of prepayment invoice  
- Refund sales credit memo  
- Refund of prepayment invoice  
- Cash desk receipt for sales to the G/L account (without source sales document)  

With posting of defined documents (and with defined payment method) is created EET ledger entry and based on the functionality regime is processed:

- Online – An EET entry is created and stored in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)]. A message to the tax authorities is generated and sent to the server. An answer from the server is processed and stored and on the customer’s receipt is printed a unique transaction ID generated by tax authorities.  
- Off-line - An EET entry is created and stored in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)]. On the customer’s receipt is printed a unique ID generated in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] (identification of company and document). EET records are processed later by batch job.  

## Main Parts of the Feature

- EET ledger entries – the table where registered documents are stored and processed. Each record contains sales data required by the tax authorities, which is needed for printing on receipts and for data from electronic communication. New records are created automatically by posting of source documents.  
- EET service settings.  
- Certificate settings.  
- EET POS terminals – identification of registered places.

# Advance Payments and Invoices in the Czech Version

The Advance Invoices and Payments feature is used to generate invoices and to make payments before goods or services have been delivered or before the production has begun. The Advance Invoices and Payments feature includes advance invoices, advance payments, advance payments subject to VAT, and tax documents. The document types and document requirements for this feature are listed below:

## Advance Invoices

- Used to request money in advance.
- The document is not accounted and does not have a tax voucher.
- Documents are created in advance of invoices templates (document groups) with predefined accounting and number series of related documents.
- Advance invoice templates define whether or not you are obliged to post VAT.
- Advance invoices can be created from purchase orders, invoices, or as a separate document with no links to any documents.
- Free advances can be additionally linked with documents before posting the final invoice.

## Life Cycle of Advance invoice

An advance invoice has its own life cycle, which is defined by states:
- **Open** - an advance invoice can be edited.
- **Prepayment** - payment of advance invoice is expected.
- **Invoice preparation** - a tax receipt for the received/issued payment is expected.
- **Preparation** of the final invoice - the advance invoice is ready to be drawn.
- **Closed** - final status after the advance invoice has been exhausted.

## Advance Payments

- The payment made against an advance invoice.
- Proportional advance payments with regard to posting and billing, in journals and banknotes.
- Received advance payments are not receivables, they are liabilities.
- Issued advance payments are not payables (liabilities), they are receivables.
- Advance payments may be subject to VAT. Czech legislation lays down rules for whether the advance payments are subject to VAT.
- Received advance payments are classified based on the date of receipt.
- Issued advance payments are classified based on the date of tax documents receipt.
- Any unspent part of advance payments can be returned.
- Posting payment for a payment can be made on the basis of an advance invoice.
- Posted invoice with a link to advance invoice can be disconnected.
- The advance invoice can be paid by multiple payments.
- Received advance invoices are posted as liabilities.
- Advance payments in foreign currency based on agreed data.

## Tax Documents (Tax Credit Memo)

- Documents specifying the paid VAT from received advance payments.
- It is not possible to claim VAT from advance payments without receiving tax documents issued for advance payments.
- VAT calculation improvements comply with the legislation of the Czech Republic.
- Documents are declaring the VAT paid on the advance payments received/issued.
- Tax documents/tax credits are created in relation to the advance invoice to which the payment was made.
- The module includes functions for automatically generating tax documents when posting an advance payment.
- For advance payments, it is possible to correct the tax documents before they are posted because of their billing based on the received document from the creditor.
- The Advance Invoice mode without a tax document allows VAT to be applied only on the final invoice, provided that its performance meets the conditions of Section 28 of the Value Added Tax Act.
- The tax document for the released payment can be charged only on the basis of the received document from the creditor, therefore the purchase advance invoice allows the change of the regime with / without VAT also during its processing.
- Calculation of VAT on advance invoices based on the Value Added Tax Act (§ 37a, § 92).
- The new module also works with VAT in the payer registration mode in another EU country/region.

## Deduction of Advance

- Deduction of advance payments and already paid or claimed VAT from final invoices.
- Deduction is done when posting final invoice proportionally.
- The module offers a tool for linking advance invoices with the final document.
- It is possible to change/supplement/cancel the linking of the advance invoice with the final document before it is posted.
- It is possible to link multiple advance invoices to the final document in one step.
- The tool parameters can be influenced by how the final deferral is interconnected with advance invoices.
- For better control/correction of the final invoice tax, order statistics and invoices have been expanded to include bookmarks informing you of your payment usage and VAT paid/claimed.
- Deduction of the advance invoice from the final invoice can be canceled with all accounting entries that were used for the deduction.
- When using an advance invoice in a foreign currency, the exchange rate differences are quantified.

## Linking Tool for an Advance Invoice and a Final Document

The tool provides a choice of different ways to link the lines of the final document to the lines of backup payments:

- Mode of linking advance invoices paid/unpaid.
- Linking by amounts remaining or billing the final document.
- Linking based on VAT rates.

## FactBoxes - Customer/Vendor Statistics

The customer and vendor card statistical information windows were supplemented with information about advances:
- Invoiced Amount of Advance
- Advances - Open
- Advances - Prepare Payments
- Advances - Preparing an Invoice
- Advances - Preparing the end Invoices

## Internal and Output Documents Printout

A set of documents are created that take into account Czech legislation and practices.

Output Documents:
- Advance Invoice
- VAT Document to Received Payment
- VAT Document to Tax Credit Memo
- Sale Invoice

Internal Documents:
- Sales Advance Letter List
- Purch. Advance Letter List
- VAT List on Purch. Adv. Letter
- VAT List on Sales Adv. Letter

# G/L account group – Multi-circuit accounting in the Czech version

According to accounting standards, an accounting entity can post transactions within multiple internal accounting areas (Financial, Off-Balance, and Intercompany Accounting).
To set up accounting areas in the system, the G/L Account Group field on the CoA account card is used. The system stops posting to financial accounts with different accounting areas in a single accounting transaction.

# Inventory counting documents in the Czech version

At the end of the period, users perform physical inventory counting to reconcile the actual (physical) value of inventory with the one registered in the system. At the end of the counting process, the accounting department needs to archive a final inventory counting document containing posted values with names of company officials who, under liability, confirm with their signature that the quantities and amounts stated in the document are the ones physically present in the company's inventory locations.

For the reasons above, this feature provides the following reports:

- Phys. Inventory List Report is used to print documents from Phys. Inventory Journals (existing report improved).
- Phys. Invt. Counting Document Report is used to print posted Phys. Inventory operations.

# Statutory Statements in the Czech Version

Companies must create financial statements according to Accounting Law 563/1991. They must create the balance sheet and the profit and loss statement. The **Statutory Statements** feature provides the following reports:

- **Balance Sheet**
- **Income Statement**

These reports use the financial reports feature with the statement structure defined.

The **Acc. Schedule Name** table contains this new field in the Czech version:

- **Acc. Schedule Type** – provides the balance sheet or income statement option

The **Acc. Schedule Line** table contains these new fields in the Czech version:

- **Row Correction** – links to another line for balance sheet setup
- **Assets/Liabilities Type** – shows assets or liabilities for balance sheet setup
- **Calc** – provides the always, never, when positive, when negative options

The balance sheet and the profit and loss statements are often prepared in Microsoft Excel file templates with the required design layout for the statement report. Both documents can be customized using Excel workbooks (.xlsx files). Similarly, you can export financial report data to Excel files. Learn more about Excel report templates at [Working with Excel Layouts](../../ui-excel-report-layouts.md).

# Corrections posting (Red Storno) in the Czech version

According to legal requirements, costs and revenues are posted only to either the debit or the credit side of a G/L account. Companies in Eastern Europe usually enforce accounting policies to post certain inventory and GL transactions as corrections. The reason for this is that auditors and revenue authorities conduct accounting controls against this rule.  

The purpose of the feature is:  

- To allow the accounting manager to enforce corrective posting on desired G/L accounts  
- To allow the accounting manager to enforce corrective posting in inventory postings (negative transfer entries, expected costs posting)  
- To allow the accounting manager to enforce corrective posting of canceling in fixed assets  
- To allow the user to enforce corrective posting with one select (in G/L, inventory, and project postings)

- Inventory Movement Report is used to print documents from inventory Journals.

# Inventory in the Czech version

## Posting groups in transfer orders
Czech posting rules require location transfers to be posted with the defined Inventory Adjmt. Account different from other item Journal postings.
In the Transfer Orders functionality, fields for Gen. Bus. Post. Groups for Ship and Receive posting were added. This feature enables you to post different transfer orders with different General Posting Setup and also different from postings in item Journal.

In Transfer Route, fields for Gen. Bus. Post. Groups for Ship and Receive posting were added. This setup is automatically copied to transfer the order based on the used transfer route.

## Rounding account in inventory
The Rounding Account in the Inventory feature enables you to post all rounded costs (rounding entries in the Value Entry table) to another General Ledger Account instead of the Inventory Adjustment Account. This feature enables you to post a rounded cost on a different Account than the acquisition cost.

## Inventory – G/L reconciliation enhancements
According to the Czech specific requirements, the Inventory – G/L Reconciliation matrix form must into account take the Czech specific inventory posting Accounts: Inventory Rounding Account and Intermediate WIP Account. Since the Czech localized application contains modifications in the inventory posting, special Account for rounding functionalities, and special intermediate WIP accounts, must also be included in the Inventory – G/L Reconciliation matrix form.

These modifications have been introduced to the interface and the calculation procedures have been modified.

## Advanced Features of the Physical Inventory
To comply with the legislation, companies require differentiation of accounting of deficits and surpluses. Thanks to the setting of default Whse. Net Change Template for these inventory movements in the Inventory Setup, the user can easily change Gen. Business Posting Group depending on the type of inventory movements.

Companies need to distinguish the posting of inventory movements of the same goods so they require line-break of physical inventory Journal line. Such accounting is required for legal reasons. For example, they need to have a different account for deficits in the limit, and another account for deficits over the limit.

## Inventory Operations Document
Users perform inventory operations such as: write down, reclassification and revaluation. They must have the possibility to print documents for these operations with the layout in compliance with the legal requirements.

Users also want to print a document for posted inventory operations.

For the reasons above, this feature provides the following reports:

- Inventory Movement Report is used to print documents from inventory Journals.
- Posted Inventory Document Report is used to print posted inventory operations.

## Inventory Counting Document
At the end of the period, users perform physical inventory counting to reconcile the actual (physical) value of inventory with the one registered in the system. At the end of the counting process, accounting department needs to archive final Inventory Counting Document containing posted values with names of company officials who under liability confirm with their signature that the quantities and amounts stated in the document correspond to ones physically present in company's inventory locations.

For the reasons above, this feature provides the following reports:

- Phys. Inventory List Report is used to print documents from Phys. Inventory Journals (existing report improved).
- Phys. Invt. Counting Document Report is used to print posted Phys. Inventory operations.

# Functional Currency – Czechia

The new amendment to Act No. 563/1991 Coll., on Accounting, effective from 1 January 2024, introduces the concept of functional currency as the currency of accounting. Functional currency means the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates and may be other than the Czech currency. The functional currency of an entity shall be determined on the basis of the criteria for determining the functional currency under IFRS as governed by European Union law.  

If the company decides to implement accounting in a foreign currency, then for other records and reports that must be in Czech currency, it uses the Additional Reporting Currencies functionality for reporting. However, this only deals with the creation of material items and VAT items, but not with subsequent reporting. All VAT reporting must be done in Czech currency (CZK), so the reporting functionalities have been adapted as follows:

- Preview of the VAT statement
- VAT control report
- VAT control report statistics
- VIES Declaration
- Export of the VAT statement
- Export of VAT control report
- Export of the VIES Declaration
- Printing the VAT statement (Report 11769)
- Printing of the Recording Obligation (Basis for VAT) and List of Tax Documents (Report 11756)
- Test report of the VAT Control Report (Report 31103)
- Test report of the VIES Declaration (Report 31064)

New VAT rate to additional reporting currency (Document Currency/Additional Reporting Currency) fields have been added to the purchase and sales documents to allow the currency rate to be adjusted if necessary. Similar functionality has been added on purchase and sales advances. The printing of document reports has also been modified.

# Non-Deductible VAT for Czech

## Non-Deductible VAT

If the VAT payer uses the received taxable supplies within their economic activities both for supplies eligible for tax deduction and for tax-exempt, they are entitled to deduct tax only in the reduced amount. VAT on input must be reduced by the calculated coefficient. Non-deductible VAT functionality allows the application of a shortening coefficient to accounting cases.

The value of the VAT reduction coefficient can be set for the whole company in one place. The value will be applied to all marked combinations of VAT posting groups. In addition to the input tax reduction through the shortening coefficient, it is also possible to set a 100% tax reduction in the VAT account group combination, i.e. the case when there is no entitlement to apply VAT on the input side, but the output side (in the case of transactions under the reverse charge regime) has to report VAT in full. The VAT reduction is also applies to the VAT Report and the VAT Control Reports, which include the entire unreduced amounts. After the end of the calendar year, it is possible, on the basis of the calculated settlement coefficient, recalculate all VAT entries from period and post the difference between the originally applied and the settlement coefficient.

### The module functionality includes

- Setting Non-Deductible VAT at a reduced or full amount
- Adjustment of input VAT postings, inclusion of non-deductible VAT in related accounts, the purchase price of items or assets
- Adjustment of VAT Reports and VAT Control Reports
- Reports for VAT reconciliation
- The settlement coefficient at the end of the calendar period

### Application limitations

- Not applicable for purchase advance invoices
- Not connected to VAT Report Setup or VAT Returns.

## Activation of Non-Deductible VAT

The activation of the Non-Deductible VAT functionality starts on the page **VAT Setup** by selecting the **Enable Non-Deductible VAT** field. If you have the **Core Localization Pack for Czech** application installed, the standard non-deductible VAT functionality is automatically extended for Czech posting and reporting purposes.

Switch the value of the field **Enable Non-Deductible VAT** to YES, the other related fields are activated. By running functionality, new fields in the tables are automatically activated, enabling them is irreversible.

## Basic principles of posting non-deductible VAT

When applying non-deductible input VAT (partial reduction through a reduction coefficient or full reduction without deduction), the value of the non-deductible VAT is added to the to the basic account where the posting case is posted.

If there is no account in the relevant VAT combination in the VAT Posting Setup
in the **Non-Deductible Purchase VAT account** field,the amount of non-deductible VAT is added to the account used in the posting entry. Otherwise (i.e. if you set any account), this
account is used to post the non-deductible part of the VAT amount.

The amount is posted to the VAT accounts at a reduced value (or not at all), but the amounts should be reported in the original amount according to the original VAT document in the VAT Report or VAT Control Reports. In order to distinguish between the amounts in the posting and the amounts in the reporting, the non-deductible VAT functionality has extended the VAT Entries table with new fields:

- **Base** - standard field, shows the amount of the reduced base
- **Amount** - standard field, shows the amount of reduced VAT
- **Non-deductible VAT base** - shows the amount of the base not applied in VAT
- **Non-deductible amount of VAT** - shows the amount of VAT not applied in VAT
- **Deductible VAT base** - shows the amount of the VAT base increased by non-deductible VAT
- **% of non-deductible VAT** - shows the value of the VAT coefficient applied to the entry
- **Amount of VAT base (original)** - shows the value of the VAT base on the original document
- **Amount of VAT (original)** - shows the amount of VAT on the original document

**VAT Return** must be reported in the original amounts in the original unreduced range. The parameterization of the VAT Statement should be adapted to this - see **VAT Report Setup**.

The **VAT Control Report** should also be reported in the original amounts. The function for retrieving the lines of the control report is adapted so that it uses the **Original VAT Base** and **Original VAT Amount** from the VAT entry. Reduced values are not included in the control report.

At the end of the calendar period, the advance coefficient must be recalculated retrospectively (This is not handled in the Business Central system, you need to proceed in your usual way.). The value of the calculated settlement coefficient is entered in the **Non-Deductible VAT Setup** in the appropriate field and at the same time it is set as the value of the advance coefficient for the following period. If the settlement coefficient differs from the advance coefficient, you must run a batch job **VAT Coefficient Correction** to recalculate the entries.

This batch job goes through all VAT entries of the specified period with combinations of VAT posting groups set as input VAT reduction. It compares the value of the applied reduction coeficient in the field **Non-deductible VAT %** and the value of the posting coefficient, calculates the difference and post it as a new VAT entry in which it adjusts the VAT base and amount. The differeence in VAT is posted to the **VAT Coefficient Correction Account** from **VAT Posting Setup**.

## Non-deductible VAT Setup

To work with the Non-Deductible VAT functionality, you need to carry out specific setup:

### Setting the range of use Non-Deductible VAT

The functionality of Non-Deductible VAT is automatically applied when posting accounting cases with direct posting to financial accounts. You can also use it when posting the item cost, for job costs or fixed assets cost.

On the **VAT Setup** page, activate the fields as required

- **Use for Item Cost**
- **Use for Fixed Asset Cost**
- **Use for Job Cost**

Once activated, the value of the non-deductible VAT will be automatically added to the purchase price of the items, the cost of the assets or the job costs.

### VAT Product Posting Groups Setup

To post accounting cases with non-deductible input VAT, you need to create a new **VAT Product Posting Groups** If you will post entries with input VAT reduction and cases where you will not apply input VAT at all, set up a separate VAT Product Posting Groups for these cases, e.g. as follows:

![VAT Product Posting Groups](Media/VAT-Product-Posting-Groups.png "VAT Product Posting Groups")  

### VAT Posting Setup

The VAT Product Posting Group created for posting non-deductible VAT must be set up for combination with the VAT Business Posting Group and define how the non-deductible VAT will be posted:

In the **Allow Non-Deductible VAT** field for the selected combination, select whether to charge non-deductible VAT

- **Do Not Allow** = standard combination of VAT Posting Groups for which VAT will be applied in full
- **Allow** = setting to apply the input VAT reduction coefficient according to **Non-deductible VAT Setup**
- **Do Not Apply** = setting for the case when VAT on input will not be applied, on output it will be in full original extent, i.e. 100% shortening coefficient.

![VAT Posting Setup](Media/VAT-Posting-Setup.png "VAT Posting Setup")  

For combinations of VAT Posting Groups marked with Allow in the Allow Non-Deductible VAT field, it is necessary to set the **VAT Coefficient Correction Account**, to which the difference between the shortening advance and settlement coefficient will be posted at the end of the calendar period

### Non-deductible VAT Setup

The value of the VAT shortening coefficient is set in the system on the **Non-Deductible VAT Setup page.** For the calendar accounting period it is necessary to set the **Advance Coefficient**, and then at the end of the period to add the value of the recalculated **Settlement Coefficient**.

Both coefficients are set as percentages of the "non-applied part of VAT", i.e. if the calculated shortening coefficient is 7% and therefore only 7% of input VAT is claimed, the value of the advance coefficient in the system (i.e. the value of non-deductible VAT) will be 93.

Setting the settlement coefficient is also related to **Source Code Setup**. On this page you need to set the **Source Code** used in the annual posting of the difference between the advance and settlement coefficient. Set the value in the **VAT Coef. Correction** field.

### VAT Report Setup

The VAT statement must be supplemented with the newly established VAT Posting Group combinations. Since the VAT statement must be entered with the original values, the parameterization of the rows in the **Amount Type** field must be modified to use the values **Full Base** or **Full Amount**.

![VAT Statement](Media/VAT-Statement.png "VAT Statement")  

## Posting of Non-Deductible VAT in documents

The examples below assume the previous setup of non-deductible VAT, the created combinations of VAT Posting Groups and the setup of the advance coefficient for the selected accounting period - see paragraph Non-Deductible VAT Setup.

### Example of using reduced VAT in a purchase invoice - normal VAT

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell me Feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Invoices** and choose the related link.
2. On **Purchase Invoices** page create with action **New** new purchase invoice.
3. Complete the purchase invoice header in the usual way - select a number from the number series, select the vendor number, posting date, VAT date, external document number.
4. In the purchase invoice line, select the value G/L Account in the **Type** field and in the **No.** field, select an expense account from the chart of accounts, e.g. 518100.
5. In the **VAT Business Posting Group** and **VAT Prod. Posting Group** fields, select the combination that is set for the normal input VAT reduced by the reduction coefficient
6. Fill in Quantity = 1 and Direct unit cost excl. VAT = 1.000
7. Run the Preview Posting.
8. View the G/L Entry. Account 518100 is debited with the basic cost price of 1000 plus a further entry for the proportionate amount of unapplied VAT. The VAT amount is reduced by a reduction coeficient
9. Display the VAT Entry. The fields for Base and Amount show the amounts corresponding to the value of the reduced, deductible VAT. The fields **Original VAT Base** and **Original VAT Amount** show the values of the base and VAT amount according to the values in the original document, i.e. without reduction. The **Non-Deductible VAT %** field shows the value of the advance VAT coefficient.

### Example of the use of reduced VAT in a purchase invoice - VAT in reverse charge

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell me Feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Invoices** and choose the related link.
2. On **Purchase Invoices** page create with action **New** new purchase invoice.
3. Complete the purchase invoice header in the usual way - select a number from the number series, select the vendor number, posting date, VAT date, external document number
4. In the purchase invoice line, select the value G/L Account in the **Type** field and in the **No.** field, select an expense account from the chart of accounts, e.g. 518100.
5. In the **VAT Business Posting Group** and **VAT Prod. Posting Group** fields, select the combination that is set for VAT in reverse charge mode reduced by the input reduction coefficient.
6. Fill in Quantity = 1 and Direct unit cost excl. VAT = 1.000
7. Run the Preview Posting.
8. View the G/L Entry. Account 518100 is debited with the basic cost price of 1000 plus a further entry for the proportionate amount of unapplied VAT. The amount of input VAT is reduced by a reduction coeficient. The output VAT amount is charged in full.
9. Display the VAT Entry. In the fields for Base and Amount, the amounts corresponding to the value of the reduced, applied VAT are shown. In the fields **Original VAT base** and **Original VAT amount**, the values of the base and VAT amount are shown according to the values in the original document, i.e. without reduction. In the **Non-Deductible VAT %** field, the value of the advance VAT coefficient is given.

### Example of the use of non-applied VAT in a purchase invoice - normal VAT

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell me Feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Invoices** and then choose the related link.
2. On **Purchase Invoices** page create with action **New** new purchase invoice.
3. Complete the purchase invoice header in the usual way - select a number from the number series, select the vendor number, posting date, VAT date, external document number.

7. Run the Preview Posting
8. View the G/L Entry. Account 518100 is debited with the basic cost price of 1000 plus the full amount of the calculated VAT by a further entry. No VAT is charged at all.
9. Display the VAT Entry. The fields for Base and Amount show zero amounts. The **Original VAT Base** and **Original VAT Amount** fields show the VAT base and amount values according to the values in the original document, i.e. without reduction.

### Example of the use of non-applied VAT in a purchase invoice - VAT in reverse charge

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell me Feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Invoices** and then choose the related link.
2. On **Purchase Invoices** page create with action **New** new purchase invoice.
3. Complete the purchase invoice header in the usual way - select a number from the number series, select the vendor number, posting date, VAT date, external document number.
4. In the purchase invoice line, select the value G/L Account in the **Type** field and in the **No.** field, select an expense account from the chart of accounts, e.g. 518100.

6. Fill in Quantity = 1 and Direct unit cost excl. VAT in value 1.000
7. Run the Preview Posting
8. View the G/L Entry. Account 518100 is charged with the basic cost price of 1000 plus the full amount of the calculated VAT in the next entry. Input VAT is not charged at all, output VAT is charged in full.
9. Display the VAT Entry. The fields for Base and Amount show zero amounts. The **Original VAT Base** and **Original VAT Amount** fields show the VAT base and amount values according to the values in the original document, i.e. without reduction.

## VAT Reporting with non-deductible VAT

For **VAT Statements** it is necessary to modify the parametrization of the VAT report so that for rows containing combinations of VAT Posting Groups reduced or not fully applied at input, the full amounts in the original values are included.

The value of the shortening coefficient can then be set manually in the corresponding row of the VAT report with the value in the **Type** = Formula field. In order to recalculate the input VAT only for selected rows of the report, it is necessary to create separate summation rows for the parts that include both full and reduced or non-applied transactions, in which full, reduced and non-applied transactions will be summed separately.

![VAT Report with coefficient](Media/VAT-Statement-coef.png "VAT Report with coefficient")  

The VAT return must be exported in its original range and the reduction must be made only for the selected total series, or the reduction must be made only on the VAT Portal website.

The **VAT Control Report** must be submitted in the original document amounts, not in the amounts reduced or not applied. Therefore, the task for retrieving the lines of the control report uses the **Original VAT base and Original VAT amount** fields from the VAT entry. The amounts that have been reduced do not enter the report.

## Non-deductible VAT control reports

The **Documentation for VAT** report (**Recording obligation**) contains columns with VAT values in original and reduced amounts. The total value of the Amount (LM) column is a check on the accounting, the total value of the Original VAT amount column is a check on the VAT report in original amounts.

There is a separate report layout for the **VAT Documents List** report, which contains columns with VAT values in original and reduced amounts. The total value of the Amount (LM) column is a check on the accounting, the total value of the Original VAT amount column is a check on the VAT report in original amounts.

## VAT settlement coefficient

After the end of the calendar year, the accounting unit using the VAT shortening coefficient recalculates the transactions for the previous year and calculates the final VAT settlement coefficient (outside the Business Central system).

The newly calculated coefficient should be entered in **Non-deductible VAT Setup** as the settlement coefficient of the closed period and at the same time as the advance coefficient for the new accounting period.

If the coefficients differ in the completed period, it is possible to use the batch job **VAT Coefficient Correction** to recalculate the VAT entries and record the difference in the accounting.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell me Feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT coefficient Correction** and choose the related link.
2. Set the **Starting VAT Date and Ending VAT Date** in the batch job (should be the same as the calendar year for which you are recalculating). The Ending VAT Date must be the end date from the **Non-deductible VAT Setup** for which the settlement coefficient is set.
3. Toggle the **Post** field to control the test mode of the job or the actual posting of entries.
4. The option in the **Use Dimensions** field controls how dimensions are used in newly created items. It will be posted according to the option either without dimensions or the dimensions from the account set as **VAT Coefficient Correction Account** in **VAT Posting Setup** will be used.
5. In the **Use Document No** field, you can enter the number with which the coefficient adjustment entries will be posted. If you do not enter a document number, the original document number will be used for posting (_Note: It is recommended not to set the document number)_.
6. In the **Use Posting Date** field, set the posting date to which the posting should be made. If you do not specify a posting date, the original posting date of the entry will be used. (_Note: It is recommended to specify the last date of the calendar period as the posting date)_.
7. In the **Use VAT Date** field, set the VAT date with which the posting should be made. If you do not enter a VAT date, the original VAT date of the entry will be posted. (_Note: It is recommended to enter the last date of the calendar period as the VAT date)_
8. On the **Filter:**  **VAT Entry** tab, you can specify VAT Posting Group filters for use in a batch job. It is not necessary to set the filters, the batch job will automatically pass only those VAT entries with VAT Posting Group combinations that are marked in the **Allow non-deductible VAT** field with the value Allow
9. The batch job will go through all (or just filtered) VAT Posting Group combinations with an Allow value in the Allow Non-Deductible VAT field. It will find the value in the **Non-Deductible VAT %** field in the VAT entry posted and compare it to the settlement coefficient. If it finds a difference in the coefficient, it calculates the difference in the VAT amount, creates a new VAT entry, and posts the difference to the accounting records. All newly posted entries and VAT entries have a separate **Source Code** for subsequent filtering options.

# Fixed assets in the Czech version

## Fixed assets tax depreciation

The Fixed Assets Tax Depreciation feature calculates and posts tax depreciation in compliance with the Income Tax Act (Law 586/1992 §26 - §33). This feature has a special setup for tax depreciation groups to enable entering rates and coefficients for new depreciation methods with fixed assets tax depreciation.

Each long-term tangible fixed asset belongs to a depreciation group. These groups determine minimal depreciation periods and parameters used for calculating depreciation. The following depreciation methods are provided for long-term tangible fixed asset (FA) depreciations for tax purposes:

- Regular – This method is based on the acquisition value and percentage (straight line).
- Accelerated – This method is based on the book value and coefficient (declining balance).
- Regular based on the acquisition value and percentage (straight-line intangible).

Each long-term fixed asset belongs to a depreciation group. These groups determine minimal depreciation periods and parameters that are used for calculating depreciation.

## Calculation of depreciation basis in fixed assets

Due to Czech legislation, it is necessary to calculate tax depreciations from the depreciable basis which can be different from acquisition costs. According to the requirements, a depreciation basis by the Czech declining-balance depreciation method for the second and following years of a fixed asset's life should be calculated by the new formula defined in the Income Tax Act.

Changes have been made in the calculation of depreciation amounts by the CZ declining-balance depreciation method for the second and following years of a fixed asset's life by the formula stated above. The tax depreciation is calculated annually and the **Force No. of Days** option is recommended for calculating the correct depreciation amount.

## Fixed assets depreciation holidays

The Fixed Asset Depreciation Holidays feature (according to the Income Tax Act – Law 586/1992 §26 part 8) enables user to discontinue depreciation for selected fixed assets and for specified periods. The system determines the depreciation schedule after the break period ends.
The list of depreciation methods for which the discontinuing of depreciation is implemented as follows:

- Straight line
- Regular
- Accelerated
- Straight line for intangible fixed assets
- Enhanced depreciation methods and straight-line methods to pick up the threads of the depreciation schedule end after the break depreciation period.  

Users can open the FA depreciation book and fill in the **Depreciation Interrupt** and **Depreciation Interrupt up to** fields. The **Keep Depr. Ending Date** field defines if you want to maintain the depreciation schedule.

## Two-step fixed asset acquisition

There are two steps to accomplish when acquiring a fixed asset in Czech accounting. When a company gets an invoice for a fixed asset acquisition, it must be posted. Since the initial use of the fixed asset, the used fixed asset is posted. Both the acquisition and put-to-use steps are required and connected with G/L entries. Fixed assets aren't depreciated until they're put to use.

For this process, use the **Custom 2** fixed asset posting type for the first step (acquisition) and **Acquisition** fixed asset posting type for the second step (put to use). Select the **Fixed Asset Acquisition as Custom2** check box on the **Fixed Asset Setup** page to start using this feature.

The value **Custom 2** is renamed in Czech language from "Vlastní 2" to "Pořízení" for correct FA purchase identification and better accountant understanding.

## Fixed asset posting of disposal

Czech accounting standards require specific posting when a fixed asset is being disposed of or being sold. After selling or posting the fixed assets, the posting of disposal ensures that the fixed asset value remains the same as the acquired value after depreciation.

The fixed asset remains unchanged even after it is put to use. When the fixed asset is depreciated periodically, a corresponding sum is debited from the acquired cost at the time of disposal. The balance amount is the current fixed asset value.

On the **Depreciation Book** page, select the **Corresponding G/L Entries on Disposal** check box to make this feature operational. Also select the **Corresponding FA Entries on Disposal** check box to retain the correspondence between G/L entries and FA entries.  

## Different types of disposal and maintenance

In Czech accounting, it's necessary to post different types of disposal and different types of maintenance of fixed assets to specific G/L accounts. A standard way offers only one method of disposal and maintenance posting.

A new setup is added for this, namely the **FA Extended Posting Group** table. This table allows to set up each FA posting group:

- Posting disposals to different accounts in combination with **Reason Code** field for disposals
- Posting maintenance in combination with the **Maintenance Code** field for maintenance

## Fixed assets classification

### Classification code

The Tax of Income Law 586/1992 insists on sorting fixed assets by production classification marked CZ-CPA and by building operations classification marked CZ-CC. The new **Classification Code** table and the **Classification Code** field are added. The field is used for FA classification to the tax group.

## Fixed asset location/responsible history report

This feature provides users with the ability to track changes to the location and responsible employee for fixed assets.

With the addition of this feature, users are able to control location history of the fixed asset and the history of employees responsible for the fixed asset.
This feature also provides reports for company verification where a specific fixed asset is/was located or to whom it is/was assigned.

To enable FA Location and responsible-employee tracking (FA history), user must first enable this feature by selecting the **Fixed Assets History** check box on the **Fixed Asset Setup** page. User can then start to track changes in fixed assets' location and responsible employees. The changes are stored in the **FA History Entry** table.

Items of fixed assets:
- Save changes in FA evidence
- Include time and user stamp changes

New reports for transactions and history documentation added:
- FA Assignment/Discharge
- FA History

## Fixed assets reporting

In order to comply with the requirements in legislation reporting features and local reporting practices of Czech companies, this feature provides the following reports:

- **Fixed Asset Card** – combines data from the standard **FA List** and **FA Details** reports, grouping details per FA depreciation book.
- **FA Receipt** – is printed when a particular fixed asset is received to be put to use. Such document must be signed by company officials.
- **FA Disposal** – is printed when a particular fixed asset is disposed of or damaged.
- **FA – Analysis G/L Account** – used to compare it with G/L account.
- **Fixed Asset – Analysis 2** – users can define 3 columns for date, 4 columns for amount field, group totals, and export to Excel.
- **Fixed Asset – Analys. Dep. Book** – user can choose 2 depreciation books for comparison.
- **FA Phys. Inventory List** – companies are obliged to reconcile the physical state of fixed assets and book value in order to prepare the financial statement.  
- **FA Inventory List** – prints the fixed assets inventory per responsible employee or location code.

The following standard reports are adjusted for the Czech Republic (new Group total, etc.):
- **Fixed Asset – Analysis**
- **Fixed Asset – Book Value 01**
- **Fixed Asset – Book Value 02**
- **Fixed Asset – Projected Value**
- **Fixed Asset – G/L Analysis**
- **Maintenance – Analysis**

# VAT date in the Czech version

The VAT date is important for tax documents according to §28 of VAT Law 235/2004. The VAT date can be different from the posting date or the document date. The VAT date is an important field for the VAT reporting.  

This feature focuses on improving the following:

## Setup of the VAT date feature

- Enabling VAT date usage in the system generally.
- Select the system's default value for the VAT date in different areas (Posting Date or Document Date).
- Periods for reporting VAT and company accounting periods are often different. To allow users to seamlessly report and post VAT according to VAT periods, and to issue internal and other statutory reporting based on accounting periods, this VAT Date feature introduces VAT periods.
- Allow VAT Posting From/To – enter a date range in from/to fields to prevent mistakes of posting to closed accounting or VAT periods.

## Posting sales, purchase, and service transactions with VAT date

To post transactions using a VAT date, the user must fill in the **VAT Date** field on the document headers and journal lines throughout the application.
After the posting of the VAT date, it becomes a part of the posted documents and G/L entries and VAT entries.

## Calculating and posting VAT settlement

# Fixed assets tax depreciation

The Fixed Assets Tax Depreciation feature calculates and posts tax depreciation in compliance with the Income Tax Act (Law 586/1992 §26 - §33). This feature has a special setup for tax depreciation groups to enable entering rates and coefficients for new depreciation methods with fixed assets tax depreciation.

Each long-term tangible fixed asset belongs to a depreciation group. These groups determine minimal depreciation periods and parameters used for calculating depreciation. The following depreciation methods are provided for long-term tangible fixed asset (FA) depreciations for tax purposes:

- Regular – This method is based on the acquisition value and percentage (straight line).
- Accelerated – This method is based on the book value and coefficient (declining balance).
- Regular based on the acquisition value and percentage (straight-line intangible).

Each long-term fixed asset belongs to a depreciation group. These groups determine minimal depreciation periods and parameters that are used for calculating depreciation.

# Payables and receivables in the Czech version

## Credits

Sometimes, a company's customers are also to some extent company vendors. In such situations, it is quite common for companies to compensate their receivables and payables.

The main features of the Credits functionality are:  

- View Balance as Vendor/Balance as Customer – to view the balance as vendor on a customer card and the balance as customer on a vendor card, users must set a customer and vendor business relation with a contact to indicate to the system that even though particular company is registered as a vendor and as a customer, it is in fact the same company.
- Credits Setup – Credit Nos., Credit Bal. Account No., etc.
- Credit Maintaining on Credit Card – choose Customer/Vendor, suggest lines/entries for compensation.
- Agreement printout.
- Credit posting – posted credit is created, entries application is posted.

entries to be counted can be entered manually or automatically from the Credit Card. In addition, there are functions to mark entries to count and balance the balance.
 
There is also a print of the Agreement on Mutual Settlement of Receivables and Payables under Czech legislation.

## Exchange rates adjustment feature

The majority of companies in the Czech Republic request the following improvements to be implemented in Exchange Rates Adjustment:

- Ability to run Exchange Rates Adjustment for Customers, Vendors and Bank Accounts separately
- Ability to have Exchange Rates Adjustment batch post adjustments in detail as well as summarized per currency
- Ability to run Exchange Rates Adjustment just as simulation (without posting) in Test Mode

On standard report Adjust Exchange Rates is now possible to:

- Set Bank Account, Customer, Vendor filter for adjustment
- Choose adjustment for Customer or Vendor or Bank Account
- Choose the test mode
- Choose summarizing entries
- Choose the method for dimension transfer

The Adjust Exchange Rate report feature also modifies the calculation principle for implemented gains and losses based on the Income Tax Act. This feature calculates the implemented gain or loss against the recently adjusted amount.

This feature in the standard version of Microsoft [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] reverses the non-implemented gain or loss first, and calculates the implemented gain or loss afterwards. The calculation is expressed against the amount in the initial exchange rate during the application of the payment and the invoice.

The new calculation principle is implemented for fluctuation in the already adjusted exchange rate.
The Adjust Exchange Rates batch job has been for Czech Advance Payments has also been extended.

## Multiple payables/receivables accounts

Users often post transactions like bad debt or other types of Receivable/Payable transactions that need to be recorded in Customer and Vendor Ledgers, but at same time posted to different Receivable/Payable GL Account, other than the one specified on Customer or Vendor posting groups. The easiest way to enable such functionality is to allow users to change Customer and Vendor posting groups in the moment of posing a particular transaction.

## Customers/vendors reconciliations

At the end of each fiscal year (or another period, when requested), companies send a statement of balances to Customers and Vendors in order to reconcile them with Customer and Vendor records. Customers and Vendors either confirm the statement or not and send it back with corrections, based on their own information. This feature allows users to prepare such report in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)].

## Sales correcting documents

According to the VAT law amendment, it is necessary to differentiate types of Sales Credit-Memo documents. This feature allows users to set up the following Credit Memo Types:

- Corrective Tax Document
- Internal Correction
- Insolvency Tax Document

This Credit Memo Type defines how is handled Postponed VAT on Sales Credit-Memo documents.

## Contacts actualization from ARES

ARES stands for Access to Register of Economic Subjects. ARES is an information system allowing retrieval of information on economic entities registered in the Czech Republic.  

The user can fill in ARES Http in Reg. No. Validation Service Setup.
It is possible to run ARES actualization from Contact, Vendor and Customer Card. It is possible to search the company and decide which fields can be updated in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)](Name, Address, City, Post Code).

## New design of output documents

A new set of printed reports for external documents is created. All documents have the same layout design (headers, footers, font type and size, etc.).
Additionally to standardization, Dynamics NAV documents were extended according to all requirements required by the Czech legislation:  

- Registration No., VAT Registration No.
- Deduction of advances with information about invoice and date of payment received
- VAT specification printout grouped by VAT Identifier
- Naming of tax corrective documents based on Credit Memo type
- Printout of documents related to advance payments

### List of Reports in the CZ Document Set:
- **Sales – Advance Letter CZ**
- **Sales – Advance Invoice CZ**
- **Sales – Advance Credit Memo CZ**
- **Purchase – Advance Letter CZ**
- **Purchase – Advance Invoice CZ**
- **Purchase – Advance Cr. Memo CZ**
- **Purchase – Quote CZ**

# Advanced features of the physical inventory in the Czech version
To comply with the legislation, companies require differentiation of accounting of deficits and surpluses. Thanks to the setting of default Whse. Net Change Template for these inventory movements in the Inventory Setup, the user can easily change Gen. Business Posting Group depending on the type of inventory movements.

Companies need to distinguish the posting of inventory movements of the same goods so they require line-break of physical inventory Journal line. Such accounting is required for legal reasons. For example, they need to have a different account for deficits in the limit, and another account for deficits over the limit.

# Intrastat in the Czech version

The standard Intrastat feature doesn't transfer all and only valid transactions into the Intrastat journal. The result is a lot of manual work to exclude and include excess and missing transactions, which often causes errors. According to the requirements of the Czech Republic, the standard Intrastat feature needs the following improvements:

- Particular options in the Intrastat engine need to be parameterized.
- Handling of supplementary measure units needs to be improved.
- Calculating Intrastat amount and statistical amounts must be improved.
- The **Get Intrastat Entries** batch needs to be improved.
- Export of Intrastat reports to .csv files according to local requirements.

This feature improves the data transferred into the Intrastat journal and prepares the environment for correct Intrastat reporting.

## Intrastat engine setup

Extra Intrastat engine general parameters setup allows you to:

- Set mandatory fields of Intrastat transactions in sales, purchase, and transfer transactions.
- Set where the particular parts of Intrastat data related to items should be taken from, either item or posted entry and which item attributes are mandatory in sales, purchase, and transfer transactions.
- Specify whether the system should ignore item charges related to sales, purchase, and transfer transactions. For example, not including them in Intrastat or statistical amounts.
- Define whether and how the statistical amount is calculated.
- Select Intrastat rounding type to set how Intrastat and statistical amounts are rounded.
- Set foreign currency exchange rates for Intrastat reporting.
- Set the object for the Intrastat report export.

### New setup tables 

New setup tables are added for the following:

- Statistic indications
- Specific movements
- Intrastat delivery groups

### More setup for Intrastat 

More setup for Intrastat enables you to define the following settings:

- Set a country/region code for entry and exit points.
- Set Tariff number supplementary units of measure if you have to report Tariff numbers in supplementary units of measure.
- Set whether specific item charges must be included in Intrastat amount or Intrastat statistical value or both.
- Set Intrastat behavior for shipment methods. Select to include or exclude item charges for specific shipment methods and Intrastat delivery groups for reporting.
- Set an area value in a Location card.
- Set default values and enforce company policies for extra Intrastat data available on Customer and Vendor cards.
- Define and add Intrastat data that includes statistic indication and specific movement on the Item card.
- Create a special foreign currency exchange rate setup and object for the export setup for each Registration country/region.

## Post sales, purchase, or transfer transactions

To identify and enter attributes of sales transactions that are in Intrastat reporting, you need to follow these steps:

- Verify Intrastat data (Transaction Type, Specification and Transport Method, etc.) on the Foreign Trade tab. This data is transferred to the document header from the relevant Customer or Vendor card and can be manually edited.
- Intrastat Transaction field (noneditable) informs the user whether the particular transaction is qualified as Intrastat transaction.
- Identify the Physical Movement in the correction (Credit-Memo) documents using the Physical Transfer field.
- You can manually exclude an Intrastat Transaction from Intrastat reporting using the Intrastat Exclude field.
- Verify Intrastat Data (Tariff No., Statistic Indication, Country/Region of Origin and Net Weight) in the document lines. These were transferred to the line from the relevant Item card and can be manually edited.
- Assign Item Charge to the sales line and include/exclude its value to Intrastat Amount and Statistical Amount.
- During the posting, the system transfers all Intrastat relevant information to Item Ledger Entry.
- During the posting, the system displays an error if any mandatory Intrastat field in Stat. Reporting Setup form isn't filled in. This error prevents the user from posting the transaction.

## Prepare the Intrastat journal

The Intrastat journal contains the following new fields and functionalities:

- Shipment Method Code
- Statistic Indication
- Specific Movement
- Supplementary Units of Measure Calculation
- Declaration Numbering
- Declaration types for Statement Classification – Primary, Null, Replacing, Deleting
- Registration Country/Region entries filtering

The fastest way to prepare the Intrastat journal and make sure all the rules set in the previous steps are followed is by using the **Get Entries** batch job. During the execution of the Get Entries batch job, the following occurs:

- The system considers the Item and Project Ledger Entries created by transactions identified as Intrastat transactions.
- The system ignores sales and purchase Intrastat transactions with the EU-3 Party Trade flag.
- The system includes Intrastat transactions with entry and exit points in EU countries/regions.
- The system includes sales and purchase documents, such as credit memos that are posted with the **Correction** check box as inserted in the Intrastat journal. These documents are the same type as the documents they're correcting, but with the opposite sign for nonphysical transfer documents and the opposite type for documents marked as physical transfer.
- The system excludes the reversed Intrastat transactions (using Undo Receipt/Shipment) from reporting.
- The system ensures the item charges are (not) included, adjusted, and calculated in Intrastat Amount and Statistical Amount according to the user's settings in Stat. Reporting Setup, Item Charges, Shipment Methods, and Item Charge Assignments.
- The system ensures the use of the Supplementary units of measure while preparing the Intrastat journal lines.
- The system makes sure the correct data source is used for Tariff number, Net weight, and Country/Region of origin according to Stat. Reporting setup.

## Export Intrastat report to CSV format

Exporting Intrastat reports to .csv files according to local requirements (for INSTATDESK and INSTATONLINE applications) was added to the Intrastat journal.
Export use object for export based on setup in Stat. Reporting Setup or Registration Country/Region.

To set the regime of transferred tax liability and its reporting. The setting of Tariff and Commodity Numbers ensures monitoring of invoice posting in the appropriate mode (normal or transferred tax liability) and their correct reporting in the VAT control report. As soon as the monitoring of the limit of a given commodity is switched on (PDP check field in the VAT posting settings), if the limit is exceeded (setting in the Commodities code list), a message is displayed stating that the invoice must be charged in the appropriate mode. The codes reported in the control report are set in the Tariff Numbers code list.

# Statutory company information in the Czech version

Many documents are circulating within and outside company structures. The local legislations set minimum necessary requirements of such documents. It's possible to divide such requirements roughly into three groups:

- Company officials' names must be present on some internal and external documents.
- Document footers – Most external documents must contain basic company information in document footers, usually in the company's partner language.
- Registration numbers must be visible in internal and external documents.

This feature allows users to define company officials and designate them as General Manager, Accounting, and Finance Managers for usage in internal and external documents.

Users can define document footers in different languages. Such footers can be used in different reports and documents.

Additional company registration numbers and other registration information can be stored on the **Company Information** page and used in documents.

# Local Banking Feature in the Czech Version
This feature provides improved efficiency and prevents users from making mistakes when entering the customer and vendor bank account data by capturing the bank specific information and eliminating the need to re-enter it every time. Such functionality is needed even more as more bank transactions are executed electronically.

## Banking Setup
The new banking setup introduces:
- General Information – assigning to bank account number
- Numbering – Payment order numbers, bank statement numbers
- Import, Export Information
- Information for posting and applying
- Settings for payment orders and bank statements

New fields are added on the **Bank Account**, **Customer Bank Account** and **Vendor Bank Account** pages.

## Company Default Bank Account

The **Default Bank Account Code** field is added on the **Company Information** page.

## Sales Documents and Bank Accounts

It is quite common for companies to have multiple bank accounts open with multiple banking institutions in order to lower the cost of financial transactions. For that purpose [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] needs to enable users to select the preferred bank account to be printed on sales documents.

The **Bank Account Code** field is added on sales documents, and information from the selected bank account is transferred to the sales header.

Additional fields for payment identification are added to the sales header, such as **Specific Symbol**, **Variable Symbol**, and **Constant Symbol**. This information is transferred to the posted document and customer ledger entry during posting. This allows you to apply payments to invoices precisely.

## Purchase Documents and Bank Accounts

It is quite common for vendors to have multiple bank accounts open with multiple banking institutions. For this purpose [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] needs to enable users to select a vendor bank account for payment on purchase documents.

The **Vendor Bank Account Code** field is added on purchase documents and information from the selected vendor bank account is transferred to the purchase header.

Additional fields for payment identification were added to the purchase header, such as **Specific Symbol**, **Variable Symbol**, and **Constant Symbol**. This information is transferred to the posted document and vendor ledger entry during posting. This allows you to use this information for payments suggesting and application.

## Bank Statement and Payment Orders

This allows you to create payment orders and bank statements. An unlimited number of bank accounts can be registered for various banking institutions and in different currencies. You can import and export files (listings and orders) from banking software.

### Main Features:
- Create, post and export a payment order
- Create, import, and post a bank statement
- Bank statement rollover into a payment reconciliation journal
- Pairing entries in the payment reconciliation journal and posting

### Other Supported Features:
- The **Payment Order** and **Bank Statement** pages can be used in addition to their own import/export functions and standard tools for the definition of import and export formats of banking components.
- Only the standard payment reconciliation journal is used to process statement files. The standard options for automatic alignment of the options are extended by specification. For example, the **O** variable symbol has been extended for payment comparison rules.
- Additional information and rules for calculating payments and text-based account mapping.
- Text mapping of accounts - for automatic matching of bank statement entries from the text given in the description, extension and mapping of accounts according to the variable symbol, constant symbol, specific symbol, bank account, IBAN code, and SWIFT.
- Payment reconciliation journal - the option to start and change automatically.

# VAT correction in local currency in the Czech version

The current system allows you to adjust input VAT only in the currency of the document, not in the local currency. According to domestic legislation, the conversion of the VAT amount to CZK must be stated on domestic documents issued in a foreign currency, and the recipient of the invoice is obliged to comply with these amounts. Therefore, the option to make a VAT correction in the local currency is added to the process of posting a purchase invoice, or to post this correction from an already posted document.

# Set Up Payment Days and Non-Payment Periods
Payment days and non-payment periods are used to calculate due dates. Due date calculation is used for sales and purchase documents.  

A payment day is a day on which invoices are paid.

# Corrective invoices in the Spanish version
The corrective invoice functionality allows you to send a corrective invoice when there's an error or dispute that affects a VAT amount or fiscal data. This invoice includes all legally required data and refers to the original invoice or invoices. The original invoices can't be voided, and remain valid. The corrective invoice contains the corrections, and reasons for these corrections.  

The following options are available:  

- You can set parameters to ensure that all corrective invoices contain corrected invoice number information.  
- When preparing a corrective invoice for posting, you can select posted invoices from a list. These invoice numbers are used as identifiers for the corrected invoices.  
- You can print corrective invoices according to legal requirements.  
- From a posted invoice, you can use a reference to look up the related corrective invoices.  

The corrective invoice must meet the following requirements:  

- You can correct several invoices by using a single corrective invoice. The corrective invoice must use all of the corrected invoice numbers.  
- You must clearly indicate the invoice numbers for the invoices you're correcting.  
- You can post a corrective invoice without corrected invoice numbers only when the corrections are necessary due to discounts or volume rebates.

# Equivalence Charges (EC) in the Spanish version
An Equivalence Charge (EC) is a tax that is used in retail sales and in activities that don't follow VAT rules. Under EC rules, companies must pay a surcharge to their vendors when purchasing goods, in addition to the usual VAT. However, when selling goods, only VAT can be charged. Some general posting groups must have an EC percentage in addition to the VAT percentage. This information is tracked separately, but in order to minimize changes, both taxes are combined.  

The **EC %** field is a separate field in the **Purchase Line**, **Sales Line**, **Sales Line Archive** and **Purchase Line Archive** tables. However, in sales and purchase lines, both taxes are combined and the value is displayed in the **VAT %** field. The **VAT + EC %** field is used when these values are combined. At the time of posting, the VAT percentage and the EC percentage are inserted in the **VAT Entry** table. This makes it possible to print the **Sales Invoice Book** report and the **Purchases Invoice Book** report.

# Report 347 in the Spanish Version
The **Report 347** report is a required annual report sent by all companies to the tax authorities to reflect the sales or purchases in a given period, based on **VAT Date**. This report also includes entries such as payment in cash that was received in the period. The **Report 347** report is generated in a format that is approved by the tax authorities. This file can be uploaded to the Spanish Tax Agency website or submitted on CD-ROM. For more information, see the [Spanish Tax Agency](https://www.agenciatributaria.es/AEAT.internet/en_gb/Inicio.shtml) website.  

## File Format for Report 347  
The file format for **Report 347** includes at least one responsible company, a deponent, and a customer/vendor register. A responsible company is a company that submits the information to the Spanish Tax Agency. Deponent information comes from the **Company Information** table and the request form. Customer information comes from the **Customer** table, the **Cust. Ledger Entry** table, and the **G/L Entry** table. Vendor information comes from the **Vendor** table and the **Vendor Ledger Entry** table.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  If there are no file records, the file is not created and an error message is displayed.  

## File Format Restrictions for Report 347  
Before creating **Report 347**, the following file format restrictions will be considered:  

- All amounts must be positive.  
- All text must be capitalized.  
- All alphanumeric fields must be left-aligned.  
- All numeric fields must be right-aligned.  
- If the company receives payments in cash that are over the predefined official threshold for these transactions, a four-digit year must be included. The year indicates when the invoices that are related to receivables were posted.  
- Special characters must be converted to standard characters.  
- If the field has no value, it will be blank for alphanumeric fields and populated with zeros for numeric fields.

# Calculating Due Dates in the Spanish Version
In Spain, there is a legal limit for the number of days that a payment can be delayed. You must submit an annual report of purchases and sales for payments that were made before or after the due date. The legal requirements depend on whether the customer is a private company or a public administration. For more information, see the official declaration [BOE-A-2010-10708](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=224630) on the Boletín Oficial del Estado website.  

## Payment Terms  
To help you meet the legal requirements, you can set up payment terms so that the due dates are calculated correctly. This includes specifying the maximum number of calendar days that a payment can be delayed after delivery. For example, you can create separate payment terms for sales to the public sector and sales to private companies. The following table illustrates how you can set up payment terms.  

|Field|Public sector|Private company|  
|---------------------------------|-------------------|---------------------|  
|**Code**|**1M(8D) PUB**|**1M(8D) PRI**|  
|**Due Date Calculation**|**1M**|**1M**|  
|**Max. No. of Days till Due Date**|**30**|**60**|  

 For each customer and vendor, you must select the appropriate payment term code. Then, when you create a document for that customer or vendor, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] will calculate a due date that does not exceed the limit for the relevant payment term.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  You cannot post a document that creates a bill where one or more installments have a due date that is later than the limit that is specified in the **Max. No. of Days till Due Date** field.  

 If a due date cannot be calculated based on the limit, the due date is set to blank. For example, if the calculated due date falls in a non-payment period and there is no available date before that period, you must specify a due date manually. You cannot post a document that has an empty due date.  

 You can change the calculated due date manually, but you cannot make it later than the limit that you specify for the payment term. For example, the due date can be calculated to be very late because of conflicts with non-payment periods. In that case, you can decide to make the due date earlier than the non-payment period.  

## Overdue Payments  
 You must include information about overdue payments in the annual reports for the government. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] includes two reports to help you identify overdue payments from customers and payments that you are late in making.  

 The **Customer - Overdue Payments** and **Vendor - Overdue Payments** reports include a section for each customer or vendor that lists the payments with the following information:  

- Invoice number  
- Invoice description  
- Document number  
- Posting date  
- Due date  
- Days overdue  
- Currency code  
- Amount  
- Amount in the local reporting currency (LCY)  

Each section has a summary section with the following information.  

|Information|Description|  
|-----------------|---------------------------------------|  
|Weighted average term exceeded|This formula is calculated based on the number of posted payments for the specified period, the number of days that payments were delayed, and the paid amount in (LCY). For more information, see the official declaration [BOE-A-2010-10708](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=224630) on the Boletín Oficial del Estado website.|  
|Payments within the legal limit|The amounts in LCY and the percentage of the total payments that were made before the maximum allowed due date for each transaction.|  
|Payments outside the legal limit|The amounts in LCY and the percentage of the total payments that were made after the maximum allowed due date for each transaction.|  

 At the end of these reports, there is a section that summarizes this information for all payments. These reports will show information based on applied detailed customer ledger entries or applied detailed vendor ledger entries. The information is based on the date filters that you specify. For more information, see Customer - Overdue Payments and Vendor - Overdue Payments.

# Set Up SII for VAT Reporting in the Spanish Version

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] supports the Spanish SII requirements for VAT reporting (Immediate Information Supply).  

## Enable the SII module in the Spanish version of Business Central

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **SII Setup**, and then select the related link.  
2. On the **General** FastTab, select the **Enabled** field.  

   The **Enabled** field is automatically selected if you import a certificate in the **Certificate Code** field on the **Certificate** FastTab.  

3. In the **Operation Date** field, specify whether you want to use the posting date or the document date as the operation date in the XML file that's sent to the tax authorities through SII.  
4. If you want to submit documents in batches, select the **Enable Batch Submission** field. If you enable document batch submissions, you can submit documents in batches either manually or automatically. For automatic batch submission, documents are transferred to the **SII History** page in a status of *Pending* when you post them. Then, when the threshold value is met or exceeded, the documents are submitted in batches. Learn more in the [Job batch submission thresholds](#job-batch-submission-thresholds) section.

   If you don't enable batch submissions, each document is submitted when it's posted, and the result is shown on the **SII History** page.
   
5. Configure the other fields, import a valid certificate, and specify the relevant endpoints with the target URLs. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](../../includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
6. Choose the **Tax Period** option for reporting. Default value is **Monthly**, but user can choose **Quarterly** if needed. If user use **Quarterly** it will be showed in the XML message.  

## Job batch submission thresholds

If you want to use automatic batch submission, the **Job Batch Submission Threshold** field specifies the threshold number of documents with the status *Pending* that will trigger an automatic batch submission.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Both the **Enabled** and the **Enabled Batch submission** fields must be selected for the threshold value to have effect.  

If the threshold is set to zero (0), documents will be submitted when posted.

If the threshold is set to one or more, documents are automatically submitted in batches. When the number of pending entries exceeds the threshold value, all pending entries are automatically submitted.  

You can always manually submit documents that have a *Pending* status by selecting **Retry** or **Retry All** on the **SII History** page.

## Specify customers without a registered NIF with AEAT

If a customer's NIF number isn't yet registered in the AEAT database, document submissions will be rejected. In this case, you can select the **Not in AEAT** option and resubmit the document.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customers**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the relevant customer to open the **Customer Card**.
3. Select the **Not in AEAT** field.

## Set VAT exemptions

To indicate value-added tax (VAT) exemptions under the SII scheme you can either select an exemption code for a VAT clause on the **VAT Clauses** page, or you can create a new clause that corresponds to the exemption and choose the appropriate code in the **SII Exemption Code** field.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>The default values are provided to cover standard scenarios. Your business and type of business transactions and any customization you may have may require you to select a different value to meet the reporting requirements under SII.

To enable reporting on **Non Taxable Due To Localization Rules** scenarios, set the appropriate **VAT Posting Setup Card** on the **VAT Posting Setup** page by selecting the option in the **No Taxable Type** field. To ensure that **VAT Posting Setup** works this way, the value of the **VAT %** field must equal **0** (zero). 

When you post the document, and the VAT is configured with the active **No Taxable Type** field, this field together with the **VAT Entry** field will create a new **No Taxable Entry** that has details about this tax exemption.

### VAT reporting based on VAT exemption

The **Calc. and Post VAT Settlement** report processes the **No Taxable Entries** in a similar way to **VAT Entries**. You can post some documents with **No Taxable** selected for a specific period for three different no taxable **VAT Posting Setup** entries and run the **The Calc. and Post VAT Settlement** report. The **No Taxable** section will be printed below the **VAT Entries** section on the report.

If you decide to close some entries for **VAT Posting Setup**, the system automatically closes the **No Taxable Entries** that are connected with this **VAT Entry**. If you run the **Calc. and Post VAT Settlement** report, it shows all other entries but doesn't include closed entries for the same period.

> [!NOTE]
> You can generate the **VAT Declaration** on the **VAT Statements** page. Select **Preview** on the **VAT Statements** page to view the result for the option **Include VAT Entries** = **Open**. This option also works for **No Taxable Entries**. Printing of the **VAT Statement** report also supports the **Include VAT Entries** option for the same values (**Open**, **Closed**, and **Open and Closed**) for both **VAT Entries** and **No Taxable Entries**.

## Ignoring invoice lines for SII 

In some situations, the user must use a line in the invoice, but not report it to SII. To make a setup for this requirement, follow these steps:

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Posting Setup**, and then select the related link. 
1. Open the **VAT Posting Setup Card** where you want to configure this exemption and choose the **Ignore in SII** field for this posting group.  

When you have configured **VAT Posting Setup**, and after you create sales or purchase invoice, you can select **Item** and/or **G/L Account** with the certain **VAT Posting Setup**, and the line with this setup will be ignored when you report it to SII. This line exists in the **VAT Entry**, but this entry will have *Yes* in the **Ignore in SII** field.

# Set up 340 reports for small businesses in the Spanish version
Use the following procedure to set up your business to report on a cash basis, that is, Cash Accounting Criteria (CAC). If you haven't already done so, you can set up posting groups for cash-based VAT accounting for purchases and sales.  

When you file a report 340, any transaction lines that are associated with unrealized VAT are assumed to take place under cash accounting.  

After VAT posting is set up to handle unrealized VAT, any printed sales order, purchase order, and so forth, will be modified to have the following label in bold font added to the report just before the section reporting the document lines: **Régimen especial del criterio de caja**.  

## To set up reporting under CAC  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Ledger Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  On the **General** FastTab, select the **Unrealized VAT** check box on the **General Ledger Setup** page. Choose the **OK** button.  
3.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Posting Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
4.  On the **VAT Posting Setup** page, select a group to modify or create a posting group that has general ledger accounts to treat the VAT amounts for the various unrealized VAT accounts in your VAT Posting Setup, and then choose the **Edit** action.  
5.  On the **General** FastTab, set the **Unrealized VAT Type** to **Percentage**.  
6.  On the **Sales** and **Purchase** FastTabs, specify general ledger accounts for the various **VAT Unreal. Account** fields.

Código Cuenta Cliente (CCC) is a unique account code used by Spanish banks to identify their customers. The CCC code is printed on bank documents such as checks and statements.  

You can set up CCC codes in the following locations:  

- **Bank Account Card** page  
- **Company Information** page  
- **Customer Bank Account Card** page  
- **Vendor Bank Account Card** page  

The following procedure describes how to set up bank CCC codes for your company.  

## To enter CCC codes  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Company Information**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Payments** FastTab, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field           |Position |Description                            |  
    |----------------|---------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**CCC Bank No.**|1-4|Identifies the bank that opened the account.|  
    |**CCC Bank Branch No.**|5-8|Identifies the branch code. If the bank doesn't use this reference, the branch code can be zeros.|  
    |**CCC Control Digits**|9-10|Identifies the control digits.|  
    |**CCC Bank Account No.**|11-20 (Spain)<br /><br /> 11-21 (Portugal)|Identifies the account number, which might be adjusted with preceding zeros.|  

The following procedure describes how to set up bank CCC codes for existing customer bank accounts, but the same steps apply to vendors, bank accounts, and company information.  

## To set up bank CCC codes for a customer bank account  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customer Bank Account Card**, and then choose the related link.  
2  On the **Transfer** FastTab, enter information into the relevant CCC fields.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  You must set up the company information on the **Payments** FastTab.  

3. Choose the **OK** button.

# Set Limits for Due Dates
You can modify payment terms to have limits for the maximum number of days that can be between a delivery and the corresponding payment.  

Legal limits for the gap between delivery and payment determine how due dates are calculated. For example, if you create a payment term that will be used for sales to the public sector, the **Max. No. of Days till Due Date** field for that payment term must be set to 30 days.  

## To set limits for due dates on payment terms  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Payment Terms**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Select the payment term that you want to modify, and then, in the **Max. No. of Days till Due Date** field, specify the number of calendar days to allow between delivery and payment.  

Next, you must make sure that you specify the appropriate payment terms for your public and private customers and vendors. When you create a document for that customer or vendor, the due date for the payment is calculated from the day that the customer received the items or services. Then, you must update the **Document Date** field for the document with the date of the receipt. For example, if you update a sales invoice when you are informed of delivery, the due date is calculated based on the new document date that you specified. The calculated due date cannot be further away than the limit that you specified for the payment term.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  You cannot post a document that creates a bill where one or more installments have a due date that is later than the limit that is specified in the **Max. No. of Days till Due Date** field.

# Electronic invoicing in Spain

This article provides information about how to set up and work with the Spanish localization of the E-Document framework.

## E-Documents framework setup

To learn more about how to set up the E-Documents framework, go to [Set up e-documents](../../finance-how-setup-edocuments.md).  

## Set up local formats  

To set up the format for the E-Document service, follow these steps:  

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **E-Document Services**, and then select the related link.
2. Select **New**, and on the **E-Document Services** page, on the **General** FastTab, in the **Document Format** field, choose **Factura-E 3.2.2**.  
3. Configure the fields as described in [Set up e-documents](../../finance-how-setup-edocuments.md).
4. Close the page.

For use in sales, set up the workflow as described in [Set up the workflow](../../finance-how-setup-edocuments.md#set-up-the-workflow). Then, on the **Document Sending Profile** page, add the workflow for the customers you send e-invoices to.  

## Work with e-invoices

To learn more about how to use the E-Documents framework in purchases, go to [Use e-documents in the purchases process](../../finance-how-use-edocuments-purchase.md). For the sales process, go to [Use e-documents in the sales process](../../finance-how-use-edocuments.md).  

> [!NOTE]
> The following nodes are determined using the following methods:
>
> - **InvoiceIssueData**/**ExchangeRateDetails**/**ExchangeRateDate** is taken as the **Posting Date** of the document.
> - **InvoiceHeader**/**InvoiceClass** is taken from the **SII Sales Invoice Type**. Currently, we support the following types: **OO = Original Invoice**, **OR = Corrective**, and **OC = Summary**.
> - **InvoiceLine**/**UnitOfMeasure** tries to convert existing units of measure to the supported units of measures. If it can't, it skips the node because it isn't mandatory.

### Corrections with credit memos

When you work with credit memos, before you post, on the **Credit Memo Details** FastTab add a reason code in the **Factura-E Reason Code** field.  

> [!NOTE]
> The **Corrective**/**TaxPeriod**/**StartDate**-**EndDate** nodes are determined using the following method:
>
> 1. Extract the posting date from the original document.
> 2. Match the posting date with the **VAT Return Period**.
> 3. If no match is found, match the posting date with the **Accounting Period**.
> 4. If a match still isn't found, use the current year.

# Electronic payments – AEB N34.1 in the Spanish version
With the electronic payments functionality, you can pay vendors using electronic payments rather than printing paper checks. Electronic payments are exported into a standard AEB N34.1 file format used by most banks in Spain. This file is then transmitted to your bank.  

You can create electronic payments from the payment journals or from the Cartera functionality (report list). This is intended to cover the following cases:  

- Invoices and open, non-grouped Cartera documents. If you select to pay using electronic payments, then the payment file is generated from the **Export Electronic Payments** report.  

- Invoices and Cartera documents that are grouped in a payment order. If you select to pay using electronic payments, the payment file is generated from the **PO - Export N34.1** report, available in the Cartera report list.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  Partners may need to modify this report to meet their customer’s bank individual requirements.  

Before you can transfer payments electronically to a vendor, you need to set up a bank account for the vendor. Also, you need to set up the electronic payment links with your bank and set up the bank account card in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] for your own bank to handle the electronic payments. The bank should provide the transmission program.

# Cartera Module
The Cartera module allows you to use specific documents, such as bills of exchange and promissory notes, to manage customer and vendor payments.  

You can use the Cartera module to manage transactions made with different financial units based on:  

- Document type  
- Cost  
- Credit limit  

The balances are kept in local currencies and original currencies.  

The Cartera module contains the Receivables Cartera module and the Payments Cartera module. The Receivables Cartera module allows you to manage bills generated from sales invoices. The Payments Cartera module allows you to manage payables documents generated from purchase invoices or from the Cartera journal.

# Receivables Cartera module in the Spanish version
The Receivables Cartera module allows you to manage bills generated from sales invoices. The documents are managed using:  

- Due date  
- Bank  
- Value  
- Document type  
- Currency  

You can manually create bills using the **Cartera Journal**. You can also use the Receivables Cartera module to manage all sales invoices that the company yields to a factoring company.  

## Bill groups  
With the Receivables Cartera module, you can manage bill groups and discount bill groups in your local currency or original currency.  

There are various criteria for grouping documents in a bill group. You can group documents for the same customer, documents with the same due date, documents drawn in the same market, and so on. You can group one or more receivable documents in one bill group.  

A bill group consists of one or more documents grouped together to submit to a bank. A bill group can be submitted for collection or discount.  

If submitted for collection, the bank is only responsible for processing the collection of the documents on the due date.  

If the bill group is submitted for discount, the bank advances the amount of the bill group (or a portion of it) in the case of factoring to the company, and takes the responsibility for collecting on the due dates of the documents that make up the bill group.  

A bill group of invoices can be submitted to a financial institution (factor) for risked factoring (the risk of insolvency is covered by the company) or unrisked factoring (the risk of insolvency is covered by the factor).  

Bill groups include:  

- Finance charges for collection or discount management  
- Finance charges for returned bills  
- Interest for discounts  

With the Receivables Cartera module, you can yield credits or factoring of sales invoice bill groups, including the finance charge calculation by the factoring company. You can request the anticipated value of the yielded invoices, or only the management of the collection.  

You can use bill groups for the following:  

- Factoring without risk - The factoring company takes on the risks associated with nonpayment.  
- Factoring with risk - You take on the risks associated with nonpayment.

# Use the same External Document Numbers across fiscal years

In general [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] does not allow for posting documents with the same value in **External Document No.**, not even across fiscal years, due to legislation. In Spain however, this is accepted, and now [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] includes an option to allow this behavior.  

## To allow posting of the same **External Document No.** across fiscal years

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchases & Payables Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. In the **General** FastTab, select the **Same Ext. Doc. No. in Diff. FY** field.

# Create Report 349 in the Spanish Version
You must submit a periodic report of trade with other EU countries/regions to the tax authorities. This declaration, Report 349, must be submitted to the tax authorities electronically on the tax agency website or on a CD-ROM. For more information, see the [Spanish Tax Agency](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=238181) website.  

## To create Report 349  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Make 349 Declaration**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  On the **Options** FastTab, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Fiscal Year**|Specify the year of the reporting period.|  
    |**Period**|Select the period that the report covers. This can be a year, a month, or a quarter.|  
    |**Period Frequency Change**|Select to change the period frequency of the report.|  
    |**Contact Name**|Specify the contact name for your company.|  
    |**Telephone Number**|Specify the telephone number for contact.|  
    |**Declaration Number**|Specify the number of the declaration. For example, if this is your first 349 declaration, the number is **3490000000000**.|  
    |**Company Country/Region**|Enter the country/region for your company.|  
    |**Declaration Media Type**|Select the media type for the declaration.<br /><br /> To submit the declaration electronically, select **Telematic**.<br /><br /> To submit the declaration on CD-ROM, select **Physical support**. If you want to submit the 349 declaration on a CD-ROM, you must also print labels for the disk. For more information, see Declaration Labels.|  
    |**Excluded Gen. Product Posting Groups**|Specify the general product posting group that you do not want to include in the declaration.|  

3.  Choose the **OK** button.  

If the period includes a credit memo, a message appears, and if you choose the **OK** button, the **Customer/Vendor Warnings 349** page opens and shows all credit memos for that period.  

Entries related to credit memos display on the **Customer/Vendor Warnings 349** page because you may want to include them as corrections to invoices. For example, if you posted a sales invoice in October, and you then post a credit memo in November that corrects the October invoice, a warning displays. Then, you can make the appropriate changes on the **Customer/Vendor Warnings 349** page. You must specify which section of the total amount for that customer must be included in the November 349 declaration.  

## To correct warnings for Report 349  

1.  On the **Customer/Vendor Warnings 349** page, select the line for the relevant customer.  
2.  Make the appropriate changes to the line.  

    The following table describes the key fields for correcting a 349 declaration that includes a credit memo.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Include Correction**|Select to accept the correction that the credit memo has resulted in.|  
    |**Delivery Operation Code**|Specifies the type of export delivery for the VAT transaction.<br /><br /> If you select a month in the **Original Declaration Period** field, the **Delivery Operation Code** field helps you identify the appropriate amount, which is shown in the **Previous Declared Amount** field.|  
    |**Previous Declared Amount**|Specifies the total amount that has been included in a 349 declaration.<br /><br /> This field is calculated only if you changed the **Original Declaration Period** field. It is calculated based on the specified delivery operation code.|  
    |**Original Declaration FY**|Specifies the fiscal year that the original 349 declaration was submitted to the tax authorities with the invoice that this credit memo corrects. **Warning:**  Do not change this field if the credit memo applies to an invoice that has not yet been declared to the tax authorities because it is part of the current 349 declaration.|  
    |**Original Declaration Period**|Specifies the month, such as **01** for the month of January, for the original 349 declaration that included the invoice that this credit memo corrects. **Warning:**  Do not change this field if the credit memo applies to an invoice that has not yet been declared to the tax authorities because it is part of the current 349 declaration.|  
    |**Original Declared Amount**|Specifies the correction for the original transaction.<br /><br /> For a credit memo for an invoice that was included in an earlier 349 declaration, enter the amount that should have been declared for this customer or vendor. This amount is the invoiced amount less the credit memo amount.<br /><br /> For a credit memo for an invoice that is part of the current 349 declaration, enter the credit memo amount.|  

3.  When you have made the appropriate changes, choose the **Process** action.  

    A page appears where you must confirm that you want to update the 349 declaration for those entries where the **Include Correction** check box is selected.  

For corrections to amounts that were included in an earlier 349 declaration, the page can show more than one warning for a customer or vendor with the same values in the **Original Declaration FY** and **Original Declaration Period** fields. In that case, you should combine the corrections in a single line so that the appropriate amounts for the **Previous Declared Amount** field and the **Original Declared Amount** field are included in the 349 declaration.

# Transaction numbers
Transaction numbers allow you to group entries with the same document number and date, so that you can balance them together. Transaction numbers usually begin with the number 2 each year. The number 1 is reserved for the opening transaction, which is automatically created each year. The only exception is for the first accounting period in the first year. In this case, the opening transaction is the number 1.  

When you enter a transaction number in the first line of a journal, the same transaction number is automatically entered into the other lines if the entries aren't balanced. If the entries are balanced, the next number in the sequence is automatically entered into the other lines.  

Having a unique sequential transaction number, ordered by date, allows you to identify every transaction posted in a fiscal year.

# VAT Reports in the Spanish Version
VAT is charged on transactions that involve goods and services in Spain or goods imported into Spain. The following information provides more details about VAT functionality.  

## Equivalence Charge  
Equivalence Charge (EC) tax applies to activities that do not follow VAT rules. According to EC rules, companies must pay a surcharge to their vendors in addition to VAT. However, they can only charge VAT without the surcharge on sales invoices.  

### VAT with EC Percentage  
Preset general posting groups have an EC percentage in addition to their VAT percentage. Although the EC is tracked separately, both tax values are merged with VAT when it is possible. If the EC percentage is a separate field in the posting group, the EC is merged with the value in the **VAT %** column.  

For printing sales and purchase invoice books, the VAT percent and EC percentages are displayed in the **VAT Entry** table during posting.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  If the item has no taxable VAT, 0 is automatically displayed in the **VAT %** field in the VAT information pages.  

### Telematic VAT  
With telematic VAT you can design and generate monthly and yearly tax reports as electronic files or printed files. You can submit these reports to the tax authorities using a third-party program or an XML file from the tax authorities' website.  

### VAT Statement  
The VAT statement displays VAT amounts and base amounts in different columns.  

There are two report template types in the **VAT Statement Name** table:  

- **One-Column Report**  
- **Two-Columns Report**  

### VAT-VIES Declaration

You can report VAT on sales to other countries/regions in the European Union (EU). For more information, see [Report VAT to Tax Authorities](../../finance-how-report-vat.md).

# Report 340 in the Spanish Version
The **Report 340** report contains information about invoices and taxes that were issued or received by your company in a given period, based on **VAT Date**. The report is generated in a format that is approved by the tax authorities. This report should be submitted in the company's monthly or quarterly liquidation period, depending on the size of the company. This file can be uploaded to the Spanish Tax Agency website or submitted on CD-ROM. For more information, see the [Spanish Tax Agency](https://www.agenciatributaria.es/) website. If the number of operations exceeds 1,000,000, the report can be submitted electronically.  

## Reporting Requirements for Entrepreneurs and Small Companies  
The reporting requirements for entrepreneurs and small businesses are modified to support businesses that use the cash accounting criteria (CAC).  

A company can use the cash accounting method if business sales do not exceed 2,000,000 euros per year. There is one exception to this rule for a business whose receipts in cash from any single customer exceeds the sum of 100,000 euros.  

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], you can set up posting groups for cash-based VAT accounting for purchases and sales.  

 If you file a report under this regimen, the following label is applied to certain [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] reports: **Régimen especial del criterio de caja**. The modified reports are:  

|Report|Description|  
|------------|---------------------------------------|  
|Report 117|Reminder|  
|Report 118|Finance Charge Memo|  
|Report 205|Order Confirmation|  
|Report 206|Sales - Invoice|  
|Report 207|Sales - Credit Memo|  
|Report 405|Purchase Order|  
|Report 406|Purchase – Invoice|  
|Report 407|Purchase - Credit Memo|  
|Report 5900|Service Order|  
|Report 5911|Service - Invoice|  
|Report 5912|Service - Credit Memo|  

## File Format  
The file format for the **Report 340** report includes one deponent record, and at least one issued invoice or one received invoice. Deponent information comes from the **Company Information** table and the request form. Issued invoices come from the companies to which you have sold goods or services. Customer information comes from the **Customer** table. Received invoices come from the companies from which you have purchased goods or services. Vendor information comes from the **Vendor** table.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  If there are no file format records, the file is not created and an error message is displayed.  

## Entries Included in Report 340  
The entries included in **Report 340** must have been posted in the period and fiscal year entered in the request form. The entries that are included in the report of payments in cash can be posted from the previous year.  

### Businesses  
**Report 340** must include the following entries:  

- Posted sales invoices and credit memos.  
- Posted purchase invoices and credit memos.  
- Posted service invoices and credit memos.  
- Auto invoices and auto credit memos.  
- Payments in cash.  

Entries in the **Sales Invoice Book** report must be included in the report as issued invoices.  

Entries in the **Purchase Invoice book** report must be included in the report as received invoices.  

### Small Businesses  
For small businesses and entrepreneurs operating under the Cash Accounting Criteria (CAC), Report 340 reports invoices under the CAC. The invoice is marked with a "Z" for operation type. If the invoice is under the CAC, then the following is reported:  

- Payment/receipt method, that is, cash, check, transfer, and so forth. This field is blank in the report if no payment collection has occurred.  
- Payment/receipt amount (full, partial)  
- Payment/receipt dates  

### Invoices Including Different VAT Percentages or EC Percentages  
If the invoice has more than one VAT percentage or equivalence charge (EC) percentage, the report must include all of the records with different VAT percentage and EC percentage. If the invoice includes equivalence charges (EC), the EC percentage and EC amount without VAT will be displayed.  

All of these records will show the same invoice ID and customer VAT number.  

## File Format Restrictions  
Before creating the **Report 340** report, you should consider the following file format restrictions:  

- All amounts must be in euro.  
- All amounts must be positive. In the fields where negative amounts are possible, **N** is specified.  
- All text must be capitalized.  
- All alphanumeric fields must be left-aligned.  
- All numeric fields must be right-aligned.  
- Special characters are converted to standard characters.  
- If the field has no value, it will be empty for alphanumeric fields and populated with zeros for numeric fields.

# Create templates for telematic VAT statements in XML file format
In order to submit VAT statements electronically, you must create templates to generate the required files. You can submit files in text format and in XML format. This procedure describes how to create templates for XML files.  

For more information, see the [Spanish Tax Agency](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=238181) website.  

## To create a template for VAT statements in XML file format

2.  Select the required VAT statement, and then choose the **Design XML file** action.  
3.  On the **XML Transference Format** page, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    > [!IMPORTANT]  
    >  The values for the fields are determined by the tax authorities.  
    >   
    >  For more information, see the [Spanish Tax Agency](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=238181) website.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**VAT Stmt. Name**|Specify the VAT statement name that this template is for.|  
    |**No.**|Specify the field number in the text file.|  
    |**Line Type**|Specify whether the VAT statement line type is an XML element or an XML attribute.|  
    |**Indentation Level**|Specify the indentation level for the label. This level is used to format the XML file.|  
    |**Parent Line No.**|Specify the line number of the parent line that the current line is indented under.|  
    |**Value Type**|Specify the subtype of the field.<br /><br /> The subtype specifies if the line must show only the integer part of an amount, the decimal part, or the full amount.|  
    |**Description**|Specify the text that you want to appear on the label.|  
    |**Value**|Specify the value for the label.|  
    |**Box**|Specify the box number from which to retrieve the data.|

# Post and Print All Transactions for a Period
Companies must submit their business transaction entries, grouped by transaction numbers, in an annual report to tax authorities. Every general ledger transaction must have a sequential number for the fiscal year. Posting transactions will assign transaction numbers to general ledger entries.  

## To post all transactions for a period  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Journal**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Batch Name**|Select the required general journal batch name.|  
    |**Transaction No.**|Enter the transaction number. **Note:**  If the transaction is balanced, the next number displays automatically, and the related transaction details appear in the next row. If the transaction is not balanced, the same transaction number is displayed with related transaction details.|  

3.  Choose the **Post** action, and then choose the **Yes** button to confirm posting.  
4.  Choose the **OK** button.  

    After the journal is posted, a final transaction number is assigned to entries in the journal. This number is a sequential, non-gap number. Thus, for each fiscal year, all of the entries grouped by their transaction number are sorted by date in sequential order, with no gaps or blanks.

# Create report 347 in the Spanish version
All companies must provide an annual declaration, **Report 347**, to the tax authorities providing the sales and purchase transactions from the previous fiscal period.  

The Report 347 declaration is generated in a format that tax authorities approved to upload to their Virtual Office website or submission on CD-ROM.  

Before you create the Report 347 declaration, you can run a report to identify payments in cash that isn't applied to a document.  

## To identify unapplied payments in cash  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **347**, and then choose the link for the **347 Declaration** area.  
2.  Choose the **Unapplied Payments in Cash** action.

# Payments in Cash
As of January 1, 2012, companies in Spain are required to submit a summary for payments in cash that are greater than EUR 6.000.00 for each customer for each year.  

## Reporting Payments in Cash  
If you are reporting payments in cash, the following sequence of tasks are listed in the order in which they are generally performed:  

- Applying payments in cash to invoices.  
- Making 340 Payments in cash declaration.  

## Applying Payments in Cash to Invoices  
You apply payments in cash to invoices that you have received from customers. For information about how to apply payments to invoices, see [Managing Receivables](../../receivables-manage-receivables.md). Only the applied payments in cash are used for reporting payments in cash. If you do not apply payments in cash to invoices, you cannot report payments in cash.  

## Making 340 Payments in Cash Declaration  
You use the **Make 340 Declaration** batch job to report 340 payments in cash declaration. For information about how to specify and select information to generate the declaration, see Make 340 Declaration.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  The payments made through banks are excluded.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  The amount received in cash in the declaration .txt file can contain values that differ from the total invoiced amount for a customer. This is because not all of the payments are made in cash.

# Report 349 in the Spanish Version
You must submit a periodic report of trade with other EU countries/regions to the tax authorities. In Spain, this Report 349 is part of the EU intra-community VAT Information Exchange System (VIES).  

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], the Report 349 declaration is based on VAT entries that are filtered by the EU country/region codes. You must create a 349 declaration and then submit the file to the [Spanish Tax Agency](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=238181) website or on CD-ROM.  

When you create a Report 349 declaration that includes credit memos, the entries will display on the **Customer/Vendor Warnings 349** page so that you can include them as corrections to invoices. You must make the appropriate changes to the lines on the **Customer/Vendor Warnings 349** page before you can submit the declaration. For more information, [Create Report 349](how-to-create-report-349.md).  

## Delivery Operation Codes  
The **Report 349** declaration must specify separate operation codes for the delivery of goods to other EU countries/regions. You can set up separate VAT product posting groups for each type of export delivery. Then, when you apply a VAT posting group to an item that is sold, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] stores the delivery operation code, and the transaction is included in the quarterly 349 declaration.  

Before you submit the 349 declaration, you must make sure that all VAT entries have the relevant delivery operation codes. The following table describes the delivery operation codes that are currently supported in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)].  

|Delivery operation code|Description|  
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
|**E**|Identifies transactions with items that were delivered to customers in another EU country/region and are not included in either the M or the H delivery operation code.|  
|**M**|Identifies transactions with items that were delivered to customers in another EU country/region and which were previously imported into Spain as tax exempt according to the VAT law.|  
|**H**|Identifies transactions with items that were delivered to customers in another EU country/region and which were previously imported into Spain as tax exempt according to the VAT law, and which were conducted by an official tax representative.|  

 To help you manage exports to other EU countries/regions in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], you can create VAT product posting groups for each operation code. Then, when you apply a VAT posting group to an item that is sold, the Delivery Operation Code field in the **VAT Entry** table identifies the VAT transactions according to the operation code.  

### Delivery Operation Codes and Item Setup  
You can set up a VAT product posting group for each delivery operation type and then assign the appropriate VAT product posting group to items in the Item Card page.  

If you have an inventory item that can be imported in different ways, for example if it is tax exempt in some cases and not tax exempt in other cases, you can create separate item cards with the appropriate VAT product posting group.  

In the following example, you import chairs from another EU country/region, and you resell the chairs to customers in other countries/regions. One type of chair is exempt from VAT when you import it under certain circumstances, but otherwise it is not exempt. As a result, you create two item cards for it:  

- One item card with a VAT product posting group with the **Delivery Operation Code** field set to **M**.  
- One item card with a VAT product posting group with the **Delivery Operation Code** field set to **E**.  

Then, when you create a sales order, you must make sure that you select the correct item in the sales lines.  

When you post the sales invoice, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] saves the delivery operation code in the **VAT Entry** table, and then, when you create the Report 349 declaration, the VAT amount is included in the section for the appropriate delivery operation code.

# Create Report 340 in the Spanish version
Report 340 includes all sales invoices and purchase invoices posted by a company during a given period. The report also includes the operation codes with related taxes and payments in cash.  

This report is generated in a format approved by the tax authorities. You should submit this report on a monthly or quarterly basis, depending on the size of your company.  

## To create Report 340  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Make 340 Declaration**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  On the **Make 340 Declaration** page, on the **Options** FastTab, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Fiscal Year**|Enter the fiscal year for which you want to create the operation declaration.|  
    |**Month**|Select the month that you want to include in the operations declaration.|  
    |**Min. Payment Amount**|Enter the amount that you received in cash for the selected **G/L Acc. for Payments in Cash**. **Important:**  The field is designed for reporting payments in cash. The amount that you select decides the sum of customer entries in the report. If the total invoiced amount for a customer per year is less than the amount specified in the field, then the sum of the customer entries isn't included in the report. If the total invoiced amount for a customer per year is greater than the amount specified in the field, then the sum of customer entries is included in the report. When you export the data to a declaration .txt file, you see that the **Amount Received in Cash** field in the declaration .txt file contains the accumulated number of customer entries in one line per year.|  
    |**G/L Acc. for Payments in Cash**|Select one or more on general ledger accounts to include only the entries that are posted to the filtered general ledger accounts in the report. **Important:**  The field is designed for reporting payments in cash. When you export the data to a declaration .txt file, you see that the **Amount Received in Cash** field in the declaration .txt file contains the accumulated value for the selected general ledger accounts. If you don't select any general ledger accounts, type 2 lines for payments in cash isn't created.|  
    |**Contact Name**|Enter the surname and name for the company that is creating the operations declaration.|  
    |**Telephone Number**|Enter the telephone number for the company that is creating the operations declaration.|  
    |**Non Deduct. Gen. Prod. Post. Groups**|Select the general product posting group. The selected posting groups are nondeductible VAT.|  
    |**Declaration Number**|Enter the number to identify the operations declaration.|  
    |**Electronic Code**|Specify the electronic code that is provided by the tax authorities.|  
    |**Declaration Media Type**|Select the media type for the declaration.|

    |**Previous Declaration Number**|If the **Replacement Declaration** option is selected, enter the previous declaration number.|  

3.  Select the appropriate filters, and then choose the **OK** button. The text file for report 340 is created in the specified path.  

## To create a Modelo 340 report under the CAC regimen  

1.  Perform the steps in the previous procedure.  
2.  As needed, adjust and modify the operation code information. In order for the report to pass validation when you submit it to the tax authority, any line that has an unrealized payment must be updated to include an operation code. You can change an operation code of Z or 3 to Z or 1 – 8 only for cash based payments.  
3.  Choose the **OK** button. The report is exported to the file location that you specified. The report contains lines for invoices, credit memos, whether applied or not, and payments that have unrealized VAT.  

    Invoices are exported and contain the Z operation code. Collection data is blank.  

    Payments against an invoice are exported and contain the collection data.  

If you print the posted document, for example, a posted sales invoice, it includes the following label: **Régimen especial del criterio de caja**.

# Pay vendors using electronic payments in the Spanish version
In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], you can pay a vendor using electronic payments. Payments are exported to a file, which are then transmitted to your bank. The bank then electronically transfers the payments from your bank account to the payee’s (vendor) bank account.  

This process is similar to how computer checks are processed.  

## To pay a vendor electronically  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Payment Journals**, and then choose the related link.

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Bank Payment Type**|Specify **Electronic Payment** to create a corresponding check ledger entry for the amount.|  
    |**Payment Type**|Specify the payment type for the special transfer payment, if applicable. Select **Blank** if you don't want to use the special transfer payment type. Select **01** to create a special payment for “goods” on the journal line. Select **02** to create a special payment for “non-goods” on this journal line.|  
    |**Statistical Code**|Specify the statistical code for the special transfer payment, if applicable. The statistical code must be used at the same time as the payment type. Select **01** to create a special payment for “goods” on the journal line. Select **02** to create a special payment for “non-goods” on this journal line.|

# Payments Cartera Module
The Payments Cartera module allows you to manage payables documents generated from purchase invoices or from the **Cartera Journal**. The documents can be managed by:  

- Bank  
- Due date  
- Value  
- Currency  

## Payment Orders  
A payment order is comprised of one or several documents that are grouped for delivery to a bank.  

There are different criteria for grouping documents into a single payment order. You can group documents sent to the same vendor, documents that have the same due date, documents sent to the same address, and so on.  

Use the Payments Cartera module to manage the following:  

- Drafts of payment orders to vendors (payment confirmation)  
- Distinct payables documents  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  The drafts, payment orders to vendors, and distinct payables documents can be managed in your local currency or original currency.  

Finance charges from financial entities are included.  

Payment confirmation is a service provided by a financial entity. With payment confirmation, you can manage a company’s payments to its suppliers, and use the invoice to charge the customers or vendors before the due date.

# Set Up Operation Codes
You can add as many operation codes as you want to the table. However, the operation codes C, D, and I already exist in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)]. For example, Credit Memos always have the operation code D. You cannot set up these values in the table because they are system-created codes. If you try to add them, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] will return an error.  

## To set up operation codes  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Operation Codes**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  On the **Operation Codes** page, fill in the fields as described in the following table  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Code**|Enter an operation code. You can only enter one letter or number.<br /><br /> Valid codes are numbers 1 – 8, and letters A – Z.<br /><br /> To submit a report under the CAC regimen, you must make certain that the code Z, which is required for these types of transactions, is in the list of operation codes.|  
    |**Description**|Enter a description for the operation code. You can enter a maximum of 30 letters and numbers.|  

## To link operation codes to general product posting groups  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Posting Groups**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Choose the **General Product Posting Groups** action.  
3.  On the **General Product Posting Groups** page, link each operation code to a general product posting group.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |Code|Enter a code to create a new general product posting group.|  
    |Description|Enter a description for the general product posting group|  
    |Def. VAT Prod. Posting Group|Select a VAT percentage to link it to the general product posting group.|  
    |Operation Code|Select an appropriate operation code to link it to the general product posting group. You can assigne the same operation code to different posting groups. **Note:**  It is important to link the operation code to the correct VAT product posting group. The Make 340 Declaration report uses the setup to create trade declarations.|  

When you add an operation code to the general product posting group, that association is in turn applied to the items that have that general product posting group.

# Posting depreciation differences in the Finnish version

In Finland, the following depreciation methods are commonly used for fixed assets:  

- Straight-line depreciation which posts fixed assets to the general ledger.  
- Declining balance depreciation which doesn't post fixed assets to the general ledger.  

Finnish tax law requires the difference in accumulated depreciation between two methods to be calculated and posted in the general ledger.

# Electronic banking in Finland

The [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] electronic banking feature allows you to process electronic customer and vendor payments. This feature supports domestic payments (LM03) and foreign payments (LUM2) for transferring electronic bank payments. To export or import electronic payments, you must first set up bank reference files to determine how payment files are processed.  

## Customer payments

Domestic customer payments can be imported from the bank and linked to the associated accounts receivable entry with a reference number. This type of automation enables incoming payments to be linked directly to open receivables without a delay in manual processing. The following steps explain how to import customer payments into a file from the bank and how to link these payments to invoices through their reference numbers.  

1. Create a sales invoice and assign a unique reference number to the invoice. This reference number is used by the customer when paying the invoice.  
1. Import the payment files that contain customer payments into the cash receipt journal. These files contain the reference numbers received from the bank. The payments are linked to the accounts receivable entry through their reference numbers.  
1. Post the cash receipt journal and close the open accounts receivable entries with the applied payments from the file.  

## Reference number

A reference number is automatically created when an invoice is posted or when an order is posted for invoicing. However, you can enter a reference number manually on a sales journal transaction. This reference number isn't based on the reference number options on the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page. If you enter a reference number for the sales journal, only the validity of the reference number is checked.  

## Vendor payments

To send electronic bank payments to vendors, you can export domestic or foreign vendor payments into a transfer file that can be sent to the bank. The following steps show how to export vendor payments.  

1. Use the **Bank Payments to Send** page to select the vendors for which you want to create payment files.  
1. Enter payment information for each transaction in the payment journal or use **Suggest Vendor Payments** to create suggested payments.  
1. Generate and preview the payment report.  
1. Create a transfer file for domestic or foreign vendor payments.  
1. Send the payment transfer file to the bank.

# Reporting goods/services tax and harmonized sales tax in Canada

In Canada, when a vendor doesn't have a business presence in the province in which purchases are made, the vendor charges the Goods and Services Tax (GST) or Harmonized Sales Tax (HST) only. However, if the province has a Provincial Sales Tax (PST), then the purchaser must still calculate the PST and pay it directly to the province. When a Provincial Tax Area Code is selected, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] uses it to calculate the PST and post it so that there's a tax liability in both the general ledger and the tax entry records. Therefore, the tax area code selected here should be one where only the PST is included, not the GST.  

## Submitting the GST/HST file

The tax information in purchase documents is used to generate a GST/HST online file transfer that you must provide to the tax authorities. This file includes goods and services tax (GST) and harmonized sales tax (HST). The file is created in a *.tax* file format, which can be transferred online. Use the GST/HST Internet File Transfer batch job to generate the *.tax* file.

# Work with GIFI codes in the Canadian version

Fiscal information can include general ledger accounts, reports, income statements, balance sheets, and statements of retained earnings. Fiscal information is classified using codes. The use of codes helps the government to process information, prepare for electronic filing, and validate tax information electronically. The use of codes also helps statistical organizations to work more efficiently, as financial information is more readily available. For more information, see the [Canada Revenue Agency website](https://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/).

The Canada Revenue Agency uses General Index of Financial Information (GIFI) codes to collect, validate, and process financial and tax information electronically. It is a best practice to assign GIFI codes only to posting accounts, so that all totaling is done by your tax preparation software.

When an account is associated with a GIFI code, it is reported to the revenue agency under that code. Multiple accounts can all have the same GIFI code, but each account can have only one GIFI code.

You can export balance information by GIFI code and save the exported file in Excel, which is useful for transferring information to your tax preparation software.

## Set up GIFI codes

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], you must set up GIFI codes for general ledger accounts, reports, balance sheets, income sheets, and statements of retained earnings.

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **GIFI Codes**, and then choose the related link.
1. On the **GIFI Codes** page, choose the **New** action.
1. Set up GIFI codes by filling the fields. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](../../includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

## Associate GIFI codes with G/L accounts

To report financial information by GIFI code, each GIFI code must be associated with the appropriate accounts in the chart of accounts.

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Chart of Accounts**, and then choose the related link.
1. Select a relevant general ledger account, and then choose the **Edit** action.
1. On the **Cost Accounting** FastTab, in the **GIFI Code** field, select an appropriate GIFI code.

## View account balances using the GIFI code report

You can review your account balances by GIFI code by using the **Account Balances by GIFI Code** report.

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Account Balances by GIFI Code**, and then choose the related link.
1. Specify what to include in the report by filling the fields. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](../../includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
1. Choose the **Print** or the **Preview** button.

## Export balance information using GIFI codes

You can export balance information using GIFI codes and save the exported file in Excel. You can modify, save, or delete the file. You can use the file to transfer information to your tax preparation software.

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Export GIFI Info. to Excel**, and then choose the related link.
1. Specify what to export to Excel by filling the fields. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](../../includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
1. Choose the **OK** button.

> [!NOTE]  
> The Excel file has the following characteristics:

* The balance is rounded to the nearest percentage, but the cell value maintains the same percentage as it does in the general ledger.
* Negative numbers are represented as positive number in brackets. Accordingly, -123 is represented as (123).

# Reporting sales tax in Canada

[!INCLUDE [sales-tax](../includes/CAMXUS/sales-tax-setup.md)]

If you set up new tax areas and tax jurisdictions, you must make sure that you fill in the fields correctly. In Canada, the federal government and provinces can charge sales tax. Companies collect and remit sales tax to these government authorities for products sold to end users. Sales tax can also be charged to existing sales tax. For example, tax can be calculated on a sales invoice amount that already includes the tax from other jurisdictions.  

In Canada, tax amounts must be detailed in documents for each tax jurisdiction. Up to four jurisdictions can be displayed in a document, and jurisdictions that have the same print order are combined when they're printed.  

## Tax details

The **Tax Details** page shows different combinations of sales tax jurisdictions and sales tax groups to establish sales tax rates. For each tax jurisdiction, we recommend that you set up one tax group for normal sales tax. Also, set up another tax group for items or services that aren't taxed. Additionally, set up tax group for every type of item or service that is handled with a different sales tax rate in that jurisdiction. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](../../includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  

<!--COMMENTING OUT DUE TO ISSUE #535: In Canada, when you sell to a customer at a location where you do not have a *situs*—or a legal location in that state—you do not collect sales tax. For locations in which you do not have a situs, ensure that both the **Tax Below Minimum** and **Tax Above Maximum** fields are 0.00.  -->

# Calculate and post withholding tax settlements in the New Zealand version

You can use the **Calc. and Post WHT Settlement** page to calculate and post the withholding tax (WHT). You can close WHT entries that are open or not settled and transfer the corresponding amount to the WHT settlement account.  

The sum of all withheld amounts is reported as a truncated whole number to the New Zealand tax authorities.  

> [!NOTE]  
> The truncated cents are accounted for in a rounding account.

# New Zealand Inland Revenue Department Numbers and Adjustment Notes

A New Zealand Inland Revenue Department Number (IRD) is a single identifier for all business dealings with the tax office, and for dealings with other government departments and agencies.  

IRDs and adjustment notes—or credit memos—are used to satisfy tax requirements.  

## IRD number  
All companies must register and apply for an IRD number to report the details of payment summaries issued to their payees during the financial year. The payment summary includes the Tax File Numbers (TFN) or business numbers of the payees.  

## Adjustment Notes  
Adjustment notes are issued by suppliers to a business when the amount of consideration for taxable supplies changes. The recipient needs an adjustment note to claim more or less GST credits than previously claimed.  

An adjustment event may result in an increase or decrease to your net amount for the tax period.  

Adjustment notes—or credit memos—should be connected to an invoice.  

Because credit memos are used for adjustment notes, each credit memo should satisfy all of the legal requirements for an adjustment note. Each credit memo should have an original invoice number, date, and reason code assigned to it. The following fields are included in the adjustment note:  

- **Adjustment Applies to**: The number of the document to which the adjustment note applies. If you use the **Copy Document** function, this field populates automatically. You must enter a reason code before the transaction can be posted. You can use this field to create an adjustment note for a paid or closed transaction.  

- **Adjustment Reference No**: The number of the adjustment note. For **Sales & Receivables**, the number assigned to the posted document populates automatically in this field.  

- **Adjustment Note Date**: Automatically populated from the document date.  
- **Adjustment**: These entries populate automatically. Adjustment notes can only be applied against a single document.

# Withholding Tax in the New Zealand Version

Withholding Tax (WHT) is tax withheld by a company when making a payment to a vendor, in which the full amount owed to that vendor is reduced by the tax withheld. The withheld tax is then remitted to tax authorities during the next Business Activity Statement (BAS) submission.  

The New Zealand government requires taxes to be withheld from payment to vendors under the following circumstances:  

* The vendor is a local supplier who has not supplied an New Zealand Inland Revenue Department number (IRD) before the payment is processed, and the individual transaction amount is greater than the specified threshold amount.  
* The vendor is a non-resident supplier and the payment is to be made to this non-resident entity in the form of interest, royalty, or dividend payments. Currently, there is no minimum threshold amount. Withholding rates may vary due to payment, or international tax treaties existing between New Zealand and the vendor's country/region.  

Fields within **WHT Business Posting Groups** and **WHT Product Posting Groups** must be set up on the **WHT Posting Setup** page so that the correct WHT calculations are made for each vendor.  

* **WHT Calculation Rule** – This field controls how calculation applies to the **WHT Minimum Invoice Amount**, or the invoice threshold amount. The following options exist:  

    - **Less than**  
    - **Less than or equal to**  
    - **Equal to**  
    - **Greater than**  
    - **Greater than or equal to**  

In New Zealand, WHT is not calculated if the individual invoice amount is less than or equal to the threshold amount. Companies should select **Less than or equal to**.  

* **WHT Minimum Invoice Amount** – Enter the invoice threshold amount.  
* **WHT %** – Enter the relevant WHT rate for the particular combination of **WHT Business Posting Group** and **WHT Product Posting Group**. If you do not wish to calculate any withholding amount, enter 0.00.  
* **Realised WHT Type** – Select **Payment** to calculate only the withholding amount at the time of payment. The other options of **Invoice** and **Earliest** do not apply to New Zealand.  
* **Payable WHT Account Code** – Enter the number of the G/L account to which you want to post **Purchase WHT** for the particular combination of **WHT Business Posting Group** and **WHT Product Posting Group**.  
* **Purch. WHT Adjustment Account No.** – Select an account number for **Purchase CR/Adj Note** adjustments.  
* **Revenue Types** – Drill down to the **WHT Revenue Types** page. These values determine how the combination of **WHT Business Posting Group** and **WHT Product Posting Group** are displayed in reports. You must enter a value in order for this combination to appear in the WHT reports.  

## WHT for Suppliers Without an IRD  
Ensure that there is a valid combination of **General Business** and **General Product Posting Groups** with the correct threshold. For example, in New Zealand today the minimum threshold is $75 with a rate of 46.50%.  

The percentage withheld is specified in **WHT Posting Setup**. The amount to be withheld is calculated automatically at the time of payment. The WHT certificate is printed automatically, and then sent to the vendor with payment. The WHT certificate explains the reasons for not sending the full invoiced amount.  

## WHT for Foreign Suppliers  
Ensure that a valid combination of **General Business** and **General Product Posting Groups** has been established for vendors for whom you need to withhold tax,other than for non-IRD.

# Addresses in the New Zealand version

A single postal code can include multiple cities in the same region.  

At the same time, cities with the same name are sometimes located in different regions.  

To avoid confusion and improve address accuracy, available options display when you enter data in address fields. For example, when you enter a postal code on a customer card, you can select from a list of all available cities for that postal code in the **City** field drop-down list. Likewise, when you enter a city name, you can select from a list of all available regions in the **Region** field drop-down list.  

To enable this functionality, you must enter the data into the **Post Code** table. You can do this manually, or you can download a copy of the New Zealand postal codes for New Zealand.  
  
To increase postal efficiency in New Zealand, the postal department introduces an address bar coding system in which every address is assigned a unique identifier called a Delivery Point Identifier (DPID). From the DPID, a bar code is generated and printed for each address. Companies can receive discounts on bulk mailings if they use these bar codes. To retrieve a DPID, you must connect to the local postal database that uses authorized Address Matching Approval System (AMAS) software. You can reduce your number of postal returns by validating customer addresses using the AMAS database.  

When you print an address that has a DPID, a bar code is printed together with the address. If you can't print bar codes, the DPID is printed together with the address.  

Contact your Microsoft partner for information on how to obtain AMAS software.

# Set up withholding tax in the New Zealand version

Withholding tax (WHT) is the tax withheld by a company when making a payment to a vendor, and it reduces the full amount owed to the vendor. The withheld tax is then remitted to tax authorities when the next Business Activity Statement (BAS) is submitted.  

If a supplier without a New Zealand Inland Revenue Department number (IRD) provides an invoice, a withholding tax amount must be withheld if the total amount of the invoice is more than the threshold amount.  

To use withholding tax, you must set up the business posting groups and product posting groups for withholding tax so that the correct WHT calculations are made for each vendor.  

> [!NOTE]  
> As a prerequisite, you need to set up source codes for WHT settlement on the **Source Code Setup** page.  

The following procedure describes how to set up product posting groups for WHT, but the same steps also apply to setting up business posting groups for WHT.

# Direct debit using domiciliation

A domiciliation is a financial agreement between you and your customers, allowing you to automatically collect the payments for customer's invoices through a preferred bank account. Domiciliation can only be processed for domestic customers with domestic bank accounts. Domiciliation in foreign currencies or involving foreign banks aren't supported.  

Direct debit domiciliation is useful for companies with many customers or subscribers, such as a utility company or a publishing company.  

Before you can start using electronic banking for domiciliation, you must enter certain basic information.  

- **Domiciliation number** - This is a unique code obtained from the bank which identifies the domiciliation agreement between you, your customer, and the bank. The contract contains details regarding payment frequency, bank account numbers, and amounts. When you send your payments to the bank, the bank uses the domiciliation number to identify all parties involved.  

- **Preferred bank account** - The preferred bank account is suggested as a default bank account on all domiciliation suggestions for that customer. If necessary, you can change the bank account before posting the domiciliation suggestions. Learn more in [Generate Domiciliation Suggestions](/dynamics365/business-central/LocalFunctionality/Belgium/direct-debit-using-domiciliation).  

## Set up domiciliation

Before you can use electronic banking for domiciliation, you must enter the customer's domiciliation number and preferred bank account.  

> [!NOTE]  
> You should use one bank account per customer for all domiciliation.  

### Set up process

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customers**, and then choose the related link.  
1. Select the customer, and then choose the **Edit** action.  
`. Fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |-----|-----------|  
    |**Domiciliation**|Enter the domiciliation number for the customer. This number is used when you create domiciliation for this customer.|  
    |**Preferred Bank Account**|Enter the preferred bank account for transactions with this customer. This account is used when you create a payment suggestion for this customer.|  

## Generate domiciliation suggestions

After setting up domiciliation, you can start generating domiciliation suggestions. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], you can create domiciliation suggestions for domestic customers only.  

### Process

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Domiciliation Journal**, and then choose the related link.  
1. In the **Batch Name** field, select the required journal batch, and then choose the **Suggest Domiciliations** action.  
1. Fill in the fields as displayed in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Due Date**|Enter the due date to be included in the batch job. Only entries that have a due date before or on this date is included.|  
    |**Take Payment Discounts**|Select if you want the batch job to include customer ledger entries for which you can receive a payment discount.|  
    |**Payment Discount Date**|Enter the date that is used to calculate the payment discount.|  
    |**Select Possible Refunds**|Select if you want the batch job to include refunds.|  
    |**Posting Date**|Enter the date that appears as the posting date on the lines that the batch job inserts in the domiciliation journal.|  

1. Enter any additional filter criteria.  
1. Choose the **OK** button.  

When the batch job is finished, the domiciliation journal contains all open customer ledger entries that match the filters.  

> [!NOTE]  
> The domiciliation suggestions include only customers who have a Domiciliation number set up. Learn more in the [Set up domiciliation](#set-up-domiciliation) section.  

## Edit and delete domiciliation lines

After generating domiciliation suggestions, you might want to change the domiciliation lines. For example, you might want to reassign a bank account or prevent payment for a specific customer or customer ledger entry.  

After modifying the journal lines, print the **Domiciliation Journal - Test** report to test all journal lines.  

The **Suggest Domiciliations** batch job creates domiciliation suggestions for all customers matching the specified criteria.  

### Edit a journal line  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Domiciliation Journals**, and then choose the related link.

1. Select the journal line, and then choose the **Delete** action.  
1. Choose the **Yes** button.

1. Choose the **Test Report** action.  
1. Choose the **Print** button to print the report, or choose the **Preview** button to view it on the screen.  

## Export and Post Domiciliation

You can submit domiciliation to your bank by exporting the data to a file. When you export to a file, you can choose to automatically post the lines to the general ledger.  

Depending on setup of the **SEPA Direct Debit Exp. Format** field on the **Bank Account Card** page, the **File Domiciliations** action opens either of these request pages:  

- **Create Gen. Jnl. Lines** page – for the SEPA Direct Debit format.  
- **File Domiciliations** page – for domestic formats.  

### Export and post domiciliation

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Domiciliation Journals**, and then choose the related link.

1. Choose an appropriate location from where you upload the file to your bank, and then choose **Save**.  
1. Choose the **Yes** button to automatically post the domiciliation journal lines.  

   If you didn't select the **Post General Journal Lines** checkbox, you must post the domiciliation manually in the general journal.  

   > [!NOTE]  
   > After posting domiciliation in the general journal, delete the posted domiciliation on the **Domiciliation Journal** page. To do this, select all lines with status **Posted**, and then choose the **Delete** action.

# Create payment journal templates and batches in the Belgian version

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], payment suggestions are generated and posted in payment journals. The structure of the payment journal is similar to the structure of other journal types. However, the payment journal contains some fields that are specific for processing payments. Before you can start generating payment suggestions, you have to set up a payment journal template and a payment journal batch.  

You can assign a specific page and a test report to each journal template. This way, you can manage your domestic and international payments from this adjusted page. The specified *source code* is copied to all the journal lines that are created based on the journal template. The code is also copied to the entries when they're posted. This way, you can always see where an entry is posted from.

If you assign a bank account to the payment journal template, the bank account is inserted on all payment journal batches and payment journal lines that are created by using this template. By specifying a bank account for the journal template, you can reduce the time that is required for checking the payment suggestions.  

## Create a payment journal template  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Payment Journal Templates**, and then choose the related link.  
1. Choose the **New** action.  
1. On the **Payment Journal Templates** page, fill in the fields.  

   [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](../../includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > If the **Page ID** and **Test Report ID** fields aren't shown, you must add them through personalization. The fields must be filled in before you continue. Learn more in [Personalize Your Workspace](../../ui-personalization-user.md).
1. Repeat step 2 for any additional templates.
1. Choose the **OK** button.  

You can create multiple journal batches under each journal template. Several journals, each with its own name, can display the same page. For example, this can be practical if every user must have a dedicated journal.

## Add payment journal batches to the journal template  

1. On the **Payment Journal Templates** page, choose the **Batches** action.  
1. On the **Paym. Journal Batch** page, fill in the fields.  

   [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](../../includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

   > [!NOTE]
   > To have the journal name update numerically, include a number in the journal batch name. For example, the name KBC1 increments by one number with every posting to KBC2, KBC3, and so on.  

   Next, you can test the configuration. Learn more in [Test Electronic Payments](how-to-test-electronic-payments.md).

- Whether only one bank account can be used for Interbanks Standards Association Belgium (Isabel).  
- Whether payment lines are in euro for Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA).  
- Whether a number series is defined for SEPA.  

You can view any errors on the **Export Check Error Logs** page.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> You have to correct all errors before you can post the lines.  

## Test payment journal lines

# Automatically transfer and post CODA statements in the Belgian version

After you apply and processed all CODA statement lines, you can transfer the CODA statement lines to a financial journal.  

After transferring the statement lines, you can post the lines in a corresponding general journal. If no such general journal exists, you can't transfer the lines. You can create a journal to handle CODA statements. Learn more in [Create Financial Journals](how-to-create-financial-journals.md).  

Alternatively, you can manually transfer and post CODA statements. Learn more in [Manually Transfer and Post CODA Statements](how-to-manually-transfer-and-post-coda-statements.md).  

## Automatically transfer statement lines  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Bank Accounts**, and then choose the related link.  
1. Select the bank account, and then choose the **CODA Statements** action.  
1. Select the CODA statement, and then choose the **Edit** action.  
1. Choose the **Transfer to General Ledger** action.  
1. Choose the **Yes** button.  

The batch job now transfers the CODA statement lines to the financial journal.  

After transferring the statement lines to the journal, you can post the statement lines in the corresponding financial journal.

# Belgian VAT

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] includes Belgian extensions to the VAT reporting capabilities so that you can print VAT transaction details. You must send the following reports to the Belgian tax authorities:  

- **Monthly/Quarterly declaration**: Use this report to create monthly or quarterly VAT declarations, depending on your company revenue.  

- **VAT annual listing (on paper/disk)**: Use this report to annually report all amounts invoiced for both goods and services to all Belgian companies with a registered VAT number.  

- **EC sales list**: Use this report to report the sales of goods to other countries/regions in the European Union. Learn more in [About the EC Sales List Report](../../finance-how-report-vat.md#ecsaleslist).  

You're also required to provide a printed statement detailing the VAT transactions to the Belgian tax authorities.

## Nondeductible VAT

In Belgium, VAT can be fully or partially deductible. Expenses such as representation cost or purchases of cars are only partially deductible, and the transaction must specify how much of the VAT is nondeductible. For example, you create a general ledger account for fixed assets such as cars, and another account for representation cost. For each account, you specify how much of the reported VAT is nondeductible by setting the **Percentage Non deductible VAT** field. Then, when you post a transaction, the deductible VAT posts to the corresponding VAT account. The nondeductible VAT is added to the base amount and posted to the same account as a tangible or intangible asset.  

For fixed assets, the nondeductible VAT depreciates just like the base acquisition cost of the fixed asset. You must set up separate fixed asset posting groups for each percentage of nondeductible VAT. You must do so because each fixed asset posting group posts to a general ledger account where the **Percentage Non deductible VAT** field specifies how much VAT must post to the same account as the fixed asset.  

If you select the **Incl. Non Deductible VAT** field in a VAT statement line, nondeductible VAT is included in the VAT amount. The **Calc. and Post VAT Settlement** report adds the nondeductible part of that amount to the **Non Ded. VAT Amount** and **Non Ded. Source Curr. VAT Amt.** fields in the resulting VAT entries.  

## Multiple VAT numbers for customers

The feature for using multiple VAT registration numbers for customers, including adding different **VAT Registration Numbers**, **VAT Business Posting Groups**, and **General Business Posting Groups** for addresses in another country, are available in the Belgian localization. Learn more in [Multiple VAT registration numbers](../../finance-how-use-multiple-vat-registrations.md).

In addition to different **VAT Registration Numbers**, **VAT Business Posting Groups**, and **General Business Posting Groups**, businesses using the Belgian localization also need to work with the **Enterprise No.**. When you open the **Alternative Customer VAT Registration** page, you can add the **Enterprise No.** for the customer if their address is in another country. After you enter this information, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] does the following things when you're working with sales documents:  

- If the customer is from Belgium and the ship-to address is in Belgium, the **Enterprise No.** comes from the **Customer** card.
- If the customer is from Belgium and the ship-to address isn't in Belgium, the **Enterprise No.** is removed.
- If the customer isn't from Belgium and the ship-to address is in Belgium, the **Enterprise No.** comes from the **Alternative Customer VAT Registration** page.
- If the customer isn't from Belgium and the ship-to address isn't in Belgium, the **Enterprise No.** isn't available.  

> [!NOTE]
> If there's a change in the **Enterprise No.** in a sales document, it displays on the **Confirm Alternative Customer VAT Registration** dialog.

# Export payment files in the Belgian version

After printing a test report and correcting errors, you can export the payment journal lines to a payment file.  

A payment file contains either domestic, international, SEPA, or non-Euro SEPA payments. The file can be sent to a bank electronically. You can create only one file for each posting date and each currency code. When you export the payments to a file, an accompanying note is printed, which can also be sent to the bank.  

In the payment journal, the **Status** field on the exported lines is set to **Posted**.  

## Print a payment file  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter *Payment Journal*, and then choose the link to open the **EB Payment Journal** page.  
1. In the **Batch Name** field, select the required journal batch.  
1. In the **Export Protocol** field, select the export protocol.  

   Export protocols control which payment file is generated in the payment journal. You can have a mixture of export formats in a single batch, such as domestic, international, SEPA, or a combination of these. However, when exporting the payment lines to a file, you can use only one export format, or export protocol.  

   > [!NOTE]
   > By defining the export protocol, you also define the type of validation that is performed in the payment journal.
1. Enter the payment journal line information.

    1. Choose the **Suggest Vendor Payments** action.
    1. In the **Suggest Vendor Payments EB** page, set the relevant filters and options.

        This batch job processes open vendor ledger entries and creates a payment suggestion as lines in a payment journal. Open vendor ledger entries result from posting invoices and finance charge memos.

        Only the ledger entries of vendors where the **Suggest Payments** field is selected on their **Vendor** card are included in the batch job. The suggestions are registered in a payment journal. You must specify a last payment date that is used in the batch job.

        In addition, only vendor entries that aren't marked as **On Hold** in the **Vendor Ledger Entries** page are included in the batch job. You can also run the batch job so that it also includes payments for which you can obtain a discount.

        When you enter an available amount, the vendors are ordered by **Priority**.

        You can define what is included in the report by setting filters. To set additional fields on the tab, choose the field. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](../../includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
    1. Delete or modify the lines as appropriate.
    1. If no bank account is indicated on the payment journal template, indicate a bank account to pay with on each line.
1. Choose the **Check Payment Lines** action.

    The **Export Check Error Logs** page displays any errors that exist. If there are errors, you must fix them before you can continue.

1. If there are no errors, choose the **Export Payment Lines** action.  

   The report that you specified in the relevant export protocol processes the payment lines and generates the file.

# Set up declaration types in the Belgian version

[!INCLUDE[intrastat-2022w2](../../includes/intrastat-2022w2.md)]

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], there are two types of declaration:  

- Simplified declaration  
- Extended declaration  

The type of declaration depends on the amount of shipped or received goods. To determine the type of declaration that you should use, visit the [National Bank of Belgium](https://aka.ms/BelgianNationalBank) website.  

When using the extended declaration, also, you need to set up an Incoterm in Intrastat Declaration for each shipping method. If you don't see the **Incoterm in Intrastat Decl.** field on the **Shipment Method** page, you might need to customize the page and add the field.

## Set up declaration types  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Ledger Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
1. Select the **Simplified Intrastat Decl.** checkbox to set up a simplified declaration type. Clear this field to use extended declaration.  
1. Choose the **OK** button.

# Make manual corrections to VAT in the Belgian version

You can make corrections to posted VAT entries without posting the correction into the VAT or general ledger entries. This is useful if you need to make a change to the total sales or purchases VAT amounts without changing the VAT base. For example, you can manually correct VAT if you receive an invoice from a vendor who has calculated VAT incorrectly.  

## Make manual corrections to VAT  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Statement Preview**, and then choose the related link.  
1. Select the line that needs to be corrected. You can make the VAT correction on both the **Row Totaling** and **VAT Entry Totaling** row **Type**.  
1. To make the correction, choose the **Correction Amount** field. The **Manual VAT Correction List** page opens.  
1. Choose the **Edit List** action. On the **Manual VAT Correction List** page, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Posting Date**|Enter the posting date of the VAT correction.|  
    |**Amount**|Enter the amount of the VAT correction. You must enter the correction amount, not the new amount. For example, if the amount is 1,000.00 and should be 1,200.00, enter 200.00.|  
    |**Additional-Currency Amount**|This field displays the amount of the VAT correction in the additional reporting currency.<br><br/> The field is automatically calculated, based on the contents of the **Amount** field and the current exchange rate.|
