# Subcontract manufacturing

Subcontracting selected operations to vendor is common in many manufacturing companies. Subcontracting can be a rare occurrence or can be an integral part of all production processes.

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides several tools for managing subcontract work:  

- Work Centers with assigned vendor: This feature enables you to set up a work center that is associated with a vendor (subcontractor). This work center is called a subcontract work center. You can specify a subcontract work center on a routing operation, which allows you to easily process the subcontracted activity. In addition, the cost of the operation can be designated at the routing or the work center level.  
- Work Center cost based on units or time: This feature enables you to specify whether costs associated with the work center are based on the production time or a flat charge per unit. Although subcontractors commonly use a flat charge per unit to charge for their services, the application can handle both options (production time and flat charge per unit).  
- Subcontracting Worksheet: This feature allows you to find the production orders with material ready to send to a subcontractor and to automatically create purchase orders for subcontract operations from production order routings. The application automatically posts the purchase order charges to the production order during the posting of the purchase order. Only production orders with a status of released can be accessed and used from a subcontracting worksheet.  

## Subcontract work centers  

Subcontract Work Centers are set up the same as regular work centers with additional information. They're assigned to routings in the same manner as other work centers.  

### Subcontract work center fields  

This **Subcontractor No.** field designates the work center as a subcontract work center. You can enter the number of a subcontractor who supplies the work center. This field can be used to administer work centers, which aren't in-house but perform processing under contract.  

If you subcontract with the vendor for a different rate for each process, then select the **Specific Unit Cost** field. This setting lets you set up a cost on each routing line and saves the time of reentering each purchase order. The cost on the routing line is used in processing instead of the cost on the work center cost fields. Selecting the **Specific Unit Cost** field calculates costs for the vendor by the routing operation.  

If you subcontract at a single rate per vendor, leave the **Specific Unit Cost** field blank. The costs are set up by filling in **Direct Unit Cost**, **Indirect Cost %**, and **Overhead Rate** fields.  

### Routings that use subcontract work centers

Subcontract work centers can be used for operations on routings in the same way as regular work centers.  

You can set up a routing that uses an outside work center as a standard operational step. Alternatively, you can modify the routing for a particular production order to include an outside operation. This might be needed in an emergency such as a server not working correctly, or during a temporary period of higher demand where work you normally do in-house must be sent to a subcontractor.  

For more information, see [Create Routings](production-how-to-create-routings.md).  

## Calculate subcontracting worksheets and create subcontract purchase orders  

After you calculate the subcontracting worksheet, the relevant document is created. In this case, a purchase order.  

The **Subcontracting Worksheet** page functions like the **Planning Worksheet** by calculating the needed supply, in this case purchase orders, which you review in the worksheet and then create with the **Carry Out Action Message** function.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Only production orders with status **Released** can be accessed and used from a subcontracting worksheet.  

### To calculate the subcontracting worksheet  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Subcontracting Worksheet**, and then choose the related link.  
2. To calculate the worksheet, choose the **Calculate Subcontracts** action.  
3. On the **Calculate Subcontracts** page, set filters for the subcontracted operations, or the work centers where they're performed, to calculate only the relevant production orders.  
4. Choose the **OK** button.  

    Review the lines on the **Subcontracting Worksheet** page. The information in this worksheet comes from the production order and production order routing lines and flows to the purchase order when that document is created. You can delete a row from the worksheet without affecting the original information, just as you can with the other worksheets. The information will reappear the next time you run the **Calculate Subcontracts** function.  

### To create the subcontract purchase order  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Subcontracting Worksheet**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **Carry Out Action Message** action.  
3. Select the **Print Orders** field to print the purchase order as it is created.  
4. Choose the **OK** button.  

If all subcontracted operations are sent to the same vendor location, then only one purchase order is created.  

The worksheet line that was turned into a purchase order is deleted from the worksheet. After a purchase order is created, it won't appear in the worksheet again.  

## Posting subcontract purchase orders  

After the Subcontractor Purchase Orders are created, they can be posted. Receiving the order posts a Capacity Ledger Entry to the production order and invoicing the order posts the direct cost of the purchase order to the production order.  

## To post a subcontract purchase order
 
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Orders**, and then select the related link.  
2. Open a purchase order that is created from the subcontracting worksheet.  

    On the purchase order lines, you see the same information that was in the worksheet. The **Prod. Order No.**, **Prod. Order Line No.**, **Operation No.**, and **Work Center No.** fields are filled in with the information from the source production order.  

3. Choose the **Post** action.  

When the purchase is posted as received, an output journal entry is automatically posted for the production order if the subcontract operation is the last operation on the production order routing.  

> [!CAUTION]  
> Posting output automatically for an ongoing production order when subcontracted items are received may not be desired. Reasons for this could be that the expected output quantity that is posted may be different from the actual quantity and that the posting date of the automatic output is misleading.  
>
> To avoid that the expected output of a production order is posted when subcontract purchases are received, make sure the subcontracted operation is not the last one. Alternatively, insert a new last operation for the final output quantity.  

When the purchase order is posted as invoiced, then the direct cost of the purchase order is posted to the production.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Expected costs are only managed for item transactions. Expected costs are not for immaterial transaction types, such as capacity posted via subcontract purchase orders. Don't be confused by the fact that posting a receipt might trigger posting of output. These transactions are separate and the expected cost of output is calculated independently.

# Customize pages for profiles

Business Central provides both [personalization](ui-personalization-user.md) for users and customization for administrators. Personalization allows users to tailor their workspace by adjusting page layouts to suit their own preferences. Administrators can customize page layouts for a specific profile, based on business roles or departments, so that all assigned users see the same customized page. While personalization allows users to show, hide, and move fields and actions on a page, customization offers extra capabilities. For example, customization allows you to show fields that are in the page's source table or extension tables but aren't defined on the page object&mdash;this isn't possible personalization.  <!--For more information, see [Personalize Your Workspace](ui-personalization-user.md).-->

<!--Similarly, administrators can customize pages for a profile, according to the related business role or department, so that all users assigned the profile see the customized page layout. As an administrator, you customize pages by using the same functionality as users do when they personalize pages, except with few extra capabilities. Like personalization, you can show, hide, and move fields, actions, or parts on a page. But while personalization only allows you to work with fields that are defined on the page object, customization allows you add fields that are in the source table or table extension, but not defined on the page object. -->

> [!NOTE]
> The typical business use of a profile is a role. A profile is therefore named *Profile (Role)* in the UI.

Page customization starts from the **Profiles (Roles)** page, the administrator's starting point for managing users' profiles on individual profile cards. In addition to customizing the page layout, you control various other settings for profiles on the **Profile (Role)** page for each profile. For more information, see [Manage Profiles](admin-users-profiles-roles.md).

## Prerequisites

- Your Business Central account must have the **D365 Profile Mgt.** permission set or equivalent permissions. 

   The **D365 Profile Mgt.** permission set includes the execute permission on the system object **9026 Add Field to Table**. If you don't have this permission, you're not allowed to add fields on the page unless they're defined on the page object. 

## Customize pages for a profile

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Profiles (Roles)**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the line for the profile that you want to customize pages for, and then choose the **Edit** action.
3. Choose the **Customize pages** action.

    [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] opens on a new browser tab for the selected profile with the **Customizing** banner activated. The **Customizing** banner offers the same functionality as the **Personalizing** banner that is available to users.

4. Customize pages according to the needs of the role or department in question in the same way as a user would do when personalizing. For more information, see [Personalize Your Workspace](ui-personalization-user.md).

    > [!NOTE]
    > To navigate during personalization, use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Click</kbd> on an action if it is highlighted by the arrowhead.

5. When you have finished changing the layout on one or more pages, choose the **Done** button on the **Customizing** banner.
6. Close the browser tab.

The customization of pages is now recorded for the profile.

## View all customized pages for a profile

You can get an overview of which pages are customized for a profile, for example to plan which pages to customize further or delete.

- On the **Profile (Role)** page, choose the **Manage customized pages** action.

On the **Customized Pages** page, you can delete customizations, and you can troubleshoot by scanning for potential issues.  

## Delete all customizations for a profile

You can cancel all customizations that you have made for a profile. Customizations introduced with an extension and personalizations made by a user aren't deleted. You can delete all personalizations with another action. For more information, see [To delete all personalizations made by a user](admin-users-profiles-roles.md#delete-all-personalizations-made-by-a-specific-user).

- On the **Profile (Role)** page for a customized profile, choose the **Clear customized pages** action.

The layout on pages for the profile is reset to the default layout.  

## Delete customization for specific pages for a profile

You can delete individual page customizations that you have made for a profile. Customizations introduced with an extension and personalizations made by a user aren't deleted. You can delete specific page personalizations with another action. For more information, see [To delete personalizations for specific pages](admin-users-profiles-roles.md#delete-personalizations-for-specific-pages).

1. On the **Profile (Role)** page, choose the **Manage customized pages** action.
2. On the **Customized Pages** page, select one or more lines for page customizations that you want to delete, and then choose the **Delete** action.

The layout on the selected pages is adjusted to the changes you made.

## Add a field

You add fields to the page from the **Add field to page** pane, which you open by selecting the **+ Field** action when in the customization mode. It's important to understand that the **Add field to page**  pane is used to show fields that already exist&mdash;either on the page and its source tables,&mdash;but are currently hidden from view. You can't create new fields.

The **Add field to page** pane presents all fields that can be shown on the page. Fields are divided into the following categories, as determined by the underlying design of the page itself, its source table, and extensions:

|Category|Description|
|-|-|
|Table fields not on the page object|Includes fields that are defined in the base table or extension tables, but aren't defined on the page. The tooltip for these fields includes the label **Defined by the table**.<br><br>|
|Page fields bound to a table|Includes fields that are defined in the base table or table extensions and are also defined on the page as either shown or hidden. The tooltip for these fields includes the label **Defined by the page**.|
|Page fields that aren't bound to a table| Fields that are only defined on the page, not in the base table or extension tables. These fields typically used for variable or calculation. The tooltip for these fields includes the label **Defined by the page**.|

<!--
- Table fields not on the page object. Includes fields that are defined in the base table or extension tables, but aren't defined on the page, either as shown or hidden.   
- Page fields bound to a table. Includes fields that are defined in the base table or table extensions and are also defined on the page as either shown or hidden. 
 - Page fields that are not bound to a table. Fields that are Includes fields that are only defined on the page, not in base table or extension table. These fields typically used for variable or calculation. -->

Use the filter button above the list to change what category of fields are presented the **Add field to page** pane.  

:::image type="content" source="media/customization-filter.svg" alt-text="Shows the filter button in the Add a field pane in the customization mode.":::
 
### Add table field that's not on the page object

If you want to make a table-only field available on a page to users, you must first add it to the page. Once you've added the field, users can choose to show or hide the field by using personalization. There are couple ways to add a field.

- One way is to drag it from  **Add field to page** pane to the desired position.
- Another way is to select the field in the pane to display the recommended location on the page. Then go to the field location on the pages, select the arrowhead, then select **Add**. 

Once the field has been added, the tooltip for the field in the  **Add field to page** pane switches to **Defined by the page**.

> [!NOTE]
> The added field is locked from editing and can't be unlocked.

## Remove a field

If you've added a table field that originally wasn't on the page object, you can remove it again. Removing a field is different that hiding it. When you hide a field, users can still show it on their workspace through personalization. However, if you remove a field, the field is no longer available for users to show, or hide for that matter. If the field is currently displayed on a user's workspace, it disappears from their workspace when you remove it. 

To remove a field, select the arrowhead on the field in the page and then **Remove**. If you can't find the field, select it in the **Add field to page** pane to indicate its hidden location. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Removing a field doesn't delete data that's stored in the field or it's source tables. It just removes the field from view. 

## Lock and unlock editing

Customization allows you to lock (allow editing) or unlock editing (prevent editing) of most fields on a page. To lock or unlock editing, select the field on the page, select the arrowhead, and then select **Lock editing** or **Unlock editing**. It's important to keep in mind a few rules about locking and unlocking fields:

- Field's that were originally not on the page object but were added to the page by customization are always locked, and can't be unlocked using customization or personalization.
- The design of the field can also prevent it from being edited. If the AL developer set the field's [Editable property](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/properties/devenv-editable-property) to `false`, it's always locked and can't be unlocked.
- It's important to note that the lock editing feature is intended to aid in the accuracy, consistency, and reliability of data. It's not intended to secure data integrity.


<!--However, whatever option you choose for a field, users can always change the setting on their own workspace using personalization. For this reason, it's important to consider locking as a deterrence measure and not a preventative measure.--> 
## Important information and tips

- Not all table fields may be available for customization from the **Add field to page** pane. The developer of a table can choose to prevent a field from appearing in customization by setting the field's [AllowInCustomization property](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/properties/devenv-allowincustomizations-property) to `Never`.
- You can't customize a page that's in [analysis mode](analysis-mode.md). The **Analyze** switch is deactivated. If you switch to customization mode while the page is in analysis mode, then analyze mode is automatically switched off. 
- Some pages have multiple page fields that map to the same source table. The **Add field to page** pane shows all of these page fields independently. You can show, hide, or move these fields independently without affecting the others.
- If a part or group is hidden, you can still identify hidden fields inside the part or group, but you can't add, move or show fields in the part or group until they're made visible.

# Set up calculations and posting methods for value-added tax

Consumers and businesses pay value-added tax (VAT) when they purchase goods or services. The amount of VAT to pay can vary, depending on several factors. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you set up VAT to specify the rates used to calculate tax amounts based on the following parameters:

* Who you sell to  
* Who you buy from  
* What you sell  
* What you buy  

You can set up VAT calculations manually, but that can be tricky and time-consuming. It's easy to use different VAT rates by mistake and create inaccurate VAT-related reports. To make VAT set up easier, we recommend you use the **VAT Setup** assisted setup guide.

However, if you want to set up the VAT calculations yourself, or just want to learn about each step, this article contains descriptions of each step.  

[!INCLUDE [finance-vat](includes/finance-vat.md)]

## Set up VAT using the assisted setup guide (recommended)

> [!NOTE]
> You can use the **VAT Setup** guide only if you have created a *My Company* and haven't posted transactions that include VAT. To learn more about a My Company, go to [Create new companies in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]](about-new-company.md).

To start the assisted setup guide, follow these steps:

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon and enter **Assisted Setup**. 
2. Choose **Set up Value-Added Tax (VAT)** and complete the steps.
3. After you complete the assisted setup, go to the **VAT Posting Setup** page to check whether you need to fill in more fields according to the local requirements in your version of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Learn more at [Local functionality in Business Central](about-localization.md).  

### Check the VAT posting setup

To support your fast start, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] notifies you of missing general ledger (G/L) accounts in posting groups or posting setups, such as on the **VAT Posting Setup** page. You can turn this type of notification on or off using the **G/L Account is missing in posting group or setup** notification in the **My Notifications** page. Just go to the **My settings** page, and then choose the **Change when I receive notifications** link.  

If you choose the notification, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates posting setups based on the posting groups in the document or journal you're currently working on.  

At this point, you can just fill in the missing G/L accounts. But, when you further refine your setup later, you might realize your initial setup is wrong. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't allow you to delete a VAT posting setup and general posting setup after they're used to create entries. To prevent people from mistakenly using a setup that's no longer relevant for new postings, you can use the **Blocked** field on the **General Posting Setup** page.

## Set up a default VAT date for documents and journals

VAT reporting in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is based on the **VAT Date** to include VAT entries on VAT reports in a VAT period. The VAT date can be changed on all documents and journals, but you must specify a default value for VAT date.

> [!NOTE]
> After posting the document or journal, the **VAT Date** will appear on **VAT Entries** and **G/L Entries** as well as on the posted document if exists.

To set up a default value for a VAT date, follow these steps:

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon and enter **General Ledger Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **General** FastTab, in the **Default VAT Date** field, choose either **Posting Date** or **Document Date**.
3. Close the page.  

> [!NOTE]
> By default, the **Default VAT Date** is the **Posting Date**.

### Enable or disable the VAT Date feature

Some countries/regions require that businesses use a specific VAT date, but other countries/regions don't. Some countries/regions also require businesses to change the VAT date in specific situations after they post documents, but other countries/regions don't allow changes to VAT dates. To allow for different contexts, you can choose whether you want to use this functionality and, if so, to what degree.

To set up the level of VAT date usage, follow these steps:

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon and enter **General Ledger Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **General** FastTab, in the **VAT Date Usage** field, specify the degree to which you want to use the VAT date feature. You can choose one of the following options:

   | Type | Description |
   |--------------------|-----------------------------------------|
   | **Use full VAT Date functionality** | Everything related to **VAT Date** works by default, giving you the maximum **VAT Date** functionality. You can set up the date, change it in documents, report based on it, and modify the date after posting as long as the period isn't closed or protected with allowed dates for posting. |
   | **Use but do not allow modifications** | Everything related to **VAT Date** works by default with one exception. You can't modify the **VAT Date** in **VAT Entries**. |
   | **Not using VAT Date functionality** | [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] hides and makes the **VAT Date** fields unavailable on documents, journals, and entries. The **Default VAT Date** is configured as the **Posting Date**. |

3. Close the page.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Even if you choose the **Not using VAT Date functionality** option, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will use the **VAT Date** in the background. Because the **Default VAT Date** is configured as the **Posting Date**, and you can't change it in this case, you'll get the same experience as without this feature. **VAT Date** fields will be removed from all pages, but this field will still exist in tables and reports will work based on it.

### Limiting periods for posting and changing the VAT date

You can prevent people from posting or changing VAT entries in specific date ranges. You set the restriction using two settings:

* Based on closed **VAT Return Period**
* Based on the **Allow Posting From** and **Allow Posting To** fields.

#### To limit posting based on VAT return period

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the TellF Me feature 1.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Ledger Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **General** FastTab, in the **Control VAT Period** field, specify the degree of VAT Return Period control. The following table describes the options.

| Type | Description |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **Block posting within closed and warn for released period** | Prevent people from posting a document or journal, or changing VAT entries that have a VAT date within a closed **VAT Return Period**. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] also shows a warning if your **VAT Return Period** is open, but the status of **VAT Return** is **Released** or **Submitted**. |
| **Block posting within closed period** | Prevent people from posting a document or journal, or changing vat entries that have a VAT date within the closed **VAT Return Period**. |
| **Warn when posting in closed period** | Show a warning, but don't block posting, if you want to post a document or journal that has a VAT date within a closed **VAT Return Period**. |
| **Disabled** | Take no action based on a closed **VAT Return Period**. |

#### Limit posting based on Allow from/to period

> [!NOTE]
> As of Business Central version 23.1, this control is changed. In earlier versions, there was only one control on the **General Ledger Setup** page for both Posting Date and VAT Date. Now, these controls are split, so control in the **General Ledger Setup** page is for the **Posting Date** only and control in the **VAT Setup** page is for the **VAT Date** only. There are also new date controls in the **User Setup** page.  

##### Version 23.1 or newer

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When you upgrade to a newversion, be aware that values are upgraded in the new **Allow VAT Date From/To** in the **VAT Setup** page based on the values in **Allow Posting From/To** in the **General Ledger Setup**. If you want to use different date controls, open the **VAT Setup** page and make changes.  

You can set up limitations on the company or at specific user levels.

To limit all postings for the whole company:

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Setup**, and then select the related link.  
2. On the **VAT Date** FastTab, in the **Allow VAT Date From** field, specify the VAT date from which you allow posting. Posting a document or journal with a VAT date before this date isn't allowed.  
3. On the **VAT Date** FastTab, in the **Allow VAT Date To** field, specify the VAT date until which you allow posting. Posting a document or journal with a VAT date after this date isn't allowed. 

To limit postings for the specific user:  

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **User Setup**, and then select the related link.  
2. In the **User ID** field, specify the user allowed to post in a specific period.  
3. In the **Allow VAT Date From** field, specify the VAT date from which you allow posting. Posting a document or journal with a VAT date before this date isn't allowed. 
4. In the **Allow VAT Date To** field, specify the VAT date until which you allow posting. Posting a document or journal with a VAT date after this date isn't allowed.  

##### Versions before 23.1 

You can set up limitation on the company or specific user levels.

To limit all postings for the whole company:

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Ledger Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **General** FastTab, in the **Allow Posting From** field, specify the VAT date from which you allow posting. Posting a document or journal with a VAT date before this date isn't allowed.  
3. On the **General** FastTab, in the **Allow Posting To** field, specify the VAT date until which you allow posting. Posting a document or journal with a VAT date after this date isn't allowed.

To limit postings for the specific user:

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **User Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. In the **User ID** field, specify the user allowed to post in specific period.  
3. In the **Allow Posting From** field, specify the VAT date from which you allow posting. Posting a document or journal with a VAT date before this date isn't allowed.
4. In the **Allow Posting To** field, specify the VAT date until which you allow posting. Posting a document or journal with a VAT date after this date isn't allowed.

## Set up VAT registration numbers for your country/region

To help ensure people enter valid VAT registration numbers, you can define formats for the VAT registration numbers that are used in the countries/regions in which you do business. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] displays an error message if someone makes a mistake or uses a format that is incorrect for the country/region.

To set up VAT registration numbers, follow these steps:

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 2.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Countries/Regions**.
2. Choose the country or region, and then choose the **VAT Reg. No. Formats** action.
3. In the **Formats** field, define the format by entering one or more of the following characters:  

* **#** Requires a single-digit number.  
* **@** Requires a letter. This format isn't case-sensitive.  
* **?** Allows any character.  

    > [!TIP]
    > You can use other characters as long as they are always present in the country or region format. So, if you need to include a period or a hyphen between sets of numbers, you can define the format as ##.####.### or @@-###-###.  

## Set up VAT business posting groups

VAT business posting groups should represent the markets in which you do business with customers and vendors, and define how to calculate and post VAT in each market. Examples of VAT business posting groups are **Domestic** and **European Union (EU)**.  

Use codes that are easy to remember and describe the business posting group, such as **EU**, **Non-EU**, or **Domestic**. Each code must be unique, meaning you can set up as many codes as you need, but you can't have the same code more than once in a table.

To set up a VAT business posting group, follow these steps:

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 3.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Business Posting Groups**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary.

You can set up default VAT business posting groups by linking them to general business posting groups. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically assigns the VAT business posting group when you assign the business posting group to a customer, vendor, or general ledger account.

## Set up VAT product posting groups

VAT product posting groups represent the items and resources you buy or sell, and determine how to calculate and post VAT according to the type of item or resource.

It's a good idea to use codes that are easy to remember and describe the rate, such as **NO-VAT** or **Zero**, **VAT10** or **Reduced** for 10 percent VAT, and **VAT25** or **Standard** for 25 percent.

To set up a VAT business posting group, follow these steps:

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 4.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Product Posting Groups**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary.

## Combine VAT posting groups in VAT posting setups

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates VAT amounts on sales and purchases based on VAT posting setups, which are combinations of VAT business and product posting groups. For each combination, you can specify the VAT percent, VAT calculation type, and general ledger accounts for posting VAT for sales, purchases, and reverse charges. You can also specify whether to recalculate VAT when a payment discount is applied or received.  

Set up as many combinations as you need. To group VAT posting setup combinations with similar attributes, define a **VAT Identifier** for each group, and assign the identifier to the group members.  

> [!NOTE]
> A **VAT Identifier** is a code you can use to group similar attributes. We recommend you use different VAT identifiers for different VAT percentages.  

To combine VAT posting setups, follow these steps:

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 5.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Posting Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

## Assign VAT posting groups by default to multiple entities

If you want to apply the same VAT posting groups to multiple entities, you can set up [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to do so by default.

* You can assign VAT business posting groups to general business posting groups, or customer or vendor templates.
* You can assign VAT product posting groups on general product posting groups.  

The VAT business or product posting group is assigned when you choose a business or product posting group for a customer, vendor, item, or resource.

## Assign VAT posting groups to accounts, customers, vendors, items, and resources

The following sections describe how to assign VAT posting groups to individual entities.

### To assign VAT posting groups to individual general ledger accounts

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 6.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Chart of Accounts**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the **G/L Account Card** for the account.  
3. On the **Posting** FastTab, in the **Gen. Posting Type** field, choose either **Sale** or **Purchase**.  
4. Choose the VAT posting groups to use for the sales or purchase account.  

### To assign VAT business posting groups to customers and vendors

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 7.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customer** or **Vendor**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Customer** or **Vendor** card, expand the **Invoicing** FastTab.  
3. Choose the **VAT Bus. Posting Group**.  

### To assign VAT product posting groups to individual items and resources

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 8.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Item** or **Resource**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Do one of the following steps:  

    * On the **Item** card, expand the **Price & Posting** FastTab, and then choose **Show more** to display the **VAT Prod. Posting Group** field.  
    * On the **Resource** card, expand the **Invoicing** FastTab.  
3. Choose the VAT product posting group.  

## Set up clauses to explain VAT exemption or nonstandard VAT rates

You set up a VAT clause to describe information about the type of VAT that is being applied. Government regulations might require this information. After you set up a VAT clause and associate it with a VAT posting setup, the VAT clause displays on printed sales documents that use the VAT posting group setup.

If needed, you can also specify how to translate VAT clauses to other languages. When you create and print a sales document that contains a VAT identifier, the document includes the translated VAT clause. The language code specified on the customer card determines the language.

When you use nonstandard VAT rates in different types of documents, such as invoices or credit memos, you might have to include an exemption text (VAT clause). The exemption text states why you calculated a reduced VAT or zero VAT rate. You can define different VAT clauses to include on business documents for each type of document on the **VAT Clauses by Document Type** page.

You can modify or delete a VAT clause, and your modifications are reflected in a generated report. However, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't keep a history of the change. On the report, the VAT clause descriptions are printed and displayed for all lines in the report alongside the VAT amount and the VAT base amount. If a VAT clause isn't defined for any lines on the sales document, the whole section is omitted when you print the report.

### To set up VAT clauses

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 9.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Clauses**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **VAT Clauses** page, create a new line.  
3. In the **Code** field, enter an identifier for the clause. You use this code to assign the clause to VAT posting groups.  
4. In the **Description** field, enter the VAT exemption text that you want to display on documents that can include VAT. In the **Description 2** field, enter more text, if needed. The text is displayed on new document lines.
5. Choose the **Description by document type** action.
6. On the **VAT Clauses by Document Type** page, fill in the fields to set up which VAT exemption text to display for which document type.  
7. Optional: To assign the VAT clause to a VAT posting setup right away, choose **Setup**, and then choose the clause. If you want to wait, you can assign the clause later on the **VAT Posting Setup** page.  
8. Optional: To specify how to translate the VAT clause, choose the **Translations** action.

### To assign a VAT clause to a VAT posting setup

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 10.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Posting Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. In the **VAT Clause Code** column, choose the clause to use for each VAT posting setup it applies to.  

### To specify translations for VAT clauses

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 11.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Clauses**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **Translations** action.  
3. In the **Language Code** field, choose the language you're translating to.  
4. In the **Description** and **Description 2** fields, enter the translations of the descriptions. This text displays in the translated VAT report documents.  

### To specify extended text for VAT clauses

> [!NOTE]  
> If your country or region requires longer text for the VAT clauses than the default version supports, you can specify the longer text for the VAT clauses as *extended text* so that it prints on the sales and purchase reports.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 11.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Clauses**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **Extended Texts** action.  
3. Choose the **New** action.  
4. Fill in the **Language Code** and **Description** fields.  
5. Optionally, select the **All Language Codes** field, or specify the relevant language in the **Language Code** field if you use language codes.  
6. Fill in the **Starting Date** and **Ending Date** fields if you want to limit the dates on which the extended text is used.  
7. In the **Text** lines, write the extended text for your VAT clauses.  
8. Select the relevant fields for the document types where you want the extended text printed.  
9. Close the page.  

## Create a VAT posting setup to handle Import VAT

Use the *Import VAT* feature when you need to post a document where the entire amount is VAT. You use this feature if you receive an invoice from the tax authorities for VAT for imported goods.  

To set up codes for import VAT, follow these steps:  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 12.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Product Posting Groups**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the VAT Product Posting Groups page, set up a new VAT product posting group for import VAT.  
3. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 13.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Posting Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
4. On the VAT Posting Setup page, create a new line, or use an existing VAT business posting groups in combination with the new VAT product posting group for import VAT.  
5. In the **VAT Calculation Type** field, choose **Full VAT**.  
6. In the **Purchase VAT Account** field, enter the general ledger account to use for posting import VAT. All other accounts are optional.  

## Use reverse charge VAT for trade between EU countries/regions

Some companies must use reverse charge VAT when trading with other companies. For example, this rule applies to purchases from EU countries/regions and sales to EU countries/regions.  

> [!NOTE]  
> This rule applies when trading with companies that are registered as VAT liable in another EU country/region. If you do business directly with consumers in other EU countries/regions, then you should contact your tax authority for applicable VAT rules.  

> [!TIP]  
> You can verify that a company is registered as VAT liable in another EU country/region by using the EU VAT Registration Number Validation service. The service is available for free in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For more information, see [Verify VAT registration numbers](finance-how-validate-vat-registration-number.md).

### Sales to EU countries/regions

VAT isn't calculated on sales to VAT-liable companies in other EU countries/regions. You must report the value of these sales to EU countries/regions separately on your VAT statement.  

To correctly calculate VAT on sales to EU countries/regions, you should:  

* Set up a line for sales with the same information for purchases. If you set up lines on the **VAT Posting Setup** page for purchases from EU countries/regions, you can also use these lines for sales.  
* Assign the VAT business posting groups in the **VAT Bus. Posting Group** field on the **Invoicing** FastTab of the customer card of each EU customer. You should also enter the customer's VAT registration number in the **VAT Registration No.** field on the **Foreign Trade** FastTab.  

When you post a sale to a customer in another EU country/region, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates the VAT amount and creates a VAT entry based on information about the reverse charge VAT and the VAT base. This amount is used to calculate the VAT amount. No entries are posted to the VAT accounts in the general ledger.

If you want to use combination of VAT business posting group and VAT product posting group for reporting as services in the periodic VAT reports, mark the **EU Service** field.

> [!NOTE]  
> The **EU Service** field is only applicable for VAT reports. The field isn't related to the **Service Declaration** or **Intrastat for Services** features.

## VAT rounding for documents

Amounts in documents that aren't posted are rounded and displayed to correspond with the final rounding of amounts that are posted. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates VAT for a complete document. The VAT calculation is based on the sum of all lines with the same VAT identifier in the document.  

## Set up VAT reporting

You must set up information about how the tax authorities in your country or region require you to submit VAT reports. The following steps illustrate the most commonly used information. However, your country or region might require other steps. For more information, see the relevant article in the *Local functionality* section in the panel to the left.

# Walkthrough: Receiving and Putting Away in Advanced Warehouse Configurations

<!-- [!INCLUDE[complete_sample_data](includes/complete_sample_data.md)]   -->

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], receiving and putting away occurs using one of four methods, as described in the following table.

|Method|Inbound Process|Require Receipts|Require Put-aways|Complexity Level (Learn more at [Warehouse Management Overview](design-details-warehouse-management.md))|  
|------------|---------------------|--------------|----------------|------------|  
|A|Post receipt and put-away from the order line|||No dedicated warehouse activity.|  
|B|Post receipt and put-away from an inventory put-away document||Turned on|Basic: Order-by-order.|  
|C|Post receipt and put-away from a warehouse receipt document|Turned on||Basic: Consolidated receive/ship posting for multiple orders.|  
|D|Post receipt from a warehouse receipt document and post put-away from a warehouse put-away document|Turned on|Turned on|Advanced|  

Learn more at [Inbound Warehouse Flow](design-details-inbound-warehouse-flow.md).

The following walkthrough demonstrates method D in the previous table.  

## About This Walkthrough

In advanced warehouse configurations where your location is set up to require receiving processing in addition to put-away processing, you use the **Warehouse Receipt** page to record and post the receipt of items on multiple inbound orders. When the warehouse receipt is posted, one or more warehouse put-away documents are created to instruct warehouse workers to take the received items and place them in designated places according to bin setup or in other bins. The specific placement of the items is recorded when the warehouse put-away is registered. The inbound source document can be a purchase order, sales return order, inbound transfer order, or assembly or production order with output that is ready to be put away. If the receipt is created from an inbound order, more than one inbound source document can be retrieved for the receipt. By using this method you can register many items arriving from different inbound orders with one receipt.  

This walkthrough demonstrates the following tasks:  

-   Setting up WHITE location for receiving and putting away.  
-   Creating and releasing two purchase orders for full warehouse handling.  
-   Creating and posting a warehouse receipt document for multiple purchase order lines from specific vendors.  
-   Registering a warehouse put-away for the received items.  

## Roles

This walkthrough demonstrates tasks that are performed by the following user roles:  

-   Warehouse Manager  
-   Purchasing Agent  
-   Receiving Staff  
-   Warehouse Worker  

## Prerequisites

To complete this walkthrough, you will need:  

-   CRONUS installed.  
-   To make yourself a warehouse employee at WHITE location by following these steps:  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Warehouse Employees**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Choose the **User ID** field, and select your own user account on the **Users** page.  
3.  In the **Location Code** field, enter WHITE.  
4.  Select the **Default** field.  

## Story

Ellen, the warehouse manager at CRONUS, creates two purchase orders for accessory items from vendors 10000 and 20000 to be delivered to WHITE warehouse. When the deliveries arrive at the warehouse, Sammy, who is responsible for receiving items from vendors 10000 and 20000, uses a filter to create receipt lines for purchase orders arriving from the two vendors. Sammy posts the items as received into inventory in one warehouse receipt and makes the items available for sale or other demand. John, the warehouse worker, takes the items from the receiving bin and puts them away. John puts all units away in their default bins, except 40 out of 100 received hinges are put away in the assembly department by splitting the put-away line. When John registers the put-away, the bin contents are updated and the items are made available for picking from the warehouse.  

## Reviewing the WHITE Location Setup

The setup of the **Location Card** page defines the company's warehouse flows.  

### To review the location setup  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Locations**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Open the WHITE location card.  
3.  Note on the **Warehouse** FastTab that the **Directed Put-away and Pick** check box is selected.  

    This means that the location is set up for the highest complexity level, reflected by the fact that all warehouse handling check boxes on the FastTab are selected.  

4.  Note on the **Bins** FastTab that bins are specified in the **Receipt Bin Code** and the **Shipment Bin Code** fields.  

This means that when you create a warehouse receipt, this bin code is copied to the header of the warehouse receipt document by default and to the lines of the resulting warehouse put-aways.  

## Creating the Purchase Orders

Purchase orders are the most common type of inbound source document.  

### To create the purchase orders  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Choose the **New** action.  
3.  Create a purchase order for vendor 10000 on the work date (January 23) with the following purchase order lines.  

    |Item|Location code|Quantity|  
    |----------|-------------------|--------------|  
    |70200|WHITE|100 PCS|  
    |70201|WHITE|50 PCS|  

    Proceed to notify the warehouse that the purchase order is ready for warehouse handling when the delivery arrives.  

4.  Choose the **Release** action. The status changes from Open to Released.

    Proceed to create the second purchase order.  

5.  Choose the **New** action.  
6.  Create a purchase order for vendor 20000 on the work date (January 23) with the following purchase order lines.  

    |Item|Location code|Quantity|  
    |----------|-------------------|--------------|  
    |70100|WHITE|10 CAN|  
    |70101|WHITE|12 CAN|  

    Choose the **Release** action. The status changes from Open to Released.

    The deliveries of items from vendors 10000 and 20000 have arrived at WHITE warehouse, and Sammy starts to process the purchase receipts.  

## Receiving the Items

On the **Warehouse Receipt** page, you can manage multiple inbound orders for source documents, such as a purchase order.  

### To receive the items  
1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Warehouse Receipts**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Choose the **New** action.  
3.  In the **Location Code** field, enter WHITE.  
4.  Select **Actions** then **Functions** then choose the **Use Filters to Get Src. Docs.** action.  
5.  In the **Code** field, enter **ACCESSORY**.  
6.  In the **Description** field, enter **Vendors 10000 and 20000**.  
7.  Choose the **Modify** action.  
8.  On the **Purchase** FastTab, in the **Buy-from Vendor No. Filter** field, enter **10000&#124;20000**.  
9. Choose the **Run** action. The warehouse receipt is filled with four lines representing purchase order lines for the specified vendors. The **Qty. to Receive** field is filled because you did not select the **Do not Fill Qty. to Handle** check box on the **Filters to Get Source Docs.** page.  
10. Optionally, if you want to use a filter as described earlier in this section, choose the **Get Source Document** action, and then select purchase orders from the vendors in question.  
11. Choose **Posting** then the **Post Receipt** action, and then choose the **Yes** button.  

    Positive item ledger entries are created reflecting the posted purchase receipts of accessories from vendors 10000 and 20000, and the items are ready to be put away in the warehouse from the receiving bin.  

## Putting the Items Away

On the **Warehouse Put-away** page, you can manage put-aways for a specific warehouse receipt document covering multiple source documents. Like all warehouse activity documents, each item on the warehouse put-away is represented by a Take line and a Place line. In the following procedure, the bin code on the Take lines is the default receiving bin at WHITE location, W-08-0001.  


### To put the items away  
1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Put-Aways**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Select the only warehouse put-away document in the list, and then choose the **Edit** action.  

    The warehouse put-away document opens with a total of eight Take or Place lines for the four purchase order lines.

    The warehouse worker is told that 40 hinges are needed in the assembly department, and proceeds to split the single Place line to specify a second Place line for bin W-02-0001 in the assembly department where the warehouse worker places that part of the received hinges.  

3.  Select the second line on the **Warehouse Put-away** page, the Place line for item 70200.  
4.  In the **Qty. to Handle** field, change the value from 100 to 60.  
5.  On the **Lines** FastTab, choose **Functions**, and then choose **Split Line**. A new line is inserted for item 70200 with 40 in **Qty. to Handle** field.  
6.  In the **Bin Code** field, enter W-02-0001. The **Zone Code** field is automatically filled.  

    By default, the **Zone Code** field on the sales lines are hidden, so you must display it. To do this you need to personalize the page. For more information, see [To start personalizing a page through the Personalizing banner](ui-personalization-user.md#start-personalizing-by-using-the-personalization-mode).

    Proceed to register the put-away.  

7.  Choose the **Register Put-Away** action, and then choose the **Yes** button.  

    The received accessories are now put-away in the items' default bins, and 40 hinges are placed in the assembly department. The received items are now available for picking to internal demand, such as assembly orders, or to external demand, such as sales shipments.

# Autofill fields with Copilot (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]

Copilot's autofill feature assists you by automatically filling in editable blank fields on your page. Use autofill when creating or modifying a record. It suggests field values that you can choose to keep or discard. These suggestions are based on your Business Central data, such as frequently or recently used values, or they can be AI-generated based on option values, lookup values, or page context.

When Copilot generates suggestions, it only accesses the business data you can access. Copilot never saves suggestions automatically but presents them for you to decide what to keep. Copilot uses AI, and suggestions might not be correct.

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-note-d365.md)]

<!--[!INCLUDE [preview-note](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/production-ready-preview-dynamics365.md)]-->

<!--Suggestions are based on Business Central that only you have access to.-->

## Prerequisites

Autofill is activated, and you have the required permissions to use it. Learn more in [Configure Copilot and agent capabilities](enable-ai.md).

## Supported languages

[!INCLUDE[copilot-language-support-en-only](includes/copilot-language-support-en-only.md)]

## Availability

### Where the autofill feature is available

The autofill feature is available on card and document pages, like a **Customer card** or a **Sales Order**. It's available on editable fields within FastTabs on these pages, except those listed in the following section.

### Where the autofill feature isn't available

The autofill feature isn't available on these types of pages:

- List pages like **Customers** and **Sales Orders**.
- Worksheet pages like the **Put-away Worksheet**.
- Setup pages, like **Company information** and **General Ledger Setup**, and assisted setup pages, like **Set up sales tax** and **Set up outgoing email**.
- Task dialogs.

The autofill feature isn't available on these fields regardless of the page type:

- Noneditable fields.
- Fields in the FactBox pane.
- Fields in rows and columns.
- Multiline text fields.
- Masked fields like passwords and secrets.
- Date and time fields.
- Toggle switches.
- Fields that uniquely identify a record like IDs and numbers from a series.
- Certain fields depending on your country/region. For example, Copilot can't make suggestions for address fields until web search powered by Bing is available in your country/region.

## Use autofill on fields

Open the page for editing, select a field, and then select the ![Shows the Copilot icon for generating suggestions for field values.](media/copilot-star-unfilled.png) **Suggest a value for this field and related fields** icon or press <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>i</kbd>. If the icon doesn't appear, autofill isn't available for the field, so try another field.

![Shows a card page with a Copilot icon for generating suggestions for field values.](media/autofill-field.svg)

Suggestions are generated only for fields in the FastTab that you are on. When Copilot finds suggestions, they're automatically entered in the fields in italics along with the ![Shows the details icon for a suggestion](media/autofill-info.png) **Show details** icon. Fields remain unchanged if suggestions aren't found or they don't support the autofill feature.

![Shows a suggested field with the accept and discard buttons.](media/autofill-suggested-value-field.svg)

When you hover over or select a field that includes a suggestion, the ![Shows the accept button for a Copilot suggestion](media/autofill-accept.png) **Accept the suggestion** and ![Shows the discard button for a Copilot suggestion](media/autofill-discard.png) **Discard the suggestion** buttons appear.

### Review suggestions

Review the suggestion for each field and take appropriate action. Suggestions aren't saved until you accept them.

- To learn more about a suggestion, select the ![Shows the details icon for a suggestion](media/autofill-info.png) **Show details** icon next to the field, or press <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>i</kbd>. The details include the source of the suggestion, like the most frequently or recently used value. Use the thumbs-up and thumbs-down icons to give feedback.
- To keep a suggestion, select ![Shows the accept button for a Copilot suggestion](media/autofill-accept.png) **Accept the suggestion** or press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.
- To reject a suggestion and keep the original value, select ![Shows the discard button for a Copilot suggestion](media/autofill-discard.png) **Discard the suggestion** or press <kbd>Delete</kbd>.
- To change a suggestion, select **Change** in the details or press <kbd>F2</kbd>.

You can also use the **Keep all** button in the upper right corner of the page to accept or discard suggestions on all fields.

When you leave the page while there are unaccepted suggestions, Copilot asks you to accept or discard suggestions first.

<!--The first time you use Copilot, you're asked to accept the terms to continue.-->

## Autofill behavior with other data-entry features

Business Central offers many other features that reduce data entry, such as customer templates and business process settings that default values. On some pages, for example, when you specify the value for a field, Business Central validates and automatically sets related fields, like zip code and country. Unlike Copilot, these features don't use AI, and values are saved immediately.

When Copilot suggests a field value and you use any feature that saves a value to the same field, Copilot's suggestion is always discarded in favor of the value set by Business Central.

# Set Up Warehouse Employees

You must set up each user who performs warehouse activities as a warehouse employee and assign them to a default location. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] filters warehouse activities to the employee's default location. They can only perform the warehouse activities at the location. You can also assign a user to other locations. They can access but not perform activities at those locations.

## To set up warehouse employees  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Warehouse Employees**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. Select the **User ID** field, and then select the user to be added as a warehouse employee. Choose the **OK** button.  
4. In the **Location Code** field, enter the code of the location where the user will be working.  
5. Turn on the **Default** toggle to specify that this is the only location where the employee can perform warehouse activities.  
6. Repeat these steps to assign other employees to locations or assign other locations to existing warehouse employees.  

> [!TIP]
> You can also use the **Add me as warehouse employee** action to quickly add yourself to the list of warehouse employees. For example, this is useful when you're testing the capabilities.

# Walkthrough: Selling, Assembling, and Shipping Kits

<!-- [!INCLUDE[complete_sample_data](includes/complete_sample_data.md)]   -->

To support just-in-time inventory and the ability to customize products to customer requests, assembly orders can be automatically created and linked as soon as the sales order line is created. The link between the sales demand and the assembly supply enables sales order processors to customize the assembly item and promise delivery dates according to component availability. In addition, assembly consumption and output are posted automatically with the shipment of the linked sales order.  

Special functionality exists to govern the shipping of assemble-to-order quantities, both in basic and in advanced warehouse configurations. When workers in charge of assembly finish assembling parts or all of the assemble-to-order quantity, they record it in the **Qty. to Ship** field on the warehouse shipment line, in advanced configurations, and then choose **Post Shipment**. The result is that the corresponding assembly output is posted, including the related component consumption, and a sales shipment for the quantity is posted for the linked sales order. This walkthrough illustrates the advanced warehouse process.  

In basic warehouse configurations, when an assemble-to-order quantity is ready to be shipped, the warehouse worker in charge posts an inventory pick for the sales order lines. This creates an inventory movement for the components, posts the assembly output, and the sales order shipment. For more information, see [Handling Assemble-to-Order Items in Inventory Picks](warehouse-how-to-pick-items-with-inventory-picks.md#handling-assemble-to-order-items-with-inventory-picks).  

## About This Walkthrough

This walkthrough demonstrates the following tasks:  

### Setting up Assembly Items

Assembly items are characterized by their replenishment system and the assembly BOM. The item's assembly policy can be either assemble-to-order (ATO) or assemble-to-stock (ATS). This section covers the following tasks:  

-   Setting the appropriate replenishment system and assembly policy on a new assembly item card.  
-   Creating an assembly BOM that lists the assembly components and the resource that go into the assembly item.  

### Selling Customized Assembly Items

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides the flexibility to enter both an inventory quantity and an assemble-to-order quantity on one sales order line. This section covers the following tasks:  

-   Creating a pure ATO sales order line where the full quantity is unavailable and must be assembled before shipment.  
-   Customizing ATO items.  
-   Recalculating the unit price of a customized assembly item.  
-   Creating a mixed sales order line where parts of the sales quantity is provided from inventory and the remaining part must be assembled before shipment.  
-   Understanding ATO availability warnings.  

### Planning for Assembly Items

Assembly demand and supply are handled by the planning system, just like for purchase, transfer, and production. This section covers the following tasks:  

-   Running a regenerative plan for items with sales demand for assembled supply.  
-   Generating an assembly order to fulfill a sales line quantity by the demanded shipment date.  

### Assembling Items

Assembly orders function in a similar way as production orders, expect the consumption and output is recorded and posted directly from the order. When the items are assembled to inventory, the assembly worker has full access to all header and line fields. When the items are assembled to an order where the quantity and date are promised to the customer, then certain fields on the assembly order are not editable. In that case, the assembly posting is performed from the warehouse shipment for the linked sales order. This section covers the following tasks.  

-   Recording and posting assembly consumption and output to inventory.  
-   Accessing a warehouse shipment line from an ATO assembly order to record assembly work.  
-   Accessing an ATO assembly order from a warehouse shipment line to review the automatically entered data.  

### Shipping Assembly Items, from Stock and Assembled to Order

Special functionality exists to govern the shipping of assemble-to-order quantities. This section covers the following tasks:  

-   Creating a warehouse pick for inventory assembly items and for assembly components to be assembled before shipment.  
-   Registering warehouse picks for assembly components and then for assembly items.  
-   Accessing an assembly order from a warehouse shipment to review picked or consumed components.  
-   Shipping assemble-to-order quantities.  
-   Shipping inventory assembly items.  

## Roles

This walkthrough demonstrates tasks that are performed by the following user roles:  

-   Sales Order Processor  
-   Planner  
-   Assembly Worker  
-   Picker  
-   Shipping Responsible

## Story

On January 23, Susan, the sales order processor takes an order from The Device Shop for three units of Kit B, which is an ATO item. All three units are customized and must contain the strong graphics card and an extra RAM block. The disc drives are upgraded to DWD because the CD drives are unavailable. Susan knows that the units can be assembled immediately, and leaves the suggested shipment date of January 23.  

At the same time, the customer orders fifteen units of Kit A with a special request that five units be customized to contain the strong graphics card. Although Kit A is typically an assemble-to-stock item, the order processor combines the sales line quantities to sell ten units from stock and assemble five customized units to the order. The ten units of Kit A are unavailable and must first be supplied to inventory by an assembly order according to the item's assembly policy. Susan learns from the assembly department that Kit A units cannot be completed in the current week. Susan sets the shipment date of the second sales order line, for the mixed ATO and inventory quantity, to January 27 and informs the customer that the 15 units of Kit A will be shipped four days later than the three units of Kit B. To signal to the shipping department that this sales order requires assembly processing, Susan creates the warehouse shipment document from the sales order.  

Eduardo, the planner, runs the planning worksheet and generates an assembly order for ten standard units of Kit A with an internal due date of January 27.  

Sammy, who is responsible for shipping, gets three warehouse shipment lines for the sales order: One line for the three pure ATO units, one line for the five ATO units on the mixed sales order line, and one line for the ten ATS units on the mixed sale order line. Sammy creates a warehouse pick document for all the assembly components that are needed to assemble the total of eight ATO units on the warehouse shipment document.  

John, the picker, retrieves components for all the ATO quantities on the warehouse shipment document and brings them to the assembly area. John enters the quantity to handle and registers the warehouse pick.  

Linda assembles the three ATO units of Kit B. The components are already picked, and Linda does not record output and consumption quantities or post the order, because both of these actions are performed automatically through the related warehouse shipment lines.  

Sammy records the assembled quantity on the warehouse shipment line and posts the shipment of the three units of Kit B. The first line on the sales order is updated as shipped. The linked assembly order remains open until the sales order is fully invoiced. The two warehouse shipment lines, one ATO and one ATS, for Kit A with due dates on January 27 remain open.  

On January 27, Linda processes two assembly orders for Kit A. The first order is the ATO order for five units, which Linda processes differently than the ATO order for Kit B processed on January 23. On this order, Linda is authorized to access the warehouse shipment line herself to record the completed assembly work. The needed components are ready in the assembly department, as they were picked together with components for Kit B.  

The second assembly order is the ATS order for ten units that were created by the planning system. On this ATS order, Linda performs all involved actions from the assembly order. Linda creates a warehouse pick document for the assembly components that are needed to assemble the ten units. When the PCs are assembled, Linda posts the assembly order and thereby signals that the items are available in inventory and can be picked for shipment.  

Sammy creates a warehouse pick document for any quantities that remain before the warehouse shipment can be posted. A pick document is created for the ten units of Kit A that have just finished. The components needed to assemble the five units of Kit A to order where picked on January 23.  

John brings the ten units of Kit A from the warehouse to the specified shipping area, records the quantity to handle, and then registers the pick.  

Sammy packs the ten ATS units with the five ATO units that Linda assembled earlier in the day. Sammy fills in the quantity to ship on both lines and then posts the last shipment for The Device Shop. The related assembly order for five units of Kit A is automatically posted. The second line on the sales order is updated as shipped. Two linked assembly order remains open until the sales order is invoiced and closed.  

When the sales order is later posted as fully invoiced, the sales order and the linked assembly orders are removed.

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  In this section, the person who is responsible for shipping is in charge of recording the completed ATO assembly work on the warehouse shipment line. This workflow may occur in environments where the assembly work is performed by the person who is responsible for shipping or by assembly workers in the shipping area.  
    >   
    >  In this section, actions on the assembly order are performed indirectly from the warehouse shipment line. For more information about how to process an assembly order directly, see the "Assemble Items to Inventory" section in this walkthrough.  

2.  Open the most recent warehouse shipment that is created at WHITE location.  

    Notice the three warehouse shipment lines: One line for the ATO quantity of Kit B, due on January 23. One line for the ATO quantity of Kit A, due on January 27. One line for the inventory quantity of Kit A, due on January 27.  

    The **Assemble to Order** field specifies the assembly method.

    Next, create a pick document for all the ATO assembly components that are needed on the warehouse shipment.  

3.  Choose the **Create Pick** action, and then choose the **OK** button.  

    Next, perform the picker's task.  

4.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Picks**, and then choose the related link.

    Next.register the pick without changing the default information.  

6.  Choose the **Autofill Qty. to Handle** action.  
7.  Choose the **Register Pick** action.  

    Return to performing the shipping tasks.  

8.  Reopen the **Warehouse Shipment** page.  

    Notice that the **Qty. Picked** field is still empty on all lines. This is because you still have not picked the items to be shipped, but only the components needed to assemble the ATO quantities.  

    Proceed to review the related assembly order.  

9. Select the shipment line for three units of Kit B.  
10. On the **Lines** FastTab, choose **Line**, and then choose **Assemble to Order**. The **Assembly Order** page opens.  

    Notice that several fields on the assembly order are unavailable because the order is linked to a sales order.  

    Notice on the assembly order lines that the **Qty. Picked** field is filled. This is due to the pick that you registered in step 7 in this section.  

11. In the **Quantity to Assemble** field, try to enter any value lower than **3**.  

    Read the error message explaining why this field can only be filled through the **Qty. to Ship** field on the related shipment.  

    The **Quantity to Assemble** field is editable is to support situations where you want to partially ship an inventory quantity instead of assembling more units to the order. For more information, see the "Combination Scenarios" section in [Understanding Assemble to Order and Assemble to Stock](assembly-assemble-to-order-or-assemble-to-stock.md).  

12. Close the **Assembly Order** page to return to the **Warehouse Shipment** page.

    Along with this warehouse shipment posting, the full consumption and output quantities of the related assembly order are posted, and the **Remaining Quantity** field is empty. The sales order line for Kit B is updated to show that the three units are shipped.  

    Warehouse activities to fulfill the first sales order line by January 23 are completed. Next, fulfill the sales order lines that are shipping on January 27  

### Assembling and Recording the Second ATO Quantity  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Assembly Orders**, and then choose the related link.  

    Notice that the ATO order for shipped units of Kit B is still in the list, although the **Remaining Quantity** is empty. This is because the linked sales order is still not fully invoiced.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  In this section, the assembly worker is responsible for recording the completed ATO assembly work on the warehouse shipment line. This workflow may occur in environments where the assembly work is performed in a separate assembly department and assembly workers are authorized to change the warehouse shipment line.  

2.  Open the ATO assembly order for five units of Kit A.  

    Notice that the **Quantity to Assemble** and the **Quantity to Consume** fields are empty because no work is recorded yet.

# Specify the languages that are available in your Business Central environment

To let people work in their preferred language, the user interface (UI) in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is translated by apps that Microsoft provides, or by language apps that our partners provide on AppSource. Administrators install the language apps in their [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] environment. Afterward, on the **My Settings** page, people can choose the language in which they want to use [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

The **Languages** page lists all languages that [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports. However, to use [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in a selected language, the language app must be installed in the environment. If someone chooses a language that a language app isn't installed for, they might be confused when the UI doesn't change.

To avoid confusion and make it easier for people to select a language they can use, administrators can use the **Allowed Languages** page to list the languages that they installed language apps for. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] filters the list of languages on the **My Settings** page to show only the allowed languages.

## Create a list of allowed languages

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Allowed Languages**, and choose the related link.
1. In the **Language ID** field, choose the language to allow.
1. Repeat step 2 for each language that you installed a language app for.

# Set up company consolidation

Before you can consolidate the general ledger entries of two or more companies (subsidiaries) into a consolidated company, you must prepare the charts of accounts and the consolidation company.  

Depending on the complexity of your businesses, there are two ways to set up consolidation:

* If you don't need advanced settings, such as including a company that you only own part of, you can use the **Company Consolidation** setup guide to quickly set-up a consolidation. The guide helps you through the basic steps.
* If you need more advanced settings, you can set up the consolidated company and business units yourself.
  * In each business unit, specify the general ledger accounts to include in the consolidation and the translation method for each account.
  * In the consolidated company, set up a business unit card for each company to include in the consolidation. The business unit card includes information such as the dates of the business unit's fiscal year, and the percentage of each account to include in the consolidation.

## Simple consolidation setup

If your consolidation is straightforward, for example because you wholly own the business units to consolidate, the **Company Consolidation** guide helps you through the following steps:

* Create a new consolidated company, or consolidate a company you already created. The company shouldn't contain transactions.
* Preview the results. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] verifies that you can successfully transfer the master data and transactions to the consolidated company.

To use the assisted setup guide, follow these steps:

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Assisted Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose **Process Consolidations**, and then complete each step in the Company Consolidation assisted setup guide.

## Advanced consolidation setup

If you need more advanced settings for your consolidation, you can set up consolidation manually. For example, if you have companies that you partially own, or you have companies that you don't want to include.  

### Set up the consolidated company

First, you must set up the consolidated company. You set up the consolidated company in the same way that you set up other companies. To learn more about setting up a company, go to [Getting Ready for Doing Business](ui-get-ready-business.md).  

The following list illustrates key aspects of the consolidated company.

1. Set up the chart of accounts.

    To learn more about setting up a chart of accounts, go to [Setting Up or Changing the Chart of Accounts](finance-setup-chart-accounts.md).  

    The charts of accounts can be identical across a business unit and the consolidated company, or the consolidated company can have a different chart of account. If a business unit's chart of accounts differs from the consolidated company's, you must map the accounts to the accounts in the business unit. To learn more, go to the [Prepare general ledger accounts for consolidation](#glacc) section.

2. Add business units.

    To consolidate several companies' data, you must set up the subsidiaries as business units and specify how much of their balances to include. To learn more about business units, to go the [Add business units](#busunit) section.

3. Specify exchange rates, if needed.

    Specify exchange rates if you consolidate data for business units that use different currencies. The three exchange rates you can use are **Average Rate (Manual)**, **Closing Rate**, and **Last Closing Rate**. To learn more about exchange rates, go to [Specify exchange rates for consolidations](#exchrates).

4. Consolidate dimension information and general ledger accounts.

    To learn more, go to the [Include or exclude dimensions](#dim) section.

### <a name="busunit"></a>Add business units

In the consolidated company, set up each company that you want to consolidate data from as a business unit. Before you run a consolidation and generate your consolidation report, it's a good idea to verify the financial data in each business unit.

A significant part of setting up the business unit is to specify how the unit shares it's financial data with the consolidated company. There are manual and automated options:

* To use a manual process, for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online and on-premises, you can export an .xml file that contains the unit's general ledger entries. Then import the file in the consolidated company.
* To automate the data exchange, for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online you can use an API that [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides to share data across environments. If your companies are in the same environment, you can use the **Database** option.

> [!NOTE]
> The API option also lets you share general ledger entries from other [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] environments. To use the API option, the user who configures the consolidation must have permission to access G/L entries. For example, the D365 Basic and D365 Read permission sets provide access.

#### Set up business unit currencies

When you run consolidation for business units in a foreign currency, pay attention to the exchange rates that various parts of the process use. This is especially true when you rerun consolidation. Use the **Set Up Business Unit Currencies** page to easily keep track of the rates.

The **Set Up Business Unit Currencies** page gives you the last rates for average, closing, and last closing rate. You can look up the exchange rates in the currency exchange rate table, which makes it easier to validate rates. You can change the rates for the current run by entering the values or copying them from previous runs. To copy rates, choose **Select from previous consolidation**. This page is valuable when you want to rerun a previous consolidation and use a previous closing rate. This step helps to correctly revaluate your balance sheet items. The **Select from previous consolidation** page is also useful if you just want to view the rates that were used, for example, when you're troubleshooting. The page is filtered to runs that included the selected business unit.

You start the **Run Consolidation** batch job from the **Business Units** list page. You can also find the **Set Up Business Unit Currencies** page by choosing the **Exchange Rates** action.

> [!NOTE]
> The exchange rate setup pages for average, closing, and last closing rate that are currently available on the **Business Unit** card will be deprecated in a future version. However, you can still maintain these rates if you have business units that you import through files.

#### Create a business unit

1. Sign in to the consolidated company.
2. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Business Units**, and then choose the related link.  
3. Choose **New**, and then fill in the required fields on the **General** and **G/L Accounts** FastTabs. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > When you fill in the **Starting Date** and **Ending Date** fields, make sure you comply with GAAP rules concerning the fiscal periods of the business unit versus the parent company.
4. On the **Data Import** FastTab, in the **Default Data Import** field, specify how you share general ledger entries with the consolidated company:

   * To share data between companies in the same environment, choose **Database**.
   * To share data between companies in different environments, choose **API**, and then fill in the **API's Endpoint** field.
        
        To get the endpoint URL, in the business unit company's [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], open the **Consolidation Setup Page** and check the Current environment's API Endpoint field value. 
   * To export an .xml file and manually share it, choose **File Format**.

### <a name="glacc"></a>Prepare general ledger accounts for consolidation

The chart of accounts for a company that you will consolidate must specify accounts for consolidation. For each posting general ledger account in each company, you must specify the general ledger account in the consolidated company to transfer the balance to. This mapping lets you consolidate companies that have different charts of accounts.

If the chart of accounts in the business unit differs from the consolidated company, you must prepare general ledger accounts for consolidation. You can specify the accounts to post debits and credits to, and the method to use to translate currencies in the consolidated company.

1. In each business unit's [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Chart of Accounts**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the card for the account, and then fill in the fields on the **Consolidation** FastTab. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> If you don't fill in the **Consol. Debit Acc.** and **Consol. Credit Acc.** fields, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] assumes they're mapped to the same accounts in the consolidated company.

> [!TIP]
> There might be scenarios where you don't want to include an account in a consolidation. For example, if you want your consolidation company to reflect only the balance sheets from the subsidiary companies. To exclude an account from consolidation, turn on the **Exclude from Consolidation** toggle for the account.

### <a name="exchrates"></a>Specify exchange rates for consolidations

If a business unit uses a different currency than the consolidated company, you must specify exchange rate methods for each account before you consolidate. For each account, the content of the **Consol. Translation Method** field determines the exchange rate. In the consolidated company, on each business unit card, in the **Currency Exchange Rate Table** field you specify whether consolidation uses exchange rates from the business unit or the consolidated company. If you use exchange rates from the consolidated company, you can change the exchange rates for a business unit. For business units, if the **Currency Exchange Rate Table** field on the business unit card contains **Local**, you can change the exchange rate from the business unit card. The exchange rates are copied from the **Currency Exchange Rate** table, but you can change them before consolidating.

The following table describes the exchange rate methods you can use for accounts.

|Exchange rate | Typical use |
|---|---|
|Average Rate (Manual) | You manually calculate the average rate for the period to consolidate. Calculate the average either as an arithmetic average or as a best estimate, and specify the result for each business unit. Use for income statement accounts.|
|Closing Rate | Used for balance sheet accounts.|
|Last Closing Rate | The rate that was valid in the foreign exchange market on the date for which the balance sheet or income statement is being prepared. You enter this rate for each business unit. Use for balance sheet accounts.|
|Historical Rate | The exchange rate that was valid when the transaction occurred.|
|Composite Rate | The current period amounts are translated at the average rate and added to the previously recorded balance in the consolidated company. You typically use this method for retained earnings accounts. Those accounts include amounts from different periods, so they contain amounts translated with different exchange rates.|
|Equity Rate | This option is similar to **Composite**. Differences post to separate general ledger accounts.|

To specify exchange rates for a business unit, follow these steps:

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Business Units**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Business Unit List** page, choose the business unit, and then choose the **Exchange Rates** action.  
3. On the **Setup Business Unit Currencies** page, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

### <a name="dim"></a>Include or exclude dimensions

You can consolidate dimension information and general ledger accounts.

* On the dimensions, specify the **Consolidation Code** field, or leave it blank.
  * To exclude a dimension in the consolidation, leave the **Consolidation Code** field blank on the dimension, and don't choose dimensions in the **Copy Dimensions** fields in any consolidation functions or reports.
  * To include dimension information in the consolidation, leave the **Consolidation Code** field blank. However, the consolidation works only if the dimension values in the business unit are the same as the consolidated company.
  * To consolidate the dimension value code in the business unit with a different dimension value code in the consolidated company, fill in the **Consolidation Code** field on the dimensions.  
* Add the dimensions to the general ledger accounts.

### <a name="exclude"></a>Exclude a company from consolidation

If you don't want to include a business unit in the consolidation, you can exclude it. To do that, go to the business unit card, and clear the **Consolidate** checkbox.

### <a name="include"></a>Include a partially owned company in consolidation

If you own only part of a company, you can include a percentage of each transaction that reflects the percentage you own. For example, if you own 70% of the company, consolidation includes $70 of an invoice for $100. To specify the percentage of the company you own, go to the business unit card and enter the percentage in the **Consolidation %** field.

# Viewing Service Statistics
You can use statistics to analyze service documents and determine how well you are managing your service processes. You can analyze service contracts, items, quotes, orders, invoices, and credit memos by choosing the **Statistics** action. For service items and contracts, you can also use the **Service Item Trendscape** or **Contract Trendscape** to view a summary of service ledger entries for a specific service item.   

## Viewing Statistics for Service Orders
The service order statistics feature gives you a quick overview of the contents of the entire service order, the details on the specific service lines, and information related to invoicing, shipping and consuming, and the customer's balance.  

The statistical data is displayed for a service order on the **Service Order Statistics** page for the relevant order. You can open the relevant statistics page from a service order. On the **Service Orders** page, choose **Statistics**. The FastTabs in this page show information such as quantity, amount, VAT, cost, profit, and customer credit limit. The amounts on the page are in the currency of the service order, unless otherwise indicated.

You can view the total amount on the service lines, including and excluding VAT, VAT part, cost, and profit on the service lines. The page also displays item-specific information, such as weight, volume, and the quantity of parcels.  

### View shipping information  
You can see information about the items, resources, or costs to be shipped. To provide the information, the values specified in the **Qty. to Ship** field are used on each service line in the order.  

### View order details  
You can view information about the items, resource hours, and costs to be invoiced and consumed. The following table describes this information.  

|Column | Description|  
|------------|---------------------------------------|  
|**Invoicing**|Displays amounts that are to be posted as invoiced from the service order.|  
|**Consuming**|Displays the quantity and cost of items, or resources that will be posted as consumed.|  
|**Total**|Displays the total amounts on the service order that result from adding the invoicing amounts to the consuming amounts.|  

### Analyze service order lines  
You can analyze the information by the types of service lines included in the service order. The amounts are shown separately for:  

* Items  
* Resources  
* Costs and general ledger accounts  

### View customer information  
See the balance on the customer's account, in addition to the maximum credit that can be endued to the customer who you created the service document for.

## Viewing Service Item Statistics
On the **Service Item Statistics** page, you can see up-to-date information about a service item based the following service ledger entry types:  

* Resources  
* Items  
* Service cost  
* Service contracts  
* Total  

For each entry type, you can see the invoiced amount, usage (amount), cost amount, quantity, quantity invoiced and quantity consumed, profit amount and profit percentage. The profit percentage is calculated according to the following formula:  

* (Invoiced Amount - Usage (Cost)) x 100 / Invoiced Amount  

## Use Trendscapes
For service items and service contracts, the **Service Item Trendscape** or **Service Contract Trendscape** pages provides a scrollable summary of service ledger entries in a period of time for a specific service item or contract. To view the trendscape, open the service item or service contract, choose the **Statistics** action, and then choose **Trendscape**.

When you scroll the list, the amounts are calculated in the local currency according to the specified time interval. All amounts are calculated from service ledger entries, which are entries that are created when you post service orders or service invoices.

You can filter the list by specifing the service items to include.  

> [!Tip]  
>  If you have set the time interval to **Day** and you want to scroll over a long period, you can do it faster by shifting to a larger interval such as **Quarter**. When you have found the desired period, you can shift back to the original interval to see the data in more detail.   

## Viewing Gains and Losses on Contracts  
A contract gain or loss entry is generated when a contract quote is converted to a service contract, when contract lines are added or removed from a service contract, or when a contract is canceled. You can view contract gains or losses on the following pages.  

|Page | Description|  
|----------------|---------------------------------------|  
|**Contract Gain/Loss (Contracts)**|To view the contract gain/loss by service contract.|  
|**Contract Gain/Loss (Groups)**|To view the contract gain/loss by service contract group.|  
|**Contract Gain/Loss (Customers)**|To view the contract gain/loss by customer.|  
|**Contract Gain/Loss (Reasons)**|To view the contract gain/loss by reason code.|  
|**Contract Gain/Loss (Resp.Ctr)**|To view the contract gain/loss by responsibility center.|  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter the name of the page to display, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the filter criteria you want to apply. For example, on the **Contract Gain/Loss (Reasons)** page, choose a value for **Reason Code Filter**.  
3. Choose the **Show Matrix** action.

## Viewing Statistics for Posted Service Documents
The service statistics feature lets you gain a statistical overview of the contents of posted service documents, such as a posted shipment, posted invoice, and posted credit memo.  

The statistical information is displayed in the statistics page for the corresponding posted service document. You can open the relevant statistics page from posted service shipment, posted service invoice, or posted service credit memo documents. For each of these document types, choose the **Statistics** action. For example, from the **Posted Service Invoices** page, choose the **Statistics** action.  

### Posted Service Shipment Statistics  
The **Service Shipment Statistics** page provides an overview of a posted service shipment. This includes information about the physical contents of the shipment, such as quantity of the shipped items, resource hours or costs, and weight and volume of the shipped items.  

### Posted Service Invoice Statistics  
You can see a statistical summary on a posted service invoice on the **Service Invoice Statistics** page. You can view the totals of the posted service invoice. The data includes total amount on the service lines (including and excluding VAT) that has been posted as invoiced, VAT part, cost, and profit on the posted invoice. The page also displays information about the following:  

* The items on the service invoice lines, such as weight, volume, and the quantity of parcels.  
* The balance on the customer's account, and the maximum credit that you can extend the customer.  

### Posted Service Credit Memo Statistics  
You can use the **Service Credit Memo Statistics** page to get a statistical overview of the lines in a posted service credit memo. The overview can include:

* The total amounts on the posted credit memo, displayed as quantity, amount, VAT, cost and profit. There is also information about the items on the service lines of the posted credit memo, such as quantity, weight, and volume.  
* General information about the customer, such as the customer's credit limit and balance on the account.

# Get the Business Central add-in for Excel

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes an add-in for Excel that lets users select the **Edit in Excel** action on certain pages to open the data in an Excel worksheet. This action is different than the **Open in Excel** action because it lets users make changes in Excel, then publish the changes back to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]

## Overview

### About the add-in

The add-in is called **Microsoft Dynamics Office Add-in** and it's available for installation from the [Office Store (AppSource)](https://appsource.microsoft.com/). With the add-in installed, the **Edit in Excel** action is available on most list and list part pages from the **Share** icon ![Share a page in another app.](media/share-icon.png). For more information about using the add-in, see [View and Edit in Excel From Business Central](across-work-with-excel.md).

> [!NOTE]
> The add-in works on Windows only.

### About deployment as an admin

With [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, there are a few deployment options for getting the add-in to users. One option is *individual acquisition*, where users install the add-in themselves. With this option, users must have access to downloading files from the Office Store. Another option is to set up *Centralized Deployment* in the Microsoft 365 admin center to automatically deploy the add-in to your entire organization, groups, or specific users. Centralized Deployment provides a way to get the add-in to users if your organization doesn't give users access to the Office Store.

For the user, the installation experience is different for the two deployment scenarios:

- With individual acquisition, the first time users choose the **Edit in Excel** action, the **New Office Add-in** pane opens in Excel. To install the add-in, the user chooses **Trust this add-in**, which in turn installs the add-in directly from the Office Store. Users then sign in to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] using their user name and password.

- With Centralized Deployment, the first time users choose the **Edit in Excel** action, the add-in is automatically installed in Excel from Centralized Deployment; not the Office Store. The only thing users have to do is sign in to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

With both these deployment options, the add-in is automatically configured to connect to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. A third deployment option is a manual installation of the add-in directly from Excel. With this option, users need to configure the add-in to connect to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

### <a name="switch"></a>Switching from individual acquisition to Centralized Deployment or the other way around

When you change from individual acquisition of the add-in to Centralized Deployment, or vice versa, it affects Excel files that users created before the transition. After the transition, users can still open any Excel worksheets previously created using the **Edit in Excel** action or created manually by configuring the Excel add-in. But they can't update the data in the file from Business Central or push updates to Business Central.

This situation happens because each Excel file gets assigned an "add-in" identifier. In the transition to or from Centralized Deployment, a different ID is assigned, so the earlier ID becomes blocked.

## Preparation (on-premises only)

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises requires that your environment is configured for the add-in. If not, the **Edit in Excel** action isn't available to users. Learn more in [Setting up the Business Central add-in for Excel in Business Central on-premises](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/configuring-excel-addin) in the Developer and IT Pro help.

## Deploy the add-in by using Centralized Deployment

Centralized Deployment is a feature in the Microsoft 365 admin center that you use to automatically install add-ins in users' Office apps, like Excel. To help you with Centralized Deployment, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes the **Excel Add-in Centralized Deployment** assisted setup.

### Before you begin

- Learn more about preventing users from downloading from the Office store at [Manage add-ins in the admin center](/microsoft-365/admin/manage/manage-addins-in-the-admin-center).
- Verify that Centralized Deployment works for your organization. Learn more at [Determine if Centralized Deployment of add-ins works for your organization](/microsoft-365/admin/manage/centralized-deployment-of-add-ins).
- Learn more about transitioning from individual acquisition at [Switching from individual acquisition to Centralized Deployment](#switch).

> [!NOTE]
> Enabling Centralized Deployment affects features that use the Excel add-in, such as the **Edit in Excel** action. It has no effect on other Excel-related features or permissions assigned to users in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

### Set up Centralized Deployment of the add-in

In this task, you work in both [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and the Microsoft 365 admin center.

1. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Excel Add-in Centralized Deployment**, and then choose the related link.
2. Read the information on the **Business Central Excel add-in setup** page and choose **Next**.
3. Sign in to the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2163967) and go to **Integrated Apps**<!--**Add-ins**-->.

    Complete the following steps to configure the add-in to deploy from the Office Store: 
    1. Choose **Get apps** to open Office Store (AppSource). <!--**Deploy Add-in** 5. In the **Deploy a new add-in**, select **Choose from the store**.-->
    2. Search for **Microsoft Dynamics Office Add-in**, then select **Get it now**. <!--On the **Select add-in** page, search for and select **Microsoft Dynamics Office Add-in** > **Add** > **Continue**.-->
    3. On the **Add Users** page, specify the users that you want to deploy the add-in for, then choose **Next**.<!--On the **Configure add-in**, specify the users that you want to deploy the add-in for.-->
    4. Review the **Accept permissions requests**, then choose **Next** > **Finish Deployment**.
    5. Wait for the green check mark next to **Deployed** appears for the add-in, then choose **Done**. <!--Select **Deploy** and wait til successful, then **Next** > **Continue**.-->

       The add-in appears on the **Add-ins** page. For more information about deploying add-ins in the Microsoft 365 admin center, see [Deploy add-ins in the admin center](/power-platform/admin/use-service-admin-role-manage-tenant?azure-portal=true).
4. Go back to **Excel Add-in Centralized Deployment** assisted setup in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], and choose **Next**.
5. Turn on **Use Centralized Deployment**, and choose **Finish**.

    If you don't turn on this switch, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] gets the add-in directly from the Office Store.

When finished, you can always change the deployment in the Microsoft 365 admin center, like assigning more users. For more information about deploying add-ins in the admin center, see [Deploy add-ins in the admin center](/power-platform/admin/use-service-admin-role-manage-tenant?azure-portal=true).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you have more than one environment, you must run the **Excel Add-in Centralized Deployment** assisted setup on each environment that you want to use Centralized Deployment. However, you don't have to configure the Centralized Deployment in Microsoft 365 again. The only thing you have to do is turn on the **Use Centralized Deployment** switch in the assisted setup. 

> [!NOTE]
> It can take up to 24 hours before the add-in deploys automatically in Excel for users.

## <a name="install"></a>Individual acquisition: Install the add-in manually for your own use

In most cases, when you open Excel from Business Central, the add-in is either installed automatically for you or you're prompted to install it. There might be cases, however, where you have to manually install the add-in.

1. Open Excel, then open any Excel workbook.
1. On the **Home** tab, select **Add-ins** > **More Add-ins**.
1. Go to **Admin managed** and look for **Microsoft Dynamics Office Add-In**. If you see it there, select it, and then choose **Add**. If you don't see it, go to **Store**, and then search for *Microsoft Dynamics Office add-In* and follow the instructions to add it.

When the add-in is installed, it shows up as a panel in Excel. Next, configure the connection.

### Configure the Business Central connection

If a user can't connect automatically, you can unblock them by asking them to follow these steps:

1. In the **Microsoft Dynamics** add-in pane in Excel, choose **Add server information**. If you don't see it, choose the ![More option button in Excel.](media/cogwheel.png) icon at the top to open the options dialog. 
2. For [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, set **Server URL** to `https://exceladdinprovider.smb.dynamics.com`. For [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, set it to the URL of the web client, like `https://myBCserver/240`.
3. Choose **OK**, and then confirm that the app reloads.
4. When prompted, sign in with your Business Central user name and password.
5. Optionally, choose the environment and company that you want to connect to.

The add-in is now connected to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], and you can edit data and publish the changes to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

## Prepare devices and network for the Excel add-in

Network services such as proxies or firewalls must allow routing between each client device on which the add-in is installed and many service endpoints. For a list of endpoints, go to [Preparing your network for the Excel add-In](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/configuring-network-for-addins).

## Troubleshooting

Sometimes, users run into problems with the Excel add-in. This section gives tips for how to unblock users in certain circumstances.

|Problem  |Solution or workaround  |Comments  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|The add-in doesn't start. <br><br>For example, the user gets the message "Add-in Warning: This add-in is no longer available" when trying to use the add-in. This particular problem can happen if Centralized Deployment is configured correctly, but the user wasn't assigned access.|Check whether the add-in is deployed centrally. Or, check whether the user is blocked from installing it locally. | The admin can configure Office so that users can't acquire add-ins. In that case, the admin must deploy the add-in centrally. For more information, see [Deploy add-ins in the admin center](/microsoft-365/admin/manage/manage-deployment-of-add-ins?view=o365-worldwide&preserve-view=true).|
|Data doesn't load into Excel.|Test the connection by opening another list in Excel from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Or, open the workbook in Excel in a browser.|If the user specified a company name that contains special characters, the add-in can't connect. |
|Data can't publish back to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].|Test the connection by opening the workbook in Excel in a browser. |Sometimes an extension can block the publishing job. If the page is extended or customized, remove the extensions, and then try again.|
|The dates are wrong.  |Excel might show times and dates in a different format than [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. This condition doesn't make them wrong, and the data in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't get messed up.|         |
|For some list pages, editing multiple lines in Excel consistently causes errors. This condition can occur if OData calls include FlowFields and fields outside of the repeater control.|On the **Web Services** page, select the **Exclude Non-Editable FlowFields** and **Exclude Fields Outside of the Repeater** checkboxes for the published page. Selecting these checkboxes excludes noneditable FlowFields and fields from the eTag calculation. |These checkboxes are hidden by default. To show them on the **Web Services** page, use [personalization](/dynamics365/business-central/ui-personalization-user). |
|Users can no longer sign in to the add-in. When they try to sign in, the process stops without completing.| This problem might happen because of an update that we made to the add-in, sometime in July 2022. For more information and a fix, see [Modify the Excel Add-in Configuration to Support July 2022 Update](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/update-excel-addin-configuration).|Applies to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises only.|
| The add-in communicates using the API v2.0 for Dynamics 365 Business Central, and any limitations of this API are automatically inherited. An example limitation is if you try to edit a list and the underlying card uses a confirmation dialog in its AL logic, for example, as its validation logic. | Sometimes there's nothing to do because it's a design choice that the user must explicitly confirm the change. If the confirmation is negligible when using **Edit in Excel**, then you can wrap the confirmation dialog call in an if-conditional statement that checks whether the client type is different from ODataV4, for example, `if SESSION.CurrentClientType() <> ClientType::ODataV4 then`. | There might be other clients that you want to remove the confirmation dialog from, such as OData and SOAP. |

## Known limitations in business logic

|Page  |Limitation| Comments  |
|-------|---------|---------|
|Sales Orders|Error message: 'Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central Data Services attempted to issue a client callback to run page 301 Ship-to Address List as modal.' Client callbacks aren't supported on Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central Data Services. | The **Ship-to Code** on the **Sales Order** page is editable only with specific Ship-to options. Setting **Alternate Shipping Address** to **Ship-to** opens the **Ship-to Address List** modal dialog, which isn't compatible with Edit in Excel.|  
|Project Journal|Update of the **Unit Price** field doesn't trigger an update of the **Line Amount**. Instead, it updates **Line Discount**.| Using the web client, you can update fields in any order—price, amount, line discount. Other fields are updated automatically. To avoid cascade updates, the fields have advanced logic that relies on xRec, which behaves differently when called via APIs.|

## Known limitations in metadata generation

When using **Edit in Excel** in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], either by selecting the **Edit in Excel** action on a page or when the Excel add-in loads after opening an Excel workbook, you might encounter the following error: _Metadata was unable to be retrieved for entity \<entity name\> as it was not found_.

This error occurs when the page you're attempting to modify becomes too complex for **Edit in Excel** to process effectively. The primary cause is the installation of multiple extensions that add fields with identical field names to the same parent page, leading to conflicts. It's also possible for a single extension to block the metadata generation.

### Single extension blocking metadata creation

Consider the following scenario involving extension _A_, which includes the page extension _CustomerCardExtA_ and the page _WebViewerA_ where _PageType = CardPart_.

When metadata is generated for the _Customer Card_ page, the algorithm evaluates each individual field, including those fields added by extensions. However, if extension _A_ is installed, this process fails because _WebViewerA_ doesn't share the same source table as the _Customer Card_ page.

To resolve this issue, you should add a _Customer_ `SourceTable` property to the _WebViewerA_ page. An example of this modification can be observed in the code snippets containing _CustomerCardExtB_ and _WebViewerB_.

In some cases, you might need to embed the `CardPart` on multiple pages without referencing a specific source table. For such scenarios, we recommend creating a separate `CardPart` for each page where you also need to generate metadata and refactoring the shared logic into a codeunit.

```AL
pageextension 50120 CustomerCardExtA extends "Customer Card"
{
    layout
    {
        addlast(content)
        {
            part("Bing WebViewer"; "WebViewer")
            {
                ApplicationArea = All;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

```AL
page 50120 "WebViewerA"
{
    ApplicationArea = All;
    Caption = 'WebViewer', Locked = true;
    PageType = CardPart;

    layout
    {
        area(Content)
        {
            usercontrol(WebViewer; WebPageViewer)
            {
                #region ControlAddInReady
                trigger ControlAddInReady(callbackUrl: Text)
                begin
                    CurrPage.WebViewer.Navigate('https://www.bing.com')
                end;
                #endregion ControlAddInReady
            }
        }
    }
}
```

```AL
pageextension 50120 CustomerCardExtB extends "Customer Card"
{
    layout
    {
        addlast(content)
        {
            part("Bing WebViewer"; "WebViewer")
            {
                ApplicationArea = All;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

```AL
page 50120 "WebViewerB"
{
    ApplicationArea = All;
    Caption = 'WebViewer', Locked = true;
    PageType = CardPart;
    SourceTable = Customer;

    layout
    {
        area(Content)
        {
            usercontrol(WebViewer; WebPageViewer)
            {
                #region ControlAddInReady
                trigger ControlAddInReady(callbackUrl: Text)
                begin
                    CurrPage.WebViewer.Navigate('https://www.bing.com')
                end;
                #endregion ControlAddInReady
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Multiple extensions causing collisions

To resolve this issue, there are two potential solutions:

1. **Disable extensions**: To identify which extension is causing the conflict, you can disable extensions that affect the page one at a time. However, this approach might not be ideal if the extensions in question are necessary for your business processes.

2. **Modify extension code**: This solution involves analyzing the root cause of the issue and addressing it by modifying the code of the conflicting extensions.

To better understand this issue, consider the following example involving the **Customer Card** page (ID 21). When you are on the **Customer List** page (ID 22) and select **Edit in Excel**, a web service is generated in the background that exposes the fields from the **Customer Card** page. This web service includes all page fields defined on the **Customer Card** page, while table fields are only exposed if they correspond to a page field or are part of the primary key.

When an extension is installed that extends the **Customer Card** page, the fields added by the extension are also exposed in the web service. While extensions can't create page fields with the same names as those fields already existing on the **Customer Card** page, conflicts can still arise when multiple extensions add fields with identical names.

For example, suppose the following extension, referred to as _A_, is installed:

```AL
using Microsoft.Sales.Customer;

// Extension A
pageextension 50101 CustomerCardExtA extends "Customer Card"
{
    layout
    {
        addLast(General)
        {
            field("ShoeSize"; Rec.ShoeSize)
            {
                ApplicationArea = ALL;
                Caption = 'ShoeSize';
            }
        }
    }
}

tableextension 50101 CustomerTableExtension extends Customer
{
    fields
    {
        field(50100; ShoeSize; Integer) { }
    }
}
```

Now, consider that another extension, referred to as _B_, is installed, which also modifies the **Customer Card** page:

```AL
using Microsoft.Sales.Customer;

// Extension B
pageextension 50102 CustomerCardExtB extends "Customer Card"
{
    layout
    {
        addLast(General)
        {
            field("ShoeSize"; Rec.ShoeSizeField)
            {
                ApplicationArea = ALL;
                Caption = 'ShoeSize';
            }
        }
    }
}

tableextension 50102 CustomerTableExtension extends Customer
{
    fields
    {
        field(50105; ShoeSizeField; Integer) { }
    }
}
```

In this scenario, both extensions A and B add a page field named `ShoeSize` to the **Customer Card** page. This condition results in a conflict, which leads to a metadata generation failure for the **Customer Card** page.

To resolve this issue, you need access to the code of at least one of the extensions, and then to modify the conflicting page field names to avoid collisions.

## Deploy the Excel add-in for Business Central online

For [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, the administrator can deploy the add-in for all users. But users can also install the add-in themselves, provided they have permission to configure their Office experience.  

> [!TIP]
> In some organizations, administrators cannot deploy add-ins centrally. For more information, see [Determine if Centralized Deployment of add-ins works for your organization](/microsoft-365/admin/manage/centralized-deployment-of-add-ins?view=o365-worldwide&preserve-view=true).

### To deploy the Excel add-in for all users

1. As the administrator, sign in to the Microsoft commercial website and find the add-in at [https://appsource.microsoft.com/product/office/WA104379629](https://appsource.microsoft.com/product/office/WA104379629).
2. Choose the **Get it now** button.

# Use pre-closing reports

There are many standard reports that you can use to verify the accuracy of the accounts before closing the books at the end of a year or period. For example, you can use the **Customer - Trial Balance** report to verify that the balance for a customer posting group is equal to the balance on the corresponding general ledger account on a certain date.

The following table describes a number of reports that might be useful in this process.

| To | See this report |
| --- | --- |
| Print a detailed trial balance report for one or more bank accounts with additional information about individual entries. |Bank Acc. - Detail Trial Bal. |
| Print a detail trial balance for selected customers. |Customer - Trial Balance |
| Print a detail trial balance with detailed information about individual entries, for selected customers during a selected period. |Customer - Detail Trial Bal. |
| Print a detail trial balance for selected vendors. |Vendor - Trial Balance |
| Print a detail trial balance with detailed information about individual entries, for selected vendors during a selected period. |Vendor - Detail Trial Balance |
| Print a trial balance with the current year's and the previous year's figures. | Closing Trial Balance |
| Print a detailed trial balance report for general ledger account balances. |Detail Trial Balance |
| Print a trial balance report with balances and net changes for general ledger accounts. |Trial Balance |
| Print a trial balance for a consolidated company. |Consolidated Trial Balance |

To see a report, choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, type the name as it appears in the table, and then choose the related link.

# Sales

You create a sales invoice or sales order to record your agreement with a customer to sell certain products on certain delivery and payment terms.

You must use sales orders if your sales process requires you to ship parts of an order quantity, for example, because the full quantity isn't available right away. If you sell items by delivering directly from your vendor to your customer, as a drop shipment, then you must also use sales orders. In all other respects, sales orders work the same way as sales invoices. With sales orders, you can also use the order promising functionality to communicate certain delivery dates to your customers.  

You can negotiate with the customer by first creating a sales quote, which you can convert to a sales invoice or sales order when you agree on the sale. After the customer confirms the agreement, you can send an order confirmation to record your obligation to deliver the products as agreed.

You can easily correct or cancel a posted sales invoice before the customer pays it. For example, to correct a typing mistake or if the customer requests a change early in the order process. If the posted sales invoice is paid, then you must create a sales credit memo or a sales return order to reverse the sale.

Good sales and marketing practices are all about how to make the best decisions at the right time. Marketing functionality in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides a precise and timely overview of your contact information so you can serve your prospective customers more efficiently and increase customer satisfaction. Learn more at [Relationship Management](marketing-relationship-management.md).

If you use Microsoft Dynamics 365 Sales for customer engagement, you can enjoy seamless integration in the lead-to-cash process by using [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] for backend activities. For example, to process orders, manage inventory, and do your finances. Learn more at [Use Dynamics 365 Sales from Business Central](marketing-integrate-dynamicscrm.md).

In business environments where the customer must pay before products are delivered, such as in retail, you must wait for the receipt of payment before you deliver the products. In most cases, you process incoming payments some weeks after delivery by applying the payments to their related posted, unpaid sales invoices. Learn more at [Reconcile Payments Using Automatic Application](receivables-how-reconcile-payments-auto-application.md).

Sales documents can be sent as PDF files attached to email. The email body contains an extract of the sales document, such as products, total amount, and a link to the PayPal site. Learn more at [Send Documents by Email](ui-how-send-documents-email.md).

For all sales processes, you can incorporate an approval workflow. For example, an approval workflow can require that a manager approves large sales to certain customers. Learn more at [Use Workflows](across-use-workflows.md).

The following sections describe a sequence of tasks, with links to the articles that cover them.

# Manage Work across Multiple Companies in the Company Hub

[!INCLUDE[azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id](~/../shared-content/shared/azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id.md)]

Some people work in multiple companies in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], and some also work in more than one organization, such as external accountants, or employees and managers of corporations with multiple subsidiaries. For these users, and many others, the company hub serves as a landing page that gives a financial overview across companies and environments. It provides users with a tool for managing work across the various environments that they work in, across companies, environments, and regions.  

You can access the company hub by switching to the **Company Hub** role in My Settings, or by opening the **Company Hub** page directly. You can do the same work in both places, but actions are placed slightly different in menus.  

[![Shows the company hub page that lists all companies.](media/company-hub.png)](media/company-hub.png#lightbox)  

> [!NOTE]
> You can connect the company hub to as many companies as you need. However, you can only connect the company hub to companies that are hosted in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online.

## Company hub home page

If you use the **Company Hub** role, your home page shows a list of companies that you have access to, including information about key point of interest (KPI) data, and links to open each company. <!--You can customize the dashboard to show the data points that you want to see by adding or removing columns. For example, you might want to see taxes that are due, how many open sales documents each company has, or the number of purchase invoices that are due next week. You can configure the view to suit your needs. If you have added many companies, you can use filters to sort your view.--> Choose the **Company Hub** action to open the company hub, where you can work more closely with each company.  

> [!TIP]
> To access a specific company in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], choose the name of the company, or choose the **Go To Company** menu item - you are logged in automatically in a new browser tab.

:::image type="content" source="media/company-hub-company-list-actions.png" alt-text="Actions for a company that is listed in the company hub.":::

You can add new companies, such as when you get a new client, or when your corporation adds a new subsidiary. For more information, see [Add Companies to Your Company Hub](company-hub-add-company.md).  

> [!TIP]
> In order to refresh the data in the company hub, you must have access to the data in the companies that the data comes from.

<!--## Company details

In the **Company Hub** page, you can see more information about each company by choosing the name of the company that you want to learn more about. This opens the **Company Details** pane, where you can see additional information, such as the following:  

* Cash account balances  
* Cash flow forecast  
* Overdue purchase invoices  
* Overdue sales invoices  

> [!TIP]
> You can launch predefined Excel workbooks from the **Reports** tab in the ribbon. These Excel workbooks are designed as ready-to-print key financial statements and reports, but you can also modify them to fit your needs. For more information, see [Analyzing Financial Statements in Microsoft Excel](finance-analyze-excel.md).  

Otherwise, close the details pane and continue to the next company.  -->

## Assigned tasks

In [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can assign tasks to yourself and others, and others can assign tasks to you. The company hub gives you an overview of assigned tasks for each company, and you can also access a list of all assigned tasks by choosing **My User Tasks** on the **Home** page.  

<!--In the client company, you also have cues that call out tasks assigned to you in this particular client.  -->

### My user tasks

The **My User Tasks** list helps you prioritize your day by showing more information about tasks assigned to you across all your companies.  

You can sort by due date, for example, or any other type of data that helps you prioritize your day. By default, the list shows all tasks that are assigned to you, but you can set up filters to only show tasks that are marked as high priority, for example.  

To pick up a task, choose it from the list of pending user tasks. In the ribbon, the link **Go to Task Item** opens the page where you can do the work.  

When you have completed a task, mark it as completed.  

For more information about companies and environments, see [Environment links](company-hub-add-company.md#environment-links).  

## Access the company hub

[!INCLUDE [2023rw1-sec-group-short](includes/2023rw1-sec-group-short.md)]

In order to access the company hub, you must have access through either the *D365 COMPANY HUB* user group or through the *D365 COMPANY HUB*  permission set. You must also have access to the companies that are listed in your company hub, which means that you must be a user in those companies. For more information, see [Create Users According to Licenses](ui-how-users-permissions.md).  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The company hub is a company-wide list, so any user who is granted access to the company hub will be able to see all companies in their own [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] tenant, and all KPIs for the companies that they have access to.

If you cannot find the company hub, and you know that you have been granted access to it, then check with your administrator if the company hub is listed in the **Extension Management** page. For more information, see [Customizing Business Central Using Extensions](ui-extensions.md).  

## Set up the company hub

To start using the company hub, you must add one or more companies to your dashboard. For more information, see [Add Companies to Your Company Hub](company-hub-add-company.md).  

But to add a company, you must have been given access to one or more instances of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in addition to the company that you use the company hub in.  

For example, if you are an accountant, your clients can invite you to their [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For more information, see [Inviting Your External Accountant to Your Business Central](finance-accounting.md#inviteaccountant).  

Administrators can use the same assisted setup guide to add you to their [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], or they can add you to the relevant Microsoft Entra account in the Microsoft 365 admin center. For more information, see [Manage users and groups](/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/?view=o365-worldwide&preserve-view=true).

# Use Allocation Keys in General Journals
You can allocate an entry in a general journal to several different accounts when you post the journal. The allocation can be made by quantity, percentage, or amount.

## To set up allocation keys
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Recurring General Journal**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **Batch Name** field to open the **General Journal Batches** page.
3. You can either modify allocations on an existing batch in the list or create a new batch with allocations.
   * To create a new batch, choose the **New** action, and go to the next step.
   * To change the allocations of an existing journal, select the journal and go to step 7.    
4. In the **Name** field, enter a name for the batch, such as CLEANING. In the **Description** field, enter a description, such as Cleaning Expenses Journal.
5. When you are done, close the page. A new, empty recurring journal opens.
6. Fill in the fields on the line.
7. Choose the **Allocations** action.
8. Add a line for each allocation. You must fill in either the **Allocation %**, **Allocation Quantity**, or **Amount** field. You must also fill in the **Account No.** field and, if you are allocating the transaction among global dimensions, the global dimension fields.
9. If you enter a percentage on a line, the amount in the **Amount** field is calculated automatically. These amounts have the opposite sign from the total amount in the **Amount** field in the recurring journal.
10. After entering the allocations lines, choose **OK** to return to the **Recurring General Journal** page. The **Allocated Amt. (USD)** field is filled in and matches the **Amount** field.
11. Post the journal.

## To change an allocation key that has already been set up
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Recurring General Journal**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Recurring General Journal** page, select the journal with the allocation.

# Liabilities (Power BI report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Liabilities** report provides an overview of your company's financial obligations, highlighting total liabilities, current liabilities, payroll liabilities, and long-term liabilities. It also shows key performance indicators such as debt ratio and dept-to-equity ratio, along with total assets.

These key performance indicators can help you understand the balance between debt and equity while monitoring liabilities that affect future cash flow and operational flexibility.

Drill through into the **Liabilities Drill-Through** page to explore the underlying ledger entries that make up the balance.

:::image type="content" source="media/finance/liabilities-report.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Liabilities report" lightbox="media/finance/liabilities-report.png":::

## Use the report

The audiences for the report are:

- Executives
- Directors
- Other high-level decision makers

Executives can use the report to evaluate your company's financial position before engaging in a new expansive initiative. By first analyzing current liabilities, you can gauge your immediate debt burden. This analysis helps you determine whether there are enough liquid assets to meet short term obligations, and ensure you have cash-flow to support existing operations and new development.

Next, you could assess the debt ratio and debt-to-equity ratios. These key performance indicators provide insight into the company's leverage and risk profile. For example, a high debt-to-equity ratio could indicate that the company has a high reliance on borrowed funds. This type of data can help inform how you decide to finance the expansion project.  

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The *Liabilities* report includes the following KPIs and measures: 

- [**Liabilities**](finance-powerbi-kpis.md#liabilities)
- [**Current Liabilities**](finance-powerbi-kpis.md#current-liabilities)
- [**Payroll Liabilities**](finance-powerbi-kpis.md#payroll-liabilities)
- [**Longterm Liabilities**](finance-powerbi-kpis.md#longterm-liabilities)
- [**Debt Ratio**](finance-powerbi-kpis.md#debt-ratio)
- [**Debt/Equity Ratio**](finance-powerbi-kpis.md#debtequity-ratio)
- [**Assets**](finance-powerbi-kpis.md#assets)
- [**Balance at Date (Neg)**](finance-powerbi-kpis.md#balance-at-date-neg)

[!INCLUDE[click-on-a-kpi-link](includes/click-on-a-kpi-link.md)] 

[!INCLUDE[powerbi-tip-track-kpis](includes/powerbi-tip-track-kpis.md)]

## Data used in the report

The report uses data from the following tables in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]:

- G/L Entry
- G/L Accounts
- G/L Account Categories

# Set Up Shipping Agents
You can set up a code for each of your shipping agents and enter information about them.  

If you enter an Internet address for the shipping agent, and the agent provides package tracking services on the Internet, you can use the automatic package tracking feature. For more information, see [Track Packages](sales-how-track-packages.md).

When you set up shipping agents on your sales orders, you can also specify the services that each shipping agent offers.  
For each shipping agent, you can set up an unlimited number of services, and you can specify a shipping time for each service.  

When you have assigned a shipping agent service to a sales order line, the shipping time of the service will be included in the order promising calculation, for that line. For more information, see [Calculate Order Promising Dates](sales-how-to-calculate-order-promising-dates.md).

## To set up a shipping agent  
1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Shipping Agents**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)].  
3.  Choose the **Shipping Agent Services** action.
4. In the **Shipping Agent Services**, fill in the fields as necessary.

> [!NOTE]  
>  If you delete the shipping agent on the order line, the shipping agent service code is also deleted. The contents of fields that were based in part on the shipping agent service are recalculated.

# Set up the E-Documents connector with external endpoints

This article explains how to set up E-Documents functionality when connected to external endpoints.

Before you use the functionality that this article describes, you must install the **E-Document Core** app and one of the E-Documents connectors with external endpoints apps. You can use these apps for default integration with the external, non-Microsoft, access points to automate the e-document flow. Because these apps represent only some of the selected connectors, you aren't limited to existing integrations.

## Install an E-Documents connector  

To install an E-Documents connector, follow these steps:

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **E-Document Services**, and then select the related link.
2. Choose the **Install E-Documents integration from AppSource** action to open the **Microsoft AppSource apps** page.
3. Choose the connector you want, and then select the **View on AppSource** action.
4. Install the app from the AppSource.

## Set up the connection

[!INCLUDE[e-documents connectors](includes/edocuments-connectors-include.md)]

Based on the endpoint service provider, the next steps might be different. You can find details about set up parameters for all available service providers [here](finance-edocuments-connectors.md).

## Set up company information

Before you start using e-documents, update your **Company Information** page by completing the following steps:

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Company Information**, and then select the related link.
2. In addition to filling in the usual fields, you must also fill in the following fields:

    | Field name | Description |
    |---|---|
    | SWIFT Code | Specify the SWIFT code (international bank identifier code) of your primary bank. |
    | Bank Branch No. | Specify the bank's four-digit branch number. |
    | VAT Registration No. | Specify the company's value-added tax (VAT) registration number. |

3. Close the page.

## Set up customers to receive e-documents

To enable customers to receive your e-documents, complete the following steps:

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customers**, and then select the related link.
2. Open the **Customer** card.
3. In addition to filling in the usual fields, in the **GLN** field, specify the customer you send electronic documents to.
4. Turn on the **Use GLN in Electronic Documents** toggle to indicate whether to use the global location number (GLN) as an identification number in electronic documents.
5. Close the page.

## Other setup

Before you start to work with e-documents, set up the e-document **workflows** and **document sending profiles** to use your workflows. After the service connection is established, you can start to use your e-document solution.

## Available service providers

Microsoft wants to encourage access point providers to add their connectors on top of our **E-Document Core** app.

The following list of access point providers are covered by default:  

- Avalara
- B2BRouter
- Logiq
- Pagero
- SignUp

Microsoft has no contractual obligations with these providers. Therefore, you must make a contract with them to get the necessary credentials. The services might require extra licensing or payments for their services.

# Sell Items Assembled to Order

Items that are set up for assemble-to-order aren't expected to be in inventory and will be assembled when it's included on a sales order. An item is set up for assemble-to-order when the **Assembly Policy** field on the item card contains **Assemble-to-Order**. When you enter the item on a sales order line, an assembly order is automatically created and linked to the sales order.  

> [!NOTE]  
> If assemble-to-order items are already in inventory, you can deduct that quantity from the assembly order and reserve it from inventory. Learn more at [Sell Inventory Items in Assemble-to-Order Flows](assembly-how-to-sell-assemble-to-order-items-and-inventory-items-together.md).  

In this procedure, you process the sale of an item that will be assembled according to specifications that are requested by the customer. The steps include: 

* Creating a sales order line.
* Customizing the assembly item by editing its components and resources.
* Checking availability to establish a delivery date.
* Releasing the sales order to be assembled and immediately shipped.  

> [!NOTE]  
> The following procedure does not include the steps for creating a standard sales order that happen before the step where you enter the assemble-to-order item on a sales order line. Learn more about creating sales orders at [Sell Products with a Customer Sales Order](sales-how-sell-products.md).  

## To sell an item that is assembled to order

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Create a sales order. 
3. In the **No.** field, enter an item that is set up to be assembled to order.  
4. In the **Location Code** field, define which location the item will be sold from. The assembly process will occur at that location.  
5. In the **Quantity** field, enter how many units to sell.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  If one or more components of the requested assembly item quantity aren't available, an availability warning page opens. <!-- Check whether the field help would be useful. For more information, see Assembly Availability.  -->

    An assembly order is created and linked to the sales order line. The due date of the assembly order is the shipment date of the sales order line.  

    The quantity to sell is copied to the **Qty. to Assemble to Order** field, which indicates that the item setup expects you'll assemble the full quantity on the sales line. You can decrease the quantity to assemble, for example, if you know that some items are already available. Learn more at [Sell Inventory Items in Assemble-to-Order Flows](assembly-how-to-sell-inventory-items-in-assemble-to-order-flows.md).  

6. If the customer wants an additional item in a kit, on the **Lines** FastTab, choose the **Line** action, choose the **Assemble to Order** action, and then choose the **Assemble-to-Order Lines** action to view and change the standard assembly components. Alternatively, choose the **Qty. to Assemble to Order** field.  
7. On the **Assemble-to-Order Lines** page, create a new line of type **Item** for the additional assembly component.  

    You can also customize the order by increasing the quantity of one standard item in the kit. You can do this by increasing the value in the **Quantity Per** field on the specific assembly order line.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  The **Assemble-to-Order Lines** page only contains the basic fields for customizing the component list, adding item tracking numbers, or solving component availability issues. To add more assembly order information, such as the assembly order starting date, choose the **Show Documents** action. This opens a full view of the assembly order that is linked to the sales order line. You can't change the contents of most fields on the assembly order header, and you can't post assembly output from it. You must post the shipment of the sales order line.  
    >
    >  On the linked assembly orders, only the **Starting Date** field can be changed. Changing the starting date lets assembly workers specify that they're starting assembly earlier than the due date. All fields on the lines of the linked assembly order can be changed so that warehouse workers can enter consumption figures during the process.  

8. Review or react to component availability issues. For example, select a substitute item.  
9. Close the **Assemble-to-Order Lines** page. The linked assembly order is ready, and workers can start to assemble the customized items.  
10. On the sales order, choose the **Release** action to notify the assembly department that the assembly process can start. Learn more at [Assemble Items](assembly-how-to-assemble-items.md).  

> [!NOTE]  
> Item substitutions don't automatically replace an item with another item, for example, when creating a sales order or in a BOM. Instead, you'll be alerted to the fact that a substitution is available.

# Design Details: Posting Engine Structure
Posting interface and some other functions in codeunit 12 use posting engine functions to prepare and insert general ledger entry and VAT entry records. The posting engine is also responsible for general ledger register creation.  
  
 The functions in the following table provide a standard framework for designing posting procedures (such as Code, CustPostApplyCustledgEntry, VendPostApplyVendLedgEntry, UnapplyCustLedgEntry, UnapplyVendLedgEntry, and Reverse) and exclusive access to table 17, G/L Entry.  
  
|Routine|Description|  
|-------------|---------------------------------------|  
|StartPosting|Initializes posting buffer TempGLEntryBuf, locks G/L Entry and VAT Entry tables, and initializes Accounting Period, G/L Register, and Exchange Rate. Should be called only once, then NextEntryNo is 0.|  
|ContinuePosting|Checks and posts unrealized VAT for previous transaction increment NextTransactionNo and prepares post of next line.|  
|FinishPosting|Completes posting by inserting G/L entries from temporary buffer into database table. Always used together with StartPosting. Checks for inconsistencies.|  
|InitGLEntry|Used to initialize new G/L entry for Gen. Jnl Line. Returns GLEntry as parameter.|  
|InitGLEntryVAT|Same as InitGLEntry, but also assigns Bal. Account No. and SummarizeVAT.|  
|InitGLEntryVATCopy|Similar to InitGLEntryVAT, but also copies posting groups data from VAT Entry before SummarizeVAT.|  
|InsertGLEntry|The only function that inserts G/L entry into global TempGLEntryBuf table. Always use this function for insert.|  
|CreateGLEntry|Performs an InitGLEntry, assigns Additional Currency Amount, and then performs InsertGLEntry. Replaces several lines of code with a single function call.|  
|CreateGLEntryBalAcc|Same as CreateGLEntry, but also assigns Bal. Account Type and Bal. Account No.|  
|CreateGLEntryVAT|Same as CreateGLEntry, but with additional processing for posting groups and saving to temporary VAT buffer:<br /><br /> `GLEntry.CopyPostingGroupsFromDtldCVBuf(DtldCVLedgEntryBuf,GenJnlLine."Gen. Posting Type");`<br /><br /> `InsertVATEntriesFromTemp(DtldCVLedgEntryBuf,GLEntry);`|  
|CreateGLEntryVATCollectAdj|Same as CreateGLEntry, but with additional collection of adjustments and saving to temporary VAT buffer:<br /><br /> `CollectAdjustment(AdjAmount,GLEntry.Amount,GLEntry."Additional-Currency Amount",OriginalDateSet);`<br /><br /> `InsertVATEntriesFromTemp(DtldCVLedgEntryBuf,GLEntry);`|  
|CreateGLEntryFromVATEntry|Same as CreateGLEntry, but also copies posting groups from VAT entry.|

# Send documents and emails

You can easily share information and documents, such as sales and purchase orders and invoices, by email directly from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], without having to open an email app.  

You can send almost all types of documents as PDF attachments. Alternatively, you can set up a report layout that includes information from the document in the email text, along with text that makes the email more friendly, for example, a standard greeting. For more information, see [Managing Report and Document Layouts](ui-manage-report-layouts.md).

When you send invoices, you can make it easier for customers to make payments through a payment service, such as PayPal, by automatically adding information and a link to the service in the email. For more information, see [Enable Customer Payments Through Payment Services](sales-how-enable-payment-service-extensions.md).

To enable emails from within [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], start the **Set Up Email** assisted setup guide. For more information, see [Set Up Email](admin-how-setup-email.md).

> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports only outbound email communications. You cannot also receive replies from within the app.

## To send documents by email

This procedure describes how attach a posted sales invoice to an email as a PDF file, and with document-specific email text. The steps are the same for other documents.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Posted Sales Invoices**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the invoice, choose the **Print/Send** action, and then choose **Send by Email**.
3. In the **Email** field, choose **Yes (Prompt for Settings)**. For more information, see [Set Up Document Sending Profiles](sales-how-setup-document-send-profiles.md).

    If the **Email** field on the **Send Document to** page is set to **Yes (Prompt for Settings)**, then the **Send Email** page opens pre-filled with the contact person in the **To:** field and the document attached as a PDF file. In the **Body** field, you can either enter text manually or you can have the field filled with a document-specific email body that you have set up.

4. Choose the **OK** button.
5. In the **To:** field, enter a valid email address. The default value is the customer email address.
6. In the **Subject** field, enter a descriptive subject text. The default value is the customer name and invoice number.
7. In the **Attachment** field, the generated invoice is attached by default as a PDF file.
8. In the **Body** field, enter a short message to the recipient.

    If a document-specific email text is set up on the **Report Selection - Sales** page, the **Body** field is filled in automatically. For more information, see [Set Up Reusable Email Texts and Layouts](admin-how-setup-email.md#set-up-reusable-email-texts-and-layouts).
9. Choose the **OK** button to send the email message.

> [!NOTE]  
> If you do not want to specify email settings each time you email a document, you can select the **Yes (Use Default Settings)** option in the **Email** field on the **Send Document to** page. In that case, the **Send Email** page will not open. See Step 4. For more information, see [Set Up Document Sending Profiles](sales-how-setup-document-send-profiles.md).  

## To compose and send an email

You can quickly compose emails for contacts, customers, vendors, salespeople/purchasers, and bank accounts directly from the pages for those entities. Just choose **Process**, and then **Send Email** to open the email editor. For bank accounts, the **Send Email** action is under **Actions**.

> [!TIP]
> If you often send email messages that are similar in nature, or want to send a bulk communication, for example, to advertise a sales campaign, using Word templates with email can speed up the process. You can create a template for an entities such as customers, vendors, and contacts, that will generate the content of an email message for you, and even personalize the content for the recipient based on data in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For more information, see [Use Word Templates for Bulk Communication](ui-mail-merge.md).  

### Attach a document to an email

There are several ways to attach documents to emails.

If you're assigned to an email scenario related to the entity you're sending the email to, or the document you're sending, an attachment might be automatically added to your message. That's because a default attachment has been assigned to the email scenario. You can delete the attachment if you don't want to send it with your message. For more information, see [Assign Email Scenarios to Email Accounts](admin-how-setup-email.md#assign-email-scenarios-to-email-accounts). 

To attach a file yourself, in the email editor, use the following actions:

* Choose **Add file** to select a file.
* Choose **Add files from default selection** to manually add a file that's associated with the email scenario.
* Choose **Add file from source document** to choose a file that's attached to the document you're working with. The files are either attached to the document itself, or one or more of its lines.

## Documents marked as printed when they are sent

Some documents in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] have a field that specifies how many times the document has been printed. The number in that field <!--"that field?" need a name...--> is also updated if you send the document by email because a PDF file is generated for it. The number is updated even if you don't send the email. <!--guessing this is because emails are technically reports, so the counter bumps up whenever someone creates an email. Need to verify.-->

## Sent emails and your email outbox

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] stores the emails that you send on the **Sent Items** page. That's to let you resend emails, or forward them to someone else. If you can't find an email in your sent items, look for it on the **Email Outbox** page. 

> [!NOTE]
> Depending on the extension that your company uses for email, administrators can see a list of messages that everyone has sent, but not the content of the messages

The **Email Outbox** is where you'll find the emails that you saved as drafts, and emails that failed to send, for example, if the email address was invalid. For messages that failed to send, you can choose **Show Error** or **Investigate Error** to troubleshoot the problem.

# Work with catalog items

Catalog items are items that you don't manage in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] until you sell them. When you use the **Select Catalog Item** action to add a catalog item to a line on a sales order, quote, or blanket sales order, the catalog item is converted to a regular item.

> [!NOTE]  
> You can't select a catalog item from the **Sales Invoice** page.

A catalog item typically has the item number of the vendor who supplies it. Before you can convert a catalog item to a normal item, you must specify how to convert vendor item numbers to your item numbering. To learn more about item numbering, go to [Specify how catalog item numbers are converted to your own numbering](#specify-how-catalog-item-numbers-are-converted-to-your-own-numbering).  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Catalog items are not to be mistaken with non-inventory items, which are regular items that are given the type **Non-Inventory** to keep them out of availability and costing calculations, for example, because they are only used internally and have a low cost. To learn move about non-inventory items, go to [About Item Types](inventory-about-item-types.md).

## Create a catalog item

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Catalog Items**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Catalog Items** page, choose the **New** action.
3. On the **Catalog Item Card** page, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

## Specify how catalog item numbers are converted to your own numbering

Before you can convert a catalog item to a regular item, you must specify how to convert vendor item numbers to the structure you use for item numbers.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Catalog Item Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. In the **No. Format** field, choose the option you prefer.

## Convert a catalog item to a normal item

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Catalog Items**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the card for a catalog item that you want to convert to a normal item.
3. On the **Catalog Item Card** page, choose the **Create Item** action.

A new item card prefilled with information from the catalog item and an item template is created. You can edit the information about the new item if needed. To learn more about creating items, go to [Register New Items](inventory-how-register-new-items.md).

> [!NOTE]  
> An item reference is automatically created between the vendor's item number and your new item number. To learn more about item references, go to [Use Item References](inventory-how-use-item-cross-refs.md).

## To sell a catalog item and convert it to a normal item

The following process uses a sales order, but the steps are the same for blanket sales orders and quotes.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Orders**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action. Fill in the fields on the **General** FastTab as for any sales order. For more information, see [Sell Products](sales-how-sell-products.md).
3. On a new sales line, in the **Type** field, select **Item**, but leave the **No.** field empty.
4. Choose the **Line** action, and then choose the **Select Catalog Items** action.
5. On the **Catalog Items** page, select the catalog item that you want to sell, and then choose the **OK** button.
   The catalog item automatically converts to a normal item, and the new normal item is selected on the sales line.
6. When the sales order is complete, choose the **Post** action.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you change you mind and delete the sales line, the automatically created item is also deleted. Deleting the item helps reduce clutter in you list of items.
>
> The item is also deleted if you convert the item manually, or make changes such as adding new units of measure or updating prices or cost. However, the item won't be deleted if it's already used in sales or purchase lines, assembly BOMs, or has ledger entries.

# OneDrive in Business Central FAQ

[!INCLUDE [online_only](includes/online_only.md)]

This article answers common questions about using OneDrive for Business with [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## Does this work with all [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] clients?

Yes. You can open files in OneDrive from the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] mobile apps, when viewing card details in Microsoft Teams, or even from the Outlook add-in.  

## Is OneDrive the same as SharePoint for storing files?

No. OneDrive is private by default, allowing you to organize and share content, while SharePoint offers a shared file repository for your organization. Additionally, OneDrive is included in your Microsoft 365 subscription.

## Does [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] support consumer OneDrive?

No. This integration is exclusively intended for OneDrive for Business and only supports your work account. 

## Are all OneDrive for Business plans supported?

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't support standalone OneDrive for Business plans. OneDrive must be part of a Microsoft 365 business or enterprise plan. Learn more at [Compare OneDrive plans](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/onedrive/compare-onedrive-plans?market=af&activetab=tab:primaryr2).

## Where can I see OneDrive service health?

Administrators can access the Service health dashboard in the Microsoft 365 admin center. The dashboard includes OneDrive's service availability. Visit the [Service health dashboard](https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/Home?#/servicehealth).

## Is OneDrive integration available to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on premises?

Yes, but unlike [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, it does require more setup. Learn more in [Configuring Business Central on-premises](admin-onedrive-integration-onpremises.md).  

## Does [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on premises connect with SharePoint Server?

No. This deployment combination isn't supported, even if SharePoint Server is enabled with My Sites.  

## Does [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online connect with SharePoint Server?

No. This deployment combination isn't supported, even if SharePoint Server is enabled with My Sites.  

## How does this work in an organization with multiple environments?

The integration assumes that company names are unique across [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] environments. When company names are unique across the organization, opening a file in OneDrive will copy the file to a folder named after the current company. If company names aren't unique across environments, files from identical company names might be placed together in the same folder.  

## We changed the company name. What happens to my previous files?

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't automatically migrate files you opened earlier in OneDrive to the new folder. After you rename your company, the Open in OneDrive action will copy files to a folder that has the new company name.   

## When I want to attach a file in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], how do I pick a file from OneDrive?

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't provide a cloud file picker. You must download the file from OneDrive to your device, and then upload it to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. 

## I want to open files in SharePoint instead. How do I do this?

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't provide features to copy files to SharePoint and open them from a SharePoint library. Contact your Microsoft partner to understand your options, or search for apps on AppSource.  

## How do I turn off integration to OneDrive?

Run the **OneDrive Setup** assisted setup guide and turn off the **Use OneDrive for app features** and **Use OneDrive for system features** switches.

## Should I use the SharePoint Connection Setup page to connect to SharePoint?

> **APPLIES TO:** Business Central on-premises, version 21 and 22

This page is a legacy feature where all [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] files from all users are sent to a single SharePoint folder. We recommend that you don't configure the Shared Documents FastTab on the **SharePoint Connection Setup** page because this page is [deprecated](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/upgrade/deprecated-features-w1#microsoft-sharepoint-connection-setup) and removed in 2023 release wave 2, version 23.0. We recommend that you use the **OneDrive Setup** instead.  

## Which version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports OneDrive?

Integration with OneDrive became available in 2021 release wave 2.  

## <a name="features"></a>Which features are affected by OneDrive integration?

In the **OneDrive Setup** assisted setup guide for setting up OneDrive integration, you can turn on or off features for handling Business Central files in OneDrive. The features are divided between two options:

|Option|Description|
|------|----------|
|**Use for app features**|If you turn on this option, the **Open in OneDrive** and **Share** actions are made available on files in Business Central, like files attached to documents or in the report inbox. These actions let users copy, open, and share files in OneDrive. Learn more in [Opening and Sharing Business Central Files in OneDrive](across-share-onedrive.md).
|**Use for system features**|Turning on this option activates the following features:<ul><li> The **Open in Excel** and **Edit in Excel** actions on list pages automatically copy the Excel file to OneDrive, then open it in Excel Online. Learn more in [Viewing and Editing in Excel](across-work-with-excel.md).</li><li> Sending a report to an Excel or Word file automatically copies the file to OneDrive, then opens it in the Excel or Word online. Learn more in [Saving a report to a file](ui-work-report.md#save-a-report-to-a-file).|

## Will Microsoft continue to improve the integration to OneDrive?

At Microsoft, we're constantly listening to feedback from our diverse user community and acting upon the top suggestions. To learn about what's next for integrations with Microsoft 365 apps, see the [Dynamics 365 release plan](/dynamics365-release-plan/2021wave1).  

If you want to participate in improving OneDrive integration, or have an idea that would improve file sharing and collaboration in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], add an idea or vote for existing ideas at [https://aka.ms/BusinessCentralIdeas](https://aka.ms/BusinessCentralIdeas).

## Does OneDrive work for guest users and delegated admins?

OneDrive features don't work when you're signed in to Business Central as a guest user. For example, if you select **Open in OneDrive** or **Share** on a file, you get the message "Could not connect to your OneDrive for Business."

If you're signed in as a delegated admin, files are downloaded instead of connecting to OneDrive.

These limitations apply to all OneDrive-based features in Business Central, including file sharing, opening, or editing.

## Troubleshooting

This section provides information about how to identify and fix problems you might experience when using OneDrive with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

### Business Central can't find my OneDrive

When this message displays, "Could not determine the location of your OneDrive for Business, contact your partner to set this up.", check whether the user accessed their OneDrive at least one time. If they haven't, ask the person to visit [https://portal.office.com/onedrive](https://portal.office.com/onedrive) to set it up. This step can take a while. If the message still displays after 24 hours, contact Support.  

### I'm having problems sharing from Outlook

Learn more at [Can't share OneDrive files from Outlook.com](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/can-t-share-onedrive-files-from-outlook-com-05d4cb21-40a2-40e3-b111-82cddb82d22f) on Microsoft Support.

### Actions Open in OneDrive and Share are missing

There are a couple things you can check:

- Check that the application features for OneDrive are turned on in the **OneDrive Setup** assisted setup guide. Learn more in [Configure OneDrive using OneDrive Setup](admin-onedrive-integration.md#configure-onedrive-using-onedrive-setup).
- Check that Microsoft OneDrive is set to **Agree** in the **Privacy Notices Status** page. Learn more in [Privacy Notices Status](privacy-notices-status.md).

# Item availability in Sales Order Agent (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]

The **Item Availability** page is part of the Sales Order Agent for checking item availability during the sale order taking process. This article provides a detailed overview of how the **Item Availability** page functions, including configuration and field descriptions.

![Screenshot of item availability page](media/soa-item-availability-page-clip.svg)

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/production-ready-preview-dynamics365.md)]
<!--[!INCLUDE [limited-public-preview](includes/limited-public-preview.md)]-->

## Overview

Admins can set up the Sales Order Agent to select only available items for sales quotes or orders. Learn more in [Set up Sales Order Agent (preview)](sales-order-agent-setup.md).

When this capability is turned on, the Sales Order Agent uses the **Item Availability** page to check an item's availability before adding it the quote or order. If an item isn't available, reviewers are notified by a **Request Assistance** step in the timeline for the task in **Task** tab.

![Screenshot of the Sales Order Agent task tab that shows a request for assistance step about item availability](media/soa-item-availability.png)

As a reviewer, use the **Item Availability** page to verify that items are unavailable. Decide whether to stop the task or let the agent proceed. You can't change items and quantity at this point. If you confirm the step, the agent creates an email to the customer about the unavailable items for your review.

<!--
Here's the general flow:

1. Select **Review** or the **Item Availability** link to open the **Item Availability** page.
1. Verify that the items in question are unavailable. Refer to the next section for details about how the page works.
1. When you're finished reviewing availability, return to the confirmation step in the **Tasks** tab and select **Confirm**.

The agent creates an email about the unavailable items for your review.
-->

## How to check item availability page

Before the agent calculates the availability and prices for requested items, its searches for the customer making the request, retrieves the customer's specific location, and then sets the **Customer No.** and **Location Filter** fields on the **Item Availability** page.

After setting these fields, the agent calculates the availability of each item in the request one at a time. The agent sets the **Date filter** with the customer's requested delivery date, if any, and the **Quantity Filter** to the requested quantity, currently only in the base unit of measure.

As a reviewer, these fields aren't automatically set to the values the agent used. To check availability, set the fields manually based on the customer's request.

For each item, the following fields are calculated:

|Field|Description|
|-|-|
|Requested Quantity Available|Indicates whether the quantity of items requested by the customer, specified by the **Quantity Filter** field, is available. If the **Quantity Filter** is less than or equal to the **Available Quantity (Base UOM)**, the item is available, and the check box is selected. If the **Quantity Filter** field is greater than item isn't available, and the check box is cleared. |
|Available Quantity (Base UOM)|Shows the projected available balance of item quantity on the date specified by the **Date Filter**. Calculated by adding the current item inventory in ledger entries to the items in scheduled receipts (inbound transactions like purchase and transfer orders). Then, subtract the items in gross requirements (outbound transactions like sales, service, and production orders). You can select the value to display the totals for item ledger entries and each receipt type. Then, you can drill down to view the source of these totals.|
|Unit of Measure Code|Shows the item's sales unit of measure code. If the field is empty, the base unit of measure is used.|
|Unit of Measure|The item's sales or base unit of measure description. Learn more in [Set Up Units of Measure](inventory-how-setup-units-of-measure.md).|
|Available Quantity|Shows the available quantity in base unit of measure (UOM) recalculated to the sales unit of measure.|
|Unit Price Including Discount|Shows the items' price including discount calculated for a specified customer on a specified date. Learn more in [Record special sales prices and discounts](sales-how-record-sales-price-discount-payment-agreements.md).|
|Availability Level|Shows the level of the item's availability, such as ***Available** or **Out of Stock**. The value is calculated based on the **Available Quantity (Base UOM)** compared to the **Safety Stock  Quantity** specified on the item or storekeeping unit card. Learn more about safety stock in [Design Details: Balancing supply and demand](design-details-balancing-demand-and-supply.md).|

# Create workflows to connect tasks in business processes

You can create workflows that connect tasks in business processes that are performed by different users. You can include system tasks, such as automatic posting, as steps in workflows that are preceded or followed by user tasks. Requesting and granting approval to create new records are typical workflow steps.  

On the **Workflow** page, create a workflow by listing the steps on the lines. Each step consists of a trigger and a response:

* An event that specifies the conditions that will start the workflow.
* A workflow response that defines what the workflow does.

[!INCLUDE[workflow](includes/workflow.md)]

When you create workflows, you can copy the steps from existing workflows or from workflow templates. Workflow templates are non-editable workflows [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides. The identifiers for workflow templates are prefixed with "MS-", such as in "MS-PIW". Learn more at [Create Workflows from Workflow Templates](across-how-to-create-workflows-from-workflow-templates.md).  

> [!NOTE]  
> All notifications about workflow steps are sent through a job queue. Make sure the job queue reflects your business needs. Learn more at [Use Job Queues to Schedule Tasks](admin-job-queues-schedule-tasks.md).  

:::image type="content" source="media/Workflows/workflow-example.png" alt-text="Illustration of a workflow example.":::

A workflow is divided into three sections:

1. **When Event**  
   This is where the trigger is selected.  
   Examples of a trigger:
   * A master data record is changed
   * A journal line is created
   * An incoming document is created or released
   * Approval of a document is requested
2. **On Condition**  
   The **conditions** are related to the event and allows creating filters to decide on how the workflow continues.
3. **Then Response**  
   The **responses** specify the next steps in the workflow.

The options for events and responses are system-defined. To add new options, you'll need to develop an extension.

## To create a workflow

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Workflows**, then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action. The **Workflow** page opens.  
3. In the **Code** field, enter a maximum of 20 characters to identify the workflow.  
4. To create the workflow from a workflow template, on the **Workflows** page, choose the **New Workflow from Template** action. Learn more at [Create Workflows from Workflow Templates](across-how-to-create-workflows-from-workflow-templates.md).  
5. In the **Description** field, describe the workflow.  
6. In the **Category** field, specify which category the workflow belongs to.  
7. In the **When Event** field, specify the event that must occur to start the workflow step.  

   When you choose the field, the **Workflow Events** page lists all available workflow events.  
8. In the **On Condition** field, specify one or more conditions that must be met before the event in the **When Event** field can occur.  

   When you choose the field, the **Event Conditions** page lists filter fields that can be conditions for the event. You can add new filter fields if you want.  

   If the workflow event is the change of a specific field on a record, use the **Event Conditions** page to select the field and the type of change.  

   1. To specify a field change for the event, on the **Event Conditions** page, in the **Field** field, select the field that changes.  
   2. In the **Operator** field, select either **Decreased**, **Increased**, or **Changed**.  
9. In the **Then Response** field, specify the response that will follow when the workflow event occurs.  

   When you choose the field, the **Workflow Responses** page lists all available workflow responses and response options.  
10. On the **Options for the Selected Response** FastTab, specify options for the workflow response by selecting values in the different fields that appear, as follows:  

    1. To specify options for a workflow response that involves sending a notification, fill the fields as described in the following table.  

    > [!NOTE]
    > These fields vary, depending on the response you've chosen.

       |Field|Description|
       |-----|-----------|
       |**Notify Sender**|Specify whether to notify the approval requestor instead of the approval request recipient. If you select the checkbox, the **Recipient User ID** field is disabled because the requestor of the approval, the sender, will be notified instead. The name of the workflow response changes accordingly, to **Create Notification for &lt;Sender&gt;**. If the checkbox isn't selected, the name of the workflow response is **Create Notification for &lt;User&gt;**.|
       |**Recipient User ID**|Specify the user the notification must be sent to. **Note**: This option is only available for workflow responses with a placeholder for a specific user. For workflow responses without placeholders for users, the notification recipient is typically defined by the **Approval User Setup**.|
       |**Notification Entry Type**|Specify a trigger for the workflow notification. The trigger can be a record change, an approval request, or passed due date.|
       |**Link Target Page**|Specify the page that the link in the notification opens. The page must have the same source table as the record involved.|
       |**Custom Link**|Specify the URL of a link included in the notification in addition to the link to the page.|

    2. To specify options for a workflow response that involves creating an approval request, fill the fields as described in the following table.  

       |Field|Description|  
       |-----|-----------|  
       |**Due Date Formula**|Specify the number of days the approver has to resolve the request. The period starts when the request is sent.|
       |**Delegate After**|Specify if and when an approval request is automatically delegated to the substitute. You can select to automatically delegate one, two, or five days after the date when the approval was requested.|
       |**Approver Type**|Specify who the approver is, according to the setup of approval users and workflow users. When the field is set to **Salesperson/Purchaser**, the user specified in the **Salespers./Purch. Code** field on the **Approval User Setup** page determines the approver. Approval request entries are then created according to the value in the **Approver Limit Type** field. Learn more at [Set Up Approval Users](across-how-to-set-up-workflow-users.md).|
       |**Show Confirmation Message**|Specify whether to show a confirmation message after a user requests an approval.|
       |**Approver Limit Type**|Specify the effect of limits for approvers. An approver's approval limit must be above the value on the request. The following options exist: <ol><li>**Approver Chain** specifies that approval request entries are created for all the requester's approvers up to and including the first qualified approver</li><li>**Direct Approver** specifies that an approval request entry is only created for the requester's immediate approver, regardless of the approver's approval limit.</li><li>**First Qualified Approver** specifies that an approval request entry is only created for the requester's first approver.</li><li>**Specific Approver** specifies that you notify the user chosen in the **Approver ID** field.</li></ol>|

    3. To specify options for a workflow response that involves creating journal lines, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

       |Field|Description|  
       |-----|-----------|  
       |**General Journal Template Name**|Specify the name of the general journal template that the specified journal lines are created in.|  
       |**General Journal Batch Name**|Specify the name of the general journal batch that the specified journal lines are created in.|  

11. Choose the **Increase Indent** and **Decrease Indent** buttons to indent the event name in the **When** field to define the step's position in the workflow.  

    1. Indent the event under the name of the previous step to indicate that it's the next step.  
    2. Indicate the step is one of several alternative steps that may start, depending on its condition, by indenting the event name to match the other alternative steps. Order such optional steps according to priority by placing the most important step first.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  You can only change the indent of a step that doesn't have a subsequent step.  

12. Repeat steps 7 through 11 to add more workflow steps, either before or after the step you've created.  
13. Turn on the **Enabled** toggle to specify that the workflow will start when the event on the first step of type **Entry Point** occurs. Learn more at [Use Workflows](across-use-workflows.md).  

> [!NOTE]  
> Don't enable a workflow until you're sure it's ready.  

> [!TIP]  
> To explore the relations between the tables used in workflows, choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, then enter **Workflow – Table Relations**.  

## Example of creating a new workflow using existing events

The following example creates a workflow to approve a change to the name of a vendor:

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Workflows**, then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action. The **Workflow** page opens.
3. In the workflow section, fill in the fields as described in the following table.

    |Field  |Value  |
    |---------|---------|
    |**Code**|**VENDAPN-01**|
    |**Description**|**Vendor Name Change Approval** |
    |**Category**|**PURCH**|

4. To create the first workflow step, do the following.

    1. In the **When Event** field, specify *A vendor record is changed*.  
    2. In the **On Condition** field, choose the word **Always**. Then, on the **Event Conditions** page, choose the **Add a condition for when a field value changes** link, then select the **Name** field. The result of this step is that the condition reads as *Name is Changed*.  
    3. In the **Then Response** field, choose the **Select Response** link. Then, on the **Workflow Responses** page, in the **Select Response** field, choose the **Revert the value of the \<Field\> field on the record and save the change** response. Then, in the **Options for the Selected Response** section, specify the **Name** field.  
    4. Choose the **Add More Responses** link, then add an entry for the **Create an approval request for the record using approver type <%1> and <%2>** response.  
    5. In the **Options for the Selected Response** section for the new response, change the **Approver type** field to **Workflow User Group**. Then, in the **Workflow User Group** field, specify the user group. Learn more at [Set Up Approval Users](across-how-to-set-up-approval-users.md).  
    6. Add a third response, **Send approval request for the record and create a notification**.  
    7. Add a fourth response, **Show message "%1"**. Then, in the **Options for the Selected Response** section, in the **Message** field, specify **An approval request has been sent**.  
    8. Choose **OK** to return to the workflow step.  

5. In the next line, add a new workflow step for the **An approval request is approved** event.

    1. In the **When Event** field, specify **An approval request is approved**.  
    2. Choose the line menu, then choose **Increase Indent**.  
    3. In the **On Condition** field, choose **Always**. Then, in the **Pending Approvals** field, specify **0**. The condition reads as **Pending Approvals:0** to indicate that the request doesn't require more approvers.  
    4. In the **Then Response** field, choose the **Select Response** link. Then, on the **Workflow Responses** page, in the **Select Response** field, choose the **Send approval request for the record and create a notification** response.  
    5. Choose **OK**.  
6. In the next line, add a second workflow step for the **An approval request is approved** event.  

    1. In the **When Event** field, specify **An approval request is approved**.
    2. In the **On Condition** field, choose **Always**. Then, in the **Pending Approvals** field, specify **>0**. The condition reads as **Pending Approvals:>0** to indicate that this isn't the last approver.  
    3. In the **Then Response** field, choose the **Select Response** link. Then, on the **Workflow Responses** page, in the **Select Response** field, choose the **Send approval request for the record and create a notification** response.  
    4. Choose **OK**.

# Suggest lines on sales documents with Copilot (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]

This article explains how to create sales documents faster by letting Copilot suggest the items to add to lines on sales documents for your customers.

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/production-ready-preview-dynamics365.md)]

## Sales line suggestions

Sales line suggestion can assist with creating lines on sales documents such as sales quotes, orders, and invoices based on structured input or natural language. The feature isn't a general-purpose chat, but a highly specific and integrated experience that you can use on sales documents. The feature offers two distinct skills that help you find data about individual products or entire documents.

- Find products

  Information that describes products is stored in multiple places in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For example, item numbers and descriptions are stored in the **Item** table, multiple barcodes are stored in the **Item Reference** table, and product properties are stored in the **Item Attributes** table. While you might prompt for *Red bicycle*, the actual product might be *Crimson tourer*, where *Bicycle* is a product category and *red* is an attribute.

- Find documents by reference

  People often repeat a previous order, or at least use it as a starting point. But it might be tricky to find the right order in a stack of orders. You might remember some of the order's ID, which can be a company-assigned number or a reference number received from a customer. Being able to use prompts such as *Need last invoice from April* should help you find an order faster.

## Supported languages

[!INCLUDE[copilot-language-support-en-only](includes/copilot-language-support-en-only.md)]

## Prerequisites

- Your administrator activates the **Sales Line Suggestions** capability on the **Copilot & agents capabilities** page. Learn more at [Configure Copilot and agent capabilities](enable-ai.md).

## Examples of prompts

Suggest sales lines with Copilot can handle a wide variety of prompt input. This section offers examples of prompts for various scenarios we tested.

### Sample inquiry to repeat a document

Prompt: *Need all the products from invoice 103031*

### During a phone call, you quickly type a list of required products and quantities, but aren't always exact and sometimes use internal product names

Prompt: *2 Red Kids Biicycle*

The prompt works, even with multiple typos.

### A user copies an inquiry from an inbound communication and pastes it onto the Sales Lines Suggestions page

Prompt: *Hello, I'm interested in buying some accessories for my XXXX Laptop, such as a wireless mouse, a keyboard cover, and a laptop bag. I wonder if you have any recommendations or suggestions for these items. Do you have any special offers or discounts for loyal customers like me? Kind regards, M*

Note that XXXX Laptop isn't included in search.

## Options for matching keywords in prompts

When you search for an item using a FullText index, we extract both primary and extra keywords. For example, we break down the search term "Red Coffee Table" into primary keywords "Coffee" and "Table," and some synonyms and other keywords, such as "Red."

When you enter your prompt in the **Suggest Sales Lines** window, the **Matching** field offers the following options for matching criteria:

- [Permissive](#permissive-matching-criteria) means that all keywords are optional. This option typically generates the most suggestions.
- [Balanced](#balanced-matching-criteria) is a blend of required and optional keywords. This option typically generates fewer suggestions.
- [Precise](#precise-matching-criteria) means that all keywords are required. This option typically generates the fewest suggestions.

The following sections provide examples of how matching works. The examples are based on a prompt for "Red Coffee Table" and you have the following fictitious items:

- Red Coffee Table
- Blue Coffee Table
- Green Coffee Table
- Red Side Table
- Dining Table

### Permissive matching criteria

The primary keywords "Coffee" and "Table" are optional. The extra keyword "Red" is optional. This search returns items such as:

- Red Coffee Table
- Blue Coffee Table
- Green Coffee Table
- Red Side Table
- Dining Table

### Balanced matching criteria

The primary keywords "Coffee" and "Table" are required. The extra keyword "Red" is optional. This search returns items such as:

- Red Coffee Table
- Blue Coffee Table
- Green Coffee Table

### Precise matching criteria

The primary keywords "Coffee" and "Table" are required. The extra keyword "Red" is required. This search returns items such as:

- Red Coffee Table

## Suggest lines on a sales document

This process describes how to suggest lines on a sales order. The steps are the same for sales quotes and invoices.

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Order**, and then choose the related link.
1. Open a sales order or create a new one.
1. On the **Lines** FastTab, choose **Suggest sales lines**.
1. In the **Suggested sales lines** window, enter your prompt or select one from the prompt guides.

## Review, save, discard, or regenerate suggestions

After Copilot suggests the items to add to lines, review its suggestions and decide whether they're what you want:

- To discard a single proposed line, select it in the list, and then choose the **Delete Line** action.
- To discard all proposed lines and close the Copilot window, choose the Discard button (trash can) next to the **Keep it** button.
- To transfer the lines shown in the Copilot window, choose **Keep it**. 

There's a **Reliability** field that displays **High (80+)**, **Medium (60-80)**, and **Low (60-)** scores and points you to lines that need attention.

This step confirms that you want to transfer the lines to a sales document. You can delete or edit the transferred lines there as well, or delete the whole document.

# Suggest vendor payments

On the **Payment Journal** page, you can use the **Suggest Vendor Payments** batch job to suggest payment lines. Based on your settings, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] suggests lines for:

- Payments that are due soon.
- Payments where a payment discount is available.

To benefit fully from payment suggestions, you must prioritize your vendors. To learn more about prioritizing vendors, go to [Prioritize Vendors](purchasing-how-prioritize-vendors.md).  

> [!NOTE]  
> The batch job excludes vendor ledger entries that are **On Hold** or that are already applied and have a value in the **Applies-to ID** field.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> If you want to take advantage of payment discounts, and have entered an available amount, the amount will be used for:  
>
> * Prioritized overdue vendor entries first, in order of priority.
> * Overdue vendor entries that aren't prioritized.  
> * Open vendor entries that qualify for payment discounts. The entries are arranged by vendor number.  

## Use the Suggest Vendor Payments action

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Payment Journals**, and then select the related link.  
2. Open the journal, and then select the **Suggest Vendor Payments** action.  
3. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  
4. Select the **OK** button.  

## Insert the due date as posting date on payment journal lines

When you use the **Suggest Vendor Payments** batch job to create payment lines for your vendors, you can fill two special fields to ensure that the generated lines use the due date to calculate the posting date. These fields are **Calculate Posting Date from Applies-to-Doc. Due Date** and **Applies-to-Doc. Due Date Offset**.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> You can't use the **Calculate Posting Date from Applies-to-Doc. Due Date** field together with the **Find Payment Discounts** field or the **Summarize per Vendor** field. If the posting date is based on the due date, some payment discounts might not calculate correctly because the posting date is after the payment discount date.  

Also, if the calculated posting date is in the past, then the posting date is moved up to the work date and a warning displays.  

You can also manually create payment lines using the due date to calculate the posting date. After you apply vendor ledger entries, you can use the **Calculate Posting Date** action to update the posting date on the journal line with the due date of the related purchase invoice. To learn more about this manual process, go to [Apply Purchase Transactions Manually](payables-how-apply-purchase-transactions-manually.md).  

> [!NOTE]  
> If the purchase invoice is overdue, the posting date is set to the work date and the font on the line changes to red.

# Receive and convert electronic documents

> [!NOTE]
> The content in this article is only applicable for versions of Dynamics 365 Business Central that were released before 2023 release wave 2. In 2023 release wave 2, new functionality for E-Documents is included. To learn more, see [Set up e-documents](finance-how-setup-edocuments.md). 


The generic version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports receiving electronic invoices and credit memos in the PEPPOL format, which is supported by the largest providers of document exchange services. To receive an invoice from a vendor as an electronic PEPPOL document, you process the document in the Incoming Documents page to convert it to a purchase invoice or general journal line in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

In addition to receiving electronic documents directly from trading partners, you can receive electronic documents from an OCR service that has turned your PDF or image files into electronic documents.  

Before you can receive electronic documents through the document exchange service, you must set up various master data, such as company information, vendors, items, and units of measure. These are used to identify the business partners and items when converting data in elements in the incoming document file to fields in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For more information, see [Set Up a Document Exchange Service](across-how-to-set-up-a-document-exchange-service.md).  

Before you can receive electronic documents through the OCR service, you must set up and enable the preconfigured service connection. For more information, see [Set Up Incoming Documents](across-how-setup-income-documents.md).  

The traffic of electronic documents in and out of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is managed by the Job Queue feature. Before you can receive electronic documents, the relevant job queue must be started.  

You can either start the conversion of electronic documents manually, as described in this procedure, or you can enable a workflow to convert electronic documents automatically when they're received. The generic version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes a workflow template, *From Incoming Electronic through OCR to Open Purchase Invoice Workflow*, which is ready to be copied to a workflow and enabled. For more information, see [Workflow](across-workflow.md).  

> [!NOTE]  
> When you convert electronic documents received from the OCR service to documents or journal lines in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], multiple lines on the source document will be summed on one line. The single line will be of type G/L Account and the **Description** and (G/L account) **No.** fields will be empty. The value in the **Amount** field will equal the total amount excluding VAT of all lines in the source document.  
>
> To make sure that the **Description** and **No.** fields are filled, you can choose the **Map Text to Account** button on the **Incoming Documents** page to define that a certain invoice text is always mapped to a certain debit or credit account in the general ledger. Going forward, the **Description** field on document or journal lines created from an electronic document for that vendor or customer will be filled with the text in question and the (G/L account) **No.** field with the account in question.  
>
> Instead of mapping to a G/L account, you can also map to a bank account. This is practical, for example, for electronic documents for expenses that are already paid where you want to create a general journal line that is ready to post to a bank account.  

The following procedure describes how to receive a vendor invoice and convert it to a purchase invoice in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The procedure is the same when you convert a vendor invoice to a general journal line.  

### To receive and convert an electronic invoice to a purchase invoice

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Incoming Documents**, and then choose the related link.  

2. Select the line for the incoming document record that represents a new incoming electronic invoice, and then choose the **Edit** action.  

    On the **Incoming Document Card** page, the related XML file is attached, and most of the fields are prefilled with information from the electronic invoice. For more information, see [Create Incoming Document Records](across-how-create-income-document-records.md).  

3. In the **Data Exchange Type** field, choose **PEPPOL - Invoice** or **OCR – Invoice** depending on the source of the electronic document.  

4. To map text on the vendor invoice to a specific debit account, on the **Actions** tab, in the **General** group, choose **Map Text to Account**, and then fill the **Text-to-Account Mapping Worksheet** page.  

5. Choose the **Create Document** action.  

    A purchase invoice will be created in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] based on the information in the electronic document.  

    Any validation errors, typically related to wrong or missing master data in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will be shown on the **Error Messages** FastTab.

# Setup Best Practices: Costing Method

The **Costing Method** on the item card defines item's cost flow is recorded and whether an actual or budgeted value is capitalized and used in the cost calculation.  

Setting the correct costing method according to item type and business environment is important to ensure economical inventories.  

The following table provides best practices on how to set up the **Costing Method** field. For more information, see [Design Details: Costing Methods](design-details-costing-methods.md).  

|Setup option|Best practice|Comment|  
|------------------|-------------------|-------------|

# Managing inventory costs
Cost management, also referred to as 'costing,' is concerned with recording and reporting business operating costs. It includes the reporting of manufacturing costs and inventory costs, that is, the value of items.   


The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the articles that describe them.

To make sure that inventory costs are recorded correctly, you must set up various fields and pages before you begin to make item transactions. Typically, businesses choose a specific costing method and apply that to inventory items, for example, to help them track the value of items on stock.

|Set up the rounding rules to apply when adjusting or suggesting item prices and when adjusting or suggesting standard costs.|**Rounding Method** page|  

Central principles to understand are that costing methods define how items are valued when they leave inventory, that cost adjustment updates the cost of goods sold with related purchase costs posted after the sale, and that inventory values must be posted to dedicated G/L accounts at regular intervals.

# Prepare financial reporting with financial data and account categories

The **Financial Reports** feature gives you insights into the financial data shown on your chart of accounts (COA). You can set up financial reports to analyze figures in general ledger (G/L) accounts, and compare general ledger entries with budget entries. The results display in charts and reports in your Role Center, such as the Cash Flow chart, and the Income Statement and Balance Sheet reports. You access these two reports, for example, with the **Financial Statements** action in the Business Manager and Accountant home pages.  

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides sample financial reports you can use right away as templates. You can also set up your own reports to specify the figures to compare. For example, you can create financial reports to calculate profit margins using dimensions such as departments or customer groups. The number of financial reports you can create is unlimited and require no involvement of a developer.  

## Prerequisites for financial reporting

Setting up financial reports requires an understanding of the structure of your chart of accounts. There are three key concepts that you likely need to pay attention to before you design your financial reports:

- Map G/L posting accounts to G/L account categories.
- Design how you use dimensions.
- Set up G/L budgets.

G/L account categories simplify your financial report definitions and make them more resilient to changes in the chart of accounts structure. Learn more at [Use G/L account categories to change the layout of your financial statements](bi-row-definitions.md#use-gl-account-categories-to-change-the-layout-of-your-financial-statements).

Setting up dimensions allows you to slice and dice your financial data in ways that make sense for your organization. Learn more at [Work with Dimensions](finance-dimensions.md).

If you want to view general ledger entries as percentages of budget entries, you must create G/L budgets. Learn more at [Create G/L Budgets](finance-how-create-budgets.md).

## Financial reports

Financial reports arrange accounts from your chart of accounts in ways that make data easier to present. You can set up various layouts to define the information you want to extract from the chart of accounts. Financial reports also provide a place for calculations that can't be made directly in the chart of accounts. For example, you can create subtotals for groups of accounts and then include that total in other totals. Another example is to calculate profit margins on dimensions such as departments or customer groups. Additionally, you can filter general ledger entries and budget entries, for example, by net change or debit amount.

> [!NOTE]
> Mathematically, think of a financial report as defined by two things:
>
> - A vector of row definitions that define what needs to be calculated.
> - A vector of column definitions that defines the data for the calculation.
>
> The financial report is then the outer product of these two vectors, where each cell value is calculated according to the formula in the row applied to the data definition from the column.

:::image type="content" source="media/financial-report-definition.svg" alt-text="Shows how a financial report is constructed from a row definition and a column definition." lightbox="media/financial-report-definition.svg":::

The **Financial Reports** page shows how all financial reports follow a pattern that consists of the following attributes:

- Name (code)
- Description
- Row definition
- Column definition
- Internal description (introduced in [!INCLUDE[2025_releasewave1_name](includes/2025_releasewave1_name.md)])

:::image type="content" source="media/financial-reports.png" alt-text="Shows how all financial reports are constructed from a row definition and a column definition." lightbox="media/financial-reports.png":::

> [!NOTE]
> The sample finance reports in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] aren't ready to use out of the box. Depending of the way you set up your G/L accounts, dimensions, G/L account categories, and budgets, you need to adjust the sample row and column definitions and the finance reports they're used in to match your setup.

You can also use formulas to compare two or more financial reports and column definitions. Comparisons let can do the following things:

- Create customized financial reports.
- Create as many financial reports as you need, each with a unique name.
- Set up various report layouts and print the reports with the current figures.

To learn more about comparisons, go to [When to use a comparison period formula and comparison date formula in a column definition](bi-design-financial-reports.md#when-to-use-a-comparison-period-formula-and-comparison-date-formula-in-a-column-definition).

## Learning path: Create financial reports in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central

Want to learn how to create budgets, and then use financial reports, dimensions, and row and column definitions to generate the financial reports that businesses typically need?

Start on the following learning path [Create financial reports in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central](/training/paths/create-financial-reports-dynamics-365-business-central).

## Create a new financial report

You use financial reports to analyze general ledger accounts or to compare general ledger entries with budget entries. For example, you can view the general ledger entries as percentages of the budget entries.

The financial reports in the standard version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] might not suit your business needs. To quickly create your own financial reports, start by copying an existing one, as described in step 3 below.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Financial Reports**, then choose the related link.  
1. On the **Financial Reports** page, choose the **New** action to create a new financial report name. Alternatively, to reuse settings from an existing financial report, choose the report, and then choose the **Copy Report Definition** action.
1. In the **Name** field, enter a short name for the report

   > [!NOTE]
   > You can't change the name later.
1. In the **Display Title** field, enter a description of the report.
1. Choose a row definition and a column definition.
1. Optionally, choose analysis views for the row and column definitions.
1. Choose the **View Financial Report** action to access more properties on the financial report.
1. On the **Options** FastTab, you can edit the report title, change the row and column definitions, write an internal description, set the formatting for negative numbers, and define how to show dates. Dates can be a Day/Week/Month/Quarter/Year hierarchy, or use accounting periods. To learn more, go to [Comparing accounting periods using period formulas](bi-column-definitions.md#comparing-accounting-periods-using-period-formulas).
1. On the **Dimensions** FastTab, you can define dimension filters for the report.
1. If you want the report output to include an introductory and/or a closing paragraph, add them from the *Definitions* menu (these fields are available from the [!INCLUDE[2025_releasewave1_name](includes/2025_releasewave1_name.md)] and later).  
1. You can now preview the report in the area below the **Dimensions** FastTab.

> [!NOTE]
> When you open a financial report in View or Edit mode, the Filter pane is available. Don't use the Filter pane to set filters for the data in your report. Such filters can cause errors or might not actually filter the data. Instead, use the fields on the **Options** and **Dimensions** FastTabs to set up filters for the report.

### Adding introductory and/or closing paragraphs

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/introduced_in_2025rw1.md)]

If you want the report output to include an introductory and/or a closing paragraph, you can use the **Edit introductory/closing paragraphs** action on the **Definitions** menu. When you export the report to PDF or Excel, these paragraphs display before and after the report body.

### Choosing a format for negative numbers

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/introduced_in_2025rw1.md)]

If you want to control how negative numbers show in the report output (both on-screen and in PDF), you use the **Negative Amount Format** action on the **Options** FastTab to choose your preferred format. The format can be a minus sign or parentheses.

### Create or edit a row definition

Row definitions in financial reports provide a place for calculations that can't be made directly in the chart of accounts. For example, you can create subtotals for groups of accounts and then include that total in other totals. You can also calculate intermediate steps that aren't shown in the final report.

Row definitions also provide settings for formatting your report. Most of the options provide visual definition to reports when people view or preview them on their monitors, or print them.

> [!NOTE]
> Some of the formatting options don't carry over when you export them to Excel. If you often export reports to Excel, you might skip the formatting here and format the report in Excel instead.

To learn more, go to [Row definitions in financial reporting](bi-row-definitions.md).

### Create or edit a column definition

Use column definitions to specify the columns to include in the report. For example, you can design a report layout to compare net change and balance for the same period this year and last year. You can have up to 15 columns in a column definition. For example, multiple columns are useful for displaying budgets for 12 months with a column that shows the total.

To learn more, go to [Column definitions in financial reporting](bi-column-definitions.md).

## Using dimensions in financial reports

In financial analysis, a dimension is data you add to an entry as a kind of marker. This data is used to group entries with similar characteristics, such as customers, regions, products, and salesperson, and easily retrieve these groups for analysis. You can use dimensions on entries in journals, documents, and budgets.

Each dimension describes the focus of analysis. So, a two-dimensional analysis, for example, would be sales per area. By using more than two dimensions when you create an entry, you can carry out a more complex analysis. An example of a complex analysis is exploring sales per sales campaign per customer group per area. That gives you greater insight into your business, such as how well your business is operating, where it is or isn't thriving, and where you should allocate more resources. That insight helps you make more informed business decisions. To learn more, go to [Work with Dimensions](finance-dimensions.md).

## Set up financial reports with overviews

You can use a financial report to create a statement that compares general ledger figures with budget figures.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 3.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Financial Reports**, then choose the related link.
1. On the **Financial Reports** page, select a financial report.  
1. Choose the **Edit Row Definition** action  
1. On the **Row Definition** page, in the **Name** field, select the default financial report name.
1. Choose the **Insert G/L Accounts** action.  
1. Select the accounts you want to include in your statement, then choose **OK**.

    The accounts are inserted in your financial report. If you want, you can also change the column definition.  
1. Choose the **Edit Financial Report** action.  
1. On the **Financial Report** page, on the **Dimensions** FastTab, set the budget filter to the filter name you want to use.  
1. Choose **OK**.  

Now you can copy and paste your budget statement into a spreadsheet.  

## Best practices for working with financial report definitions

Financial report definitions aren't versioned. When you change a report definition, the old version is replaced when your change saves to the database. The following list contains some best practices for working with financial report definitions:

- If you add report definitions, choose a good code and fill in the description field with a meaningful text while you still know what you use the report for. This information helps your coworkers (and your future self) to work with the report and perhaps changing the report definition.
- Before you change a report definition, consider taking a copy of it as a backup, just in case your change doesn't work as expected. You can either just copy the definition (give it a good name), or export it. To learn more, go to [Import or export financial report definitions](#import-or-export-financial-report-definitions).
- If you need a fresh copy of a definition that [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides, an easy way to get one is to create a new company that only contains setup data. Then, export the definition and import it in the company where the definition needs a refresh.

## Import or export financial report definitions

You can import and export financial report definitions as RapidStart configuration packages. For example, configuration packages are useful for sharing information with other companies. The package is created in a .rapidstart file, which compresses the contents.

> [!NOTE]
> When you import financial report definitions, existing records with the same names as those you are importing are replaced with the new definitions. The configuration package for a report definition won't overwrite any existing row or column definitions that are used in the report definition.

To import or export financial report definitions, follow these steps:

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 4.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Financial Reports**, then choose the related link.
1. Choose the financial report, then choose the **Import Financial Report** or **Export Financial Report** action, depending on what you want to do.

To learn more about how to import or export financial report row or column definitions, go to the following articles: 

- [Import or export financial reporting row definitions](bi-row-definitions.md#import-or-export-financial-reporting-row-definitions), or
- [Import or export financial reporting column definitions](bi-column-definitions.md#import-or-export-financial-report-column-definitions)

## Integrate financial reports with Excel

You can integrate a financial report with an Excel workbook template, adjust the layout to suit your needs, and then update the Excel template with data from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For example, this integration makes it easier to generate your monthly and yearly financial statements in a format that works for you.

To learn more, go to [How to integrate financial reports with Excel](finance-financial-reporting-view-a-report.md#integrate-financial-reports-with-excel).

## Print and save financial reports

You can print financial reports using your device's printing services. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] also offers options to save reports as PDF files. 

To learn more, go to [How to print and save financial reports](./finance-financial-reporting-view-a-report.md#print-and-save-financial-reports).

# Managing payables

A large part of managing accounts payable is paying your vendors, or reimbursing your employees for expenses. You can use functions to add payments lines for purchase invoices that are due on the **Payment Journal** page. To send transactions to your bank, you can export multiple payment journal lines to a file, and then upload the file to your bank. You can also make payments by check, including transmitting checks as electronic payments.

Another typical task is to apply outgoing payments to their related vendor or employee ledger entries in order to close purchase invoices, purchase credit memos, or employee accounts as paid. You can do this on the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page by importing a bank statement file to register the payments. The payments are applied to open vendor, customer, or employee ledger entries by matching payment text and entry information. There are various ways to review and change the matches before you post the journal. You can choose to close any open bank account ledger entries related to the applied ledger entries when you post the journal. The bank account is automatically reconciled when all payments are applied.

Alternatively, you can apply outgoing payments manually on the **Payment Journal** page or from the related vendor or employee ledger entries.

The following table describes a sequence of tasks within accounts payable, with links to the articles that describe them.

# Outbound Warehouse Processes

Outbound processes in warehouses start when you release a source document to take items out of a warehouse location. For example, either to ship the items somewhere or to move them to another company location. You can ship physical and non-inventory items. To learn more about receiving non-inventory items, go to [Post non-inventory items](#post-non-inventory-items). 

In principle, the process of shipping outbound orders consists of two activities:

* Picking items from the shelves.
* Shipping items out of the warehouse.

The source documents for outbound warehouse flow are:  

* Sales order  
* Outbound transfer order  
* Purchase return order  
* Service order  

> [!NOTE]
> Production and assembly orders with component needs also represent outbound source documents. Production and assembly orders are a little different because they're typically internal processes that don't involve shipping. Instead, they're used to put-away produced items or move the components needed to assemble an item to an assembly area. Learn more about these processes at [Design Details: Internal Warehouse Flows](design-details-internal-warehouse-flows.md).  

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you pick and ship items using one of four methods, as described in the following table.

|Method|Outbound Process|Require Pick|Require Shipment|Complexity Level (Learn more at [Warehouse Management Overview](design-details-warehouse-management.md))|  
|------|----------------|-----|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
|A|Post the pick and shipment from the order line|||No dedicated warehouse activity.|  
|B|Post the pick and shipment from an inventory pick document|Turned on||Basic: Order-by-order.|  
|C|Post the pick and shipment from a warehouse shipment document||Turned on|Basic: Consolidated receive/ship posting for multiple orders.|  
|D|Post the pick from a warehouse pick document, and post the shipment from a warehouse shipment document|Turned on|Turned on|Advanced|  

The approach to choose depends on your warehouse practices and level of organizational complexity. The following are some examples that might help you decide.

* In an order-by-order environment with straightforward processes and a simple bin structure, method A, picking and shipping from the order line is appropriate.
* If items for an order line come from more than one bin, or if warehouse workers can't work with order documents, the use of separate pick documents is appropriate, method B.
* If your picking and shipping processes involve multiple orders and require greater control and overview, you might choose to use a warehouse shipment document and warehouse pick document to separate the picking and shipping tasks, methods C and D.  

In methods A, B, and C, picking and shipping activities are combined in one step when posting the document as shipped. In method D, you first register the pick, and then post the shipment later from a different document.

> [!NOTE]
> While warehouse picks and inventory picks sound similar, they're different documents and are used in different processes.
> * The inventory pick used in method B, together with registering picking information, also posts the shipment of the source document.
> * The warehouse pick used in method D can't be posted and only registers the pick. The registration makes the items available for the warehouse shipment but doesn't post the shipment. In the outbound flow, the warehouse pick requires a warehouse shipment.

## No dedicated warehouse activity

The following articles provide information about how to process receipts for source documents if you don't have dedicated warehouse activities.

* [Transfer Orders](inventory-how-transfer-between-locations.md)
* [Process Purchase Returns or Cancellations](purchasing-how-process-purchase-returns-cancellations.md)
* [Create Service Orders](service-how-to-create-service-orders.md)

## Basic warehouse configurations

The following diagram illustrates the outbound warehouse processes for different types of documents in basic warehouse configurations. The numbers in the diagram correspond with the steps in the sections following the diagram.  

:::image type="content" source="media/design-details-warehouse-management-outbound-basic-flow.png" alt-text="Shows the steps in a basic outbound flow in a warehouse.":::

### 1: Release a source document

When you use the **Release** action on a source document, such as a sales or transfer order, the items on the document are ready to be handled in the warehouse. For example, picked and put in the bin specified on the document. Alternatively, you can create inventory pick documents for individual lines on orders, in a push fashion, based on specified bins and quantities to handle.  

### 2: Create an inventory pick

On the **Inventory Pick** page, the warehouse worker retrieves, in a pull fashion, the source document lines. Alternatively, the inventory pick lines are already created, in a push fashion, by the user who is responsible for the source document.  

### 3: Post an inventory pick

On each line for items that have been picked or moved, partially or fully, fill in the **Quantity** field, and then post the inventory pick. Source documents related to the inventory pick are posted as shipped or consumed.  

For inventory picks, negative item ledger entries are created, warehouse entries are created, and the pick request is deleted, if fully handled. For example, the **Quantity Shipped** field on the outbound source document line is updated. A posted shipment document is created  that reflects the sales order, for example, and the shipped items.  

## Advanced warehouse configurations

The following diagram illustrates the outbound warehouse processes for different types of documents in advanced warehouse configurations. The numbers in the diagram correspond with the steps in the sections following the diagram.  

:::image type="content" source="media/design_details_warehouse_management_outbound_advanced_flow.png" alt-text="Shows the steps in an advanced outbound warehouse flow.":::

### 1: Release a source document

Releasing a source document in advanced configurations does the same thing as for basic configurations. The items become available for handling in the warehouse. For example, they can be included in a shipment.  

### 2: Create a warehouse shipment

On the **Warehouse Shipment** page, get the lines from the released source document. You can combine lines from several source document in one warehouse shipment.  

### 3: Create a warehouse pick

On the **Warehouse Shipment** page, create warehouse pick activities for warehouse shipments in one of two ways:

- In a push fashion, where you use the **Create Pick** action. Select the lines to be picked and prepare the picks by specifying, for example, which bins to take from and place in, and how many units to handle. The bins can be predefined for the warehouse location or resource.
- In a pull fashion, where you use the **Release** action. On the **Pick Worksheet** page, warehouse workers can use the **Get Warehouse Documents** action to get their assigned picks. When the warehouse picks are fully registered, the lines in the **Pick Worksheet** are deleted.

### 4: Register a warehouse pick

On the **Warehouse Pick** page, a warehouse worker fills in the **Quantity** field for each line that they've fully or partially picked, and then registers the pick.

Warehouse entries are created, and the warehouse pick lines are deleted if the full quantity was picked. The warehouse pick document remains open until the full quantity of the warehouse shipment is registered. The **Qty. Picked** field on the warehouse shipment lines is updated accordingly.  

### 5: Post the warehouse shipment

When all items on the warehouse shipment document are registered as picked, the warehouse worker posts the shipment. Posting updates the item ledger entries to reflect the reduction in inventory. For example, the **Quantity Shipped** field on the outbound source document line is updated.

# Multi-language [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] apps for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]

This article describes how to test and use multi-language capabilities in the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] apps for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## Try a [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] app in your language/locale

To try an app in a language, add `language = <culture name>` to the url parameters. For example, this URL shows an app in German:

``` link
https://<your domain>.powerbi.com/groups/a1d27337-134a-4326-99ed-9e68a1485679/reports/3173137b-a485-42e2-a3df-8f3acd7640a6/ReportSection2fa580b0181e8c981cdc?experience=power-bi&language=de-DE
```

## Languages and locales

A culture name is usually a lower-case language identifier and an upper-case locale identifier separated by a hyphen. Here are some examples of culture names:

- **en-US** identifies a user in the United States who speaks English.
- **es-ES** identifies a user in Spain who speaks Spanish.
- **fr-FR** identifies a user in France who speaks French.
- **de-DE** identifies a user in Germany who speaks German.

| language parameter | Language | Locale        |
|--------------------|----------|---------------|
| en-US              | English  | United States |
| es-ES              | Spanish  | Spain         |
| fr-FR              | French   | France        |
| de-DE              | German   | Germany       |

# Make drop shipments

A drop shipment is the shipment of items from one of your vendors directly to one of your customers.

When a sales order is marked for drop shipment, and you create a purchase order specifying the customer in the **Ship-to** field, **Customer Address**, you can link the two documents to instruct the vendor to ship directly to the customer.
<br><br>  
  
> [!Video https://learn-video.azurefd.net/vod/player?id=58c81aa9-7190-476a-9fd9-75a9841549f7]

## To create a sales order for drop shipment

To prepare a drop shipment, you create a sales order for an item and indicate on the sales line that the sale requires drop shipment.

1. Create a sales order for an item. For more information, see [Sell Products](sales-how-sell-products.md).
2. On the sales order line for the drop shipment, select the **Drop Shipment** checkbox. Alternatively, in the **Purchasing Code** field, select a purchasing code that has the **Drop Shipment** field selected.

> [!TIP]
> By default, the Drop Shipment checkbox and Purchasing Code field aren't available on the lines. If they aren't, you can add them by personalizing the section of page that contains the lines. For more information, see [Personalize Your Workspace](ui-personalization-user.md).

## To create the purchase order for drop shipment

To prepare a drop shipment, you indicate on the purchase order that it must be shipped to your customer, not to yourself.

1. Create a purchase order. Don't fill any fields on the lines. For more information, see [Record Purchases](purchasing-how-record-purchases.md).
2. In the **Ship-to** field, select **Customer Address**.
3. In the **Customer** field, select the customer that you're selling to.
4. Choose the **Drop Shipments** action, and then choose the **Get Sales Order** action.
5. On the **Sales List** page, select the sales order that you prepared in [To create a sales order for drop shipment](#to-create-a-sales-order-for-drop-shipment).
6. Choose the **OK** button.

The line information from the sales order is inserted on the purchase order line(s).

You can now tell your vendor to ship the items directly to the customer. For example, you might send them the order by email.

If your vendor provides additional information, such as a tracking number, you can add that information as a comment on a purchase order line. To add a comment on a line, in the **Type** field, choose **Comment**, and then enter the information in the **Description** field.  

## To create multiple purchase orders for drop shipments

You can also use the requisition worksheet to create purchase orders. The advantage of using the requisition worksheet is that it can create purchase orders for all outstanding drop shipments. That means you won't have to create each order individually.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Requisition Worksheets**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **Drop Shipments** action, and then choose the **Get Sales Order** action.
3. If needed, enter filter criteria for the orders you wan to get, and then choose the **OK** button.
4. Review the purchase order lines, and in the **Vendor No.** field, select the vendor that supplies the goods.
5. Choose the **Carry Out Action Message** action to convert the lines to a purchase order.

## To view the linked purchase order from the sales order

Select the drop-shipment sales order line, choose the **Order** action, choose the **Drop Shipment** action, and then choose the **Purchase Order** action.

## To post a drop shipment

After the vendor ships the items, you can post the sales order as shipped. You can also post the purchase order, but only with the **Receive** option until the sales order has been invoiced.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Orders**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the sales order that you created in [To create a sales order for drop shipment](#to-create-a-sales-order-for-drop-shipment).
3. In the **Qty. to Ship** field, specify how many of the order quantity to ship, the full or a partial order quantity.
4. Choose the **Post** or **Post and Send** action.
5. Choose either the **Ship** option to invoice later, or the **Ship and Invoice** option to invoice immediately.

> [!TIP]
> Don't forget that you need to post the purchase order invoice.

# Configure API Templates

The API library for [!INCLUDE[prod_short_md](includes/prod_short.md)] provides a simplified representation of the underlying entities. All the properties in the application are not exposed through the associated API. The **API Setup** page allows you to define templates that are used to populate empty properties on an entity when you create a POST action through the API. 

For example, if a configuration template is defined for the item entity, when a new item record is created through the items API, any properties for the new item that are not defined in the API call will be populated from the selected template. If, for example, no value is defined for the **Gen. Prod. Posting Group** field through the API, but a value is defined in the selected template, then the posting group value defined in the template will be applied to the new item. 

## Setting up the Entity Template

To use templates with the API library, you must first set up and define properties for the templates. You can set up these templates on the **Configuration Templates** page. For more information, see [Migrate On-Premises Data to Business Central Online](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/migrate-data) (in English only) in the administration content.  

## Assign the template to an API

To assign a template to an API, you must go through the following steps.

> [!NOTE]  
> API templates can only be set up with the following API pages: contacts, countriesRegions, currencies, customers, employees, itemCategories, paymentMethods, paymentTerms, shipmentMethods, unitsOfMeasure, and vendors.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **API Setup**, and choose the related link.
2. Choose **New**, and then choose the **Order** value for the record.  

    If there is more than one template selected for an API (Page ID), the templates are applied in the order defined in the **Order** column.  

    When each template is applied, field values defined in the template are only applied to fields that have not already had a value defined, either explicitly in the API, or in a previously applied template in the order.  
3. Select a **Page ID** value.  

    This is the page for the API to which the template will be applied. The **Page ID** lookup provides a list of all APIs available in the library.
4. Select a value in the **Template Code** field.  

    The template code is the code for the template that was defined on the **Configuration Templates** page. The template values defined are applied to the API.  
5. In the **Conditions** field, specify which template should be applied.  

    The defined template is applied to a new record created through the API if, and only if, the conditions defined in the **Conditions** field are met by the values already defined for the new instance of the entity.

# Enabling Power BI integration with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]

[!INCLUDE[azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id](~/../shared-content/shared/azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id.md)]

This article describes how to get [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] ready for integration with Power BI. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online is already enabled for integration, although there's some information about licensing that you might want to read. For [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, you'll have set up your environment to connect to Power BI before users can work with it.

## <a name="license"></a>Power BI Licensing

With [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], users get a free Power BI license that provides access to the most common features in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and Power BI. You can also purchase a Power BI Pro license that provides access to additional features. The following table provides an overview of the features available with each license.

|Power License|View reports|Create reports|Share reports|Refresh reports| [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] Apps|
|-------------|--------||
|Power BI free|![a checkmark.](media/check.png) (in your personal workspace)  | ![another checkmark](media/check.png) (in your personal workspace) |(limited)|(limited)||
|Power BI Pro|![yet another checkmark.](media/check.png) |![it's a checkmark](media/check.png)|![again a checkmark](media/check.png)|(extensive)|![last checkmark](media/check.png)|

You can't use a [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] free license for the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] Apps. To learn more, go to [Prerequisites for installing Power BI apps for Business Central](across-powerbi-install-business-central-apps.md#prerequisites)

To learn more about [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] licensing in general, go to [Licensing the Power BI service for users in your organization](/power-bi/admin/service-admin-licensing-organization) or [Sign up for the Power BI service as an individual](/power-bi/fundamentals/service-self-service-signup-for-power-bi).

## <a name="exposedata"></a>Expose data through API or OData web services

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers two ways to expose data that can be consumed by [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports: 

* API pages or queries
* Open Data Protocol (OData) web services

### API pages and queries (recommended)

> **APPLIES TO:** [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online only.

Developers can define page objects and query objects that are of the type *API*. This way, they can expose data from database tables through a webhook-supported, OData v4-enabled, REST service. This type of data can't be displayed in the user interface, but is intended for building reliable integration services.

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online comes with a set of built-in APIs that you can use to get data for typical business entities, like customers, items, sales orders, and more. No extra work or setup is required to use these APIs as a data source for [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports. To learn more about these APIs, go to [Business Central API V2.0](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/api-reference/v2.0/).

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online also supports custom APIs. Application developers of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] solutions can create their own API pages and queries and package them into apps. You then install the apps on your tenant. When they're installed, you use the API pages for your [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports, like you'd do with the built-in APIs (v2.0). To learn more about how to create an API by exposing pages or queries, go to [Developing a Custom API](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-develop-custom-api).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Starting in February 2022, [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online are sourced from a secondary, read-only database replica for performance reasons. AL developers should avoid designing API pages that make database modifications while the pages are opening or loading records. In particular, consider the code on the AL triggers: `OnInit`, `OnOpenPage`, `OnFindRecord`, `OnNextRecord`, `OnAfterGetRecord`, and `OnAfterGetCurrRecord`. In some cases, these database modifications might cause performance problems and prevent the report from refreshing data. To learn more, go to [Performance Articles For Developers](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/performance/performance-developer?branch=main#writing-efficient-web-services) in the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] development content.
>
> In rare cases, the behavior causes an error when you try to get data from the API for a report in Power BI Desktop. However, if the custom API requires database modifications, Power BI Desktop users can force the behavior. To learn more, go to [Building Power BI Reports to Display Business Central Data](across-how-use-financials-data-source-powerbi.md#fixing-problems).

### OData web services (not recommended)

You can publish [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] application objects, such as codeunits, pages, and queries, as [OData web services](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/webservices/odata-web-services). With [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, there are many web services published by default. An easy way to find the web services is to search for *web services* in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. On the **Web Services** page, make sure the **Publish** field is selected for the web services. To learn more about publishing web services, go to [Publish a Web Service](across-how-publish-web-service.md).

To learn about what you can do to ensure the best performance of web services, as seen from the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] server (the endpoint) and from the consumer (the client), read [Writing efficient Web Services](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/performance/performance-developer#writing-efficient-web-services).

### Choosing whether to use API pages or OData web services

We recommend that you use API pages instead of OData web services. API pages load data faster in [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports than OData web services. Plus, they're more flexible because they let you get data from table fields that aren't defined in a page object.

Stability is another reason for why you shouldn't base your [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports on UI pages exposed as OData web services. Fields on UI pages in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can change between updates. The changes are done either by the app publisher (the organization that develops the code), or with per-tenant extensions or apps that modify the page. In both cases, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't know about [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] report dependencies on page objects, so the change in the UI page might break your [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports. This problem doesn't happen if you base your reports on API pages or queries.

<!--## <a name="setup"></a>Set up [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises for Power BI integration

This section explains the requirements for a [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises deployment to integrate with Power BI.

1. Configure either [NavUserPassword](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/authenticating-users-with-navuserpassword) or [Microsoft Entra ID](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/authenticating-users-with-azure-ad-overview) as the authentication method for the deployment.  
    
    > [!NOTE]
    > Power BI integration doesn't support Windows authentication and is not supported on Windows Client.

2. Enable OData web services and the ODataV4 endpoint.

    OData web service must be enabled on the [!INCLUDE[server](includes/server.md)], and OData port opened in firewall. For more information, see [Configuring Business Central Server - OData Web Services](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/configure-server-instance#ODataServices).

    The local server must be accessible from the Internet.

3. Give [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] user accounts a web service access key.

    A web service access key is only needed to view [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] data in Power BI. You can assign a web service access key to each user account. Or instead, create a specific account with a web service access key for use by all users. For more information, see [Web Services Authentication](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/webservices/web-services-authentication#generate-a-web-service-access-key).

    <!--
    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > With [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] online, the use of access keys (Basic Auth) for web service authentication is [deprecated](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/upgrade/deprecated-features-w1#accesskeys). We recommend that you use OAuth2 instead. For more information, see [Use OAuth to Authorize Business Central Web Services](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/webservices/authenticate-web-services-using-oauth).-->

<!--4. Create an application registration for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in Microsoft Azure.

    To view Power BI reports embedded in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] pages, an application must be registered for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in Microsoft Azure. The registered application needs permission to Power BI services. At a minimum, the app requires  **User.ReadWrite.All** permission. For users to view reports from shared Power BI workspaces, the app requires **Workspace.Read.All** permission. For more information, see [Registering [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] On-Premises in Microsoft Entra ID for Integrating with Other Services](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/register-app-azure).

    > [!NOTE]
    > If your deployment uses NavUserPassword authentication, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] connects to the same Power BI service for all users. You'll specify this service account as part of registering the application. With Microsoft Entra authentication, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] connects to the Power BI service associated with the individual user accounts.

    <!-- Windows authentication can also be used but you can't get data from BC in Power BI -->
<!--5. Make the initial connection from Business Central to Power BI.

    Before end-users can use Power BI in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], an Azure application administrator will have to give consent to the Power BI service.

    To make the initial connection, open [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], and run **Get Started with Power BI** from the Home page. This action will lead you through the consent process, and check your Power BI license. When prompted sign in using an Microsoft Entra admin account. For more information, see [Connect to Power BI - one time only](across-working-with-powerbi.md#connect).-->

## Setting up Dataflows

Dataflows enable you to ingest, transform, and load data into a Power BI workspace and then use the data as the basis for your reports. These dataflows can in some cases experience transient errors while doing a scheduled refresh. The error message looks like this: `DataSource.Error: OData: Unable to read data from the transport connection: An existing connection was forcibly closed by the remote host.` 

Using PowerAutomate, you can set up retries for this situation. For more information, see [Automatically retry a dataflow on failure](/power-query/dataflows/automatically-retry-dataflow).

# Work with blanket sales orders or blanket purchase orders

A blanket sales order represents a framework for a long-term agreement between you and your customer. Similarly, you use blanket purchase orders to manage long-term agreements between you and your vendor.

A blanket order is typically made when a customer has committed to purchasing large quantities that are to be delivered in several smaller shipments over a certain period of time. Often blanket orders cover only one item with predetermined delivery dates. The main reason for using a blanket order rather than a sales order is that quantities entered on a blanket order don't affect item availability and thus can be used as a worksheet for monitoring, forecasting, and planning purposes.

On the blanket order, each separate shipment can be set up as an order line, which can then be converted into a sales order at the time of shipping.

An example of when a blanket sales order could be used is if a customer calls and places an order of 1000 units of an item and they want the items to be delivered in 250 units every week over the next month.

> [!NOTE]
> Blanket purchase orders work in a similar way as blanket sales orders. This documentation covers blanket sales orders only.

## To create a blanket sales order

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Blanket Sales Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
4. Leave the **Order Date** field blank. When the separate sales orders are created from the blanket order, the order date of the sales order is set to equal the actual work date.
5. On the **Lines** FastTab, create separate lines for each shipment. For instance, if your customer wants 1000 units split out equally between four weeks, you would enter four separate lines of 250 units each.  

## To create a sales order from a blanket sales order  

1. To create an order for any of the lines in the blanket sales order, remove the quantity in the **Qty. to Ship** field on all the lines that you don't wish to ship at this time.  
2. When you're ready to create orders, choose the **Make Order** action, and then choose **Yes**. A message appears informing you that the blanket order has been assigned an order number. Note that the blanket order hasn't been deleted.  
3. Choose the **OK** button.  
4. To see the results of the preceding steps, choose the **Line** action, choose the **Unposted Lines** action, and then choose the **Orders** action.  
5. On the **Sales Lines** page, select the appropriate sales order, choose the **Line** action, and then choose the **Show Document** action.  

The following applies to sales orders after they have been created from blanket sales orders:  

- After the blanket order is converted into a sales order, the sales order contains all the lines from the blanket order. The lines where the quantity in the **Qty. to Ship** field was deleted appear, but with blank **Quantity** fields. You may choose to leave, edit, or delete the lines.  
- It's important to remember that the sales order line quantity must not exceed the quantity of the associated blanket order line. Otherwise, posting of the sales order won't be possible.  
- When the sales order is posted as shipped and/or invoiced, the **Quantity Shipped** and **Quantity Invoiced** fields are updated on the related blanket order.  
- The blanket order number and line number are recorded as properties of the sales lines when created from a blanket order.  
- When sales orders aren't created directly from the blanket order but still relate to it, a link between a sales order and a blanket order can be established by entering the associated blanket order number in the **Blanket Order No.** field on the sales order line.  
- After the sales order has been created for the total quantity of a blanket order line, no other sales order can be created for the same line. Users are prevented from entering a quantity in the **Qty. to Ship** field. If, however, additional quantities need to be added to a blanket order, the value in the **Quantity** field can be increased and additional orders can then be created.  
- The invoiced blanket sales order remains in the system until it's deleted, either by deleting individual blanket orders or by running the **Delete Invoiced Blanket Sales Orders** batch job.  
- If a customer is also recorded as a contact in the Marketing application area, and if you have specified an interaction template code for blanket sales order on the **Marketing Setup** page, an interaction is recorded in the Interaction Log Entry table when you select **Print** to print the blanket sales order.

## To view the status of a blanket sales order

You can see the status of a blanket sales order on the **Sales Blanket Order Statistics** page. This might be relevant when you start to invoice the order that is created from the blanket sales order.  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Blanket Sales Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Select a blanket sales order, and then choose the **Statistics** action.  
3.  On the **Sales Blanket Order Statistics** page, on the **General** FastTab, you can see summary information about the entire order based on the total quantity in the various **Quantity fields** on the blanket sales order lines.  

- On the **Invoicing** FastTab, you can see summary information based on the total quantity in the **Qty. to Invoice** fields on the sales blanket order lines.  
- On the **Shipping** FastTab, you can see summary information based on the total quantity in the **Qty. to Receive** fields on the sales blanket order lines.  
- On the **Prepayment** FastTab, you can see summary information about any prepaid amounts.  
- On the **Vendor** FastTab, you can see certain basic information about the vendor.

## To view unposted and posted blanket sales order lines

The link between the blanket sales order and the originating sales order, and any other sales document, is retained after posting as a list of posted and unposted sales order invoice lines.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon enter **Blanket Sales Orders**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the blanket sales order you want to view.
3. To view unposted entries, select the line in question, choose the **Line** action, and then choose the **Unposted Lines** action. Choose one of the following options.  

|Option|Description|
|--|--|
|**Orders**|Specifies open orders associated with the selected line.|
|**Invoices**|Specifies open invoices that have been associated with the selected line. Open invoices are manually associated with a blanket order by entering the blanket order number on the sales invoice line.|
|**Return Orders**|Specifies open return orders that have been associated with the selected line.|
|**Credit Memos**|Specifies open credit memos that have been associated with the selected line.|

4. To view posted entries, select the line in question, choose the **Line** action, and then choose the **Posted Lines** action. Choose one of the following options.  

|Option|Description|
|---|----|
|**Shipments**|Posted shipments associated with the selected line.|
|**Invoices**|Posted invoices associated with the selected line.|
|**Return Receipts**|Posted return receipts that have been associated with the selected line.|
|**Credit Memos**|Posted credit memos that have been associated with the selected line.|

5. On the **Sales Lines** page, choose the **Show Document** action to view the entry.

# Record Special Purchase Prices and Discounts

> [!NOTE]
> In 2020 release wave 2 we released streamlined processes for setting up and managing prices and discounts. If you're a new customer using that version, you're using the new experience. If you're an existing customer, whether you are using the new experience depends on whether your administrator has enabled the **New sales pricing experience** feature update in **Feature Management**. For more information, see [Enabling Upcoming Features Ahead of Time](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/feature-management).

The different price and discount agreements that apply when you buy from different vendors must be defined so that the agreed rules and values are applied to purchase documents that you create for the vendors.

When you have recorded special prices and line discounts for sales and purchases, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] ensures that your profit on item trade is always optimal by automatically calculating the best price on sales and purchase documents and on project and item journal lines. For more information, see [Best Price Calculation](purchasing-how-record-purchase-price-discount-payment-agreements.md#best-price-calculation).

Concerning prices, you can have a special purchase price inserted on purchase lines if a certain combination of vendor, item, minimum quantity, unit of measure, or starting/ending date exists.

Concerning discounts, you can set up and use two types of purchase discounts:

| Discount Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Purchase Line Discount** |An amount discount that is inserted on purchase lines if a certain combination of vendor, item, minimum quantity, unit of measure, or starting/ending date exists. This type works in the same way as for purchase prices. |
| **Invoice Discount** |A percentage discount that is subtracted from the document total if the value amount of all lines on a purchase document exceeds a certain minimum. |

Because purchase line discounts and purchase prices are based on a combination of item and vendor, you can also enter this configuration from the item card, where the rules and values are defined. For more information, see [Register New Items](inventory-how-register-new-items.md).

## To set up a special purchase price for a vendor

#### [Current Experience](#tab/current-experience)

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Vendors**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the relevant vendor card, and then choose the **Prices** action.
3. Fill in the fields on the line as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
4. Fill a line for each combination for which the vendor grants you a purchase line discount.

#### [New Experience](#tab/new-experience)

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Vendors**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the vendor, and then choose the **Sales Price Lists** action.
3. Choose **New** to create a new purchase price list.
4. On the **General** and **Tax** FastTabs, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
5. To add items to the list, do one of the following:
   * To add many items, choose **Suggest Lines**, and then enter filter criteria to specify the types of items to add. Optionally, you can also enter some additional settings for the items that are specific to the price list. You can change these later, if needed.
   * To copy items from another price list, choose **Copy Lines**, and then choose the price list to copy.
   * To add items manually, in the grid, in the **Product Type** field, choose the type of product that the price list is for. Depending on your selection, fill in the remaining fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
6. To start using the price list, in the **Status** field, choose **Active**.

## To set up a line discount for a vendor

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Vendors**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the relevant vendor card, and then choose the **Line Discounts** action.

   The **Vendor No.** field is prefilled with the vendor number.
3. Fill in the fields on the line as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
4. Fill a line for each combination for which the vendor grants you a purchase line discount.

## To set up an invoice discount for a vendor

When your vendors have informed you which invoice discounts they grant, enter the invoice discount code on the vendor cards and set up the terms for each code.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Vendors**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the vendor card for a vendor that will be eligible for invoice discounts.
3. In the **Invoice Disc. Code** field, select a code for the relevant invoice discount terms to use to calculate invoice discounts for the vendor.

    > [!NOTE]  
    > Invoice discount codes are represented by existing vendor cards. This enables you to quickly assign invoice discount terms to vendors by picking the name of another vendors who will have the same terms.

    Proceed to set up new the purchase invoice discount terms.
4. On the **Vendor Card** page, choose the **Invoice Discounts** action. The **Vend. Invoice Discounts** page opens.
5. In the **Currency Code** field, enter the code for a currency that the invoice discount terms on the line applies to. Leave the field blank to set up invoice discount terms in USD.
6. In the **Minimum Amount** field, enter the minimum amount that an invoice must have to be eligible for the discount.
7. In the **Discount %** field, enter the invoice discount as a percentage of the invoice amount.
8. Repeat steps 5 through 7 for each currency that the vendor will receive a different invoice discount for.

The invoice discount is now set up and assigned to the vendor in question. When you select the vendor code in the **Invoice Disc. Code** field on other vendor cards, the same invoice discount is assigned to those vendors.

## To choose a principle for posting purchase discounts

When you post a purchase invoice that includes one or more discounts, you can choose between two principles for posting discount amounts. You can post discounts separately or you can subtract discounts from invoice discounts.  

Before you can do this, you must have already set up the necessary accounts for posting discount amounts in the chart of accounts. You must also check that you have entered the correct account numbers in the general posting setup in the **Purch. Line Disc. Account** and **Purch. Inv. Disc. Account** fields.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchases & Payables Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. In the **Discount Posting** field, choose one of the following principles for posting discounts.

|**Discount Posting Principle**|**Invoice Discount**|**Line Discount**|  
|------------------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------|  
|**All Discounts**|Posted separately|Posted separately|  
|**Invoice Discounts**|Posted separately|Subtracted|  
|**Line Discounts**|Subtracted|Posted separately|  
|**No Discounts**|Subtracted|Subtracted|  

## Purchase invoice discounts and service charges

If you have fixed terms for invoice discounts with any vendors, you can enter them for those vendors. Then the discount will be calculated when you fill in a purchase invoice.  

Before you can use invoice discounts with purchases, you must specify the vendors that offer you the discounts.  

You link discount percentages to specific invoice amounts in **Vend. Invoice Discounts** pages. You can enter any number of percentages in each page. Each vendor can have its own page, or you can link several vendors to the same page.  

In addition to a discount percentage, you can link a service charge amount to a specific invoice amount.  

You can define the terms of the invoice discount in LCY for domestic vendors and in foreign currency for foreign vendors.  

You can choose to have [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically calculate the invoice discounts for quotes, blanket orders, orders, invoices, or credit memos.  

> [!TIP]  
> Before you enter this information, it is a good idea to prepare an outline of the discount structure that you want to use. This makes it easier to see which vendors can be linked to the same invoice discount page. The fewer pages that you have to set up, the faster that you can enter the basic information.

## Best price calculation

When you have recorded special prices and line discounts for sales and purchases, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] ensures that your profit on item trade is always optimal by automatically calculating the best price on sales and purchase documents and on project and item journal lines.

The best price is the lowest permissible price with the highest permissible line discount on a given date. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically calculates this price when it inserts the unit price and the line discount percentage for items on new document and journal lines.

> [!NOTE]  
> The following describes how the best price is calculated for sales. The calculation is the same for purchases.

1. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] checks the combination of the bill-to customer and the item and then calculates the applicable unit price and line discount percentage, using the following criteria:

    - Does the customer have a price/discount agreement, or does the customer belong to a group that does?
    - Is the item or the item discount group on the line included in any of these price/discount agreements?
    - Is the order date (or the posting date for the invoice and credit memo) within the starting and ending date of the price/discount agreement?
    - Is a unit of measure code specified? If so, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] checks for prices/discounts with the same unit of measure code, and prices/discounts with no unit of measure code.

2. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] checks if any price/discount agreements apply to information on the document or journal line, and then inserts the applicable unit price and line discount percentage, using the following criteria:

    - Is there a minimum quantity requirement in the price/discount agreement that is fulfilled?
    - Is there a currency requirement in the price/discount agreement that is fulfilled? If so, the lowest price and the highest line discount for that currency are inserted, even if LCY would provide a better price. If there is no price/discount agreement for the specified currency code, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] inserts the lowest price and the highest line discount in LCY.

If no special price can be calculated for the item on the line, then either the last direct cost or the unit price from the item card is inserted.

# Display a stockout warning

When someone enters a quantity for an item on a sales document that exceeds the item's current inventory level at the location, you might want to let them know by displaying a notification. The notification is just to inform them of the potential problem, and doesn't prevent them from creating the order.

## To show a warning about low inventory on a sales document

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales & Receivables Setup**, and then choose the related link.
1. Depending on whether you want to show the warning, turn on or turn off the **Stockout Warning" toggle.

## Video guidance

The following video shows a scenario where someone is creating a sales order, and the quantity exceeds the available inventory level for the item at its location.

# Create users according to licenses

[!INCLUDE[azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id](~/../shared-content/shared/azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id.md)]

[!INCLUDE [2023rw1-sec-group-short](includes/2023rw1-sec-group-short.md)]

This article describes how administrators create users and define who can sign in to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. This article also describes how to assign permissions to different users according to your product licenses.

When you create users in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you grant permissions to them through permission sets. You can also organize users in user groups. User groups make it easier to manage permissions and other settings for multiple users at the same time. For more information, see [Assign Permissions to Users and Groups](ui-define-granular-permissions.md).  

For more information about the different types of licenses and how licensing works in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], [download the Dynamics 365 Licensing Guide](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=866544).

> [!NOTE]
> The process of managing users and licenses varies depending on whether [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is deployed online or on-premises. For [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, you must add users from Microsoft 365. In on-premises deployments, you can create, edit, and delete users directly.  

## Manage users and licenses in online tenants

User accounts in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] must be first created in the Microsoft 365 admin center. These user accounts aren't exclusive to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. If you subscribe to other plans, they can be used to sign in to other applications, such as Power BI. For information about creating users in the Microsoft 365 admin center, go to [Add users in Microsoft admin center](/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/add-users).

Your subscription to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online defines how many [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] user licenses you're allowed. Users are added to your tenant in the Microsoft Partner Center, typically by your Microsoft partner. For more information, see [Administration of Business Central Online](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/tenant-administration).

You assign licenses to users according to the work each user does in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. You can assign licenses in several ways:

- Your company's Microsoft 365 administrator can do it in the [Microsoft 365 Admin Center](https://admin.microsoft.com). For more information, see [Add users individually or in bulk to Microsoft 365](/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/add-users).  
- A Microsoft partner can assign licenses in the Microsoft 365 Admin Center or in the Microsoft Partner Center. For more information, see [User management tasks for customer accounts](/partner-center/assign-licenses-to-users) in the Microsoft Partner Center Help.

For more information, see [Administration of Business Central Online](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/tenant-administration) in the administration Help.

After user accounts are created in the Microsoft 365 admin center, there are two ways to import them to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]:

- A user account is imported automatically when the user signs in to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] the first time.

   > [!NOTE]
   > After a user signs in to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, you can't delete the user.

- The administrator can import users by choosing the **Update Users from Microsoft 365** action on the **Users* page.

Both approaches have their own advantages, and you can use them simultaneously. Each approach allows administrators to proactively configure [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to assign the starting permissions, user groups, and user profiles. Using the **Update Users from Microsoft 365** action gives administrators more control to adjust permissions, user groups, and profiles. It's an ideal approach when you're setting up [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] the first time, before any users sign in, or when adding a new team of users.

> [!NOTE]
> After you add users in the Microsoft 365 Admin Center, we recommend that you update the user information in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] as soon as possible. Keeping user information current is easy to do, and helps ensure that people can always sign in. For more information, see [To add users or update user information and license assignments in Business Central](#adduser).<br>
>
> Updating user information is especially important if you've customized permission sets for the license. If a new user tries to sign in to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] before you've added them, they might not be able to. For more information, see [Configure permissions based on licenses](#licensespermissions).
>
> However, users who experience this problem aren't actually blocked. They can either use the **Go back home** action, or simply sign in again to resolve the issue.

[!INCLUDE [admin-gdap-users](includes/admin-gdap-users.md)]

For more information, see [Delegated administrator access to Business Central Online](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/delegated-admin).  

### <a name="licensespermissions"></a>Configure permissions based on licenses

[!INCLUDE [2022_releasewave1](includes/2022_releasewave1.md)]

Admins can configure permissions sets and user groups for each license.<!--Note to translators: The names in *italics* or capitalized in this section must not be translated.-->  

For example, the commonly used license, *Dynamics 365 Business Central Team Member*, has the following permissions sets by default:

- D365 READ
- D365 TEAM MEMBER
- EDIT IN EXCEL - VIEW
- EXPORT REPORT EXCEL
- LOCAL

Other permission sets are added automatically based on the user groups assigned to the license. When you create a new user based on this license, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] assigns the permission sets originating from the user groups and the permission sets from the license. The same starting permissions are assigned to the user if their user account was created automatically in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] or if the administrator used the **Update Users from Microsoft 365** action in the **Users** page.

If this default configuration isn't the right setup for a particular environment, the admin can change that configuration. However, customized permissions affect only new users who are assigned that license. Permissions for existing users who are assigned the license aren't affected.  

1. Sign in to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] using an administrator account.  
2. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **License Configuration**, and then choose the related link.  

    <!--Alternatively, if you're already in the **Users** page, you can run the **Update Users from Microsoft 365** guide, and then, on the first page of the guide, choose the **Configure permissions per license** link.-->  
3. In the **License Configuration** page, choose the license that you want to customize, and then choose the **Configure** action.  
4. Choose the **Customize permissions** field to switch on customization, and then make the changes.  

    In our example, the admin wants to remove the permission to edit in Excel, so they remove the *Excel Export Action* user group from the Team Member license. Afterward, new users who are assigned the Team Member license can't export data to Excel. If the organization changes their minds on the subject, they can just go back to the **License Configuration** page and switch off the customization for that license type.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This customization of permissions only takes effect for new users that you assign the relevant license. Existing users are not updated. We recommend that you customize permissions before you start assigning users licenses in the Microsoft 365 admin center.

### <a name="adduser"></a>To add users or update user information and license assignments in Business Central

After you add users or change user information in the Microsoft 365 Admin Center, you can quickly import the user information to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The import includes license assignments.  

> [!TIP]
> If you need to update user information and you have a lot of users, you can use the filter pane to narrow down the list. You can filter on basic information such as the user name, or set more technical filters, such as the user's security ID.

1. Sign in to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] using an administrator account.
2. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Users**, and then choose the related link.  
3. Choose **Update Users from Microsoft 365**.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Running the synchronization of users from Microsoft 365 using the **Update Users from Microsoft 365** guide, requires the SUPER permission set.

> [!NOTE]
> The **Update Users from Microsoft 365** guide doesn't update users that are not assigned a license, such as someone who is a [Dynamics 365 administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#dynamics-365-administrator). Those users will update the next time they sign in to the environment.

The next step for newly created users is to assign user groups and permissions. Go to [Assign Permissions to Users and Groups](ui-define-granular-permissions.md) for information. If you update a user with a license change, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] assigns users to the appropriate user group and updates their permission sets. For more information, see [To manage permissions through user groups](ui-define-granular-permissions.md).  

> [!NOTE]
> With 2024 release wave 1, a Premium license user can sign in to a company where the **User Experience** field is set to **Essentials** on the **Company Information** page. However, the Premium user can't use any of the features that the Premium license provides. This doesn't work in the opposite direction. Users who have an Essentials license can't sign in to a company where the **User Experience** is set to **Premium** on the **Company Information** page. For more information about licensing, go to [Business Central](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/business-central/overview/) website.

If you use an external accountant to manage your books and financial reporting, you can invite them to your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] so they can work with you on your fiscal data. For more information, see [Inviting Your External Accountant to Your Business Central](finance-accounting.md#inviteaccountant).

For more information about synchronizing user information with Microsoft 365, go to the [Synchronization with Microsoft 365](#m365) section.

> [!NOTE]
> If you use an external accountant to manage your books and financial reporting, you can invite them to your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] so they can work with you on your fiscal data. For more information, see [Inviting Your External Accountant to Your Business Central](finance-accounting.md#inviteaccountant).

### To remove a user's access to the system

You can remove a user's access to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online. All references to the user are kept. However, the user can't sign in and active sessions for the user are stopped.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Users**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the **User Card** page for the relevant user, and then, in the **Status** field, select **Disabled**.
3. To give the user access again, set the **Status** field to **Enabled**.

You can also remove the license from a user in the Microsoft 365 Admin Center. The user is then unable to sign in. For more information, see [Remove licenses from users](/microsoft-365/admin/manage/remove-licenses-from-users).

### <a name="m365"></a>Synchronization with Microsoft 365

When you assign a license for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to a user in Microsoft 365, there are two ways to create the user in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

- The administrator can add the user by choosing the **Update Users from Microsoft 365** action on the **Users** page as described in the [To add a user or update user information in Business Central](#adduser) section.
- The license information updates automatically when the user signs in for the first time.

In both cases, several settings are applied automatically. These settings are listed in the second and third columns in the following table.

If you change user information in Microsoft 365, you can update [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to reflect the change. Depending on what you want to update, use one of the actions on the **Users** page. The actions are described in the last two columns in the following table.

|What happens when:|First user, first sign-in|Update Users from Microsoft 365|Restore User Default User Groups|
|-|-|-|-|
|Scope:|Current user|Multiple selected users|Single selected user (except current)|
|Create the new user and assign SUPER permission set.<br /><br /><!--Platform-->|**X**|**X** | | 
|Update the user based on information in Microsoft 365: Status, Full Name, Contact Email, Authentication Email.<!--<br /><br />Codeunit "Azure AD   Graph User".UpdateUserFromAzureGraph-->|**X**|**X**|**X**|
|Synchronize user plans (licenses) with licenses and roles assigned in Microsoft 365.<!--<br /><br />Codeunit "Azure AD   Graph User".UpdateUserPlans-->|**X**|**X**|**X**|
|Add the user to user groups according to the current user plans. Remove the SUPER permission set for all users other than the first user to sign in and [administrators](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/tenant-administration). At least one SUPER is required.<!--<br /><br />Codeunit "Permission Manager". AddUserToDefaultUserGroups-->|**X**|**X**|**X**<br /><br />Removes manually assigned user groups and permissions.|

Users can access [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] records in Teams using only their Microsoft 365 license. When access is enabled for an environment, synchronizing using the **Update users from Microsoft 365** action skips users that only have a Microsoft 365 license. To include these users in synchronization, you must first update environment settings by assigning a security group that contains users with a [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] license and users with only a Microsoft 365 license.

Learn about securing access to environments using security groups at [Manage access using Microsoft Entra groups](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/tenant-admin-center-manage-access#manage-access-using-azure-active-directory-groups).

Get an overview of accessing [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in Teams with Microsoft 365 licenses at [admin-access-with-m365-license](admin-access-with-m365-license.md).

## Manage users and licenses in on-premises deployments

For on-premises deployments, the number of user licenses is specified in the license file (.bclicense or .flf). When an administrator or Microsoft partner uploads the license file, they can specify which users can sign in to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

For on-premises deployments, the administrator creates, edits, and deletes users directly from the **Users** page.

### To edit or delete a user in an on-premises deployment

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Users**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the user that you want to edit, and then choose the **Edit** action.
3. On the **User Card** page, change the information as necessary.  
4. To delete a user, select the user that you want to delete, and then choose the **Delete** action.

> [!NOTE]
> For on-premises deployments an administrator can specify how to authenticate user credentials in the [!INCLUDE[server](includes/server.md)] instance. When you create a user, you provide the credential type that you are using.
>
> For more information, see the [Authentication and Credential Types](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/users-credential-types) in the administration Help for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## Analyze user status by license type

You can use the **Data Analysis** feature to analyze data on the [Users](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=9800&layout=analysis) page. You don't have to run a report or open another application, such as Excel. The feature provides an interactive and versatile way to calculate, summarize, and examine data. Instead of running reports using options and filters, you can add multiple tabs that represent different tasks or views on the data. Some examples are "Users by status" or "Users by license type," or any other view you can imagine. To learn more about how to use the **Data Analysis** feature, go to [Analyze list and query data with analysis mode](analysis-mode.md).

### User analysis scenarios

The following sections provide examples of scenarios where analyzing the user list can help you monitor the status of your users.

| Area | To... | Open this page in analysis mode | Using these fields |
| ---- | ----- | ------------------------------- |------------------- |
| [Users by status](#example-users-by-status) | See a list of users based on their status (enabled/disabled). | [Users](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=9800&layout=analysis) | **Status**, **User Name**, **Full Name**, **Authorization email**, and **License Type**. |
| [Users by license type](#example-users-by-license-type) | See a list of users based on their license type. | [Users](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=9800&layout=analysis) | **License Type**, **Status**,  **User Name**, **Full Name**, and **Authorization email**. |

### Example: Users by status

To analyze users by status, follow these steps:

1. Open the [Users](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=9800&layout=analysis) list, and choose the :::image type="content" source="media/analysis-mode-icon.png" alt-text="Enter analysis mode."::: icon to turn on analysis mode.
1. On the **Columns** menu, remove all columns (select the box next to the **Search** field on the right).
1. Drag the **Status** (user enabled/disabled) and **License Type** fields to the **Row Groups** area.
1. Choose the fields **User Name**, **Full Name**, and **Authorization email**.
1. Rename your analysis tab to **Users by status**, or something that describes this analysis.

The following image shows the result of these steps.

# Accountant experiences in Business Central

[!INCLUDE[azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id](~/../shared-content/shared/azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id.md)]

Any business must do its books and sign off on the accounting. Some businesses employ an external accountant, and others have an accountant on staff. No matter what type of accountant you are, you can use the **Accountant** Role Center as your Home in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. From here, you can access all pages that you need in your work.  

## Accountant Role Center

The Role Center is a dashboard with activity tiles that show you real-time key figures and give you quick access to data. The ribbon at the top of the page gives you access to more actions. For example, to open financial reports and statements in Excel. In the navigation bar at the top, you can quickly switch between the lists you use most often. Here, there are other areas, such as **Posted Documents** with the various types of documents that the company posted.  

If you're new to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], select **Product Videos** to watch videos or **Get Started** for a tour of key areas in the Role Center.

## Company Hub

If you work in multiple [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] companies, use the **Company Hub** page to keep track of work. For more information, see [Manage Work across Multiple Companies in the Company Hub](company-hub.md).  

## <a name="inviteaccountant"></a>Inviting a third-party accountant to your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]

If a third-party accountant manages your books and financial reporting, your administrator can invite them to your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] so they can work with you on your fiscal data. Both the Premium and Essentials [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] licenses let you procure up to three **External Accountant** licenses per customer tenant. The licenses are free, but you do need to procure them like you would other licenses. To learn more about licensing, download the [Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central Licensing Guide](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=866544).

After your accountant can access your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], they can use the **Accountant** Role Center for easy access to the pages for their work. They can also use the company hub in their own [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to manage their work. Learn more in [Manage Work across Multiple Companies in the Company Hub](company-hub.md).  

> [!Video https://learn-video.azurefd.net/vod/player?id=7ba6427f-cdf0-480d-8c98-b51f65437146]

It's easy to invite your external accountant. In [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], open the **Users** page, and then select the **Invite external accountant** action. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] prepares an email for you. Just add your accountant's work email, and send the invitation.  

> [!Note]  
> This action requires that you set up email in your [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to use SMTP. Learn more in [Set Up Email](admin-how-setup-email.md).  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The accountant's email address must be a work address based on Microsoft Entra ID. If the accountant uses another type of email, the invitation can't be sent.
>
> This task requires access to managing users and licenses in Microsoft Entra ID. The user who sends this invitation must be assigned at least the [User Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#user-administrator) role in the Microsoft 365 admin center. Learn more in [About admin roles](/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/about-admin-roles) in the Microsoft 365 admin content.  

### Add your accountant to your Microsoft 365 tenant

If your admin or reselling partner prefers not to use the **Invite External Accountant** guide, you can add an external user to the Microsoft Entra tenant used by Business Central and assign them the *External Accountant* license. You can add a user using the Microsoft 365 admin center, Microsoft Entra admin center, or Azure portal. The following procedure uses the Microsoft admin center. Learn about using the Microsoft Entra admin center at [Quickstart: Add a guest user and send an invitation](/azure/active-directory/b2b/b2b-quickstart-add-guest-users-portal).

#### Add your accountant as a guest user

1. Sign in to [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com) as at least a [User Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#user-administrator).
1. In the navigation pane, select **Users**.
1. On the **Users** page, select **New user**, and then **Invite external user**.
1. On the **Invite external user** page, add the accountant's email address and other information about them.  

   Optionally, include a personal welcome message to let the accountant know that you're adding them to your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

1. When you're finished, select **Review + Invite**.
1. Review the information, and then choose **Invite**.

After you send the invitation, the external user receives an email invitation to join your organization. After they accept the invitation, the user account is added as a guest.

Next, assign the guest user a license to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

#### Give your accountant access to your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]

1. In the [Microsoft admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com), **Users** > **Guest users**.
1. Select the accountant's guest user account in the list, then select **Manage product licenses** to open the guest user profile pane.
1. Under **Licenses and apps**, select **Dynamics 365 Business Central External Accountant** license.  

   If this license isn't available, contact your reselling partner to add the license to your subscription.

   Specifically for evaluation purposes in a trial tenant, you can use an available **Dynamics 365 Business Central for IWs** license instead. However, you can't use this type of license if you already purchased [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].
1. Select **Save changes**.

If successful, the license is assigned to the guest user, and the guest account is created.

### Import the new user into [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]

The accountant receives an email notifying them that they have access to your Microsoft Entra ID. Next, give them access to the correct company in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

#### Add the accountant to the correct company

1. Sign in to [Business Central](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com).
1. Open company that you want to give the accountant access to. Learn more in [Switching to Another Company or Environment](ui-organization-switch.md).
1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Users**, and then select the related link.  
1. Select the **Get New Users from Microsoft 365** action.

This action imports the user account that you created in the Azure portal to the company. Learn more in [To add a user in Business Central](ui-how-users-permissions.md#adduser).  

If you want to give access to multiple companies, then you must sign in to each company and repeat this process. Alternatively, you can update the permission groups for the accountant's user profile in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], such as assigning them the *D365 Bus Premium* user group. Learn more in [Assign Permissions to Users and Groups](ui-define-granular-permissions.md).  

### Inform your external accountant how to sign in to Business Central

Unlike internal users who access Business Central using the common URL `https://businesscentral.dynamics.com`, guest users must use the fully qualified domain name. The fully qualified domain name has the format `https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/<tenant ID or domain name>`, such as `https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/aaaabbbb-0000-cccc-1111-dddd2222eeee` or `https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/contoso.com`.

Guest users can sign in using two methods. They can open their browser, enter the fully qualified domain name in the address bar, and sign in using their username and password. Alternatively, they can:

1. Enter `https://businesscentral.dynamics.com` in the browser address bar.
1. Select **Sign in options**.
1. Select **Sign in to an organization**.
1. Enter the domain name of your organization, for example `contoso.com`, and then select **Next**.
1. Sign in using their username and password.

# Access Data in Teams without Business Central License

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] users are assigned a Dynamics 365 Business Central license that allows them to view, modify, and act on their business data within Teams. These users can collaborate on data by sharing records into chats or channels, or adding tabs that show records. However, there may be other employees across the organization who don't have a Business Central license but could benefit by being able to view data in Teams. For these users, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers limited access through their Microsoft 365 licenses only.  

As an administrator, you can configure environments to enable access with Microsoft 365 licenses. You can then choose exactly which tables and other objects this category of user will have access to. Once configured, employees who have a Microsoft 365 license, but no Business Central license, can view Business Central records that are shared with them in Microsoft Teams chat and channels.

To learn more about access with Microsoft 365 Licenses, go to [Business Central Access with Microsoft 365 Licenses](admin-access-with-m365-license.md) and [Access with Microsoft 365 Licenses FAQ](admin-access-with-m365-license-faq.md).

# Responding to requests about users' personal data

Data subjects can request several types of actions regarding their personal data. For example, under some privacy laws and regulations, they have the right to request the export, deletion, and modification of their personal data. These requests are called *Data Subject Requests*. If you have classified the sensitivity of your data, and are sure they are correct, an administrator can respond to requests by using the options in the **Data Privacy** tab in the **Administration of users, security groups and permissions** Role Center.

## Types of requests

The following table provides examples of the types of requests administrators can respond to.

> [!Note]
> While we provide capabilities for responding to these types of request, and thereby accessing, personal data, it's your responsibility to ensure that personal and sensitive data are located and classified appropriately.

|Request Type|Description and Suggested Response|
|-----|-----|
|Portability requests|A data subject can make a data portability request. You must export the data subject's personal data from your systems and provide it in a structured, commonly used format. To respond to these requests, you can use the **Data Privacy Utility** to export personal data to an Excel file or a RapidStart configuration package. Using Excel, you can edit the personal data and save it in a commonly used, machine-readable format, such as .csv or .xml. For RapidStart configuration packages, you can configure master data tables and their related tables that contain personal data. <br><br> **Note:** When you export data, you specify a minimum sensitivity level. The export includes the minimum and all sensitivity levels above it. For example, if you export data that is classified as Personal, the export also includes data classified as Sensitive. <br><br>When exporting data related to a data subject, the **Data Privacy Utility** looks for direct relationships between the data subject and data related to the data subject. Indirect relationships between data related to the data subject and other data are not exported automatically by the **Data Privacy Utility**. For example, the Contact table has directly related Contact Profile Answers data, and the Contact Profile Answers table is further related to Profile Questions data. If you want to export Profile Questions as well, you must add this table manually as a row with the appropriate filters in the configuration package that the **Data Privacy Utility** creates.<br><br>The **Data Privacy Utility** only considers tables of the type **Normal**. Data in other types of tables, such as CDS, CRM, ExternalSQL, and others resides in external systems, and portability requests should be handled in those systems.|
|Requests for deletion|A data subject can request that you delete their personal data. There are several ways to delete personal data using the customization capabilities, but the decision and implementation is your responsibility. In some cases, you might choose to directly edit your data. For example, delete a contact and then run the Delete Canceled Interaction batch job to delete interactions for the contact. <br><br> **Note:** If you've specified a date in the **Allow Document Deletion Before** field on the **Sales & Receivables Setup** or **Purchases & Payables Setup** pages, you might need to change the date so that you can delete posted sales and purchase documents that have posting dates on or before that date.|
|Requests for correction|A data subject can request that you correct inaccurate personal data. There are several ways to do so. In some cases, you can export lists to Excel to quickly bulk-edit multiple records, and then import the updated data. For more information, see [Exporting your Business Data to Excel](about-export-data.md). You can also manually edit fields that contain personal data, such as editing information about a customer in the Customer card. However, records such as general, customer, and tax ledger entries are important. If you store personal data in business transaction records, consider using the customization capabilities to modify such personal data.|

## Restrict data processing for a data subject

A data subject can request that you temporarily stop processing their personal data. To honor such requests, you can mark their record as blocked due to privacy to stop processing their data. When a record is marked as blocked, you cannot create new transactions that use that record. For example, you cannot create a new invoice for a customer when either the customer or the salesperson is blocked. To mark a data subject as blocked, open the card for the data subject, for example the Customer, Vendor, or Contact cards, and choose the **Privacy Blocked** check box. You may need to choose **Show More** to display the field.  

## Handling data subject requests when using a trial version

Certain types of personal data are part of a Microsoft 365 account, and only administrators can export the data. The process for handling data subject requests is different depending on the type of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] tenant.

If you have a paid subscription for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], users must contact their organization's tenant administrator to make a data subject request. Administrators have the administrative rights and tools to fulfill data subject requests.

If you signed up for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] from the [Trials](https://trials.dynamics.com/) page, and you're still using the trial version, users can download and export their own data in the [Work and School Privacy page in the Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/GDPRViralBlade).

On the Work and School Privacy page, you can also close your account. However, we recommend that you export and delete all data first. Deleting your account means that you lose access to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

You can still mark people as blocked due to privacy and export, edit, or delete transactions as explained elsewhere in this article.  

## Exporting data from tables not classified by data subject

If you must export data that isn't classified in a way so that it's automatically exported, such as data from the Profile Answers table, you must take the following actions:

* Consider whether you really must export supplemental data that isn't directly related to the contact.
* Add the table and relationship manually to the Rapid Start package and export it directly from the Rapid Start package. We generate a Rapid Start package for you, so that you can tweak it in such situations.

## Handling data about minors

If a contact person's age is below the age of legal consent according to the laws in your region, you can indicate that by choosing the **Minor** check box on the **Contact** card. When you do, the **Privacy Blocked** check box is automatically selected. When you receive consent from the minor's parent or legal guardian, you can choose the **Parental Consent Received** check box to unblock the contact. Though you can process personal data for minors, you cannot use the profiling functionality in Dynamics 365 Sales.

> [!Note]
> The Change Log can record details such as when, and by whom, the **Parental Consent Received** check box was chosen. An administrator can set that up by using the **Change Log Setup** guide, and also choosing the **Log Modification for Parental Consent Received** check box on the **Contact** card. For more information, see [Logging Changes](across-log-changes.md).

# Suggest substitute items with Copilot

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](includes/preview-banner.md)]

This article explains how to find and assign substitute items faster by letting Copilot suggest the items to add.

[!INCLUDE [production-ready-preview-dynamics365](includes/production-ready-preview-dynamics365.md)]

## About item substitution suggestions

To ensure they can fulfill orders quickly, businesses often assign similar items to each other so they can use them as substitutes. For example, substitutes are good to have when the item that was originally requested is out of stock. Finding and assigning the right items to use as substitutes can be time consuming, and that's where Copilot can help. The suggest item substitutions capability for Copilot can speed up the process of finding similar items.

Information about products is stored in multiple places in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For example, item numbers and descriptions are stored in the Item table, multiple barcodes are stored in the Item Reference table, and item properties are stored in the Item Attributes table. Copilot uses a large language model combined with embedded search to comb through this information and suggest items that might be good substitutes. While you might prompt for *Red bicycle*, the actual product might be *Crimson Tourer**, where *Bicycle* is an item category and *Red* is an attribute.

## Available languages

[!INCLUDE [copilot-geo-and-language-availability](includes/copilot-geo-and-language-availability.md)]

## Prerequisites

- Your administrator must activate the **Create product information** capability on the **Copilot & agent capabilities** page. [Learn more about how to configure Copilot and agent capabilities](enable-ai.md).
- You're familiar with creating and managing product (item) information.

## Suggest item substitutions on item substitution entries

This process describes how to get Copilot to suggest substitute items.

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, and then select the related link.
2. Select the item you want Copilot to find substitutes for.
3. Choose the **Substitutions** action.
4. On the **Item Substitution Entry** page, choose **Suggest with Copilot**.
5. Review the suggestions. To learn more, go to [Review, save, discard, or regenerate suggestions](#review-save-discard-or-regenerate-suggestions).

## Adjust the search

By default, the capability uses the item description as search criteria, which you can adjust if you want to fine-tune the search results. To edit the prompt, select the :::image type="content" source="media/edit-pencil.png" alt-text="Edit the prompt."::: icon in the Copilot window. For example, you can add more details to the prompt such as colors, sizes, or other item attributes.

## Review, save, discard, or regenerate suggestions

After Copilot suggests the items to add, review the suggestions and decide whether they're what you want:

- To discard a single proposed line, select it in the list, and then choose the **Delete Line** action.
- To discard all proposed lines and close the Copilot window, choose **Discard** (trash can).
- To transfer the lines shown in the Copilot window, choose **Insert all**. This step confirms that you want to transfer the lines to the **Item Substitution Entry** page. You can delete or edit the transferred lines there as well. The **Score** field that displays **High (85+)**, **Medium (83-85)**, and **Low (79-83)** scores and points you to lines that need attention.

# Set Up Locations to Use Bins

Bins represent the basic warehouse structure, and you use them to suggest where to place items. After you create your bins you define their contents, or let them serve as floating bins without specific contents.

To use the bin functionality at a location, turn on the **Bin Mandatory** toggle on the **Location** card. After you turn on the toggle, the **Bin Code** and **Zone Code** fields are available on the following documents:

* Warehouse receipt header
* Warehouse receipt lines
* Warehouse put-away lines
* Warehouse shipment header
* Warehouse shipment lines
* Warehouse put-away lines

The next step is to design the item flow at the location by specifying bin codes in setup fields that represent the different flows.  

> [!NOTE]  
> You must create bin codes before you can specify them for the location. For more information, see [Create Bins](warehouse-how-to-create-individual-bins.md).  

## To set up a location to use bins

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Locations**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the location where you want to use bins.  
3. Choose the **Edit** action.  
4. On the **Warehouse** FastTab, select the **Bin Mandatory** checkbox.  
5. If you aren't using directed put-away and pick for the location, in the **Default Bin Selection** field, choose the method you want [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to use to assign a default bin to an item.  
6. Open the card for the location that you want to set up bins for.
7. On the **Bins** FastTab, select the bins to use as the default for receipts, shipments, inbound, outbound, and open shop floor bins.  

    The bin codes you specify appear automatically on the headers and lines of various warehouse documents. The default bins define all starting or ending placements of items in the warehouse.  
8. If you're using directed put-away and pick, select a bin for warehouse adjustments. The bin code in the **Adjustment Bin Code** field defines the virtual bin in which to record discrepancies in inventory:

    * When you observe differences registered in the warehouse item journal
    * Differences calculated when you register a warehouse physical inventory  
9. Optional: Fill in the fields on the **Bin Policies** FastTab. The most important fields are **Bin Capacity Policy**, **Allow Breakbulk**, and **Put-away Template Code** fields.  
10. On the **Warehouse** FastTab, fill in the **Outbound Whse. Handling Time**, **Inbound Whse. Handling Time**, and the **Base Calendar Code** fields. To learn more, go to [Set Up Base Calendars](across-how-to-assign-base-calendars.md).

## Fill in the consumption bin

The following flow chart shows how the **Bin Code** field on production order component lines is filled in according to your location setup.

# Design Details: Balancing supply and demand

To understand how the planning system works, it's important to understand its prioritized goals:  

* Any demand will be met by sufficient supply.  
* Any supply serves a purpose.  

Generally, these goals are achieved by balancing supply with demand.  

## Supply and demand

The term *supply* refers to any kind of positive or inbound quantity, such as:

* Inventory
* Purchases
* Assembly
* Production
* Inbound transfers
* Sales returns  

The term *demand* refers to any kind of gross demand, such as:

* An item for a sales order
* A component for a production order

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] also lets you use more technical types of demand, such as negative inventory and purchase returns.

To sort the sources of supply and demand, the planning system organizes them on two timelines called inventory profiles. One profile is for demand events, and the other is for the corresponding supply events. Each supply event represents one entity on an order, such as:

* A sales order line
* An item ledger entry
* A production order line

When inventory profiles are loaded, the demand-supply sets are balanced to output a supply plan that fulfills the listed goals.

Inventory levels and planning parameters are other types of supply and demand. These types undergo integrated balancing to replenish stock items. Learn more at [Design Details: Handling Reordering Policies](design-details-handling-reordering-policies.md).

## The concept of balancing, in brief

Demand comes from your customers. Supply is what you create and remove to establish balance. The planning system starts with the demand and then tracks backwards to the supply.  

Inventory profiles contain information about the demands and supplies, quantities, and timing. These profiles make up the two sides of the balancing scale.  

The objective of planning is to balance the supply and demand of an item to ensure that supply will match demand as defined by the planning parameters and rules.  

:::image type="content" source="media/nav_app_supply_planning_2_balancing.png" alt-text="Overview of balancing supply and demand.":::

## Process orders before the planning start date

To avoid that a supply plan shows unreasonable suggestions, the planning system won't plan anything in the period before the planning starting date. The following rule applies to that period:

* All supply and demand before the starting date of the planning period are considered part of inventory or shipped.  

With a few exceptions, the planning system won't suggest any changes to supply orders in the period or create order tracking links for that period. The following are exceptions to this rule:  

* The inventory that's projected to be available, including the sum of supply and demand in the period, is below zero.  
* Backdated orders require serial or lot numbers.  
* The supply-demand set is linked by an order-to-order policy. 

If the initial available inventory is below zero, the planning system suggests an emergency supply order on the day before the planning period to cover the missing quantity. So, the projected and available inventory will always be at least zero when planning for the future period begins. The planning line for this supply order will display an Emergency warning icon and provide additional information.

### Serial and lot numbers and order-to-order links are exempt from the previous period  

If serial or lot numbers are required or an order-to-order link exists, the planning system disregards the rule about the previous period. It will include back-dated quantities from the starting date and might suggest corrective actions if supply and demand aren't synchronized. These demand-supply sets must match to ensure that a specific demand is fulfilled.

## Load inventory profiles

To sort the sources of supply and demand, the planning system organizes them on two timelines called inventory profiles.  

Supply and demand with due dates on or after the planning starting date are loaded into each inventory profile. When loaded, the supply and demand types are sorted according to overall priorities, such as:

* Due date
* Low-level codes
* Location
* Variant

Order priorities are applied to the different types to fulfill the most important demand first. Learn more at [Prioritizing Orders](design-details-balancing-demand-and-supply.md#prioritize-orders).  

Demand can also be negative. Treat negative demand as supply. However, unlike typical supply, negative demand is considered fixed supply. The planning system can take it into account, but will not suggest changes to it.  

In general, the planning system considers all supply orders after the planning starting date as subject to change in order to fulfill demand. However, after a quantity is posted from a supply order the planning system can't change it. The following orders can't be replanned:  

* Released production orders where consumption or output has been posted.  
* Assembly orders where consumption or output has been posted.  
* Transfer orders where shipment has been posted.  
* Purchase orders where receipt has been posted.  

Apart from loading the supply and demand types, certain types are loaded with attention to special rules and dependencies. The following sections in this article describe these rules and dependencies.  

### Item dimensions are separated  

The supply plan must be calculated for each combination of the item dimensions, such as variant and location. Only the combinations that carry a demand and/or supply need to be calculated.  

The planning system looks for combinations in the inventory profile. When it finds a new combination, it creates an internal control record that holds the information about the combination. The planning system then inserts the SKU as the control record, or outer loop. As a result, the planning parameters are set according to a combination of variant and location, and the system can proceed to the inner loop. 

> [!NOTE]  
> You don't have to enter a SKU record when you enter demand and/or supply for a particular combination of variant and location. Therefore, if a SKU doesn't exist for a given combination, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates a temporary SKU record based on data from the item. If the **Location Mandatory** is toggle is turned on on the **Inventory Setup page**, you must either create a SKU or turn on the **Components at Location** toggle. Learn more at [Planning With or Without Locations](production-planning-with-without-locations.md).  

### Serial and lot numbers are loaded by specification level  

Serial and lot numbers are loaded into the inventory profiles along with the supply and demand they're assigned to.  

Supply and demand attributes are arranged by order priority and by their level of specification. Because serial and lot number matches reflect the level of specification, a more specific demand will match before a less specific demand. For example, a specific demand might be a lot number specified for a sale line. A less specific demand might be a sale from any lot number.

> [!NOTE]  
> The only dedicated prioritization rules for serial and lot-numbered supply and demand are the level of specification defined by their combinations and how item tracking is set up for the items.  

During balancing, the planning system regards supply that has serial and lot numbers as inflexible. The system won't increase or reschedule such supply orders. The one exception to this is if they're used in an order-to-order relation. Learn more at [Order-to-order links are never broken](#order-to-order-links-are-never-broken). This exception protects the supply from receiving several, possibly conflicting, action messages when it has varying attributes. For example, varying attributes might be when the supply has a collection of different serial numbers.  

Another reason why serial and lot-numbered supply are inflexible is because serial and lot numbers are often assigned late in the process. It could be confusing if changes are suggested at that point.  

Serial and lot number balancing doesn't respect the rule about not planning anything before the planning starting date. If supply and demand aren't synchronized, the planning system will suggest changes or new orders, regardless of the planning starting date.  

### Order-to-order links are never broken

When planning an order-to-order item, the linked supply must only be used for what it was originally intended. The linked demand shouldn't be covered by any other supply, even if the supply is available in time and quantity. For example, you can't use an assembly order that's linked to a sales order in an assemble-to-order scenario to cover another demand.  

Order-to-order supply and demand must balance precisely. The planning system will ensure the supply without regarding order sizing parameters, modifiers, and quantities in inventory (other than quantities relating to the linked orders). For the same reason, the system will suggest decreasing excess supplies if the linked demand is decreased.  

This balancing also affects the timing. The limited horizon that is given by the time bucket is not regarded; the supply will be rescheduled if the timing of the demand has changed. However, dampener time will be respected and will prevent order-to-order supplies from being scheduled out, except for the internal supplies of a multi-level production order (project order).  

> [!NOTE]  
> Serial and lot numbers can also be specified on order-to-order demand. In that case, the supply is not inflexible, which is normally is for serial and lot numbers. In this case, the system will increase or decrease according to changes in demand. If one demand has varying serial and lot numbers, such as more than one lot number, one supply order will be suggested for each lot.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Forecasts should not lead to creating supply orders that are bound by an order-to-order link. If the forecast is used, it should only be used as a generator of dependent demand in a manufacturing environment.

### Component need is loaded according to production order changes

When handling production orders, the planning system must monitor the needed components before loading them into the demand profile. Component lines that result from a changed production order will replace the lines of the original order. The change ensures that the planning system doesn't duplicate planning lines for a component need.  

### Consume safety stock

Safety stock quantity is a demand that's loaded into the inventory profile on the planning starting date.  

Safety stock is a quantity of inventory that's set aside to meet uncertainties in demand during replenishment. However, it can be consumed to fulfill a demand. In that case, the planning system will ensure that the safety stock is quickly replaced. The system suggests a supply order to replenish the safety stock quantity on the date it's consumed. The planning line will display an Exception warning icon explaining that the safety stock has been partly or fully consumed by an exception order for the missing quantity.  

### Forecast demand is reduced by sales orders

Demand forecasts express anticipated future demand. While actual demand is entered, typically as sales orders for produced items, it consumes the forecast.

The forecast itself is not reduced by sales orders. However, the forecast quantities that are used in the planning calculation are reduced by the sales order quantities before the remaining quantity enters the demand profile. For sales during a period, planning includes both open sales orders and item ledger entries from shipped sales. The exception to this rule is when they come from a blanket order.  

You must define a valid forecast period. The date on the forecasted quantity defines the start of the period, and the date on the next forecast defines the end of the period.  

The forecast for periods prior to the planning period isn't used, regardless of whether it was consumed. The first forecast figure of interest is either the planning starting date, or the closest date to it.  

The forecast can be for different types of demand:

* Independent demand, such as sales orders
* Dependent demand, such as production order components.

An item can have both types of forecast. During planning, consumption happens separately, first for independent demand and then for dependent demand.  

### Blanket order demand is reduced by sales orders

Forecasting is supplemented by blanket sales orders as a way to specify future demand from a specific customer. As with the (unspecified) forecast, actual sales should consume the anticipated demand, and the remaining quantity should enter the demand inventory profile. Consumption doesn't reduce the blanket order quantity.

The planning calculation includes open sales orders linked to the specific blanket order line, but it doesn't include any valid time period. Also, it doesn't include posted orders because the posting procedure has already reduced the outstanding blanket order quantity.

## Prioritize orders

Within a given SKU, the requested or available date represents the highest priority. Today's demand should be dealt with before the next week's demand. But, in addition to this overall priority, the planning system will make the following suggestions according to order priorities:

* Which type of demand you should fulfill first.
* What source of supply should be applied before applying other sources of supply.  

Loaded supply and demand contribute to a profile for projected inventory according to priorities.  

### Priorities on the demand side  

1. Already shipped: Item Ledger Entry  
2. Purchase return order  
3. Sales order  
4. Service order  
5. Production component needs  
6. Assembly order line  
7. Outbound transfer order  
8. Blanket order (that has not already been consumed by related sales orders)  
9. Forecast (that has not already been consumed by other sales orders)  

> [!NOTE]  
> Purchase returns aren't usually involved in supply planning; they should always be reserved from the lot that's going to be returned. If not reserved, purchase returns play a role in availability and are highly prioritized to avoid that the planning system suggests a supply order just to serve a purchase return.  

### Priorities on the supply side  

1. Already in inventory: Item Ledger Entry (Planning Flexibility = None)  
2. Sales return order (Planning Flexibility = None)  
3. Inbound transfer order  
4. Production order  
5. Assembly order  
6. Purchase order  

### Priority related to the state of supply and demand  

In addition to the priorities from the type of supply and demand, there are other things that affect planning flexibility. For example, warehouse activities, and the status of the following orders:

* Sales
* Purchase
* Transfer
* Assembly
* Production

The status of these orders has the following effects: 

1. Partly handled (Planning Flexibility = None)  
2. Already in process in the warehouse (Planning Flexibility = None)  
3. Released – all order types (Planning Flexibility = Unlimited)  
4. Firm Planned Production Order (Planning Flexibility = Unlimited)  
5. Planned/Open – all order types (Planning Flexibility = Unlimited)

## Balancing supply with demand

The planning system balances supply and demand by suggesting actions to revise supply orders that aren't balanced. This balance happens for each combination of variant and location.  

Imagine that each inventory profile contains two strings:

* A string of demand events, sorted by date and priority
* A corresponding string of supply events

Each event refers to its source type and identification. The rules for balancing the item are straightforward. Matching supply and demand can occur at any point in the process, as follows:  

1. No demand or supply exists for the item => the planning has finished (or should not start).  
2. Demand exists but there's no supply => supply should be suggested.  
3. Supply exists but there's no demand for it => supply should be canceled.  
4. Both supply and demand exist => questions should be asked and answered before [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can ensure that the supply can meet the demand.

    If the timing of the supply isn't suitable, perhaps the supply can be rescheduled, as follows:  

    1. If the supply is placed earlier than the demand, perhaps the supply can be scheduled out so that inventory is as low as possible.  
    2. If the supply is placed later than the demand, perhaps the supply can be scheduled forward. Otherwise, the system will suggest new supply.  
    3. If the supply meets the demand on the date, the planning system can investigate whether the quantity of the supply can cover the demand.  

    When the timing is in place, the quantity to supply can be calculated as follows:  

    1. If the supply quantity is less than the demand, the supply quantity could be increased (or not, if you have a maximum quantity policy).  
    2. If the supply quantity is greater than the demand, the supply quantity can be decreased (or not, if you have a minimum quantity policy).  

    At this point, one of these two situations exist:  

    1. The current demand can be covered, in which case it can be closed and planning for the next demand can start.  
    2. The supply has reached its maximum, leaving some of the demand quantity uncovered. In this case, the planning system can close the current supply and proceed to the next one.  

 The procedure starts all over with the next demand and the current supply, or vice versa. The current supply might be able to cover this next demand as well, or the current demand has not yet been fully covered.  

### Rules for actions for supply events

For top-down calculations in which supply must fulfill demand, the demand is taken as a given. It's outside the control of the planning system. However, the planning system can manage the supply side and will make the following suggestions:

* Create new supply orders
* Reschedule existing orders or change their quantities
* Cancel supply orders that are no longer needed  

To exclude a supply order from the planning suggestions, you can state that it has no planning flexibility (Planning Flexibility = None). Then, excess supply from that order will be used to cover demand, but no action will be suggested. 

In general, all supply has a planning flexibility that's limited by the conditions of each of the suggested actions.  

* **Reschedule Out**: The date of an existing supply order can be scheduled out to meet the demand due date unless:

  * It represents inventory (always on day zero).  
  * It has an order-to-order linked to another demand.  
  * It's outside the window for rescheduling in the time bucket.
  * There's a closer supply that could be used.  
  * On the other hand, the user may decide not to reschedule because:
  * The supply order is tied to another demand on a previous date.  
  * The needed rescheduling is so minimal it's negligible.  

* **Reschedule In**: The date of an existing supply order can be scheduled in, except under the following conditions:

  * It's linked directly to some other demand.  
  * It's outside the window for rescheduling defined by the time bucket.

> [!NOTE]  
> When planning an item using a reorder point, you can reschedule the supply order. This often happens in forward-scheduled supply orders triggered by a reorder point.

* **Increase Quantity**: The quantity of an existing supply order can be increased to meet the demand unless the supply order is linked directly to a demand by an order-to-order link.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Although you can increase the supply order, the increase might be limited due to a defined maximum order quantity.  

* **Decrease Quantity**: An existing supply order with a surplus compared to an existing demand can be decreased to meet the demand.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Although the quantity can be decreased, there might be surplus compared to the demand due to a defined minimum order quantity or order multiple. 

* **Cancel**: As a special incident of the decrease quantity action, the supply order can be canceled if it's been decreased to zero. 
* **New**: If there aren't any supply orders, or an existing order can't be changed to meet the quantity needed on the due date for the demand, a new supply order is suggested.  

### Determine the supply quantity  

You define the planning parameters that control the suggested quantity of each supply order.  

When the planning system calculates the quantity of a new supply order or the quantity to change on an existing order, the suggested quantity might differ from the actual demand.  

If a maximum inventory or fixed order quantities are selected, the suggested quantity might be increased to meet the fixed quantity or the maximum inventory. If a reordering policy uses a reorder point, the quantity may be increased at least to meet the reorder point. 

The suggested quantity might be modified in this sequence:  

1. Down to the maximum order quantity.  
2. Up to the minimum order quantity.  
3. Up to meet the nearest order multiple.

### Order tracking links during planning  

For order tracking during planning, the planning system rearranges the order tracking links for the combinations of items, variants, and locations. The system rearranges the tracking links for the following reasons:

* To verify its suggestions for covering all demand, and ensure that all supply orders are needed.  
* The order tracking links must be rebalanced regularly.  

Over time, order tracking links become out of balance. The links become out of balance because the order tracking network isn't rearranged until a demand or supply event is closed.

Before balancing supply by demand, the planning system deletes all order tracking links. During the balancing process, when a demand or supply event is closed, it creates new order tracking links between the supply and demand.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Even if the item isn't set up for dynamic order tracking, the planning system will create balanced order tracking links.

## Close balanced supply and demand

Balancing supply has three possible outcomes:

* The required quantity and date of the demand events are met and planning for them can be closed. The supply event stays open and might be able to cover the next demand. Keeping the supply event open lets the balancing procedure start over with the current supply event and the next demand.  
* The supply order can't be modified to cover all of the demand. The demand event is still open with an uncovered quantity that might be covered by the next supply event. Therefore the current supply event is closed, and balancing can start over with the current demand and the next supply event.  
* All of the demand is covered and there isn't a next demand (or there wasn't any demand at all). Surplus supply might be decreased (or canceled) and then closed. Any other supply events should also be canceled.  

Finally, the planning system will create an order tracking link between the supply and the demand.  

### Create the planning line (Suggested Action)  

If a **New**, **Change Quantity**, **Reschedule**, **Reschedule and Change Quantity**, or **Cancel** action is suggested to revise the supply order, the planning system creates a planning line in the planning worksheet. For order tracking, the planning line is created not only when the supply event is closed, but also if the demand event is closed. This is true even though the supply event is still open and might be changed when the next demand event is processed. The planning line may be changed again when it's created.

To reduce the load on the database when handling production orders, the planning line can be maintained in three levels:

* Create only the planning line with the current due date and quantity but without the routing and components.  
* Include routing: the planned routing includes calculation of starting and ending dates and times. Include routing is demanding in terms of database accesses. To determine the ending and due dates, it might be necessary to calculate the routing even if the supply event hasn't been closed. For example, if you're doing forward scheduling.  
* Include BOM explosion: can happen just before the supply event is closed.

# Managing Sales Opportunities
Any incoming lead can be considered a sales opportunity. You can create opportunities and associate them to a salesperson so that you can keep track of potential sales.

Before you can start using opportunity management, you must set up sales cycles and sales cycle stages. As you create opportunities, you should provide information about the contact, salesperson, sales cycle, and dates, as well as your estimates for the sales value of the opportunity and your estimation of the chances of its success.

The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the topics that describe them.

| To | See |

# Set Up Pricing and Additional Costs for Services
You can use the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] pricing features to set up and customize your application so that you apply and adjust pricing on service items, repairs, and orders. These pricing decisions are then easily transmitted to the invoicing process.  
  
As your implementation requires, you can set up pricing groups and map them to specific time periods, customers, or currency. You can set up fixed, minimum, or maximum pricing, depending on the service contracts that you have with customers. Finally, as you adjust your prices, you can view and approve the changes before committing them to the ledger.  

## To set up a service price group
You can set up groups containing service items that you want to receive the same special service pricing. You assign service price groups to service items on service item lines. You can also assign service price groups to service item groups.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Price Groups**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Create a new service price group.  
3. Fill in the **Code** and **Description** fields.  
4. Choose the **Setup** action.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  

 > [!Tip]
 > The **Adjustment Type** and **Amount** fields work together to specify whether an adjustment concerns a fixed amount, or applies only when the total service price exceeds or is lower than the amount in the **Amount** field.  

## To set up a service price adjustment group  
You can set up price adjustment groups to adjust service pricing of service items. For example, you can set up price adjustment groups that adjust price of freight or spare parts.  
  
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Price Adjustment Groups**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Create a new service price adjustment group.  
3. Fill in the **Code** and **Description** fields.  
4. In the **Type** field, enter the type of the entry that you want to adjust.  
  
    * To adjust only one specific entry, enter the number of this entry in the **No.** field. When you leave this field blank, your adjustment group will adjust all entries of the type defined in the **Type** field.  
    * To adjust service prices related to only one specific service, fill in the **Work Type** field. When you leave this field blank, it will just be ignored.  
  
5. In the **Description** field, enter a short description of the service price adjustment.  
6. To adjust service prices related to only one specific general product posting group, fill in the **Gen. Prod. Posting Group** field.

> [!Tip]
> You can choose **Details** to add additional information about the adjustment group. For example, you can specify which item belongs to the service price adjustment group, and whether this is an item, a resource, a resource group, or a service charge.  

## To set up additional costs for services
When you work with service items and service orders, you may need to register additional costs, such as travel costs to particular service zones or starting fees. When you create a service order, you can insert these costs and a line with the type **Cost** will be added to the order. Alternatively, if you want to apply the cost to all service orders, you can set up a default cost. For example, if you always want to apply a starting fee.
  
### To set up service costs
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Costs**, and then choose the related link. 
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  

### To specify a default cost for service orders
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Setup**, and then choose the related link. 
2. In the **Service Order Starting Fee** field, choose the appropriate service cost.

# Purchase items for a sale by creating purchase invoices

From sales orders and sales invoices, you can use functions to quickly create purchase documents for missing item quantities that are required by the sale. You can use two different functions depending on the document type.

> [!Note]
> This functionality is for replenishing sales items into your own inventory. To purchase items for direct delivery from your vendor to your customer, you must create a drop shipment. For more information, see [Make Drop Shipments](sales-how-drop-shipment.md).   

|Function|Description|
|--------|-----------|
|**Create Purchase Orders**|From a sales order, this function creates a purchase order for each vendor of items on the sales order. You can edit the purchase quantity before you create the purchase orders. Only unavailable sales quantities are suggested.
|**Create Purchase Invoice**|From a sales order and from a sales invoice, this function creates a purchase invoice for a selected vendor for all lines or selected lines on the sales document. The full sales quantity is suggested.|

## To create one or more purchase orders from a sales order
To create a purchase order for each unavailable item quantity on the sales order, you use the **Create Purchase Orders** function.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Orders**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open a sales order that you want to purchase items for.
3. Choose the **Create Purchase Orders** action.

    The **Create Purchase Orders** page opens showing a line for each different item on the sales order. Lines for both fully available sales quantities and unavailable sales quantities (grayed) are shown by default. You can choose the **Show Unavailable** action to only see lines for unavailable sales quantities.

    The **Quantity to Purchase** field contains the unavailable sales quantity by default.
4. To purchase another quantity than the unavailable sales quantity, edit the value in the **Quantity to Purchase** field.

    > [!NOTE]  
    >   You can also change the **Quantity to Purchase** field on grayed lines even though they represent fully available sales quantities.
5. Choose the **OK** button.

    A purchase order is created for each vendor of items on the sales order, including any quantity changes that you made on the **Create Purchase Orders** page.
7. Proceed to process the purchase order or orders, for example, by editing or adding purchase order lines. For more information, see [Record Purchases](purchasing-how-record-purchases.md).


## To create a purchase invoice from a sales order or sales invoice
To create a single purchase invoice for one or more lines on a sales document by first selecting which vendor to buy from, you use the **Create Purchase Invoice** function.

> [!NOTE]  
>   This function creates a purchase invoice for the exact item quantity on the selected sales document. To change the purchase quantity, you must edit the purchase invoice after it is created.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Orders**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open a sales invoice that you want to purchase items for.
3. Select one or more sales invoice lines that you want to use on the purchase invoice. To use all the sales invoice lines, select either all of them or don't select any lines.
4. Choose the **Create Purchase Invoice** action.
5. Select either **All Lines** or **Selected Lines**, and then choose the **OK** button.  
6. In the list of vendors that appears, select the vendor that you want to buy all the items from, and then choose the **OK** button.

    A purchase invoice is created that contains one, more than one, or all the lines on the sales invoice.
7. Proceed to process the purchase invoice, for example, by editing or adding purchase invoice lines. For more information, see [Record Purchases](purchasing-how-record-purchases.md).

# Batch post production consumption

If the flushing method is **Manual**, use a consumption journal to post the components manually.  

> [!NOTE]
> If you select the **Inventory Pick/Movement** option in the **Prod. Consumption Whse. Handling** field on the location card to indicate that the location requires inventory pick processing, you don't need to use this batch job. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] handles consumption when you post the inventory pick. To learn more, go to [Pick for Production in Basic Warehouse Configurations](warehouse-how-to-pick-for-production.md).  

You can also set up [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to automatically post (*flush*) components when you start or finish production orders. To learn more, go to [Enable Flushing of Components According to Operation Output](production-how-to-flush-components-according-to-operation-output.md).

## To post consumption for one or more production order lines

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Consumption Journal**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields with the production order data and the consumption data. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  

    Use the **Calc. Consumption** action to generate journal lines from production orders based on the actual output (the quantity of finished goods that you reported) or on the expected output (the quantity of finished goods that you expect to produce).

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you configured the location to require warehouse pick processing, only quantities that are already picked through a warehouse activity can be entered in the **Quantity** field in the **Consumption Journal** page. It can't be a calculated quantity. To learn more, go to [Pick for Production or Assembly in Advanced Warehouse Configurations](warehouse-how-to-pick-for-internal-operations-in-advanced-warehousing.md).

3. Choose the **Post** action to post the consumption. The related inventories are reduced.

# Track packages
Most shipping agents provide a web service that lets you track the status of your packages while they're en route. That information can be useful in many business processes, for example, when providing customer service. If you use one or more shipping agents, you can enter some basic information about them, and then use their package tracking service directly from the Posted Sales Shipments, Posted Sales Invoices, Posted Sales Credit Memos, and Posted Return Receipt pages. For more information, see [Set Up Shipping Agents](sales-how-to-set-up-shipping-agents.md). 

The following procedure shows how to track a package from a posted sales shipment, but the same steps apply to enable package tracking from the Posted Sales Invoice, Posted Sales Credit Memo, and Posted Return Receipt pages.  

## To track a package

> [!NOTE]
> The following procedure uses the Posted Sales Shipment page as an example. The steps to track a package are the same on the Posted Sales Invoices, Posted Sales Credit Memos, and Posted Return Receipt pages.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Posted Sales Shipment**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the shipment you want to track, and then choose the **Update Document** action.
3. In the **Package Tracking No.** field, enter the package number you received from the shipping agent. 
4. Make sure that the correct shipping agent and the level of service are correct, and then close the page.
5. Choose the **Track Package** action to open the shipping agent's package tracking service.

# Edit Posted Documents

Sometimes you have to update a posted document because information that is relevant to the document has changed. On a posted sales document, this can be the shipping agent's package tracking number, for example. On a posted purchase document, this can be a payment reference text.

You perform the change on an editable version of the original document, indicated by "**- Update**" in the page title. The page contains a subset of the fields on the original document, of which some are non-editable fields that are shown for information only.

The functionality is available for the following documents across all supported markets:

- Posted Sales Shipment
- Posted Purchase Invoice
- Posted Return Shipment
- Posted Return Receipt

The following additional documents can be edited in the specified countries or regions:

- ES: Posted Sales Invoice, Posted Sales Credit Memo, Posted Purchase Credit Memo
- APAC: Posted Sales Credit Memo, Posted Purchase Credit Memo
- RU: Posted Sales Credit Memo
- IT: Posted Transfer Shipment, Posted Service Shipment

## To edit a posted sales shipment

The following explains how to edit a posted sales shipment. The steps are similar for the other supported documents.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Posted Sales Shipments**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the document that you want to edit, and then choose the **Update Document** action. Alternatively, open the document and then choose the action.
3. On the **Posted Sales Shipment - Update** page, edit the **Package Tracking No.** field, for example.
4. Choose the **OK** button.

The posted sales shipment is updated.

# Process sales return orders  

If you need more control of the sales return process, such as warehouse documents for the item handling, or a better overview when receiving items from multiple sales documents with one sales return, then you can create sales return orders. A sales return order automatically issues the related sales credit memo and other return-related documents, such as a replacement sales order, if needed.

In addition to the original posted sales invoice, you can apply the sales credit memo or sales return order to other sales documents, for example another posted sales invoice because the customer is also returning items delivered with that invoice.

## Create a sales return order based on one or more posted sales documents  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Return Orders**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. Fill in the fields on the **General** FastTab as necessary.
4. On the **Lines** FastTab, fill the lines manually, or copy information from other documents to fill the lines automatically:

    - Use the **Get Posted Document Lines to Reverse** function to copy one or more posted document lines from one or more posted documents. This function always exactly reverses the costs from the posted document line. This function is described in the following steps.    
    - Use the **Copy from Document** function to copy an existing document to the return order. Use this function to copy the entire document. It can be either a posted document or a document that isn't yet posted. This function only enables exact cost reversing when the **Exact Cost Reversing Mandatory** check box is selected on the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page.  

5. Choose the **Process** action, then choose the **Get Posted Document Lines to Reverse** action.
6. At the top of the **Posted Sales Document Lines** page, select the **Show Reversible Lines Only** check box if you want to see only lines that have quantities that haven't yet been returned. For example, if a posted sales invoice quantity has already been returned, you might not want to return that quantity on a new sales return document.

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  This field only works for posted shipments and posted invoice lines, not for posted return or posted credit memo lines.

    At the left side of the page, the different document types are listed, and the number in brackets shows the number of documents available of each document type.

7. In the **Document Type Filter** field, select the type of posted document lines you would like to use.  
8. Select the lines that you would like to copy to the new document.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  If you use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd> to select all lines, all lines within the filter you have set are copied, but the **Show Reversible Quantity Only** filter is ignored. For example, suppose you have filtered the lines to a particular document number with two lines, one of which has already been returned. Even if the **Show Reversible Quantity Only** field is selected, if you select <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd> to copy all lines, both lines are copied, instead of only the one that has not yet been reversed.  

9. Choose the **OK** button to copy the lines to the new document.  

    The following processes occur:  

    -   For posted document lines of the type **Item**, a new document line is created that is a copy of the posted document line, with the quantity that hasn't yet been reversed. The **Appl.-from Item Entry** field is filled in as appropriate with the number of the item ledger entry of the posted document line.  

    -   For posted document lines that aren't of the type **Item**, such as item charges, a new document line is created that is a copy of the original posted document line.  

    -   Calculates the **Unit Cost (LCY)** field on the new line from the costs on the corresponding item ledger entries.  

    -   If the copied document is a posted shipment, posted receipt, posted return receipt, or posted return shipment, the unit price is calculated automatically from the item card.  

    -   If the copied document is a posted invoice or credit memo, the unit price, invoice discounts, and line discounts from the posted document line are copied.  

    -   If the posted document line contains item tracking lines, the **Appl.-from Item Entry** field on the item tracking lines is filled with the appropriate item ledger entry numbers from the posted item tracking lines.  

     When you copy from a posted invoice or posted credit memo, application copies any relevant invoice discounts and line discounts as valid at the time of posting that document from the posted document line to the new document line. Be aware, however, that if the **Calc. Inv. Discount** option is activated on the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page, then the invoice discount will be newly calculated when you post the new document line. The line amount for the new line might therefore be different than the line amount for the posted document line, depending on the new calculation of the invoice discount.  

     > [!NOTE]  
     >  If part of the quantity of the posted document line has already been reversed or sold or consumed, a line is created for only the quantity that remains in inventory or that has not been returned. If the full quantity of the posted document line has already been reversed, a new document line is not created.  
     >   
     >  If the flow of goods in the posted document is the same as the flow of goods in the new document, a copy of the original posted document line in the new document is created. The **Appl.-from Item Entry** field is not filled in because, in this case, exact cost reversing is not possible. For example, if you use the **Get Posted Document Lines to Reverse** function to get a posted sales credit memo line for a new sales credit memo, only the original posted credit memo line is copied to the new credit memo.  

10. On the **Sales Return Order** page, in the **Return Reason Code** field on each line, select the reason for the return.
11. Choose the **post** action.

## To create a replacement sales order from a sales return order
You might decide to compensate a customer for an item that you have sold them by replacing the item. You can make a replacement with the same item or a different item. This situation could occur if you mistakenly shipped the wrong item to the customer, for example.  

1. On the **Sales Return Order** page for an active return process, on an empty line, make a negative entry for the replacement item by inserting a negative amount in the **Quantity** field.  
2. Choose the **Move Negative Lines** action.
3. On the **Move Negative Sales Lines** page, fill in the fields as necessary.
4. Choose the **OK** button. The negative line for the replacement item is deleted from the sales return order and inserted in a new **Sales Order** page. For more information, see [Sell Products](sales-how-sell-products.md).

## To create return-related documents from a sales return order
You can have replacement sales orders, purchase return orders, and replacement purchase orders created automatically during the sales return process. This is useful, for example, in situations where you want to handle items with warranties provided by vendors.

1. On the **Sales Return Order** page for an active return process, choose the **Create Return-Related Documents** action.
2. In the **Vendor No.** field, enter the number of a vendor if you want to create vendor documents automatically.
3. If a returned item must be returned to the vendor, select the **Create Purch. Ret. Order** check box.
4. If a returned item must be ordered from the vendor, select the **Create Purchase Order** check box.
5. If a replacement sales order must be created, select the **Create Sales Order** check box.

## To create a restock charge
You might decide to charge your customer a restock fee to cover the physical handling costs of returning an item. This could occur if the customer mistakenly ordered the wrong item or changed their mind after receiving the item you sold them, for example.

You can post this increased cost as an item charge in a credit memo or a return order and assign it to the posted shipment. The following describes this for a sales return order, but the same steps apply to a sales credit memo.

1. Open the **Sales Return Order** page for an active return process.
2. On a new line, in the **Type** field, select **Charge (Item)**.  
3. Fill in the fields as for any item charge line. For more information, see [Use Item Charges to Account for Additional Trade Costs](payables-how-assign-item-charges.md).  

When you post the sales return order, the restock charge is added to the relevant sales entry amount. In this way, you can maintain accurate inventory valuation.

# Set up an additional reporting currency

As companies operate in increasingly more countries/regions, it becomes more important that they're able to review and report financial data in more than one currency.

> [!NOTE]  
> In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], if you're looking for real time information about foreign exchange (FX) rates or historical rates, it's referred to as currency. In addition to this article, see also [Update Currency Exchange Rates](finance-how-update-currencies.md).

Your general ledger is set up to use your local currency (LCY), but you can set it up to also use another currency with a current exchange rate assigned. If you designate a second currency as an additional reporting currency (ACY), [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically records amounts in both LCY and ACY on each G/L entry and other entries, such as VAT entries.

> [!Warning]
> You shouldn't use the ACY feature as a basis for financial statement translation unless you understand its limitations. It can't translate foreign subsidiary financial statements as part of a company consolidation. The ACY can only be used to prepare reports in another currency, as if that currency was the company's LCY.
>
> For example, you have a large amount of accounts receivable in British pounds (GBP), and you have set up your ACY to be GBP. In this scenario, amounts in the accounts receivable that use GBP aren't adjusted for currency exchange gains/losses in the ACY, only amounts in the accounts receivable that are in other currencies. That means that if you use ACY to report your financial statements, it might result in understated or overstated outstanding balances of accounts receivable.

## Displaying reports and amounts in ACY

Using an ACY can assist the reporting process for a company in the following cases:

- Companies in non-EU countries/regions that have a high proportion of transactions with EU country/region companies. In this case, the non-EU company might also want to report in euro to make its financial reports more usable for EU trade partners.
- Companies that also wish to display reports in a more internationally traded currency than their own local currency.

Several financial reports are based on G/L entries. To display report data in the ACY, select the **Show Amounts in Add. Reporting Currency** checkbox on the **Options** FastTab for the relevant G/L report.

## Adjusting exchange rates

Because exchange rates fluctuate constantly, ACY equivalents in your system must be adjusted periodically. If these adjustments aren't done, amounts that converted from foreign (or additional) currencies and posted to the general ledger in LCY can be misleading. In addition, daily entries posted before a daily exchange rate is entered into application must be updated after the daily exchange rate information is entered. The **Adjust Exchange Rates** batch job is used to adjust the exchange rates of posted customer, vendor, and bank account entries. It can also update ACY amounts on G/L entries. For more information, see [Update Currency Exchange Rates](finance-how-update-currencies.md).

## Setting up an ACY

To set up an ACY, follow these steps:

- Specify general ledger accounts for posting exchange rate adjustments.  
- Specify the exchange rate adjustment method for all general ledger accounts.  
- Specify the exchange rate adjustment method for VAT entries.  
- Activate the ACY.  

### To specify general ledger accounts for posting exchange rate adjustments  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Currencies**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Currencies** page, fill in the following fields for the ACY.  

|Field|Description|  
|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
|**Realized GL Gains Account**|The general ledger account to which exchange rate gains for currency adjustments between LCY and the ACY are posted.|  
|**Realized GL Losses Account**|The general ledger account to which exchange rate losses for currency adjustments between LCY and the ACY are posted.|  
|**Residual Gains Account**|The general ledger account to which residual amounts that are gains are posted if you post in the general ledger application area in both LCY and an ACY.|  
|**Residual Losses Account**|The general ledger account to which residual amounts that are losses are posted if you post in the general ledger application area in both LCY and an ACY.|

> [!NOTE]  
> Residual amounts can occur when [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] rounds debit and credit amounts that have been converted from LCY to an ACY.  

For each general ledger account, you must specify how general ledger amounts for that account are adjusted for exchange rate fluctuations between LCY and the ACY.  

### To specify the exchange rate adjustment method for all general ledger accounts

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Chart of Accounts**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Chart of Accounts** page, select the relevant account, and then choose the **Edit** action.  
3. On the **GL Account Card** page, select the relevant method in the **Exchange Rate Adjustment** field.  

    If you post in an ACY, in the **Exchange Rate Adjustment** field, specify how this general ledger account is adjusted for exchange-rate fluctuations between LCY and the ACY. The following table describes the options.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**No Adjustment**|No exchange rate adjustment is made to the general ledger account. This setting is the default option.<br /><br /> **NOTE:** Select this option if the exchange rate between the LCY and ACY is always fixed.|  
    |**Adjust Amount**|The LCY amount is adjusted for any exchange rate gains or losses. Exchange rate gains or losses are posted to the general ledger account in the **Amount** field and to the accounts you specified for gains or losses in the **Realized G/L Gains Account** and **Realized G/L Losses Account** fields on the **Currencies** page.|  
    |**Adjust Additional-Currency Amount**|The ACY is adjusted for any exchange rate gains or losses. Exchange rate gains or losses are posted to the general ledger account in the **Additional-Currency Amount** field and to the accounts you specified for gains or losses in the **Realized G/L Gains Account** and **Realized G/L Losses Account** fields on the **Currencies** page.|  

    Exchange rate gains and losses are posted when you run the **Adjust Exchange Rates** batch job. In that batch job, the adjustment exchange rate is identified on the **Currency Exchange Rates** page, and then the amounts in the **Amount** and **Additional-Currency Amount** fields on the general ledger entry are compared to determine whether there's an exchange rate gain or loss. The batch job uses the option that you select in the **Exchange Rate Adjustment** field to determine how to calculate and post exchange rate gains or losses for general ledger accounts.  

4.  Close the **G/L Account Card** page.  

### To specify exchange rate adjustment method for VAT entries

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Ledger Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **General Ledger Setup** page, select the relevant method in the **VAT Exchange Rate Adjustment** field.  
3. If you post in an ACY, in the **VAT Exchange Rate Adjustment** field you can specify how the accounts set up for VAT posting on the **VAT Posting Setup** page are adjusted for exchange-rate fluctuations between LCY and the ACY.  

    When you run the **Adjust Exchange Rates** batch job, the adjustment exchange rate is identified on the **Currency Exchange Rate** page and then the amounts in the **Amount** and **Additional-Currency Amount** fields on the VAT entry are compared to determine if there's an exchange rate gain or loss. The batch job uses the option that you select in this field to determine how to post exchange rate gains or losses for VAT accounts.  

    You have the same options as with general ledger entries but in this case the entries adjusted are the VAT entries. The following table describes the options.

    |Field|Description|  
    |----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**No Adjustment**|No exchange rate adjustment is made to the general ledger account. This setting is the default option.|  
    |**Adjust Amount**|The LCY amount is adjusted for any exchange rate gains or losses. Exchange rate gains or losses are posted to the general ledger account in the **Amount** field and to the accounts you specified for gains or losses in the **Realized G/L Gains Account** and **Realized G/L Losses Account** fields on the **Currencies** page.|  
    |**Adjust Additional-Currency Amount**|The ACY is adjusted for any exchange rate gains or losses. Exchange rate gains or losses are posted to the general ledger account in the **Additional-Currency Amount** field and to the accounts you specified for gains or losses in the **Realized G/L Gains Account** and **Realized G/L Losses Account** fields on the **Currencies** page.|  

### To activate the ACY  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Ledger Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **General Ledger Setup** page, in the **Additional Reporting Currency** field, choose the additional currency that you want to report in.  
3. When you leave the field, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] displays a confirmation message describing the effects of activating the ACY.  
4. Choose the **Yes** button to confirm that you want to activate the currency.  
5. The **Adjust Add. Reporting Currency** batch job opens.

    This batch job converts LCY amounts on existing entries to the ACY. The batch job uses a default exchange rate copied from the exchange rate that is valid on the work date on the **Currency Exchange Rates** page. Residual amounts that occur on conversion of LCY to ACY are posted to the residual gains and losses accounts specified on the **Currencies** page. The posting date and document number for these entries are the same as for the original general ledger entry. After you post all residual entries, the batch job posts a rounding entry on the closing date of each closed year to the retained earnings account. This posting makes sure that the ending balance of the income accounts for each closed year is 0 in both LCY and the ACY.
6. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]      
7. Choose the **OK** button to run the batch job.  

After you run the batch job, amounts on the following existing entries are in both the LCY and ACY:  

- General ledger entries  
- Item application entries  
- VAT entries  
- Project ledger entries  
- Value entries  
- Production order lines  
- Production order ledger entries  

In addition, all future entries of the same type have amounts recorded in both LCY and the ACY.  

> [!NOTE]  
> The **Add. Reporting Currency** field will only be activated after you choose the **OK** button in the **Adjust Add. Reporting Currency** batch job.

# Setting Up Source Codes and Reason Codes for Audit Trails

All posted entries are automatically assigned a source code so that transactions can be traced to their origin. If you want to give entries a supplementary source code, you can use reason codes. Reason codes are used to indicate why an entry was created. When you set up reason codes, you can assign them to entire journal templates and journal batches, and you can assign them to individual journal lines and documents.  

For both source codes and reason codes, use codes that are easy to remember and descriptive. The code must be unique, and you can set up as many codes as you like.

## Define source codes

Sometimes, you want see how a particular entry arose, such as whether it came from posting a general journal or a purchase invoice. A source code indicates where an entry was created. Entries are created when journals and invoices are posted and when certain batch jobs are executed. Each posting type has a specific source code that is assigned when individual entries are created.  

Posting journals, orders, invoices, or credit memos, and running various batch jobs, creates entries in the financial statements. The **Source Code Setup** page contains several FastTabs, one for each application area. Each FastTab contains the source codes that are applicable for that application area.

When you post or run a batch job, the correct source code is automatically attached to the entry. For example, when you post from the general journal, the entry is coded as *GENJNL*. You can then filter the **General Ledger Entries** page to show which entries were posted from the general journal or from sales documents, for example

### To define source codes

1. Choose the ![Search for Page or Report.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Source Code Setup**, and then choose the related link.  

2. In the **Source Code Setup** window, for each each posting type and batch job, specify the relevant source code.  

You can change the contents of a field later, and that change will then impact future postings.

## Change source codes

You may want to change a source code. For example, you want to change the source code *GENJNL* to *GNJ*.

### To change source codes

1. Choose the ![Search for Page or Report.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Source Codes**, and then choose the related link.

2. On the line with the code to be changed, select the code in the **Code** field.

3. Enter the new code, and then choose the **Yes** button. You can also change the contents of the **Description** field.

All new entries that are posted from the general journal will have the new source code.

## Define reason codes

Reason codes supplement the source codes and are used to indicate why an entry was created. You can assign reason codes on individual entries, and you can assign permanent codes to specific journal templates and journal batches. When a reason code is linked to a journal line or a sales or purchase header, all entries are marked with the reason code when they are posted.  

### To set up reason codes

1. Choose the ![Search for Page or Report.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon")  icon, enter **Reason Codes**, and then choose the related link.

2. In the **Reason Codes** window, enter the first code in the **Code** field. In the **Description** field, enter an explanatory text.

Repeat the procedure for each code you want to use. You can set up any number of codes.

The following procedure describes how to add a reason code to a journal template, but similar steps apply to adding a reason code to a journal line or journal batch.  

### To assign reason codes to journal templates

1. Choose the ![Search for Page or Report.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon")  icon, enter **General Journal Templates**, and then choose the related link.

2. On the line with the selected journal template, in the **Reason Code** field, specify the relevant code.

3. Close the journal template.

The selected reason code will be copied to new journal batches created under this journal template. You assign reason codes to journal templates in the other application areas in the same way.

### To use reason codes on sales and purchase documents

1. Open the relevant sales or purchase document.

2. On the sales or purchase header, enter the code in the **Reason Code** field.

When the invoice is posted, the reason code is copied to each general ledger, customer, and vendor entry. You cannot assign different reason codes to the individual purchase and sales lines because all lines are posted as one entry.

# Enable Customer Payments Through Payment Services

As an alternative to collecting payments through bank transfer or credit cards, your customers can pay you through their account with payment services, such as PayPal or WorldPay.  

After you enable a payment service in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], a link to the service is available on sales documents that you send by email to your customers. Customers can use the link to go to the payment service and pay the bill, directly from the sales document. If you don't want to include the link, for example, if a customer will pay with cash, you can remove the payment service from the invoice before posting.  

The PayPal Payments Standard and WorldPay Payments Standard extensions are installed in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], and are ready for you to enable.  

> [!CAUTION]
> The WorldPay Payments Standard extension will be deprecated. The code is market as obsolete starting in 2023 release wave 2. The app will be active for the next three major releases and then it will be removed.   

## To enable a payment service in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Payment Services**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Payment Services** page, choose the **New** action.  
3. Select the payment service, and then close the page.  
4. On the **Payment Services** page, choose the **Setup** action.  
5. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  
6. Close the page.  

## To select a payment service on a sales invoice

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Invoices**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the sales invoice that you want to pay by using the payment service.  
3. In the **Payment Service** field, choose the payment service.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > The **Payment Service** field is available only if you've enabled the payment service.

# Bulk Invoicing for Microsoft Bookings in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]

If your company uses the Bookings app in Microsoft 365, you can do bulk invoicing for appointments. The **Bookings Not Invoiced** page in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides a list of the company's completed bookings. In this page you can quickly select the appointments that you want to invoice and create draft invoices for the services provided.  

## Connect to Bookings

To connect your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with Bookings, you must specify your Bookings company, what to synchronize with Bookings, how often to synchronize, and which templates to use. You set up this information on the **Booking Sync. Setup** page, which you can launch from the **Exchange Sync. Setup** page, which you can find through [Search](ui-search.md).  

For example, if you want to synchronize customers between Bookings and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you must specify the default template to use to add new customers in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] based on the customers in your Bookings company.  

> [!NOTE]
> The Bookings app is designed to book appointments for individual customers rather than companies. The synchronization with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will, therefore, only synchronize customer contacts with a Type of *Person*. An email address is also required for the contact to synchronize.  

Similarly, if you want to synchronize service items between Bookings and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you must specify the default template to use to add new service items in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] based on the services in our Bookings company.  

> [!NOTE]
> Only items of type *Service* will synchronize between Bookings and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The template that you set up in the **Configuration Templates** page so it can be used for the item synchronization must define the type as *Service*.

## Invoice Appointments

When it is time to send invoices for the completed bookings, you go to the **Bookings Not Invoiced** page. Depending on how often the information is synchronized, the list is long or short. You can create invoices for all bookings in the list or one booking at a time. You can select one or more entries in the list and invoice those only.  

The support for invoicing appointments from Bookings is simpler than the fuller workflow of working with sales quotes, sales orders, and sales invoices. For more information, see [Invoice Sales](sales-how-invoice-sales.md). You can choose to sell your services using [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] or choose to use Bookings, depending on your business needs.  

> [!NOTE]
> In May 2022, we discovered an issue in the integration with Bookings. Currently, the sync from Bookings to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] requires you to manually associate the invoices with customers in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

# Analyzing financial statements in Microsoft Excel (obsolete)

> [!NOTE]
> This feature is deprecated and will be removed in a later [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] release. Learn more in [Deprecated features in the base app](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/upgrade/deprecated-features-w1). Learn more about alternative finance reporting in [Financial analytics overview](bi.md).

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides KPIs and get overviews of your company's finances. The following are examples of ways to analyze KPIs and overviews in Excel:

* Open lists in Excel and analyze the data.
* Export heavy financial statements such as your balance sheet or income statement to Excel, analyze the data, and print the reports.  

> [!TIP]
> By default, the reports you can view in Excel are designed to help you analyze the current year. The Income Statement report is an exception, however. That report lets you filter the data to include previous years in your analyses.

## Get the overview and the details in Excel

In the Business Manager and Accountant Role Centers, the **Reports** action lets you choose the financial statements to view in Excel. When you choose a statement, it will be opened in Excel or Excel Online. An add-in connects the data to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. However, you have to sign in with the same account that you use with [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The following table lists the reports and where they're available.  

|Report  |Role Center  |
|---------|---------|
|Balance Sheet                 | Business Manager, Accountant |
|Income Statement              | Business Manager, Accountant |
|Statement of Cash Flows       | Business Manager, Accountant |
|Statement of Retained Earnings| Business Manager, Accountant |
|Sales Taxes Collected         | Business Manager, Accountant |
|Customer Statements           | Business Manager, Accountant |
|Aged Accounts Payable         | Accountant |
|Aged Accounts Receivable      | Accountant |

Let's say you want to dig deeper into your cash flow. From the Business Manager or Accountant Role Center, you can open the **Statement of Cash Flows** report in Excel, but what actually happens is that we export the relevant data for you and create an Excel workbook based on a predefined template. Depending on your browser, you might be prompted to open or save the workbook.  

In Excel, you see a tab where the data is laid out for you on the first worksheet. All the data that was exported is also present in other worksheets in case you need it. You can print the report right away, or you can modify it until you have the overview and the details that you want. Use the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Excel Add-in to further filter and analyze data.  

### Understand the Excel templates

The predefined Excel reports are based on the data in the current company. For example, the demonstration company has set up the chart of accounts to list three cash accounts under *Current Assets*: 10100 **Checking account**, 10200 **Saving account**, and 10300 **Petty Cash**. The accounts have the **Account Subcategory** field set to *Cash*, and it's their combined amount that shows up as *Cash* in the **Balance Sheet** Excel report.  

Other sheets in the Excel workbook show the data behind the report. To find out what's behind the groupings in the Excel reports, you might have to filter the lists in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

## The [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Excel add-in

Your [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] experience includes an add-in for Excel. Depending on your subscription, you're signed in automatically, or you must provide your sign-in details for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. To learn more, go to [Viewing and Editing in Excel From Business Central](across-work-with-excel.md).  

The add-in lets you get fresh data from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], and you can push changes back to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. However, the ability to push data back to the database is not available for the financial reports you can view in Excel.

# Manage storage by deleting documents or compressing data

A central role, such as the application administrator, must regularly deal with accumulating historic documents by deleting or compressing them.  

> [!TIP]
> Learn more about other ways to reduce the amount of data stored in a database by reading [Reducing Data Stored in Business Central Databases](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/database-reduce-data) in our Developer and IT pro documentation.

## Delete documents

In certain situations, you might need to delete invoiced purchase orders. However, you can't delete them unless you fully invoice and received the items in the purchase orders. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] helps you out by checking for that.

Businesses usually delete return orders after they're invoiced. When you post an invoice, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] transfers it to the **Posted Purchase Credit Memo** page. If you selected the **Return Shipment on Credit Memo** check box on the **Purchases & Payable Setup** page, the invoice is transferred to the **Posted Return Shipment** page. You can delete the documents using the **Delete Invd Purch. Ret. Orders** batch job. Before it deletes documents, the batch job checks whether the purchase return orders are fully shipped and invoiced.  

Blanket purchase orders aren't automatically deleted after you process and invoice all the related purchase orders. Instead, you can delete them with the **Delete Invoiced Blanket Purchase Orders** batch job.  

Businesses typically delete invoiced service orders automatically after they're fully invoiced. When an invoice is posted, a corresponding entry is created and can then be viewed on the **Posted Service Invoices** page.  

Service orders aren't deleted automatically, however, if the total quantity on the order was posted from the **Service Invoice** page rather than from service order itself. You might need to manually delete such invoiced orders by running the **Delete Invoiced Service Orders** batch job.  

## Compress data with date compression

You can compress data in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to save space in the database&mdash;which in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online can even save you money. The compression, based on dates and functions, combines several old entries into one new entry.

You can compress entries that meet all of the following conditions:

* They're from closed fiscal years.
* The **Open** field is set to **No**.
* They're at least five years old. If you want to compress data less than five years old, contact your Microsoft partner.

So, for example, vendor ledger entries from previous fiscal years can be compressed so there's only one credit and one debit entry per account per month. The amount in the new entry is the sum of all the compressed entries. The date assigned is the starting date for the compressed period, such as the first day of the month (if you compress entries by month). After compression, you can still see the net change for each account in the previous fiscal year.

The number of entries that result from a date compression depends on how many filters you set, which fields are combined, and which period length you choose. There's always at least one entry. When the batch job is finished, you can see the result on the **Date Compr. Registers** page.

You can compress the following data types using batch jobs.

* Finance entries - general ledger (G/L) entries, value added tax (VAT) entries, bank account ledger entries, G/L budget entries, customer ledger entries, and vendor ledger entries.
* Warehouse entries
* Resource entries
* Item budget entries
* Fixed asset (FA) ledger entries, FA maintenance ledger entries, and FA insurance ledger entries.

When you're defining criteria for the compression, you can keep the contents of certain fields using the options under **Retain Field Contents**. The available fields depend on the data you're compressing.

> [!NOTE]
> Before you can run date compression, your analysis views must be current. Learn more in the [Update an analysis view](bi-how-analyze-data-dimension.md#update-an-analysis-view) section.

After the compression, the contents of the following fields are always retained: **Posting Date**, **Vendor No.**, **Document Type**, **Currency Code**, **Posting Group**, **Amount**, **Remaining Amount**, **Original Amt. (LCY)**, **Remaining Amt. (LCY)**, **Amount (LCY)**, **Purchase (LCY)**, **Inv. Discount (LCY)**, **Pmt. Disc. Given (LCY)**, and **Pmt. Disc. Possible**.

## Posting compressed entries

Compressed entries are posted a little differently than standard posting. This difference is to reduce the number of new general ledger entries created by date compression, and is especially important when you keep information such as dimensions and document numbers. Date compression creates new entries as follows:

* On the **General Ledger Entries** page, new entries are created for the compressed entries. The **Description** field contains **Date Compressed** so the compressed entries are easy to identify. 
* On ledger pages, such as the **Customer Ledger Entries** page, one or more new entries are created. 

The posting process creates gaps in the number series for entries on the **General Ledger Entries** page. Those numbers are assigned to the entries on the ledger pages only. The number range assigned to the entries is available on the **G/L Register** page in the **From Entry No.** and **To Entry No.** fields. 

> [!NOTE]
> After you run date compression, you can't reverse vendor or bank ledger entries for any transactions that are affected by the compression.

The number of entries that result from a date compression depends on how many filters you set, which fields are combined, and the length of the time period you choose. There's always at least one entry.

> [!WARNING]
> Date compression deletes entries, so you should always make a backup copy of the database before you run the batch job.

### To run a date compression

1. Choose the ![Search for Page or Report](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Data Administration**, then choose the related link.
2. Do one of the following, depending on your needs:
    * To use an assisted guide to set up date compression for one or more types of data, choose **Data Administration Guide**.
    * To set up compression for an individual type of data, choose **Data Compression**, **Compress Entries**, then choose the data to compress.

   > [!NOTE]
   > You can only compress data more than five years old. If you want to compress data less than five years old, contact your Microsoft partner. They need to use the `OnSetMinimumNumberOfYearsToKeep` event in the "Date Compression" codeunit to set the threshold.

# Set Up Fixed Assets with User-Defined Depreciation Methods

You can use [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to set up the user-defined depreciation methods as described here.

For each user-defined method, you use the **Depreciation Tables** page, where you must enter a depreciation percentage for each period (month, quarter, year, or accounting period). Then, when you assign a depreciation book with a user-defined method to a fixed asset, you must set the **First User-Defined Depr. Date** and **Depreciation Starting Date** fields on the **FA Depreciation Books** page for the specific fixed asset.  

The formula for calculating the depreciation amounts is:  

*Depreciation Amount = (Depreciation % x Number of Depreciation Days x Depr. Basis) / (100 x 360)*


> [!NOTE]  
> While the date in the field **First User-Defined Depr. Date** is used to determine the time intervals, it is the **Depreciation Starting Date** that is used to determine the number of depreciation days. If the **First User-Defined Depr. Date** is earlier than the **Depreciation Starting Date**, the percentage for the first period in the depreciation table will be only partially used when the program calculates the first depreciation. This means that the asset will not be completely depreciated by the end of the last period.

## To assign a depreciation book to a fixed asset with a user-defined depreciation method

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Fixed Assets**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the fixed asset that you want to set up a fixed asset depreciation book for.
3. Choose the **Related** action, and then choose **Fixed Asset**, and then **Depreciation Books**. This opens the **FA Depreciation Books** page.

   By default, some of the fields that need to be filled in per the instructions below are hidden, so you must display them. To do this you need to personalize the page. For more information, see [To start personalizing a page through the Personalizing banner](ui-personalization-user.md#start-personalizing-by-using-the-personalization-mode).
4. In the field **Depreciation Method**, select **User-Defined**.
5. In the field **Depreciation Table Code**, select the **Depreciation Table** you want to use.
6. In the field **Depreciation Starting Date**, select the starting date for the depreciation calculation.
7. When you use a user-defined method, the **First User-Defined Depr. Date** field must be set to a date that is the same or earlier than the field **Depreciation Starting Date**. If you have selected a value in the **Period Length** field in the depreciation table, the date in the field **First User-Defined Depr. Date** must be the starting date of an accounting period.
8. Either fill in the field **No. of Depreciation Years** or the field **Depreciation Ending Date**. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

On the **Depreciation Table** page, you can set up user-defined depreciation methods. For example, you can set up depreciation based on number of units.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Depreciation Tables**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Depreciation Table List** page, choose the **New** action.  
3. On the **Depreciation Table Card** page, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  

> [!TIP]
> Use the **Create Sum of Digits Table** function to define a depreciation table based on the *Sum of Digits* method.

With the *Sum of Digits* method, if a fixed asset is depreciated over 4 years, then the depreciation for each year is calculated in the following way:

Sum of Digits = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10
Depreciation:

* Year 1 = 4/10  
* Year 2 = 3/10  
* Year 3 = 2/10  
* Year 4 = 1/10  

### Depreciation Based on Number of Units

This user-defined method can also be used to depreciate based on number of units, for example, in the case of production machines with an established lifetime capacity. On the **Depreciation Tables** page, you can enter the number of units that can be produced in each period (month, quarter, year,or accounting period).  

### Example - User-defined Depreciation

You use a depreciation method that allows you to depreciate assets in an accelerated manner for income tax purposes.  

You would use the following depreciation rates for a fixed asset with a three-year lifetime for tax purposes:  

* Year 1: 25%  
* Year 2: 38%  
* Year 3: 37%  

The acquisition cost is LCY 100,000, and the depreciable lifetime is five years. Depreciation is calculated annually.  

| Date | FA Posting Type | Days | Amount | Book Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 01/01/20 |Acquisition Cost |(Depreciation starting date) |100,000.00 |100,000.00 |
| 12/31/20 |Depreciation |360 |-25,000.00 |75,000.00 |
| 12/31/21 |Depreciation |360 |-38,000.00 |37,000.00 |
| 12/31/22 |Depreciation |360 |-37,000.00 |0 |
| 12/31/23 |Depreciation |None |None |0 |
| 12/31/24 |Depreciation |None |None |0 |

In the previous example, both the **First User-Defined Depr. Date** and **Depreciation Starting Date** fields would be set to 01/01/20 in the **FA Depreciation Books** page for the specific fixed asset. If, however, the **First User-Defined Depr. Date** field contained 01/01/20 and the **Depreciation Starting Date** field contained 04/01/20, the result would be:  

| Date | FA Posting Type | Days | Amount | Book Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 01/01/20 |Acquisition Cost |(Depreciation starting date) |100,000.00 |100,000.00 |
| 12/31/20 |Depreciation |270 |-18,750.00 |81,250.00 |
| 12/31/21 |Depreciation |360 |-38,000.00 |42,250.00 |
| 12/31/22 |Depreciation |360 |-37,000.00 |6,250.00 |
| 12/31/23 |Depreciation |90 |-6,250.00 |0 |
| 12/31/24 |Depreciation |None |None |0 |

# Business Central and OneDrive integration

OneDrive for work or school (formerly known as OneDrive for Business) is a cloud storage service that is included in Microsoft 365. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] makes it easy to store, manage, and share files with other people through OneDrive. When a file is in your OneDrive you enjoy the rich collaborative experiences from the online versions of Microsoft products, such as Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. For example, you can share a Word document, and then you and your colleagues can edit it together in real-time. OneDrive also lets you open other types of files, such as PDFs. 

## Get started with OneDrive features

If you're using [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, we've already created the connection between [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online and OneDrive, so it's easy to get started. The only requirement is that users have opened OneDrive at least one time. With [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, an administrator has to configure the connection before you can get started. Learn more at [Managing OneDrive Integration with Business Central](admin-onedrive-integration.md).

<!-- We've created the connection between [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online and OneDrive, so it's easy to get started. The only requirement is that users have opened OneDrive at least one time. -->

### Open and share in OneDrive

On most pages where files are available, such as the Report Inbox or files that are attached to records, you'll find an **Open in OneDrive** and **Share** actions.

:::image type="content" source="media/onedrive-overview-report-inbox-w-outline.png" alt-text="The Open in OneDrive and Share actions for reports":::

|Share|Copy the file to your OneDrive and share it with other people.|[Share in OneDrive](across-share-onedrive.md#share) |

### Save Excel workbooks and report files in OneDrive

With OneDrive integration set up, a couple other familiar features will automatically use OneDrive for saving files instead of saving files on your device:

- The **Open in Excel** and **Edit in Excel** actions on list pages will automatically copy the Excel file to OneDrive, then open it in Excel Online. For more information, see [Viewing and Editing in Excel](across-work-with-excel.md).
- Sending a report to an Excel or Word file will automatically copy the file to OneDrive, then open it in the Excel or Word online. For more information, see [Saving a report to a file](ui-work-report.md#save-a-report-to-a-file).

These features aren't turned on by default. But as an administrator, you can easily turn them on by using the **OneDrive Setup** assisted setup guide.

<!--
When you use the **Open in OneDrive** action for the first time, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] does the following in your OneDrive:

1. Creates a folder named [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. 
2. In the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] folder, it creates another folder with the same name as the company you're working in. If you work in more than one company, it will create a folder for the company you're working in when you use the **Open in OneDrive** action. 
3. Puts a copy of the file you selected in the folder, and then opens the file. The next time you use the action, it only copies and opens the file. 

The folder and its content are private until you decide to share them with others. For example, you might decide to share content with one or more of your coworkers, or even people outside of your organization. For more information, see [Share OneDrive files and folders](https://support.microsoft.com/office/share-onedrive-files-and-folders-9fcc2f7d-de0c-4cec-93b0-a82024800c07) in the content for OneDrive.
-->

> [!NOTE]
> You can also connect your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises to OneDrive. However, there are a few things to do to make it work. For more information, see [Configuring Business Central On-Premises](admin-onedrive-integration-onpremises.md).

# About planning functionality

The planning system takes all demand and supply data into account, nets the results, and creates suggestions for balancing supply to meet demand. To learn more, go to [Design Details: Supply Planning](design-details-supply-planning.md).  

> [!TIP]  
> To understand the fields that this article mentions, read their tooltip in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

## Supply and demand

Planning has two elements, supply and demand. These must balance to ensure that the demand is met.  

- Demand is any kind of gross requirement, such as a sales order, service order, or a component need for assembly or production orders, outbound transfer, blanket order, or forecast. Additionally, there other technical types of demand, such as a negative production or purchase order, negative inventory, and purchase return.  
- Supply refers to any kind of replenishment such as inventory, a purchase order, assembly order, production order, or inbound transfer. Correspondingly, there can be a negative sales or service order, negative component need or sales return that also represent supply.  

Another goal of the planning system is to ensure that the inventory does not grow unnecessarily. In the case of decreasing demand, the planning system will suggest that you postpone, decrease in quantity, or cancel existing replenishment orders.  

## Planning calculation

The planning system is driven by anticipated and actual customer demand, as well as inventory reordering parameters. Running the planning calculation will result in application suggesting specific actions ([Action Messages](production-how-to-run-mps-and-mrp.md#action-messages)) to take concerning possible replenishment from vendors, transfers between warehouses, or production. If replenishment orders already exist, the suggested actions could be to increase or expedite the orders to meet the changes in demand.  

The basis of the planning routine is in the gross-to-net calculation. Net requirements drive planned order releases, which are scheduled based on the routing information (manufactured items) or the item card lead time (purchased items). Planned order release quantities are based on the planning calculation, and are affected by the parameters set on the individual item cards.  

> [!TIP]
> The planning system relies on how your organization uses locations. To learn more, go to [Planning With or Without Locations](production-planning-with-without-locations.md).

## Planning with manual transfer orders

In the **Replenishment System** field on a SKU card, you can set up the planning system to create transfer orders to balance supply and demand across locations.  

In addition to such automatic transfer orders, you may sometimes need to perform a general move of inventory quantities to another location, irrespective of existing demand. For this purpose you would manually create a transfer order for the quantity to move. To ensure that the planning system does not try to manipulate this manual transfer order, you must set the **Planning Flexibility** on the transfer line(s) to None.  

Contrarily, if you do want the planning system to adjust the transfer order quantities and dates to existing demand, you must set the **Planning Flexibility** field to the default value, Unlimited.

## Planning parameters

The planning parameters control when, how much, and how to replenish based on the various settings on the item card (or stockkeeping unit - SKU), and the manufacturing setup.  

The following planning parameters exist on the item or SKU card:  

- Dampener Period  
- Dampener Quantity  
- Reordering Policy  
- Reorder Point
- Maximum Inventory  
- Overflow Level  
- Time Bucket  
- Lot Accumulation Period  
- Rescheduling Period  
- Reorder Quantity  
- Safety Lead Time  
- Safety Stock Quantity  
- Assembly Policy  
- Manufacturing Policy  

The following order modifiers exist on the item or SKU card:  

- Minimum Order Quantity  
- Maximum Order Quantity  
- Order Multiple  

Global planning setup fields on the **Manufacturing Setup** page include:  

- Dynamic Low-Level Code  
- Current Demand Forecast  
- Use Forecast on Locations  
- Default Safety Lead Time  
- Blank Overflow Level  
- Combined MPS/MRP Calculation
- Components at Location  
- Default Dampener Period  
- Default Dampener Quantity  
- Default General Business Posting Group

To learn more, go to [Design Details: Planning Parameters](design-details-planning-parameters.md)  

## Other important planning fields

### Planning Flexibility

On most supply orders, such as production orders, you can select **Unlimited** or **None** in the **Planning Flexibility** field on the lines.

This specifies whether the supply represented by the production order line is considered by the planning system when calculating action messages.
If the field contains **Unlimited**, then the planning system includes the line when calculating action messages. If the field contains **None**, then the line is firm and unchangeable, and the planning system does not include the line when calculating action messages.

### Warnings

The **Warning** information field on the **Planning Worksheet** page informs you of any planning line created for an unusual situation with a text, which the user can choose to read additional information. The following warning types exist:

- Emergency
- Exception
- Attention

#### Emergency

The emergency warning displays in two situations:

- The inventory is negative on the planning starting date.
- Back-dated supply or demand events exist.

If an item's inventory is negative on the planning starting date, the planning system suggests an emergency supply order for the negative quantity to arrive on the planning starting date. The warning text states the starting date and the quantity of the emergency order.

Any document lines with due dates before the planning starting date are consolidated into one emergency supply order for the item to arrive on the planning starting date.

#### Exception

The exception warning displays if the projected available inventory drops below the safety stock quantity.

The planning system will suggest a supply order to meet the demand on its due date. The warning text states the item's safety stock quantity and the date on which it is violated.

Violating the safety stock level is considered an exception because it shouldn't occur if the reorder point has been set correctly.

> [!NOTE]
> Supply on planning lines with Exception warnings is normally not modified according to planning parameters. Instead, the planning system only suggests a supply to cover the exact demand quantity. However, you can set the planning run up to respect certain planning parameters for planning lines with certain warnings. To learn more, go to the description for the **Respect Planning Parameters for Exception Warnings** field in the [Run Full Planning, MPS or MRP](production-how-to-run-mps-and-mrp.md) article.

#### Attention

The attention warning displays in two situations:

- The planning starting date is earlier than the work date.
- The planning line suggests to change a released purchase or production order.

> [!NOTE]
> In planning lines with warnings, the **Accept Action Message** field is not selected, because the planner is expected to further investigate these lines before carrying out the plan.

## Planning worksheets and requisition worksheets

As described in [Planning](production-planning.md), you can choose between two worksheets for most planning activities, the planning worksheet and the requisition worksheet. Most processes are described based on the planning worksheet, but there are a couple of scenarios where the requisition worksheet is preferred.

[!INCLUDE [edit-in-excel](includes/edit-in-excel.md)]

> [!TIP]
> When you process lines in a planning worksheet, you can print more than one firm planned orders. The **Prod. Order** option in the **Report Selection - Production Order** page determines which report to print. The default report is **99000762 Prod. Order - Job Card**. If your production orders lack routing lines or you prefer a more compact report, consider switching to the **5500 Prod. Order Comp. and Routing** report.

### Requisition worksheet

The **Requisition Worksheet** page lists items that you want to order. You can enter items in the worksheet in the following ways:

- Enter the items manually in the worksheet and fill in the relevant fields.
- Use the **Calculate Plan** batch job. This calculates a replenishment plan for items and stockkeeping units that have been set up with a replenishment system of **Purchase** or **Transfer**. When you use this batch job, the program automatically fills in the **Action Message** field with a suggestion for an action you can take to replenish the item. This could be increasing the item quantity on an existing order or creating a new order, for example.
- If you have used the **Calculate Plan** batch job from the **Planning Worksheet** page to calculate a replenishment plan, you can use the **Carry Out Action Message** batch job to copy purchase and transfer order proposals from the planning worksheet to the requisition worksheet. This is practical if separate users are responsible for handling production orders and purchase/transfer orders.
- You can use the **Drop Shipment** action to fill in the requisition worksheet lines. This action uses the **Get Sales Orders** batch job to determine the sales order lines that you want to designate for a drop shipment.
- You can use the **Special Order** action to fill in the requisition worksheet lines. This action uses the **Get Sales Orders** batch job to determine the sales order lines that you want to designate for a special order.

Requisition worksheet lines contain detailed information about the items that need to be reordered. You can edit and delete the lines to adjust your replenishment plan, and you can further process the lines by using the **Carry Out Action Message** batch job.

To learn more about planning with locations and transfers, go to [Planning With or Without Locations](production-planning-with-without-locations.md).

> [!TIP]
> When you're working on the **Requisition Worksheet** or **Planning Worksheet** pages, you can organize the lines by sorting on a column name. This is especially useful on the Planning Worksheet page because they it can be used for multilevel production orders. By default, lines are sorted by the **Item No.** field. To group lines for a multilevel order, sort by the **Ref. Order No.** field. Also, the **MPS Order** and **Planning Level** fields can help show the hierarchy of the lines.

# Manage Saved Settings for Reports and Batch Jobs

When running reports, users are typically presented with a page that lets them select options and set filters to change the data that is included in the generated report. This page is called the *request page*. A report can include one or more *saved settings* that users can apply to the report from the request page. *Saved settings* are basically predefined options and filters. Using saved settings is a fast and reliable way to consistently generate reports that contain the correct data. For more information, see [Use saved settings](ui-work-report.md#SavedSettings).

> [!NOTE]
> This topic refers to *reports*, but similar information applies to *batch jobs*.

If you have the proper permissions, you can view, create, and modify the saved settings for all reports for all users in a company. You can assign saved settings for a report to individual users or to all users in the company.

## Manage saved settings

You manage saved settings on the **Reports Settings** page. There are two ways to open this page:

- Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Report Settings**, and then choose the related link.
- In a report's request page, choose the lookup in the **Use default values from** field, and then choose the **Select from full list** action.

    This field is only visible if you have run the report at least once earlier. The list will only show settings that are available to you, either because they are your own settings, or because the settings are shared with you.

The **Report Settings** page displays all the existing saved settings entries for all users. If there is a user name in the **Assigned to** field, only that user can use the saved settings for the associated report. If there is a check mark in the **Share with all users** field, all users can use the saved settings for the report.  

> [!TIP]
> When a user has run a report that supports shared settings, their settings are saved and added to this list. In most cases, the admin can then edit those settings and choose to share the settings with all users.
>
> However, in some cases, settings cannot be shared, and the admin cannot change them either. Most batch jobs do not support shared settings.  

## Create or modify saved settings for all users

From the **Report Settings** page, you can:

- Choose the **New** action to create a new saved settings entry from scratch.
- Select a saved settings entry from the list, and choose the **Copy** action to create a copy.
- Select a saved settings entry from the list, and choose the **Edit** action to modify a saved settings entry.

> [!Important]
> Consider the name that you give a saved settings entry. If you create a saved settings entry for all users, and you give it the same name as an existing saved settings entry that is assigned to a specific user only, then that user will not be able to use the saved settings entry that is assigned to everyone.  In the **Saved Settings** section on the request page, the user will see two saved settings entries with the same name. However, no matter which option they choose, the user-specific saved settings entry will be used.

> [!NOTE]
> The ability to save settings is available only on reports where the [SaveValues property](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/properties/devenv-savevalues-property) of the report's request page is set to **Yes**. The **SaveValues** property is set by the developer.

# Analyze Data with Statistical Accounts

Use statistical accounts to supplement information in financial reports. Statistical accounts let you add metrics that are based on non-transactional data. You add the non-transactional data as number-based units, such as:

* Employee headcount
* Square footage
* The number of customers with overdue accounts

For example, you can measure revenue or costs based on the number of people in a department. The headcount for the department is the unit for the statistical account. The following image shows an example of a report that uses a statistical account to show revenue per employee.

:::image type="content" source="media/statistical account report example.png" alt-text="An example of a report that includes data from a statistical account.":::

In terms of how they work, statistical accounts are similar to posting accounts. They store transactions that you post using statistical account journals, so that you can use the transactions as data for financial reports. To learn more about financial reports, go to [Prepare Financial Reporting with Financial Data and Account Categories](bi-how-work-account-schedule.md). 

There are a couple of key differences between statistical accounts and posting accounts. Statistical accounts are separate entities, and aren't included in trial balance reports. Also, you don't need to balance debit and credit amounts when you use statistical account journals to post entries to a statistical account. You just post the amount.

## Set up a statistical account

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Statistical Accounts**, then choose the related link.
1. On the **General** FastTab, fill in the fields. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

## Post amounts to a statistical account

1. To post the amounts you want to track, on the **Statistical Accounts** page, choose the **Statistical Accounts Journal** action.
1. In the **Posting date** field, enter the last date of the posting period that you want to post amounts for.
1. Optional: If you want to track amounts for a specific document, in the **Document No.** field, enter the document's ID.
1. In the **Statistical Account No.** field, choose the statistical account that you'll post amounts to.
1. In the **Description** field, enter a brief description of what you're measuring.  
1. In the **Amount** field, enter the amount to post. 
1. Optional: If you'll want to include the statistical account in more advanced analyses, specify dimensions in the **Department Code** and **Customergroup Code** fields. To learn more about dimensions, go to [Analyze Data by Dimensions](bi-how-analyze-data-dimension.md).

## Verify statistical account amounts

On the **Statistical Accounts** page, use the **Statistical Accounts Balance** action to verify that the registered amounts are correct for each period.  

## Include the statistical account in a financial report

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Financial Reports**, then choose the related link.
1. Create a new financial report in one of the following ways:
    1. To start from scratch, choose **New**. To learn more about creating financial reports, go to [Create a new financial report](bi-how-work-account-schedule.md#create-a-new-financial-report).
    1. To use settings from a similar report you already have, choose the report to copy, and then choose the **Copy Financial Report** action. You can edit the settings you copy in your new report.
1. Add the statistical account:
    1. If you're starting from scratch, choose the **Edit Row Definition** action.
    1. To use a row definition from an existing report, choose the report to copy from, and then choose the **Copy Row Definition** action.
1. On the **Row Definition** page, in the **Row No.** field, define where the row will appear in the sequence of rows on the report.
1. In the **Description** field, enter text that indicates what you're measuring.
1. In the **Totaling Type** field, choose **Statistical Accounts**.
1. In the **Totaling** field, choose a statistical account.
1. In the **Row Type** field, choose whether to view the balance on the posting date or the beginning of the posting period, or to show the change to the amount during the period.
1. Fill in the remaining fields. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

# Replan or refresh production orders directly

The **Replan** action on production orders is typically used after you add or change components that constitute underlying production orders. The action calculates changes made to components and routings lines, and includes items on lower production BOM levels for which it might generate new production orders.  

Based on the changes to the components and routing lines, the **Replan** action calculates and plans for any new demand for the production order.  

The **Refresh** action on production orders is typically used after you:

- Create a production order header manually to calculate and create line data for the first time.
- Change the production order header to recalculate all the line data.

The **Refresh** action calculates changes to a production order header and doesn't involve production BOM levels. The action calculates and initiates the values of the component lines and routing lines based on the production BOM and routing. The calculation is according to the order quantity and due date on the production order’s header.

You can either insert the production order lines manually or use the action that calculates the production order lines from the header.  

> [!NOTE]
> If you use the **Refresh** action to recalculate production order lines, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] deletes the existing production order lines and calculates new lines.
> Even if the **Lines** option is disabled, non-top-level lines in a Make-to-order environment are deleted. Use the **Replan** action to restore them.

## To replan a production order

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Firm Planned Prod. Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the production order you want to replan.  
3. On the **Lines** FastTab, choose the **Lines** action, and then choose the **Components** action.  
4. Add a component that is a produced item or subassembly.  
5. From the production order, choose the **Replan** action.  

    On the **Replan Production Order** page, define how and what to replan.  
6. In the **Scheduling Direction** field, select one of the options in the following table.  

    | Option | Description |
    |--|--|
    | **Back** | Calculates the operation sequence backwards from the earliest possible ending date, defined by due date and/or other scheduled orders, to the latest possible starting date. **Note:**  This default option is relevant in most situations. |
    | **Forward** | Calculates the operation sequence forward from the earliest latest possible starting date, defined by due date and/or other scheduled orders, to the earliest possible ending date. **Note:**  This option is only relevant for expedite orders. |

7. In the **Plan** field, select whether to calculate production requirements for produced items on the production BOM. The following table describes the options.  

    |Option|Description|  
    |----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**No Levels**|Don't consider lower level production. This setting only updates the item’s schedule, like refresh.|  
    |**One Level**|Plan for first-level production demand. First-level production orders might be created.|  
    |**All Levels**|Plan for all-level production demand. All-level production orders might be created.|  

8. Select **One Level**, and choose the **OK** button to replan the production order and calculate and create a new underlying production order for the introduced subassembly if it isn't fully available.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Changes implemented with the **Replan** action probably change the capacity need of the production order. You might have to reschedule operations afterwards.  

## To refresh a production order

If you change production order lines, components, or routing lines, you must also refresh the information on the production order. In the following procedure, the components are calculated for a firm planned production order. The steps are similar for routing lines.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 2.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Firm Planned Prod. Order**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action. To learn more, go to [Create Production orders](production-how-to-create-production-orders.md).  
3. Choose the **Refresh** action.
4. On the **Refresh Production Order** page, select one of the options in the following table.

    |Field|Option|Description|  
    |----------------------------------|---------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Scheduling Direction**|**Forward**|Scheduling starts from the starting date and proceeds forward to the finishing date. You must fill in the starting date to use this option.|  
    ||**Backward**|Scheduling starts from the ending date and proceeds backward to the starting date.|  
    |**Calculate**|**Lines**|Select this field to calculate the production order lines.|  
    ||**Routings**|This field doesn't affect the calculations on production lines.|  
    ||**Component Need**|This field doesn't affect the calculations on production lines.|  
    |**Warehouse**|**Create Inbound Request**|This field doesn't affect the calculations on production lines.|  

5. Choose the **OK** button to confirm your selection. The production order lines are calculated.

> [!NOTE]  
> Calculating production order components deletes previous changes in the components.

## Reschedule production orders within a safety lead time

If you discover that you need the supply before the due date that planning set, you can manually reschedule the production order. To do that, you must turn on the **Manual Scheduling** toggle on the **Manufacturing Setup** page. If needed, in the **Safety Lead Time for Manual Scheduling** field, you can also specify an amount of buffer time to add to the end date when you manually reschedule a production order. You can move the due date to the current date or a future date, or change the end date directly by changing the starting date.

# Connect to Microsoft Dataverse

[!INCLUDE[azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id](~/../shared-content/shared/azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id.md)]

This article describes how to set up a connection between [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)]. Typically, businesses create the connection to integrate and synchronize data with another Dynamics 365 business app, such as [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)].  

## Before you start

There are a few pieces of information to have ready before you create the connection:  

* The URL for the [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] environment that you want to connect to. If you use the **Dataverse Connection Setup** assisted setup guide to create the connection we'll find your environments. You can also enter the URL of another environment in your tenant.  
* The user name and password of an account that has administrator permissions in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)].  
* If you have an on-premises [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] 2020 release wave 1, version 16.5, read the [Some Known Issues](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/upgrade/known-issues#wrong-net-assemblies-for-external-connected-services) article. You'll have to complete the described workaround before you can create your connection to [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)].
* The local currencies that each company uses. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] companies can connect to a [!INCLUDE [cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] environment that has a base currency that's different than their local currency. To learn more about how to handle multi-currency setups, go to [Allow for different currencies](#allow-for-different-currencies).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Your [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] environment must not be in Administration mode. Administration mode will cause the connection to fail because the integration user account for the connection does not have administrator permissions. For more information, see [Administration mode](/power-platform/admin/admin-mode).

> [!Note]
> These steps describe the procedure for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online.
> If you're using [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises and aren't using a Microsoft Entra account to connect to [!INCLUDE [cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)], you must also specify a user name and password of a user account for the integration. This account is referred to as the "integration user" account. If you're using a Microsoft Entra account, the integration user account is not required or displayed. The integration user will be set up automatically and does not require a license.

## Link your Business Central and Dataverse environments

Businesses want to keep their data safe and secure within their privacy boundary, and especially when their business management application integrates with other apps. By linking [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] environments, you’ll not only achieve those considerations, but also give your administrators an easier way to create and maintain your integrations with other Dynamics 365 apps.

In the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] admin center, you can link your [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] environment to your [!INCLUDE [cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] environment. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can use the information from the link to make it easier, and more secure, to integrate with other Dynamics 365 apps, such as Sales and Field Service. For example, the linked [!INCLUDE [cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] environment URL is available by default on the **Dataverse Connection Setup** page and when you run the **Dataverse Connection Setup** assisted setup guide.

## Allow for different currencies

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] companies can connect to a [!INCLUDE [cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] environment that has a base currency that's different than their local currency.

> [!NOTE]
> Synchronizing multiple currencies requires that you're using a unidirectional synchronization, from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to [!INCLUDE [cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)].

To learn more about the base currency in [!INCLUDE [cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)], go to [Transaction Currency (currency) entity](/powerapps/developer/data-platform/transaction-currency-currency-entity). 

To learn more about currencies in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], go to [Currencies in Business Central](finance-currencies.md).

To allow for different currencies, before you connect, be sure that you've specified the following settings:

* The base transaction currency setting in [!INCLUDE [cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] has the currency code that's specified on the **Currencies** page in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].
* There's at least one exchange rate specified for the currency in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on the **Currency Exchange Rates** page.

When you enable the connection to [!INCLUDE [cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)], [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] adds its local currency to the **Currency** entity in [!INCLUDE [cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)]. The local currency uses the exchange rate from the **Currency Factor** field on the **Currency Exchange Rates** page.

Because currency synchronization is unidirectional, from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to [!INCLUDE [cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)], monetary amounts convert and synchronize as follows:

* If in the [!INCLUDE [cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] base currency, amounts convert to the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] local currency based on the latest exchange rate synchronized from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].
* If in the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] local currency, amounts synchronize with the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] local currency in one of the additional, non-base currencies in [!INCLUDE [cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)].

## Set up a connection to [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)]

For all authentication types other than Microsoft 365 authentication, you set up your connection to [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] on the **Dataverse Connection Setup** page. For Microsoft 365 authentication, we recommend that you use the **Dataverse Connection Setup** assisted setup guide. The guide makes it easier to set up the connection and specify advanced features, such as the ownership model and initial synchronization.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> During the setup of the connection to [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)], the administrator will be asked to give following permissions to a registered Azure application named [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Integration to [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)]:
>
> * **Access [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] as you** permission is needed so [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can, on behalf of administrator, automatically create non-licensed non-interactive [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Integration application user, assign security roles to this user and to deploy [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Integration Solution to [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)]. This permission is used only once during set up of connection to [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)].  
> * **Have full access to Dynamics 365 [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]** permission is needed so automatically created [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Integration application user can access [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] data that will be synchronized.  
> * **Sign in and read your profile** permission is needed to verify user logging in actually has System Administrator security role assigned in [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)].  
>
> By giving consent on behalf of organization, the administrator is entitling the registered Azure application called [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Integration to [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] to synchronize data using automatically created [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Integration application user's credentials.

### To use the Dataverse Connection Setup assisted setup guide

The Dataverse Connection Setup guide can make it easier to connect the applications, and can even help you run an initial synchronization. If you choose to run initial synchronization, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will review the data in both applications and provide recommendations for how to approach initial synchronization. The following table describes the recommendations.

|Recommendation  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|**Full synchronization**|Data exists only in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], or only in [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)]. The recommendation is to synchronize all data from the service that has it to the other service.|
|**No synchronization**|Data exists in both applications, and running full synchronization would duplicate the data. The recommendation is to couple records.|
|**Dependency not satisfied**|Data exists in both applications, but the row or table can't be synchronized because it depends on a row or table that has the No synchronization recommendation. For example, if customers can't be synchronized, then data for contacts that depends on the customer data can't be synchronized either.|

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Typically, you only use full synchronization when you're integrating the applications for the first time, and only one application contains data. Full synchronization can be useful in a demonstration environment because it automatically creates and couples records in each application, which makes it faster to start working with synchronized data. However, you should only run full synchronization if you want one row in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] for each row in [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] for the table mappings. Otherwise, the result can be duplicate records.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Assisted Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose **Set up a connection to Microsoft Dataverse** to start the assisted setup guide.
3. Fill in the fields as necessary.

> [!NOTE]
> If you aren't prompted to sign in with your administrator account, it's probably because pop-ups are blocked. To sign in, allow pop-ups from `https://login.microsoftonline.com`.

### To create or maintain the connection manually

The following procedure describes how to set up the connection manually on the **Dataverse Connection Setup** page. The **Dataverse Connection Setup** page is where you manage integration settings.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Dataverse Connection Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. Enter the following information for the connection from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)].

    |Field|Description|
    |-----|-----|
    |**Environment URL**|If you own environments in [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)], we'll find them for you when you run the setup guide. If you want to connect to a different environment in another tenant, you can enter the administrator credentials for the environment and we'll find it. |
    |**Enabled**|Start using the integration. If you don't enable the connection now, the connection settings will be saved but users won't be able to access [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] data from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. You can return to this page and enable the connection later.  |

3. In the **Ownership Model** field, choose whether you want a team table in [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] to own new records, or one or more specific users. If you choose **Person**, you must specify each user. If you choose **Team**, the default business unit will display in the **Coupled Business Unit** field.

    <!--Need to verify the details in this table, are these specific to Sales maybe?  IK: No they are not and no longer relevant 
    Enter the following advanced settings.-->

    <!-- |Field|Description|
    |-----|-----|

## Customize the match-based coupling

Starting in 2021 release wave 2, an administrator can enter criteria to couple records based on matches. You can start the algorithm for matching records from the following places in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]:

* List pages that show records that are synchronized with [!INCLUDE [cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)], such as the Customers and Items pages.  

    Select multiple records, and then choose the **Related** action, choose **Dataverse**, choose **Coupling**, and then choose **Match-Based Coupling**.

    When you start the match-based coupling process from a master data list, a coupling job is scheduled after you specify the coupling criteria.  
* The **Dataverse Full Synch. Review** page.  

    When the full synchronization process detects uncoupled records in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and [!INCLUDE [cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)], a **Select Coupling Criteria** link appears for the integration table.  

    You can start the **Run Full Synchronization** process from the **Dataverse Connection Setup** and **Dynamics 365 Connection Setup** pages. You can also start it in the **Set up a connection to Dataverse** assisted setup guide when you complete your setup.  

    When you start the match-based coupling process from the **Dataverse Full Synch. Review** page, a coupling job is scheduled after you complete the setup.  
* The **Integration Table Mappings** list.  

    Select a mapping, choose the **Coupling** action, and then choose **Match-Based Coupling**.

    When you start the match-based coupling process from an integration table mapping, a coupling job runs for all uncoupled records in the mapping. You can also select uncoupled records in the list to run the job only for those records.

In all three cases, the **Select Coupling Criteria** page opens so that you can define the relevant coupling criteria. In this page, customize the coupling with the following tasks:

* Choose the fields to use to match [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] records with [!INCLUDE [cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] entities. You can specify whether the match is case-sensitive.  

* Specify whether to synchronize after you couple records. If records use bidirectional mapping, you can also specify what happens if conflicts are listed in the **Resolve Update Conflicts** page.  

* Prioritize the order in which records are searched by specifying a *match priority* for the relevant mapping fields. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will search for a match in ascending order based on the value in the **Match Priority** field. A blank value in the **Match Priority** field equals priority 0, which is the highest priority. Fields with the 0 priority are considered first.  

* Specify whether to create a new entity instance in [!INCLUDE [cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] in case no unique uncoupled match can be found by using the match criteria. To activate this capability, choose the **Create New if Unable to Find a Match** action.  

### View the results of the coupling job

To view the results of the coupling job, open the **Integration Table Mappings** page, select the relevant mapping, choose the **Coupling** action, and then choose the **Integration Coupling Job Log** action.  

If records failed to couple, you can choose the value in the **Failed** column to open a list of errors that describe why that happened.  

Typically, coupling fails for the following reasons:

* No matching criteria was defined

    Run the match-based coupling again, but remember to define coupling criteria.

* No match was found for the fields specified in the matching criteria

    Repeat the coupling using different fields.

* Multiple matches were found for several records based on the the fields specified in the matching criteria  

    Repeat the coupling using different fields.

* A match was found, but the record is already coupled to a record in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]  

    Repeat the coupling using different fields, or investigate why that [!INCLUDE [cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] entity is coupled to the record in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

> [!TIP]
> To help you get an overview over the progress of the coupling, the **Coupled to Dataverse** field shows whether a record is coupled to a [!INCLUDE [cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] entity. You can use the **Coupled to Dataverse** field to filter the list of records you're synchronizing.

## Upgrade connections from Business Central online to use certificate-based authentication

> [!NOTE]
> This section is relevant only for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online tenants that are hosted by Microsoft. Online tenants hosted by ISVs, and on-premises installations, are not affected.

In April 2022, [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] is deprecating the Office365 authentication type (username/password). For more information, see [Deprecation of Office365 authentication type](/power-platform/important-changes-coming#deprecation-of-office365-authentication-type-and-organizationserviceproxy-class-for-connecting-to-dataverse). Additionally, in March 2022, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is deprecating the use of client secret based service-to-service authentication for online tenants. You must use certificate-based service-to-service authentication for connections to [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)]. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online tenants that are hosted by ISVs, and on-premises installations can continue to use client secrets for authentication.

To avoid disrupting integrations, _you must upgrade_ the connection to use certificate-based authentication. Although the change is scheduled for March 2022, we strongly recommend that you upgrade as soon as possible. The following steps describe how to upgrade to certificate-based authentication. 

### To upgrade your Business Central online connection to use certificate-based authentication

1. Depending on whether you integrate with Dynamics 365 Sales, do one of the following:
   * If you do, open the **Microsoft Dynamics 365 Connection Setup** page.
   * If you don't, open the **Dataverse Connection Setup** page.
2. Choose **Connection**, and then **Use Certificate Authentication** to upgrade the connection to use certificate based authentication.
3. Sign in with administrator credentials for Dataverse. It should take less than a minute to sign in.

> [!NOTE]
> You must repeat these steps in each [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] environment, including both production and sandbox environments, and in each company where you have a connection to [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)].

## Connecting on-premises versions

To connect [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises to [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)], you must specify some information on the **Dataverse Connection Setup** page.

To connect using a Microsoft Entra account, you must register an application in Microsoft Entra ID. You'll have to provide the application ID, key vault secret, and the redirect URL to use. The redirect URL is pre-populated and should work for most installations. You must set up your installation to use HTTPS. For more information, see [Configuring SSL to Secure the Business Central Web Client Connection](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/deployment/configure-ssl-web-client-connection). If you're setting up your server to have a different home page, you can change the URL. The client secret will be saved as an encrypted string in your database. 

### To register an application in Microsoft Entra ID for connecting from Business Central to Dataverse

The following steps assume that you use Microsoft Entra ID to manage identities and access. For more information about registering an application in Microsoft Entra ID, see [Quickstart: Register an application with the Microsoft identity platform](/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app). 

1. In the Azure Portal, under **Manage** on the Navigation Pane, choose **Authentication**.  
2. Under **Redirect URLs**, add the redirect URL that is suggested on the **Dataverse Connection Setup** page in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].
3. Under **Manage**, choose **API permissions**.
4. Under **Configured permissions**, choose **Add a permission**, and then add delegated permissions on the **Microsoft APIs** tab as follows:
    * For Business Central, add the **Financials.ReadWrite.All** permissions.
    * For Dynamics CRM, add the **user_impersonation** permissions.  

    > [!NOTE]
    > The name of the Dynamics CRM API might change.

5. Under **Manage**, choose **Certificates & Secrets**, and then create a new secret for your app. You will use the secret either in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], in the **Client Secret** field on the **Dataverse Connection Setup** page, or store in a secure storage and provide it in an event subscriber as described earlier in this topic.
6. Choose **Overview**, and then find the **Application (client) ID** value. This ID is the Client ID of your application. You must enter it either on the **Dataverse Connection Setup** page in the **Client ID** field, or store it in a secure storage and provide it in an event subscriber.
7. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], on the **Dataverse Connection Setup** page, in the **Environment URL** field, enter the URL for your [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] environment.
8. To enable the connection to [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)], turn on the **Enabled** toggle.
9. Sign in with your administrator account for Microsoft Entra ID (this account must have a valid license for [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] and be an administrator in your [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] environment). After you sign in, you will be prompted to allow your registered application to sign in to [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] on behalf of the organization. You must give consent to complete the setup.

   > [!NOTE]
   > If you aren't prompted to sign in with your administrator account, it is probably because pop ups are blocked. To sign in, allow pop-ups from `https://login.microsoftonline.com`.

### To disconnect from [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)]

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Dataverse Connection Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Dataverse Connection Setup** page, turn off the **Enabled** toggle.

# Integrate with Microsoft Dynamics 365 Field Service

Service organizations require a front-to-back application in which finance, inventory, and procurement are tightly coupled with service delivery. They generate financial data with every transaction. Every work order represents cost and revenue, and every resource generates profit and loss. Customer interactions add entries on the general ledger. The integration between [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] streamlines the end-to-end process of managing service operations and ensures a smooth flow of information between the two systems.  

You can easily create and manage work orders in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)], track the progress of service tasks, assign resources, and capture consumption details. When you complete a work order in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)], the integration enables the smooth transfer of data to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] for further processing.  

The integration also facilitates the invoicing and fulfillment of work orders in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. You can generate accurate invoices based on the service activities and the consumption recorded in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)].  

By integrating [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)], you don't have to enter data manually or duplicate efforts. Integration also provides a comprehensive view of service operations and finances, enabling better decision-making and operational efficiency.

## Prerequisites

Because [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] is built on top of Dynamics 365 Sales, you must [set up a connection to Dataverse](/dynamics365/business-central/admin-how-to-set-up-a-dynamics-crm-connection#to-use-the-dataverse-connection-setup-assisted-setup-guide) and [enable integration to Dynamics 365 Sales](/dynamics365/business-central/admin-prepare-dynamics-365-for-sales-for-integration#connection-settings-in-the-setup-guide).

You must download the following apps from AppSource, and install them in your [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] environment:

- [Field Service Integration](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2277917)
- [Business Central Virtual Table](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2304910)

> [!NOTE]
> The [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Virtual Table app is optional. You only need it if you want to view information about item availability from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)]. To learn more, go to [View item availability in Business Central from Field Service](#view-item-availability-in-business-central-from-field-service).

### Permissions and security roles for user accounts

When you install the Integration Solution, permissions for the integration user account are configured. If those permissions change, you might need to reset them. To do that, reinstall the Integration Solution from the **Dynamics 365 Connection Setup** page by choosing **Redeploy Integration Solution**. The following sections list the permissions and security roles that the solution deploys for each app.

#### Sales

- Dynamics 365 [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Integration Administrator
- Dynamics 365 [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Integration User
- Dynamics 365 [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Product Availability User

#### Business Central

Users who post project journals must have the following permission set:

- Dynamics 365 Sales Integration

#### Field Service

To use the integrated data, users must have the following security role:

- Business Central Field Service Integration

For example, users must have this role to connect work orders to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] for processing.

> [!NOTE]
> Ensure that users are assigned to the standard security roles and profiles in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)].  
>
> To learn more about column security profiles in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)], go to [Field Service security roles](/dynamics365/field-service/users-licenses-permissions#field-service-security-roles).
>
> Administrators must add one of the appropriate column security profiles to users in Power Platform. To learn more, go to [Add teams or users to a column security profile to control access](/power-platform/admin/add-teams-users-field-security-profile).

> [!NOTE]
> To use the **Open in Business Central** action in Sales, you must have the following privileges for the following tables:
>
> - You must have **Read** permissions for the **Dynamics 365 Business Central Connection** (nav_connection) table.
> - You must have **Read**, **Write**, and **Delete** permissions for the **Default Dynamics 365 Business Central Connection** (nav_defaultconnection) table.

### Other settings in Field Service

On the **Field Service Setting** page, make the following changes:

- On the **Purchase** tab, clear the **Use of Products Out of Stock** field. Otherwise, you might get an "out of stock" warning when you choose a product that's out of stock in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)], but is in stock in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].
- On the **Work Order / Booking** tab, turn off the **Calculate Price** and **Calculate Cost** toggles. In the **Work Order Invoice Creation** field, choose **Never**.

> [!NOTE]
> Setting up a connection to [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] removes the coupling between resources and products. To make [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] items available in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)], update the **Field Service Product Type** field to match the **Type** field on the items in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. To learn more, go to [Create a product or service](/dynamics365/field-service/create-product-or-service#create-a-product-or-service).

## Set up the integration in Business Central

After you have a connection to Dataverse and Sales, you can set up your integration to [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)].

1. Download and install the **Field Service Integration** app from [AppSource](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2277917). Afterward, on the **Extension Management** page, find the Field Service Integration app, and choose the **Set up** action to run the assisted setup guide.
2. On the **Assisted Setup** page in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], choose **Set up integration to Dynamics 365 Field Service** to run the assisted setup guide.

This section describes the key settings in the guide.

Optionally, if you want to enable technicians to view information about item availability from work orders, choose the **Install Business Central Virtual Table app** link.

To let people post consumption of items and services in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] work orders, specify the **Project Journal Template** and **Project Journal Batch** to use to post consumption of products and services.

Because services are expressed in duration in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)], specify the **Hours Unit of Measure** to use to convert durations to quantities in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

You can also specify when work order products and service lines synchronize to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For example, they might synchronize when work order lines are used, or when someone completes a work order. Choose the appropriate option in the **Synchronize work order products/services** field.

After work order products and services synchronize to project journals in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can choose whether to post the project journals manually. Choose the appropriate option in the **Automatically post project journals lines** field:

- When a work order is complete
- When work order products or services are used

After you finish the setup, run a full synchronization from the **Dynamics 365 Field Service Integration Setup** page. This action synchronizes table mappings for things like:

- Project tasks for projects with the **Apply Usage Link** set. This synchronization makes [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] projects available for selection in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)].
- Resources that aren't blocked, don't have **Use Time Sheet** selected, and do have **Hours** specified as the unit of measure on the **Dynamics 365 Field Service Integration Setup** page.
- Service items (requires that you're using the Premium experience in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]).

## Integration table mappings for synchronization

The basis of synchronizing data is mapping the tables and fields in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with tables and columns in Dataverse, so they can exchange the data. Mapping happens through integration tables. To learn more about table mappings, go to [Mapping the Tables and Fields to Synchronize](/dynamics365/business-central/admin-how-to-modify-table-mappings-for-synchronization).

The following integration table mappings install if you choose the **Project (default)** integration type.

|Integration table mapping  |Data the mapping synchronizes  |
|---------|---------|
|**PJLINE-WORDERPRODUCT** | Maps work order products in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] to project journal lines in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  |
|**PJLINE-WORDERSERVICE** |  Maps work order services in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] to project journal lines in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  |
|**PROJECTTASK** |  Maps projects and project tasks in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to products in external projects in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)].  |
|**RESOURCE-BOOKABLERSC**  | Maps resources in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to bookable resources in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)].  |
|**SVCITEM-CUSTASSET**     | (Premium Experience only) Maps service items in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to customer assets in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)].        |
|**LOCATIONS**     |  Maps locations in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to warehouses in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)]. <br><br> **Note:** The **LOCATIONS** integration table mapping is available only if you turn on the **Location Mandatory** toggle on the **Inventory Setup** page.      |

In addition to those, the following integration table mappings install if you choose the **Project and Service** integration type.

|Integration table mapping  |Data the mapping synchronizes  |
|---------|---------|
|**SRVORDER**| Maps service orders in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to work orders in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)], including the status of the orders. |
|**SRVORDERITEMLINE**| Maps service item lines in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to work order incidents in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)].|
|**SRVORDERLINE-ITEM**| Maps items on service order lines in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with work order products in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)]. |
|**SRVORDERLINE-RESOURCE**| Maps resources on service order lines in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with bookable resource booking in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)].|
|**SRVORDERLINE-SERVICE**|Maps service lines in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with work order services in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)]. |
|**SRVORDERTYPE**| Maps service order types in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to work order types in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)].|
|**SVCITEM-CUSTASSET**|Maps service items in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with customer assets in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)].|

> [!NOTE]
> The integration also maps fields that show item availability information in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on work orders and products in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)]. However, the mapping happens through a virtual table, and not an integration table. Some setup is required. To learn more about virtual tables and viewing item availability, go to [View item availability in Business Central from Field Service](#view-item-availability-in-business-central-from-field-service).

### Synchronize location and warehouse data

You can integrate [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] warehouses with locations in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The integration gives technicians information about the availability of a product or item at a specific location.

The data synchronizes through a unidirectional (from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]) integration table mapping between locations in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and warehouses in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)]. To use the integration table mapping, you must turn on the **Location Mandatory** toggle on the **Inventory Setup** page in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] .

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] synchronizes locations with the following settings on the **Location Card** page:

- The **Use as In-Transit** toggle is turned off.
- **Project Consump. Whse. Handling** is different from Warehouse Pick (mandatory)
- **Assm. Consump. Whse. Handling** is different from Warehouse Pick (mandatory)

In [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], on the **Locations** and **Location Card** page, you can use the **Warehouse** action to open a coupled location in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)], synchronize it, set up and delete couplings, and view synchronization logs.

### View item availability in Business Central from Field Service

When technicians prepare work orders, it's helpful that they can be sure that the items they need to do the work are available. This section describes how to let people view item availability information from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)].

The first thing to do is to install the [Business Central Virtual Table](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2277917) app from AppSource.

Afterward, on the **Dynamics 365 Field Service Integration Setup** or **Set up integration to Dynamics 365 Field Service** pages in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], turn on the **Enable Inventory Availability by Location** toggle. When you enable inventory availability by location, a **dyn365bc_availabilitybylocation_v2_0** virtual table becomes available. You must create a synthetic relation between the following tables:

- The native **Product** and **Work Order Product** tables in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] and the **Item Availability** virtual table that shows item availability. 

There's an assisted setup guide to help you create the synthetic relation.

To create the synthetic relation, follow these steps:

1. In [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], on the **Dataverse Connection Setup** page, use the **Synthetic Relations** action
1. On the **Synthetic Relations** page, choose the **New** action to start the **New Synthetic Relation** assisted setup guide.
1. In the **Native Dataverse Table** field, choose the :::image type="content" source="media/assist-edit-icon.png" alt-text="The AssistEdit icon."::: button, and then choose **CRM Product**.
1. In the **Virtual Dataverse Table** field, choose the :::image type="content" source="media/assist-edit-icon.png" alt-text="The AssistEdit icon."::: button, and then choose **Inventory Availability by Location**.
1. On the **Synthetic Relations** page, choose the **New** action to start the **New Synthetic Relation** assisted setup guide again.
1. In the **Native Dataverse Table** field, choose the :::image type="content" source="media/assist-edit-icon.png" alt-text="The AssistEdit icon."::: button, and then choose **FS Work Order Product**.

> [!NOTE]
> It can take a few moments to create the synthetic relations.

To learn more about virtual tables and synthetic relationships, go to [Use virtual tables to get more data](admin-synchronizing-business-central-and-sales.md#use-virtual-tables-to-get-more-data).  

The next thing to do is to create and customize the associated view that people use in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] to check the inventory of products.

To create the view, follow these steps:

1. In **Power Apps admin center**, on the navigation pane, choose **Tables**.
1. Choose the **Item Availability by Location** table.
1. In the **Data experiences** part, choose **Views**.
1. Choose the **View column** action, and then choose the columns you want the view to include. The following columns are typical choices:

    - **Location Code** shows where the product is available.
    - **Item No.** confirms you're looking at the correct product.
    - **Item Description** provides information about the product.
    - **Unit of Measure Code** gives you an idea of the space you need.
    - **Remaining Quantity** shows how much of the product is available at each location.

### Integrate service management features

Integrating [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] lets you manage service tasks, consumption, and financial transactions to benefit service technicians, service managers, and finance teams. It's a powerful solution for managing work orders and consumption in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] and efficiently invoicing and fulfilling them in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The integration is bi-directional, meaning that when you enter or change data in either app, the data updates in the other.

> [!NOTE]
> When you enable the integration with service management features, you also enable the integration with projects. You can't enable only the service management integration.

#### Set up the integration with service management features

You must have a **Premium** license. When you do, on the **Company Information** page in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], set the **User Experience** field to **Premium**.

You can enable the integration in the **Integration Type** field by selecting **Project and Service** in the following places:

- In the **Set up integration to Dynamics 365 Field Service** assisted setup guide.
- On the **Dynamics 365 Field Service Integration Setup** page.

When the **Integration Type** field is set to **Project and Service**, the following things happen when you enable the integration:

- Creates a solution in Power Apps named **Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central Field Service Integration (service)**.
- Adds integration table mappings for service order types, service documents, service lines, and service item lines. To learn more about the table mappings, go to [Integration table mappings for synchronization](#integration-table-mappings-for-synchronization).
- Fields in the headers on service orders and work orders transfer information, such as the **Service Account**, **Billing Account**, and **Work Order Type**.
- **Service Item Lines** and **Work Order Incidents** in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] transfer information about the customer assets being repaired.
- **Service Line** fields and **Work Order Products** and **Work Order Services** fields, such as **Qty. to Ship**, **Qty. to Invoice**, and **Qty. to Consume**.

In [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], make the following settings on the **Service Management Setup** page:

- Turn on the **Service Order Type Mandatory** toggle. This setting is required because [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] requires a work order type.
- Make sure that the number series you use for service orders is set up to allow manual numbering. On the **No. Series** page, select the **Manual Nos.** checkbox for the number series. Manual numbering lets you create work orders in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] and synchronize them with service orders. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses the order number from [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)].
- Turn off the **One Service Item Line/Order** toggle. This setting lets you have more than one work item line.
- Turn on the **Archive Orders** toggle.
- Make the **Service Order Type** field on service orders mandatory because the **Work Order Type** is mandatory on [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] work orders.

If you choose **Enable Inventory Availability by Location** when you set up the integration, you can view the allocated product quantity from work orders in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] as part of the gross requirements in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]'s inventory availability calculation. Demand generated by orders in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] automatically becomes input for planning through synchronized service orders.

As service or work orders progress toward completion, their status changes. The following table shows how the statues align in both apps.

|[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] status  |[!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] status  | Alignment |
|---------|-----------|---------|
|Pending  |Unscheduled| Bidirectional per mapping to account for item demand. |
|Pending  |Scheduled  | [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Synchronizes the quantity to ship and the quantity to invoice.|
|In process | In progress | [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Synchronizes the quantity to ship and the quantity to invoice. |
|Finished | Completed     | [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Ready for posting in Business Central. |
|Finished | Posted        | [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. When fully invoiced or deleted after partial invoicing in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].|
|N/A     | Canceled      | Not synchronized. Manual alignment is needed for canceled work orders. |

### Upgrade your integration to include service management features

If you set up the integration to only include projects, but decide to add service management features later, that's easy to do in just a few steps. Remember that you must have a Premium license though.

1. On the **Dynamics 365 Field Service Integration Setup** page, turn off the **Enabled** toggle.
1. In the **Integration Type** field, choose **Project and Service**.
1. Turn on the **Enabled** toggle.

## Use data in both applications

The following sections describe the features where you can use the data that comes from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)].

### Field Service

You can [create work orders](/dynamics365/field-service/create-work-order) using the **Service Account** and **Billing Account** from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. On work orders, you must select the **Business Central Project Task** in the **External Project** field. Selecting a project lets you synchronize work order products and services to the appropriate project task in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

You can add inventory and noninventory items as **Work Order Products** on work orders and get the quantity on hand and costs and prices from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. To learn more, go to [Create a work order from the work order form and record list](/dynamics365/field-service/create-work-order#create-a-work-order-from-the-work-order-form-and-record-list).

You can add items of the type service as **Work Order Services**, and get costs and prices from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. To learn more, go to [Products and services tab](/dynamics365/field-service/work-order-experience#products-and-services-tab).

> [!NOTE]
> When a product or service's status on a work order changes from **Estimated** to **Used** in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)], they synchronize to project journal lines in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

You can book a resource and relate the **Bookings** to work order services using a **Bookable Resource** from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

You can use the **Open in Business Central** action in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] to open a location that's coupled to a warehouse.

Use the **Open in Business Central** action to open a location that's coupled to a warehouse. On the **Products** page, technicians can check how much of particular product is available at a warehouse they specify.

From the **Work Order** and **Product** pages, you can view where, and how much, of an item is available. On the **Related** menu, choose **Items Availability by Location**.

When you mark a work order product or service as **Used** on a work order with a specific work order type, the lines synchronize to a service order. Consumption is also posted, based on settings on the **Dynamics 365 Field Service Integration Setup** page.

During consumption and invoice posting in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the quantities are updated on the original work order product and work order service lines in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)].

### Business Central

Depending on your settings on the **Field Service Integration Setup** page, when work orders include products and services, consumption information is transferred and posted using a **Project Journal** in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

The **Quantity To Bill** and **Duration To Bill** values are copied to the **Qty- to Transfer to Invoice** field. Based on those values, you can create and post sales invoices in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to invoice the customer. After the invoice is posted and synchronized to the Dynamics 365 Sales environment, or consumption is processed in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the quantity invoiced and quantity consumed display on the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] tab on the **Work Order Product** and **Work Order Service** pages.  

Use the **Project Planning Lines** page to track posting and invoicing of consumption on work orders. From the **Project Planning Lines** page, you can create and post sales invoices in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Afterward, you can synchronize them with [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] and keep track of the status of the invoices.

> [!NOTE]
> Work order services with a booking that uses a bookable resource that's coupled to a [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] resource synchronize to two project journal lines:
>
> - One line of type **Budget** for the coupled resource
> - One line of type **Billable** for the item being serviced
>
> The product that's chosen on the work order service must be coupled to an item of the type **Service** in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Also, the base unit of measure for the item must be set to the **Hours Unit of Measure** that's chosen on the **Dynamics 365 Field Service Integration Setup** page.
>
> You can create an invoice for an item of the type **Service** from the billable project planning line, and use the budget project planning line to register cost with the resource.

Use the **Locations in Field Service** action on the **Locations** and **Location Card** pages to open a coupled location in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)], synchronize it, set up and delete couplings, and view synchronization logs. You can view the allocated product quantity from work orders in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] as part of the gross requirements in Business Central's inventory availability calculation. Demand generated by orders in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] automatically become an input for planning.

# Save and personalize list views

When you set a filter on a list and you want to keep the filter for later, you can save it as a view. To learn more about filtering lists, go to [Set filters on lists](ui-enter-criteria-filters.md#set-filters-on-lists).

If views exist, the **Views** group appears at the top of the filter pane. Views are variations of the list that is preconfigured with filters. You can define and save as many views as you want per list. The views will be available the next time you open the list, from any device or browser.

[!INCLUDE [about-ui-learn](includes/about-ui-learn.md)]

## To save a view

1. Open any list page.
2. Select ![Filter pane icon.](media/open-filter-pane-icon.png "Filter pane icon") at the top of the list or select <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>F3</kbd>.
3. Set one or more new filters. To learn more, go to [Set filters on lists](ui-enter-criteria-filters.md#set-filters-on-lists).
4. When you set  the filters, choose the ![Save View.](media/save_view_icon.png "Save View") icon.

    If you set a filter for a list view that was already saved as a view, the existing view updates when you save.
5. If you're saving a new view, enter a name for the view in the **All (Copy)** box, such as "Items I own".
6. To accept the name, select the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key or move the cursor from the text box.

If you don't give it a name, the default name is **All (Copy)**.

> [!TIP]
> Not seeing the ![Save View](media/save_view_icon.png "Save View") icon? To learn more, go to [Why don't I have a Save icon](/dynamics365/business-central/ui-views-faq#save).

## To rename or remove a view

1. For the view that currently displays the list, choose the ![Show more options.](media/show-more-options-icon.png "Show more options") icon to see which options are available.
2. Choose either the **Rename** or the **Remove** action.

## Managing Many Views

As the number of views on a page grows, you might need more control over how views are presented in the filter pane. With the **Personalizing** banner, you can hide unwanted views or reorder your views to get the perfect sequence. To learn more, go to [Personalize Your Workspace](ui-personalization-user.md).

# Import payroll transactions

To account for salary payments and related transactions, you must import and post financial transactions made by your payroll provider to the general ledger. To do this, you first import a file that you receive from the payroll provider into the **General Journal** page. Then you map the external accounts in the payroll file to the relevant G/L accounts. Lastly, you post the payroll transactions according to the account mapping.

> [!NOTE]  
> To use this functionality, an extension for payroll import must be installed and enabled. The Ceridian Payroll and the Quickbooks Payroll File Import extensions are pre-installed in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For more information, see [Customizing [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Using Extensions](ui-extensions.md).

## To import a payroll file

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. In the relevant general journal batch, choose the **Import Payroll Transactions** action. An assisted setup guide opens.
3. Follow the steps on the **Import Payroll Transactions** page.

    > [!TIP]  
    >   In the step about mapping the external payroll records to your G/L accounts, the mappings that you make will be remembered next time the same records are imported. This will save you time as you do not have to manually fill in the **Account No.** field in the general journal every time you have imported recurring payroll transactions.   

    When you choose the **OK** button in the assisted setup guide, the **General Journal** page is filled with lines representing the transactions that the payroll file contains and with the relevant accounts prefilled in the **G/L Account** fields according to mappings you made in the guide.
4. Edit or post the journal lines as for any other general ledger transactions. For more information, see [Post Transactions Directly to the General Ledger](finance-how-post-transactions-directly.md).

# Sustainability scorecards and goals overview

This article offers guidance on how to create scorecards and goals, and how to update the status of goals. Scorecards and goals allow organizations to curate sustainability metrics and track them against key business objectives. Goals can be created based on current and target values, so users can keep track of the progress of current gas emissions, or water/waste intensity, compared to previous periods.  

## Create a scorecard  

To create a sustainability scorecard, follow these steps:

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sustainability Scorecards**, and then select the related link.
2. On the **Sustainability Scorecards** page, select **New** to create a new scorecard.  
3. Specify the **No.** and the **Name** fields on the **General** FastTab, and then add the **Owner**.

> [!NOTE]
> In the **Owner** field, you can only choose users who enabled the **Sustainability Manager** field on the **User Setup** page.

## Create goals  

To create a new sustainability goal, follow these steps:

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sustainability Scorecards**, and then select the related link.
2. Choose the **Goals** action to create a new sustainability goal for the scorecard.  
3. Select **New** to start creating a goal.
4. The **Scorecard No.** is automatically added based on the value from the sustainability scorecard, and you can't edit this field. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] also fills in the **Unit of Measure** field based on the **Emission Unit of Measure Code** on the **Sustainability Setup** page.  
5. Fill in **No.** and **Name** of the new sustainability goal. The **Owner** field is automatically filled in based on the value from the connected **Sustainability Scorecard**.
6. You can create a sustainability goal for the entire company, a specific country/region, or a facility. To create a specific goal, choose the country or region in the **Country/Region Code** field or the facility in the **Responsibility Center** field.  
7. Select the **Start Date** and **End Date** fields to set up a dedicated period for tracking current values. This configuration determines the values in the **Current Value for CO2**, **Current Value for CH4**, **Current Value for N2O**, **Current Value for Water Intensity**, and **Current Value for Waste Intensity** fields.  
8. Select the **Baseline Start Date** and **Baseline End Date** fields to set up a dedicated baseline period for comparing current values. This configuration determines the values in the **Baseline for CO2**, **Baseline for CH4**, **Baseline for N2O**, **Baseline for Water Intensity**, and **Baseline for Waste Intensity** fields.  
9. You can also add target values in the selected **Unit of Measure** field for the current period using the following **Target Value for CO2**, **Target Value for CH4**, **Target Value for N2O**, **Target Value for Water Intensity**, and **Target Value for Waste Intensity** fields.
10. You can specify one of these goals as a **Main Goal**. Values from the main goal are used on the **Sustainability Manager** Role Center.  

If you have many goals on the page, you can use the **Show My Goals** action to show only your goals. To show all, run the **Show All Goals** action.  

> [!NOTE]
> You can only create sustainability goals for a specific sustainability scorecard. You can't create goals that aren't related to a scorecard, but you can create more goals for one scorecard. You can only have one sustainability goal as the **Main Goal**.  

> [!NOTE]
> You can set up different combinations of goals for the whole company, specific countries or regions, and a responsibility center for a sustainability scorecard. You can also use different periods for the same model of tracking.

# Work with item attributes

When customers inquire about an item, either in correspondence or in an integrated web shop, they might ask or search according to characteristics, such as height and model year. To provide this customer service, you can assign item attribute values of different types to your items, which can then be used when searching for items.

You can also assign item attributes to item categories, which then apply to the items that use the item categories. For more information, see [Categorize Item](inventory-how-categorize-items.md).

> [!TIP]  
> If you attach pictures to items, the Image Analyzer extension can detect attributes in the image, and suggest the attributes so you can decide whether to assign them. The extension is ready to go. You just need to enable it. For more information, see [The Image Analyzer Extension](ui-extensions-image-analyzer.md).

# Set up customer discount groups

You can define sales line discounts for a group of customers instead of applying them individually.

**Customer Discount Groups** are similar to [customer price groups](sales-how-to-set-up-customer-price-groups.md), but can be combined with Item Discount Groups to quickly set line discounts to many items for selected customers.

## Create sales line discounts for a customer group

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customer Disc. Groups**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Customer Disc. Groups** page, select **New** to create a new discount group and give it a name under the **Code** column and add a description.
3. Choose the **Sales Line Discounts** action.
4. Fill in the **Sales Code** column with the discount group created on the previous page.
5. Fill in the fields on the lines with the **Type** (Item or Item Discount Group), **Code**, **Unit of Measure Code**, and the **Line Discount %**.
6. If the customer group needs to purchase a minimum quantity in order to gain the discount, fill in the **Minimum Quantity** field.
7. If necessary, enter the **Starting Date** and **Ending Date** for the discount group.
8. If relevant, you can also specify the **Currency Code** or **Variant Code** after [personalizing the columns](ui-personalization-user.md).

Repeat steps 4 through 8 for each item or item discount group you want to create a sales line discount for.

## Assign a customer to a discount group

After you set up the customer discount groups, you can enter the customer discount group codes on the customer cards.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customers**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the **Customer Card** for a customer you want to be part of a customer discount group.
3. On the **Invoicing** FastTab, in the **Customer Disc. Group** field, select the group code.

title: Design Details - Changing Costing Methods for Items
description: Learn how to assign a different costing method to an item although you have already used the item in transactions.

# Design Details: Change the Costing Method for Items

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you cannot change a costing method for an item after you have included the item in a transaction. For example, after you have bought or sold the item. If an incorrect costing method was assigned to the item or items, you might not discover the issue until you do your financial reporting.

This topic describes how to resolve this situation. The recommended approach is to replace the item that has the incorrect costing method with a new item, and use an assembly order to transfer the inventory from the old item to the new.

> [!NOTE]
> Using assembly orders allows the costs to still flow although there are outstanding purchase invoices or shipping charges to post. Additionally, it allows you to undo the conversion and get the quantities of the original items back, if needed.

> [!TIP]
> To become familiar with the process, we recommend that you start the conversion process with a single item or a small set of items.

## About Costing Methods

Costing methods control cost calculations when goods are purchased, received in inventory, and sold. Costing methods affect the timing of amounts recorded in COGS that affect gross profit. It is this flow that calculates COGS. The cost of goods sold (COGS) and revenue are used to determine gross profit, as follows:

*gross profit* = *revenue - COGS*

When you set up inventory items, you must assign a costing method. The method can vary from business to business, and from item to item, so it's important to choose the right one. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports the following costing methods:

* Average
* FIFO
* LIFO
* Standard
* Specific

For more information, see [Design Details: Costing Methods](design-details-costing-methods.md).

## Use Assembly Orders to Change Costing Method Assignments

This section describes the following steps for changing the costing method assigned to an item:

1. Define a default costing method.
2. Identify the items that to change the costing method for and renumber them.
3. Create new items with the old numbering scheme and copy the master data in a batch.
4. Manually copy related master data from the existing item to the new item.
5. Determine the inventory quantity to convert from the original item to the new item.
6. Transfer the inventory to the new item.
7. Handle inventory quantities that are allocated to demand.
8. Block the original item from further use.  

### Define a default costing method

To help avoid future mistakes you can specify a default costing method for new items. Whenever someone creates a new item, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will suggest the default costing method. You specify the default method in the **Default Costing Method** field on the **Inventory Setup** page. 

### Identify the items to change the costing method for and renumber them

You may want to give your new items the same numbers as those they are replacing. To do that, change the numbers of the existing items. For example, if the existing item number is "P1000," you might change it to "X-P1000." This is a manual change that you must make for each item.

### Create new items with the old numbering scheme and copy the master data in a batch

Create the new items using the current number scheme. With the exception of the **Costing Method** field, the new items should contain the same master data as the existing items. To transfer the master data for the item, and related data from other features, use the **Copy Item** action on the **Item Card** page. For more information, see [Copy Existing Items to Create New Items](inventory-how-copy-items.md).

After you create the new items and transfer the master data, assign the correct costing method.

### Manually copy related master data from the original item to the new item

To make the new items fully useful you must manually copy some master data from other areas, as described in the following table.

|Area  |What to copy  |How to copy it  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|Inventory |Stock-keeping units (SKUs) |Check whether a SKU is specified for the original item. If planning parameters have been entered for each SKU card, then you must manually create the SKU for the new item. If the parameters are not specified, you can use the **Create Stockkeeping Unit** batch job from the **Item Card** page to create the data.|
| |Item substitutions |Check whether any item substitutions are defined for the original item. If there are, transfer that data to the new item. To view substitute items, use the **Substitutions** action on the **Item Card** page. |
| |Analysis reports |Review the Item Analysis, Sales Analysis, and Purchase Analysis reports. For those that reference the original items you can either create a new analysis report with a reference to the new item (keeping the original analysis report to use as history) or adjust the reports so that they reference the new item. |
| |Standard journals |Check whether standard journals reference the original item and transfer that data to the new item when necessary. This information is found on the standard journals, which are available on the item journal.  |
|Sales |Sales prepayment percentage | Check whether any sales prepayment percentages are defined for the original item and transfer that data to the new item. To view prepayment percentages, on the **Item Card** page, choose **Sales**, and then **Prepayment Percentages**.|
|Purchase |Purchase prepayment percentage |Check whether any purchase prepayment percentages are defined for the original item and transfer that data to the new item. To view prepayment percentages, on the **Item Card** page, choose **Purchases**, and then **Prepayment Percentages**. |
|Warehouse |Bin contents |Review the bin content defined for the original item. If columns such as as Min. Qty., Max. Qty., Default, and Dedicated have been individually entered then you must manually create bin content for the new item. If they are not, no action is required. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will maintain the records when you register warehouse documents and journals.|
|Job |Job Prices |Check whether project prices are defined for the original item and transfer that data to the new item. This information is available on the **Project Card** page in the **Project Details – No. of Prices** part on the **FactBox pane**. |
|Service |Service resource skill |Check whether service resource skills are defined for the original item and transfer that data to the new item. To view resource skills, use the **Resource Skills** action on the **Item Card** page.  |
| |Service item components |Check whether components are defined for the original service item and transfer that data to the new item. To view service item components, on the **Item Card** page use the **Service Item** action to open the list of related service items, and then choose the **Components** action.  |
|Production |Production BOMs |Check whether any production BOMs contain the original item and replace it with the new item. To replace the original item, on the **Production BOMs** page, choose the **Exchange Production BOM Item** action. |
|Assembly |Assembly BOMs |Check whether any assembly BOMs contain the original item and manually replace it with the new item. |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If the new costing method is Standard you should enter a value in the **Standard Cost** field on the **Item Card** page. You can use the **Standard Cost Worksheet** page to set the cost shares accordingly. For more information, see [Update Standard Costs](finance-how-to-update-standard-costs.md).

### Determine the inventory quantity to convert from the original item to the new item

> [!NOTE]
> This step does not consider quantities that are included in unshipped orders. For more information, see [Handle inventory quantities that are allocated to demand](design-details-changing-costing-methods.md#handle-inventory-quantities-that-are-allocated-to-demand). 

Use a physical inventory journal to produce a list of the quantities in inventory. Depending on the warehouse location setup, use one of the following:

* Physical Invt. Journals
* Whse. Phys. Invt. Journals

Both journals can calculate the inventory quantity of the item, including the location, variant, bin, and storage location. For more information, see [Count, Adjust, and Reclassify Inventory Using Journals](inventory-how-count-adjust-reclassify.md).

### Transfer the inventory to the new item

Create and post assembly orders to transfer the cost and inventory quantity from the original item to the new item. Assembly orders can convert one item to another while preserving the costs. This helps ensure that the net totals for the inventory account and COGS are not affected (except when the new costing method is Standard, in which case costs may be distributed to variance accounts). For more information, see [Assembly Management](assembly-assemble-items.md).

When creating assembly orders, use the information from the Physical Invt. journal or Whse. Phys. Invt. journal. The following tables describe the information in the reports to enter in the header and lines on the assembly order.

#### Header

|Field  |Value to enter  |
|---------|---------|
|Item No. |The number of the new item. |
|Quantity |The quantity in physical inventory journal.<br> **NOTE:** The quantities calculated by the physical inventory journals does not include the quantities that are on orders that have not yet shipped.  |
|Variant Code |The same as in physical inventory journal.  |
|Location Code |The same as in physical inventory journal. |
|Unit of Measure Code |The same as in physical inventory journal. |
|Bin Code |The same as in physical inventory journal. |

#### Lines

|Field  |Value to enter  |
|---------|---------|
|Type |Item |
|No. |The number of the original item. |
|Quantity per |1 |
|Variant Code |The same as in physical inventory journal. |
|Location Code |The same as in physical inventory journal. |
|Unit of Measure Code |The same as in physical inventory journal. |

> [!NOTE]
> An assembly order can handle only one SKU of an item at a time. You must create an assembly order for each combination of SKU that has a quantity in inventory.

> [!NOTE]
> For a warehouse location, you might have to create picks before you can post the assembly order. To investigate that, review the setup for picking on the **Location Card** page. For more information, see [Set Up Items and Locations for Directed Put-away and Pick](warehouse-how-to-set-up-items-for-directed-put-away-and-pick.md).

### Handle inventory quantities that are allocated to demand

Ideally, the inventory for the original item should go to zero after you transfer the inventory quantities. However, there can be outstanding orders, worksheets, and journals (see the table below) that still require a quantity of the original item. The quantity could also be blocked by a reservation or item tracking.

**Example**
There are 1000 pcs. in inventory, and 20 pcs. are reserved for a sales order that has not yet shipped. In that case, you might decide to keep the 20 pcs. in the old item so that you can fulfill the outstanding order.

> [!NOTE]
> There are functional areas that can affect the quantity, as listed in the table below, so it can be tricky to find the correct amount. To be safe, using the example above, you can choose to keep 100 pcs. and transfer the remaining 900 pcs. instead. Another way to do it would be to process the documents and journals so that only a manageable few remain. Yet another alternative is to transfer the entire quantity to the new item and then transfer some of it back to the original item using the assembly order.

The following table lists functional areas where there might be outstanding quantities.

|Area  |Where to look for outstanding quantities  |
|---------|---------|
|Sales |Sales documents, including orders, return orders, invoices, quotes, blanket orders, and credit memos |
|Inventory |Item journals, reservations, item tracking, and standard cost worksheet |
|Purchase |Purchase documents, including orders, return orders, invoices, quotes, blanket orders, and credit memos |
|Planning |Requisition worksheet, planning worksheet, and order planning |
|Warehouse |Transfer orders, warehouse shipments, warehouse journals, and warehouse picks, put-aways, and movements, internal picks and put-aways, and bin creation worksheets |
|Assembly |Assembly documents, including orders, return orders, and blanket orders |
|Jobs |project planning lines and project journal lines |
|Service |Service documents and service contracts |
|Production |Production orders (planned, firm planned, and released) |

### Block the original item from further use

When the inventory for the original item is zero, you can block the item to prevent it fom being used in new transactions. To block the item, on the **Item Card** page, turn on the **Blocked** toggle. For more information, see [Block Items from Sales or Purchasing](inventory-how-block-items.md).

## Summary

Changing the costing method on items that have been used in transactions is a process, and not a standard action in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. You can use the steps described in this topic as a template for the process.

The process can be time consuming because there are several manual steps. However, taking the time to complete it will minimize the impact of mistakes on your general ledger.

We recommend the following:

1. Assess the feasibility of the process by taking one, or maybe a few, representative items through the entire process.
2. Consider contacting an experienced partner who can help you with the process.

# Walkthrough: managing projects

<!-- [!INCLUDE[complete_sample_data](includes/complete_sample_data.md)]   -->

This walkthrough introduces you to the project management features. Projects are a way for you to schedule the usage of your company's resources and to keep track of the various costs associated with the resources on a specific project. Projects involve the consumption of employee hours, machine hours, inventory items, and other types of usage that you might want to track as a project progresses.  

This walkthrough covers the setup of a new project and related tasks:

- Handle fixed pricing
- Make payments in installments
- Post invoices from projects
- Copy projects

## About this walkthrough

 This walkthrough demonstrates the following tasks:  

### Setting up a project

With the budget structure set up for projects, creating a project is straightforward. This walkthrough covers the following procedures:  

- Set up project task lines and planning lines.  
- Create project-specific prices for items, resources, and general ledger accounts.  
- Invoice customers for a project.  

### Handling fixed prices

 You can handle fixed prices and the prices for services or goods that are agreed upon in advance with customers. In this walkthrough, you'll learn how to:  

- See how contract and invoice values are determined.  
- Allow for extra work in the schedule that isn't invoiced.  

### Copying a Project

 This part of the walkthrough focuses on how to copy part or all of a project in order to reduce manual data entry and improve accuracy.

- Copy part of a project to a new project.  
- Copy project-specific prices.  
- Copy planning lines.  

### Making Payment by Installment

 When a large, expensive project lasts for a long period, the customer often makes an agreement with the company to pay by installments. This scenario shows how you set up payment by installments and covers:  

- Create payment by installments for a project.  
- Invoice payments to customers.  
- Account for usage in a project set up for payment by installments.  

## Roles

 This walkthrough includes tasks for the following roles:  

- Project Manager  
- Project Team Member  

## Prerequisites

 Before you can perform the tasks in the walkthrough, you must:  

- Install the CRONUS demonstration database.
- Create sample data by using the steps in the following section.  

## Story

This walkthrough focuses on CRONUS, which is a fictional design and consultancy firm that designs and fits new infrastructures. For example, conference halls and offices with furniture, accessories, and storage units. Most of its work is project oriented. Prakash, a project manager at CRONUS uses project to get an overview of each ongoing task that CRONUS started and completed. Prakash is usually the one who sets up deals with customers and enters the core of the project, which is task and planning lines in addition to prices, into [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Prakash finds that creating, maintaining, and reviewing information is straightforward. Prakash also likes the way [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] enables copying projects and payment by installments.

 Tricia, a project team member who reports to Prakash, is responsible for monitoring the project day-to-day. Tricia enters the work done by technicians on every task, records the items that they used, and the costs that they incurred.  

## Preparing sample data

To prepare for this walkthrough, you must add Tricia as a resource.

### To set up a project  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Projects**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action to create a new card.  
3. On the **General** FastTab, enter the following information:  

    - **Description**: **Advising on conference hall setup**  
    - **Bill-to-Customer No.**: **01445544**  

4. On the **Posting** FastTab, enter the following information:  

    - **Status**: **Planning**  
    - **Project Posting Group**: **Setting Up**  
    - **WIP Method**: **Cost Value**  

5. On the **Duration** FastTab, type today's date into the **Starting Date** and **Ending Date** fields. These dates help apply currency conversions when the project is invoiced.  
6. On the **Foreign Trade** FastTab, set the currency code to **USD**. If you select USD in the **Invoice Currency Code** field, the project is invoiced in U.S. dollars and planned in the local currency of CRONUS only.  

 You can customize the pricing for customers on a per project basis, depending on the agreements you have. In the next procedure, the project manager specifies a cost for Tricia's time, sets the price for the required software, and adds in the travel costs that the customer agreed to pay.  

### To customize pricing  

1. From the **Project Card**, choose the **Resource** action.  
2. On the **Project Resource Prices** page, enter the following information:  

    - **Code**: **Tricia**  
    - **Unit Price**: **20**  

3. Close the page.  
4. Choose the **Item** action.  
5. On the **Project Item Prices** page, enter the following information and customized price:  

    1. **Item No.**: **80201 (Graphic Program)**  
    2. **Unit Price**: **200**  

6. Close the page.  
7. Choose the **G/L Account** action.  
8. On the **Project G/L Account Prices** page, enter the following information and the cost of travel, for which the customer agreed to pay cost plus 25 percent:  

    1. **G/L Account**: **8430 (Travel)**  
    2. **Unit Cost Factor**: **1.25**  

9. Close the page.  

 The final steps in setting up a project are adding the project tasks and the planning lines that are part of each task. The planning lines determine what is invoiced to the customer.  

### To add project tasks  

1. On the **Project** card for the new project, choose the **Project Task Lines** action.  
2. The following table describes the information that you should enter in the fields.  

    |Project Task No.|Description|Project Task Type|  
    |------------------|---------------------------------------|-------------------|  
    |1000|Consulting on hall setup|Begin-Total|  
    |1010|Consultation meeting with customer|Posting|  
    |1020|Development|Posting|  
    |1090|Consulting Total|End-Total|  

3. To show that some tasks are subcategories of other tasks, choose the **Indent Project Tasks** action.  

A planning line can be one of the following types:  

- **Budget**: Added to the schedule, but not invoiced.  
- **Billable**: Invoiced, but not added to the schedule.  
- **Both Budget and Billable**: Invoiced and added to the schedule.  

In this walkthrough, the project manager uses **Both Budget and Billable**. They create three planning lines for task 1010, and two planning lines for task 1020.  

### To create planning lines  

1. Select line 1010, and then choose the **Project Planning Lines** action.  
2. Create planning lines with the following information:  

    | Line | Line Type | Planning Date  | Type        | No.   | Quantity | Unit Price |
    |------|-----------|----------------|-------------|-------|----------|------------|
    | 1    | Both Budget and Billable | (today's date) | Resource | Tricia | 40        |     |
    | 2    | Both Budget and Billable | (today's date) | Resource | Timothy | 40        |     |
    | 3    | Both Budget and Billable | (today's date) | G/L Account | 8430 (Travel) | 2 | 400    |

     Close the page. The totals are updated on the **Project Task Lines** page.  
3. Select line 1020, and then choose the **Project Planning Lines** action. Enter the following information:  

    | Line | Line Type | Planning Date  | Type        | No.   | Quantity | Unit Price |
    |------|-----------|----------------|-------------|-------|----------|------------|
    | 1    | Both Budget and Billable | (today's date) | Resource | Tricia | 80        |     |
    | 2    | Both Budget and Billable | (today's date) | Item | 80201 (Graphic program) | 1 |     |

4. Close the page. Totals are updated on the **Project Task Lines** page.  

## Calculating remaining usage

Tricia, the team project member, has been working on the project for a while and wants to register their hours and usage. Tricia didn't work more hours than was agreed upon with the customer in advance. Tricia uses the **Calculate Remaining Usage** batch job to calculate remaining usage in a project journal. For each task, the batch job calculates the difference between scheduled usage of items, resources, and general ledger expenses and the actual usage posted in project ledger entries. The remaining usage is then displayed in the project journal, and Tricia can post it.  

### To calculate remaining usage  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Project Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Project Journal** page, in the **Batch Name** field, open the **Project Journals Batches** list. Select the **Tricia** project journal batch.  
3. Choose the **Calc. Remaining Usage** action.  
4. On the **Project Calc. Remaining Usage** page, on the **Project Task** FastTab, choose the **Project No.** field, and select the relevant project number, typically project J00010.  
5. On the **Options** FastTab, type **J00001** in the **Document No.** field. This information makes future tracking of the posting easier.  
6. Enter today's date as the posting date.  
7. Choose the **OK** button. This action generates project journal lines based on the planning lines that Prakash created.  
8. Choose the **OK** button on the confirmation page. The generated lines are added to the project journal.  
9. Make sure that all the document numbers are J00001, and then choose the **Post** action. Choose **Yes** to confirm the posting.  

The lines are now posted.  

## Creating and posting a project sales invoice

Next, Tricia can create a new invoice for the whole project or for part of a project. Tricia can also attach the invoice to another invoice for the same customer for the same project. In this case, Tricia invoices for the whole project because the project is now completed.  

### To create a project sales invoice  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Projects**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the project that you created earlier, and then choose the **Create project Sales Invoice** action.  
3. On the **Project Task** FastTab, clear any filter on **Project Task No.** in order to invoice the project. In the **Project No.** field, select the relevant project.  
4. On the **Options** FastTab, fill in the posting date and define whether you want to create one invoice per task or just a single invoice for all tasks.  
5. Choose the **OK** button to create the invoice and choose the **OK** button on the confirmation page.  

After Tricia creates the invoice, it's available from the **Sales Order Processor** Role Center, for example.

### To post a new sales invoice  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Invoices**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the invoice for Customer No. 01445544. You can see the information that was entered from the planning lines.  
3. Choose the **Post** action. Choose **Yes** to confirm the posting.  

### To view the posted invoice  

1. Open the project, and then choose the **Project Planning Lines** action.  
2. Select any of the planning lines that were invoiced, and then choose the **Sales Invoice/Credit Memo** action.
3. On the **Project Invoices** page, choose the **Open Sales Invoice/Credit Memo** action.  

Tricia has a question about the prices, costs, and profits that are relevant to this particular project, so Tricia accesses that information on the **Statistics** page.  

### To open the Statistics page  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Projects**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **Statistics** action. You can review detailed information about the project prices, costs, and profits in both local and foreign currencies.  
3. Choose the **Close** button to close the **Project Statistics** page.  

## Handling fixed prices

CRONUS is contracted to set up conference rooms. As the project manager, Prakash wants a good overview of the tasks required for the project with the associated budgeted and incurred costs for each task. In addition, Prakash wants to know the total contracted price for the project and the amount that was invoiced to this point. They're in agreement with the customer regarding fixed pricing for the project.  

### To manage fixed pricing in projects  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Projects**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the **Guildford** project number, and then choose the **Project Task Lines** action.  
3. Select line 1120, and in the **Budget (Total Cost)** field, right-click the amount and choose **DrillDown**.  

     By reviewing the Project Planning Lines, it's determined that Prakash needs Tricia for 30 hours for this stage of the project. Prakash agrees on a fixed price with the customer.  

4. On the **Project Task Lines** page, select line 1120, and then choose the **Project Planning Lines** action. Create a planning line with the following information:  

    | Line | Line Type | Type        | No.   | Quantity |
    |------|-----------|-------------|-------|----------|
    | 1    | Both Budget and Billable  | Resource | Tricia | 30 |

     Close the page.  
5. In the **Budget (Total Cost)** field, right-click the field, and choose **Drilldown** again on the **Project Task Lines** page. View the changes to the schedule. You see that 30 hours are added to the schedule.  
6. Close the pages.  

After being added to the schedule for this task line, Tricia works 25 hours on the project, and enters these hours into the project journal.  

### To enter hours in a project journal  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Project Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On a new line, enter the following information:  

    - **Line Type**: **(blank)**  
    - **Posting Date**: **(today's date)**  
    - **Document No.**: **J00002**  
    - **Project No.**: **Guildford**  
    - **Project Task No.**: **1120**  
    - **Type**: **Resource**  
    - **No.**: **Tricia**  
    - **Quantity**: **25**  

3. Choose the **Post** action.  

     A few days later, Tricia works for another 10 hours on the project and has worked 35 hours in all. Because the agreement is for 30 hours with the customer, only five of these hours are charged to the customer. Tricia manually adds the other five hours to the schedule.  

4. On the **Project Journal** page, choose the **Calc. Remaining Usage** action.  
5. On the **Project Calc. Remaining Usage** page, on the **Options** FastTab, enter the following information:  

    - **Document No.**: **J00003**  
    - **Posting Date**: **(today's date)**  

6. On the **Project Task** FastTab, enter the following information:  

    - **Project No.**: **Guildford**  
    - **Project Task No.**: **1120**  

7. Choose the **OK** button to run the calculation.

    There are five hours of work remaining for Tricia. The **Line Type** field is blank, which indicates that only the usage remains to be posted because the work was already scheduled.  

8. In the **Project Journal**, create a new line with the following information. Make sure that both project numbers are sequential with the numbers you've already used:  

    - **Line Type**: **Budget**  
    - **Project No.**: **Guildford**  
    - **Project Task No.**: **1120**  
    - **Type**: **Resource**  
    - **No.**: **Tricia**  
    - **Quantity**: **5**  

     If you use the **Budget** line type, there are updates to the scheduled costs and prices, but no updates to the contract costs and prices that are invoiced to the customer.  

9. Choose the **Post** action. Choose the **OK** button to close the page.  
10. Open the **Projects** list.  
11. Select the GUILDFORD project, and then, in the **Project Task Lines** section, select line 1120 and in the **Budget (Total Cost)** field, right-click the amount. Choose **DrillDown** to view the information.  

     Changes are automatically entered on the line for Project Task No. 1120. In the total cost of scheduled work, five more hours of work by Tricia were added to the schedule.  

12. Choose the **Close** button to close the page.  
13. Right-click the amount in the **Contract (Total Cost)** field and choose **DrillDown** to view the information.  

In the total price for the contract, only the original contracted 30 hours are included, as agreed upon with the customer.  

## Copying projects

Prakash reached an agreement with a customer, Selagorian Ltd, to set up 10 conference rooms. The agreement resembles an earlier project. Therefore, it saves time to copy that earlier project.  

On the **Copy Project** page, you can select the project and task lines that you want to copy.

- Copy the source project ledger entries to create planning lines based on actual use.
- Copy the source project planning lines to copy the original planning lines to the new project.

You can then choose what planning line or ledger entry line type that you want to include, selecting only what is relevant to this new project. Finally, you can select the project that you want to copy to and define whether prices and quantities should be copied as well.  

### To copy a project  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Projects**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action to create a new project. Enter the following information:  

    - **Description**: **Setting up 10 Conference Rooms**  
    - **Bill-To Customer No.**: **20000**  

3. Choose the **Copy Project Tasks from** action.  
4. On the **Copy Project Tasks** page, enter the following:  

    - **Project No.**: **Guildford**  
    - **Project Task No. From**: **1000**  
    - **Source**: **Project Planning Lines**  
    - **Incl. Planning Line Type**: **Budget + Billable**  
    - **To Project No.**: **GuildfordSetting up 10 Conference Rooms**  
    - Select the **Copy Dimensions** and **Copy Quantity** fields.  

5. Choose the **OK** button to copy the project, and then choose the **OK** button to close the confirmation page.  

By comparing prices, project task lines, and project planning lines for the two projects, you can see that the information was successfully copied.  

## Making payments by installments

CRONUS just landed a large project that will take a year to complete. Because it requires many resources, the project manager sets up the contract so that the customer pays part of the price up front, part when the project is halfway completed, and the final payment upon completion.  

### To set up a new account  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Chart of Accounts**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Chart of Accounts** page, choose the **New** action to create a new card.  
3. On the **New G/L Account** card, enter the following information:  

    - **No.**: **40255**  
    - **Name**: **Project Payment**  

4. On the **Posting** FastTab, in the **Gen. Prod. Posting Group** field, select **Services**. Close the page.  
5. On the **Chart of Accounts** page, select **No. 40255 Job Payment**, and then choose the **Indent Chart of Accounts** action. Choose **Yes** to confirm.  

The following procedures show how to create a new project, set pricing, and then set up payment by installment. In the project task lines, you can create specific lines dedicated to the payment by installments. All work completed on the project that is added to the schedule will be entered on the usage lines. For each payment task line on the planning lines, the line type is **Billable**, which means that the customer will be invoiced. Enter a new line for the down payment. On the usage task line, you can enter the information for the items and resources that have been used in this project, which will increase the schedule, such as employee hours and items used on the project.  

### To make a payment by installment  

1. Create a new project.  
2. On the new **Project** card, fill in the following information:  

    - **Description**: **Redecoration of Reception Area**  
    - **Bill-to-Customer No.**: **30000**  
    - **Project Posting Group**: **Setting up**  
    - **WIP Method**: **Cost Value**  

3. On the Project Card, choose the **Prices** action, and then choose the **Resource** action. Enter the following information:  

    - **Code**: **Tricia**  
    - **Unit Price**: **10**  

     Close the page.  

4. On the **Project** card, in the **Tasks** section, add project task lines as described in the following table:  

    | Line | Project Task No. | Description          | Project Task Type |
    |------|--------------|----------------------|---------------|
    | 1    | 1000         | Payment-Down Payment | Posting       |
    | 2    | 2000         | Usage                | Posting       |
    | 3    | 3000         | Payment - Midway     | Posting       |
    | 4    | 4000         | Payment - Completion | Posting       |

5. Choose task 1000, and then choose the **Project Planning Lines** action.  

6. Create a planning line with the following information:  

    | Line | Line Type | Planning Date  | Type        | No.   | Quantity | Unit Price |
    |------|-----------|----------------|-------------|-------|----------|------------|
    | 1    | Billable  | (today's date) | G/L Account | 40255 | 1        | 5000       |

     Close the page.  

7. Choose task 2000, and then choose the **Project Planning Lines** action.  

8. Create a planning line with the following information:

    | Line | Line Type | Planning Date  | Type     | No.    | Quantity |
    |------|-----------|----------------|----------|--------|----------|
    | 1    | Budget    | (today's date) | Resource | Tricia | 120      |
    | 2    | Budget    | (today's date) | Item     | 70104  | 10       |

     Close the page. On the **Project Task Lines** page, you can see the schedule amounts have been updated.  

9. Choose task 32000, and then choose the **Project Planning Lines** action.  

10. Create a planning line with the following information:

    | Line | Line Type | Planning Date   | Type        | No.   | Quantity | Unit Price |
    |------|-----------|-----------------|-------------|-------|----------|------------|
    | 1    | Billable  | (a future date) | G/L Account | 40255 | 1        | 5000       |

     Close the page.  

11. Create a similar planning line entry for project task 4000.  

 Now that the task and planning lines have been entered, Prakash creates an invoice for the first payment. Prakash does this from the project task lines to make sure that the invoice only contains the lines for the first payment. You can open the sales order from the planning lines or the task lines.  

### To create an invoice  

1. On the **Project Task Lines** page, select line 1000, and then choose the **Create Sales Invoice** action.  
2. On the **Create Sales Invoice** page, set today's date as the posting date, specify **Per Task**, and choose the **OK** button to create an invoice with the default information. Choose the **OK** button to close the confirmation page.  
3. Choose the **Sales Invoice/Credit Memo** action. On the sales invoice, you can see that only the down payment is included in the invoice. You can now send this to the customer as agreed.

# Walkthrough: Create custom financial reports

The examples in this article describe how to create the following reports:

* Example 1 creates a Trial Balance report
* Example 2 creates a Balance Sheet report
* Example 3 creates an Income Statement report

> [!NOTE]
> The examples are based on the demonstration data that [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides for its CRONUS demonstration company.

> [!TIP]
> Formulas are expressed as a row number reference, such as "R" or "CA" (current assets), which adds all accounts with row number "R" or "CA."

## Example 1: Trial Balance

In this example, we have a new financial report called **Trial Balance** and a new row definition called **TB**.

:::image type="content" source="media/trialbalanceselection.png" alt-text="Shows the trial balance selection.":::

1. Open the new Trial Balance report.
1. Open the **TB** row definition, and choose **Insert**.
1. Choose the **Insert G/L Accounts** action to open the G/L Accounts page.
1. Filter the **Account Type** column to **Posting**.

   > [!TIP]
   > To quickly apply the filter, choose any row that has Posting in the Account Type column, and then right-click the Account Type column header and choose **Filter to this value**.

1. On the first line, choose **Show more options** :::image type="content" source="media/show-more-options-icon.png" alt-text="Show more options icon.":::, and then choose **Select more**.
1. Select all lines by choosing the radio button next to the first column header.

   :::image type="content" source="media/account type select all.png" alt-text="Shows how to select all lines.":::

1. Choose **OK** to assign all general ledger accounts with a totaling type of Posting to your row definition.

   > [!TIP]
   > To sum the results of all lines, add a formula on the last line of the row definition. Because this is a trial balance report, the expected result is zero.

Your trial balance report is complete. To view the report, choose the report on the Financial Reporting page, and then choose **View Financial Report**. Choose the column definition you prefer for the report. Often used column definitions for a trial balance report are **Balance Only**, **M-Balance**, and **Default**.

> [!TIP]
> If you add a new general ledger account to the chart of accounts, you must update your row definition to include it. Otherwise, your trial balance report won't balance to zero.

## Example 2: Balance Sheet

In this example, we have a new financial report called **Balance Sheet** and a new row definition called **BS**.

:::image type="content" source="media/balance sheet selection.png" alt-text="Shows a balance sheet selection in financial reporting.":::

1. Open the Balance Sheet report.
1. Open the **BS** row definition.
1. Map the accounts as shown in the following table. This example maps the balance sheet to the chart of accounts in the CRONUS demonstration company.

| Row No.| Description | Totaling Type | Totaling  | Row Type  | Bold  |

The following table describes the fields on the **Row Definition** page.

|Field  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|Row No.      |Alphanumeric codes are used for each section. The codes let you group by row number when you use formulas. Groupings help make formulas shorter and more simple. Each formula line is labeled with an alphanumeric code for easy identification.         |

Notice that accounts show in the ranges created for each line. Totaling ranges let the report update dynamically when you add a new general ledger account to your chart of accounts.  |
|Row type     | Balance at Date is used for Balance Sheet reports.        |
|Bold         | Section headers and totals are set to Bold so they stand out.        |

> [!TIP]
> This example shows a summarized balance sheet, where each line is a group of related balance sheet accounts. Your report’s level of summarization is up to you. Good financial report design tries to provide enough detail to tell the story of financial performance without detailing every account. Avoid creating a balance sheet that is a categorized trial balance. It can be hard for people to digest such a large amount of information.

Continue to add balance sheet sections as shown in the following table. You can incorporate your own account groupings to create or replicate your company’s method of displaying accounts.  

The last line of this report is a check figure that the report complies with the accounting equation where Assets=Liabilities+Equity. The result of this check figure should be zero. If it isn't zero, it's a good indication that there's a problem:

* Some accounts aren't included in the report.
* Accounts might be included more than once.
* A formula in the report isn't calculating correctly.

# Set up Sales Order Agent (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]

The Sales Order Agent in Business Central automates processing sales orders from customer email requests. This article explains how to set up, activate, configure the Sales Order Agent, and manage user access.

Learn more about the agent in [Sales Order Agent overview](sales-order-agent.md).

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/production-ready-preview-dynamics365.md)]

<!--[!INCLUDE [limited-public-preview](includes/limited-public-preview.md)]-->

## Prerequisites

Before configuring and activating the sales order agent, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

- The Business Central environment is one of these country/region versions: AU (Australia), CA (Canada), GB (Great Britain), NZ (New Zealand), or US (United States).

  Sales Order Agent is currently unavailable in other countries/region versions. Learn more about geographic and language availability at [Copilot international availability](https://aka.ms/bapcopilot-intl-report-external).
- Set up the email account for receiving incoming requests for sales quotes and orders.

   The Sales Order Agent monitors incoming emails to this mailbox. The email account must be a **Microsoft 365** type (user mailbox or shared mailbox) in your organization. Learn more at [Set up email](admin-how-setup-email.md).

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > To activate and configure the agent, you need **Read and manage (Full Access)** and **Send as** permission on the mailbox, unless it's your personal mailbox. As an Exchange admin, delegate these permissions to all users who need to activate and configure the agent. Learn more in [Use the Exchange admin center to edit shared mailbox delegation](/microsoft-365/admin/email/create-a-shared-mailbox#use-the-eac-to-edit-shared-mailbox-delegation).
   >
   > When a user activates the agent, it runs as a background task in the context of that user and needs access to the shared mailbox to process emails. It might take a few hours for Exchange to propagate the permissions to the selected users.
- Set up the Business Central environment for billing agent capabilities (preview version 26.0 sandbox environments in Great Britain and United States only).

   Agents use Microsoft Copilot Studio messages when a user runs it, which your company is charged for. Learn more in [Manage consumption-based billing](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/tenant-admin-center-manage-consumption-billing).

- Turn on the **Allow HttpClient Requests** toggle in the **Sales Order Agent** extension settings (sandbox environments only)

   Open the [Extension management](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=2500) page, select **Sales Order Agent**, and then turn on the **Allow HttpClient Requests** toggle.

## Turn on the Sales Order Agent capability for the environment

The agent capability is on if the ![Shows the Sales Order Agent icon](media/soa-icon.png) **Sales Order Agent** icon appears in the top navigation menu of the role center.

![Shows the Sales Order Agent icon on a role center](media/soa-in-role-center.svg)

If the icon isn't present, turn it on from the **Copilot & agent capabilities** page, like other Copilot features in Business Central. The Sales Order Agent is listed under **Production ready previews**. Learn more in [Configure Copilot and AI agent capabilities](enable-ai.md).

Next, configure and activate the agent so it can process customer sales orders.

## Configure and activate Sales Order Agent

Configure and activate the Sales Order Agent for your company. Only one Sales Order Agent is allowed per company, but you can give access to many users.

1. In the navigation bar at the upper right of the role center, select ![Shows the Sales Order Agent icon](media/soa-icon.png) **Sales Order Agent** > **Activate**.

1. On the **Configure the Copilot agent** page, turn on the **Monitor incoming information** toggle, select the **Mailbox** check box, and then set **Mailbox** field to the email account you want the agent to monitor.

   ![Shows the Sales Order Agent configuration page](media/soa-configuration.png)

1. Select **Manage user access** to specify the users who can manage or interact with the agent. You can add more users now or later. Learn more in [Manage user access to the Sales Order Agent](#manage-agent-permissions-and-user-access).
1. Turn on the **Active** toggle.
1. On the right side of the page, select the **Go to next card** arrow to choose how the agent helps with inquiries, quotes, and orders.

    There are several options described in the following table:

    |Option|Description|Default|
    |-|-|-|
    |Select only available items|Specifies whether the agent considers item availability when searching for the customer's requested items.<br><br>When on, the agent checks inventory to determine whether the customer's requested item quantity is available based on their requested delivery date and location code. If there aren't enough items, the agent prepares the reply to the user that the requested items aren't available, even in situations when fewer items are available. <br><br>When off, the agent includes the customer's requested item quantity regardless of availability. That is, quotes can be created for the items which aren't available and their availability can become negative.<br><br>Learn more about item availability in [Get an availability overview](inventory-how-availability-overview.md) or open the [Item Availability page](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com?page=4410).|On|
    |Create sales documents|When on, the agent can create sales quotes and orders from email inquiries based on the remaining options in this table.<br><br>When off, the agent handles only email communication and doesn't create quotes or orders. The remaining options are irrelevant and can’t be set.|On|
    |Review quotes when created and updated|When on, the agent adds a review step for a Business Central user to review and confirm the sales quote before creating an outgoing email with the quote details and attachment. <br><br>When off, the agent creates or modifies sales quotes as requested and then automatically proceeds with creating an outgoing email with the quote as an attachment. The user must review and confirm the email before the agent sends it to the customer. |Off|
    |Make orders from quotes|When on, the agent converts confirmed sales quotes into orders after the customer agrees to the quote via email and the Business Central user confirms the email.<br><br>When off, you have to create the order manually.|On|
    |Review orders when created and updated|When on, the agent adds a review step for a Business Central user to review and confirm the sales order before creating an outgoing email with the order details and attachment. <br><br>When off, the agent creates the sales order as requested and then automatically proceeds with creating an outgoing email with the order as an attachment. The user must review and confirm the order before the agent sends it to the customer. |Off|

1. Select **Update** to complete the setup.
1. Ensure the Sales Order Agent's language is set to a supported language.

   When you configure the agent, it uses the same language as the display language of your workspace. [Learn how to change the agent's language](#change-language-and-regional-settings).

The **Sales Order Agent** icon changes to ![Shows the Sales Order Agent icon after configured](media/soa-activated-icon.png), indicating the agent is active and ready to handle incoming quote requests to the mailbox.

When the Sales Order Agent is active, a scheduled task added to job queue runs every 20 seconds on the mailbox. This task monitors new unread messages in the mailbox. If a new unread message is found, the Sales Order Agent imports the message into Business Central and verifies whether there's already a task for the mail thread. If a task for the thread already exists, the Sales Order Agent incorporates the new message into the existing task. Otherwise, it creates a new task for the message.

> [!NOTE]
> The ![Shows the Sales Order Agent icon when the agent is configure but not active](media/soa-not-activated-icon.png) icon indicates the agent is configured with mailbox, but it's not active. To activate it, select the icon, then select ![Shows the configuration icon for Sales Order Agent](media/soa-configure-icon.png) **Configure Sales Order Agent** to reopen the configuration page. From there, turn on the **Active** toggle.

## Manage agent permissions and user access

### Add agent users

As an administrator, you can specify which users have permission to use or configure the Sales Order Agent. There are two ways to add and configure agent users:

#### [From Configure Sales Order Agent](#tab/soaconfig)

1. Open the **Configure Sales Order Agent** page by selecting ![Shows the Sales Order Agent icon after configured](media/soa-activated-icon.png) **Sales Order Agent** > ![Shows the configuration icon for Sales Order Agent](media/soa-configure-icon.png) **Configure**.
1. Turn off the **Active** toggle.
1. Select **Manage user access**.
1. On the **Select users that can manage or interact with the Agent** page, you can do the following steps:

   - To add a user, select an empty line, select the **User Name** field, then select the user from the list.
   - To give a user permission to configure Sales Order Agent, select the **Can configure** check box. <br><br> The **Can configure** setting defines whether a user has access to update the agent configuration (for example, updating the designated mailbox, activating and deactivating the agent, and other settings) or only to work with the agent tasks (for example, reviewing and confirming agent steps).
   - To remove a user's access to the agent, select ![Shows the icon to show more option on a field](media/show-more-options-icon.png) **Show more options** next to the user name, and then select **Delete**.

#### [From Sales Order Agent card page](#tab/soapage)

1. To open the **Sales Order Agent** card page, search (<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Q</kbd>) for  **Agents**, and then select **SALES ORDER AGENT - [COMPANY]**.
1. Set **Status** to **Disabled** to deactivate the agent.
1. In the **User access** section, you can do the following steps:

   - To add a user, select an empty line, select the **User Name** field, then select the user from the list.
   - To give a user permission to configure Sales Order Agent, select the **Can configure** check box.
   - To remove a user's access to the agent, select ![Shows the icon to show more option on a field](media/show-more-options-icon.png) **Show more options** next to the user name, and then select **Delete**.

---

### Manage agent permissions to objects, data, and UI elements

The Sales Order Agent has a user account in Business Central, similar to other users. To access this account, search for and open the **Agents** page, and then select **SALES ORDER AGENT - [COMPANY]** to open the agent card page.

The **Agent Permission Sets** section lists all the permission sets currently assigned to the agent. By default, the Sales Order Agent has the **SOA AGENT – EDIT** permission set. This set restricts access to only the objects, data, and UI elements (such as pages, fields, and actions) necessary for handling sales quote requests.

You can't modify the **SOA AGENT – EDIT** permission set directly, because it's a system permissions set. However, you can create a copy of **SOA AGENT – EDIT** permission set, modify the copy to suit your needs, then add it to **Agent Permission Sets** section, along with any other permission sets.

Before you can add or delete permission sets applied to the agent, change the **State** to disabled. When you're done making changes, set it back to **Enabled**.

The following system permissions are available for controlling user access to the agent's functionality:

- **Configure All Agents** (ID 9665): Grants a user access to manage the configuration settings of the Sales Order Agent.
- **Manage Agent Tasks** (ID 9670): Allows a user to work with agent tasks displayed in the Copilot pane.

These system permissions are also included in the following permission sets, entitlements, and license types:

- The **SECURITY** permission set includes the **Configure All Agents** permission.
- The **System Execute - Basic** permission set includes the **Manage Agent Tasks** permission.
- The **System Tables - Basic** permission set includes all virtual tables used by the agent (labeled as "Agent *" tables).
- Essential and Premium license entitlements now include **Manage Agent Tasks** permissions.
- All license types include **Configure All Agents** permissions.

Users can configure the Sales Order Agent if they have the **Configure All Agents** permission or are listed as an agent user with the **Can Configure** field selected.

Users can work with agent tasks in the Copilot pane if they have the **Manage Agent Tasks** permission (either explicitly or as part of their Essential or Premium license permissions) and are listed as an agent user.

## Change language and regional settings

[!INCLUDE[soa-language-support](includes/soa-language-support.md)]

1. To open the **Sales Order Agent** card page, search (<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Q</kbd>) for  **Agents**, and then select **SALES ORDER AGENT - [COMPANY]**.
1. Select **User Settings**.
1. Set **Lanaguage** to a supported English locale.

# Sales analytics

Businesses capture lots of data during daily activities that supports business intelligence (BI) for sales managers:

- Opportunities
- Sales quotes
- Sales orders
- Sales invoices

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides features to help you gather, analyze, and share your organization's sales data:

- Power BI reports for sales
- Ad-hoc analysis on lists
- Ad-hoc analysis of data in Excel (using Open in Excel)
- Built-in sales analytics tools
- Built-in sales reports

Each of these features has its advantages and disadvantages, depending on the type of data analysis and the role of the user. To learn more, go to [Analytics, business intelligence, and reporting overview](reports-bi-reporting.md).

This article introduces how you can use these analytical features to gain sales insights.

## Analytics needs in sales

When you think about the analytics needs in sales management, it might help to use a persona-based model that describes different analytics needs at a high-level.

:::image type="content" source="/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/media/analytics-personas.svg" alt-text="Illustration of different personas for analytics" lightbox="/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/media/analytics-personas.svg":::

People in different roles have different needs when it comes to data, and they use the data in different ways. For example, people in asset management and finance interact with data differently than people in sales.

:::image type="content" source="/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/media/analytics-personas-scenarios.svg" alt-text="Illustration of how different personas have different analytics needs." lightbox="/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/media/analytics-personas-scenarios.svg":::

| Role              | Data aggregation  | Typical ways to consume data                          | 
|-------------------|-------------------| ----------------------------------------------------- |
|CCO / CFO / CEO    | Performance data  | KPIs <br> Dashboards <br> Financial reports           |
|Sales Manager      | Trends, summaries | Built-in managerial reports <br> Ad-hoc analysis      | 
|Account Manager / Sales Person | Detailed data     | Built-in operational reports <br> On-screen task data |

<!-- 
## Sales KPIs

A key performance indicator (KPI) is a measurable value that shows how effectively you’re meeting your goals. In sales management, people often use the following KPIs to monitor their organization's sales performance:

- TODO  
-->

## Using Power BI to monitor sales KPIs

A key performance indicator (KPI) is a measurable value that shows how effectively you’re meeting your goals. In sales, people often use the following KPIs to monitor their sales organization's performance:

- Gross Profit
- Gross Profit Margin
- Sales by period
- Sales vs. budget
- Number of new customers
- Period-over-Period Sales Amount Growth
- Sales by item/customer/location/sales person

:::image type="content" source="media/powerbi/sales/sales-overview.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Sales Overview Power BI report" lightbox="media/powerbi/sales/sales-overview.png":::

These sales KPIs, and more, are available in the Power BI Sales app for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. To learn more, go to [Power BI sales app](sales-powerbi-app.md).

[!INCLUDE [power-bi-sales-app](includes/power-bi-sales-app.md)]

## Use financial reporting to produce financial statements and KPIs related to sales

The **Financial Reporting** feature gives you insights into the financial data shown on your chart of accounts (COA). You can set up financial reports to analyze figures in general ledger (G/L) accounts, and compare general ledger entries with budget entries. Specifically for sales management, you can set up financial reports on the general ledger (G/L) accounts that you use to track sales postings.

Dimensions play an important role in business intelligence. A dimension is data that you add to an entry as a parameter. Dimensions let you group entries that have similar characteristics, such as customers, regions, products, and salesperson. Among other purposes, use dimensions when you define analysis views and create financial reports. To learn more, go to [Work with Dimensions](finance-dimensions.md).

To learn more about financial reports, go to [Prepare Financial Reports with Financial Data and Account Categories](bi-how-work-account-schedule.md).

## Finance reporting across business units or legal entities related to sales

Some organizations use [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in multiple business units or legal entities. Others use [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in subsidiaries that report to parent organizations. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] gives accountants tools that help them transfer general ledger entries from two or more companies (subsidiaries) into a consolidated company. Specifically for sales management, you might want to consolidate general ledger entries for your sales accounts to be able to track sales KPIs across business units or legal entities.

To learn more, go to [Company consolidation](finance-consolidated-company-reporting.md).

## Ad-hoc analysis of sales data

Sometimes, you just need to check whether the numbers add up correctly, or quickly confirm a figure. The following features are great for ad-hoc analyses:

- Data analysis on ledger list pages
- Open in Excel

The Data Analysis feature lets you open almost any list page, such as **General Ledger Entries**, **Customer Ledger Entries**, **Item Ledger Entries**, or **Posted Invoices**, enter analysis mode, and then group, filter, and pivot data as you see fit.

:::image type="content" source="media/data-analysis-customer-ledger-entries.png" alt-text="Example of how to do data analysis on the Customer Ledger Entries page." lightbox="media/data-analysis-customer-ledger-entries.png":::

Similarly, you can use the **Open in Excel** action to open a list page, optionally filter the list to a subset of the data, and then use Excel to work with the data. For example, by using features such as Analyze Data, What-If Analysis, or Forecast Sheet.

:::image type="content" source="media/open-in-excel-customer-ledger-entries.png" alt-text="Example of how to do data analysis on the Customer Ledger Entries data using Excel." lightbox="media/open-in-excel-customer-ledger-entries.png":::

> [!TIP]
> If you configure OneDrive for system features, the Excel workbook opens in your browser.

To learn more about how to do ad-hoc analysis on sales data, go to [Ad hoc analysis of sales data](ad-hoc-analysis-sales.md).

## Built-in reports for sales

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes several built-in reports, tracing functions, and tools to help sales organizations report on their data.

[!INCLUDE [sales_reports_report_explorer](includes/sales-reports-report-explorer-include.md)]

## On-screen sales analytics

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] has several pages that give you sales overviews and tasks to do. Here are some examples to get you started:

- [Open the Sales Quotes list](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=9300)
- [Open the Sales Orders list](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=9305)
- [Open the Posted Sales Invoices list](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=143)
- [Open the Sales Return Orders list](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=9304)
- [Calculate order promising dates](sales-how-to-calculate-order-promising-dates.md)
- [Calculate delivery dates for sales orders](sales-date-calculation-for-sales.md)
- [Track packages](sales-how-track-packages.md)
- [View the Availability of Items](inventory-how-availability-overview.md)
- [Blanket sales order status](sales-how-to-create-blanket-sales-orders.md#to-view-the-status-of-a-blanket-sales-order)
- [View unposted and posted blanket sales order lines](sales-how-to-create-blanket-sales-orders.md#to-view-unposted-and-posted-blanket-sales-order-lines)

### Show sales-related general ledger entries and balances from the Chart of Accounts page

The **Chart of Accounts** page shows all general ledger accounts with aggregated numbers posted to the general ledger. From this page, you can do things like:  

- View reports that show general ledger entries and balances.  
- Review a list of posting groups for that account.
- View separate debit and credit balances for a single account.

Specifically for sales, you can create a view that only shows the accounts you use for posting sales entries.

:::image type="content" source="media/chart-of-accounts-page.png" alt-text="Example of how the Chart of Accounts page shows finance insights" lightbox="media/chart-of-accounts-page.png":::

To learn more, go to [Understand the Chart of Accounts](finance-general-ledger.md#the-chart-of-accounts).

### Analyze data by dimensions (related to sales)

Dimensions are values that categorize entries so you can track and analyze them on documents, such as sales orders. Dimensions can, for example, indicate the project or department an entry came from.  

So, instead of setting up separate general ledger accounts for each department or location, you can use dimensions as a basis for analysis and avoid having to create a complicated chart of accounts structure.

To learn more, go to [Analyze Data by Dimensions](bi-how-analyze-data-dimension.md).

# Pick Items with Inventory Picks

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you pick and ship items using one of four methods, as described in the following table.

|Method|Outbound Process|Require Pick|Require Shipment|Complexity Level (Learn more at [Warehouse Management Overview](design-details-warehouse-management.md))|  
|------|----------------|-----|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
|A|Post the pick and shipment from the order line|||No dedicated warehouse activity.|  
|B|Post the pick and shipment from an inventory pick document|Turned on||Basic: Order-by-order.|  
|C|Post the pick and shipment from a warehouse shipment document||Turned on|Basic: Consolidated receive/ship posting for multiple orders.|  
|D|Post the pick from a warehouse pick document, and post the shipment from a warehouse shipment document|Turned on|Turned on|Advanced|  

Learn more at [Outbound Warehouse Flow](design-details-outbound-warehouse-flow.md).

This article refers to method B in the table.

When your location is set up to require pick processing but not shipment processing, use the **Inventory Pick** page to record and post picking and shipping information for your source documents. Outbound source documents can be sales orders, purchase return orders, and outbound transfer orders.

> [!NOTE]
> Production and assembly order component needs also represent outbound source documents. Learn more about handling production and assembly orders for internal processes at [Design Details: Internal Warehouse Flows](design-details-internal-warehouse-flows.md).
>
> Although service orders are also outbound source documents, they don't support the basic, order-by-order level of complexity.
>
> When picking and shipping sales line quantities that are assembled to the order, there are rules you must follow when you create inventory pick lines. Learn more at [Handling Assemble-to-Order Items with Inventory Picks](#handling-assemble-to-order-items-with-inventory-picks).  

You can create an inventory pick in in three ways:

* Create the inventory pick directly from the source document.  
* Create inventory picks for multiple source documents at the same time by using a batch job.
* Request the pick in two steps by first releasing the source document, which acts as a signal to the warehouse that the source document is ready picking.

The inventory pick can then be created from the **Inventory Pick** page based on the source document.  

## To create an inventory pick from the source document

1. In the source document, which can be a sales order, purchase return order, or outbound transfer order, choose the **Create Inventory Put-away/Pick** action.
2. Select the **Create Invt. Pick** checkbox.  
3. Choose the **OK** button. A new inventory pick will be created.

## To create multiple inventory picks with a batch job

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Create Inventory Put-away/Pick/Movement**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Warehouse Request** FastTab, use the **Source Document** and **Source No.** fields to filter on certain types of documents or ranges of document numbers. For example, you can create picks only for sales orders.  
3. On the **Options** FastTab, select the **Create Invt. Pick** checkbox.
4. Choose the **OK** button.

## To create the pick in two steps

### To request an inventory pick by releasing the source document

For sales orders, purchase return orders, and outbound transfer orders, you create the warehouse request by releasing the order. Releasing the order makes the items available for picking.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Orders**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the sales order that you want to release, and then choose the **Release** action.

### To create an inventory pick based on the source document

After you release an order, the warehouse employee can create an inventory pick.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Inventory Picks**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. In the **Source Document** field, select the type of document you're picking for.  
4. In the **Source No.** field, select the source document.  
5. Alternatively, choose the **Get Source Document** action to create a list of all outbound source documents that are ready for picking at the location.  
6. Choose the **OK** button to fill the pick lines according to the selected source documents.  

## To record inventory picks

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Inventory Pick**, and then choose the related link.  
2. In the **Bin Code** field on the pick lines, the bin that the items must be picked from is suggesting per the item's default bin. You can change the bin in this page if necessary.  
3. Perform the pick, and then enter the quantity that in the **Qty. to Handle** field.

    If you must pick the items for a line from more than one bin, for example because the full quantity isn't in the bin, use the **Split Line** action on the **Lines** FastTab. The action creates a line for the remaining quantity to handle.

4. Choose the **Post** action.  

    * Post the shipment of the source document lines that were picked.
    * If the location uses bins, posting will also create warehouse entries to post the changes to the bin quantity.  

    [!INCLUDE [preview-posting-warehouse](includes/preview-posting-warehouse.md)]

## Handling assemble-to-order items with inventory picks

You can also use the **Inventory Pick** page to pick and ship for sales where items must be assembled before they can be shipped. Learn more at [Sell Items Assembled to Order](assembly-how-to-sell-items-assembled-to-order.md).

Assemble-to-order items aren't physically in a bin until they're assembled and posted as output to a bin. Picking assemble-to-order items from a bin for shipments follows a special flow.

1. From a bin, warehouse workers take the assembly items to the shipping dock and then post the inventory pick.
2. The posted inventory pick posts the assembly output, the component consumption, and the sales shipment.

You can set up [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to automatically create an inventory movement when the inventory pick for the assembly item is created. Select the **Create Movements Automatically** field on the **Assembly Setup** page. Learn more at [Set Up Basic Warehouses with Operations Areas](warehouse-how-to-set-up-basic-warehouses-with-operations-areas.md).

Inventory pick lines for sales items are created in different ways, depending on whether none, some, or all of the sales line quantities are assembled to order. In scenarios where some of the quantity is assembled and some is picked from inventory, a minimum of two pick lines are created.

For sales where the full quantity on the sales order line is assembled to order, one inventory pick line is created for the quantity. The value in the **Quantity to Assemble** field is the same as the value in the **Qty. to Ship** field. The **Assemble to Order** field is selected on the line.

If an assembly output flow is set up for the location, the **Bin Code** field on the inventory pick line contains the value from the following fields, in the following order.

* ***Asm.-to-Order Shpt. Bin Code** <!-- not applicable for inv pick-->
* **From-Assembly Bin Code**

If a bin code isn't specified on the sales order line, and no assembly output flow is set up for the location, the **Bin Code** field on the inventory pick line is empty. The warehouse worker must open the **Bin Contents** page and select the bin where the assembly items are assembled.

In scenarios where a part of the quantity is assembled and another must be picked, a minimum of two pick lines are created.

* One pick line for the assemble-to-order quantity. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses the following fields, in this order, to determine the bin code: **Bin Code**, **Asm.-to-Order Shpt. Bin Code**, and then **From-Assembly Bin Code**. If these fields are blank, the warehouse employee must open the **Bin Contents** page and choose the bin where the items are assembled.  
* The other pick line depends on which bins can fulfill the remaining quantity. If the item is kept in multiple bins, multiple lines will be created. The Take line is based on the quantity in the **Qty. to Ship** field.

> [!NOTE]  
> If items are assembled to order, the inventory pick for the linked sales order till create an inventory movement for all of the assembly components.

# Design details: reservation, order tracking, and action messaging

The comprehensive reservation system includes the interrelated and parallel features of Order Tracking and Action Messaging.  

At the core of the reservation system, is the linking of a demand entry and a corresponding supply entry, either through reservation or order tracking. A reservation is a user-generated link, and an order tracking record is a system-generated link. An item quantity entered in the reservation system is either reserved or order tracked, but not both at the same time. How the systems handle an item depends on how the item is setup.  

The reservation system interacts with the planning system by creating action messages on planning lines during planning runs. An action message can be considered an appendage to an order tracking record. Action messages, whether created dynamically in order tracking or during the planning run, provide a convenient tool for efficient supply planning.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Reserved quantities are ignored by the planning system, that is, the hard link that is made between supply and demand cannot be changed through planning.  

 The reservations system also forms the structural foundation for the item tracking system. For more information, go to [Design Details: Item Tracking](design-details-item-tracking.md).  

 <!--For more detailed information about how the reservation system works, see the _Reservation Entry Table_ white paper on [PartnerSource](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=258348).  -->
<!--
> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE [locations-cronus](includes/locations-cronus.md)]
-->

## Reservation  

 A reservation is a firm link that connects a specific demand and a specific supply to each other. This link directly affects the subsequent inventory transaction and ensures the proper application of item entries for costing purposes. A reservation overrides the default costing method of an item. For more information, go to [Design Details: Item Tracking](design-details-item-tracking.md).  

 The **Reservation** page is accessible from all order lines of both demand and supply types. On this page, the user can specify which demand or supply entry to create a reservation link towards. The reservation consists of a pair of records that share the same entry number. One record has a negative sign and points to the demand. The other record has a positive sign and points to the supply. These records are stored in the *Reservation Entry* table with the status value *Reservation*. The user can view all reservations on the **Reservation Entries** page.  

### Offsetting in reservations  

 Reservations are made against available item quantities. Item availability is calculated in basic terms as follows:  

 `available quantity = inventory + scheduled receipts - gross requirements`

 The following table shows the details of the order network entities that are part of the availability calculation.  

||Field in T27 Item|Source table|Table filter|Source field|  
|-|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|  
|**Inventory**|Inventory|Item Ledger Entry|N/A|Quantity|  
|**Scheduled receipts**|FP Order Receipt (Qty.)|Prod. Order Line|=Firm Planned|Remaining Qty. (Base)|  
|**Scheduled receipts**|Rel. Order Receipt (Qty.)|Prod. Order Line|=Released|Remaining Qty. (Base)|  
|**Scheduled receipts**|Qty. on Assembly Order|Assembly Header|=Order|Remaining Qty. (Base)|  
|**Scheduled receipts**|Qty. on Purch. Order|Purchase Line|=Order|Outstanding Qty. (Base)|  
|**Scheduled receipts**|Trans. Ord. Receipt (Qty.)|Transfer Line|N/A|Outstanding Quantity|  
|**Gross requirements**|Qty. On Sales Order|Sales Line|=Order|Outstanding Qty. (Base)|  
|**Gross requirements**|Scheduled Need (Qty.)|Prod. Order Component|<>Simulated|Remaining Qty. (Base)|  
|**Gross requirements**|Qty. on Asm. Component|Assembly Line|=Order|Remaining Qty. (Base)|  
|**Gross requirements**|Trans. Ord. Shipment (Qty.)|Transfer Line|N/A|Outstanding Quantity|  

 For more information, go to [Design Details: Availability in the Warehouse](design-details-availability-in-the-warehouse.md).  

### Manual reservation  

When a user intentionally creates a reservation, the user gains full ownership of and responsibility for these items. This means that the user must also manually change or cancel a reservation. Such manual changes might cause automatic modification of the involved reservations.  

The following table shows when and which modifications might occur:  

|User Action|System Reaction|  
|-----------------|---------------------|  
|Decreasing the reserved quantity|The related quantity fields are updated.|  
|Changing date fields|The related date fields are updated.<br /><br /> **Note:** If the due date on a demand is changed to precede the shipment date or due date of the supply, then the reservation is canceled.|  
|Deleting the order|The reservation is canceled.|  
|Changing location, bin, variant, serial number, or lot number|The reservation is canceled.|  

> [!NOTE]  
> The Late Binding functionality may also change reservations without informing the user, by reshuffling nonspecific reservations of serial or lot numbers. For more information, go to [Design Details: Item Tracking and Reservations](design-details-item-tracking-and-reservations.md).  

### Automatic reservations  

The item card can be set up to automatically reserve items based on demand, such as sales orders. In that case, reservation is made against inventory, purchase orders, assembly orders, and production orders. A warning is issued if the supply is insufficient.  

In addition, various planning functions automatically reserve items to keep a demand linked to a specific supply. The order tracking entries for such planning links contain **Reservation** in the **Reservation Status** field in the *Reservation Entry* table. Automatic reservations are created in the following situations:  

- A multilevel production order where the **Manufacturing Policy** field of the involved parent and child items is set to **Make-to-Order**. The planning system creates reservations between the parent production order and the underlying production order to ensure they process together. This reservation binding overrides the item's default costing and application method.  

- A production, assembly, or purchase order where the **Reordering Policy** field of the involved item is set to **Order**. The planning system creates reservations between the demand and the planned supply to ensure that the specific supply is created. For more information, go to [Order](design-details-handling-reordering-policies.md#order).  

- A production order created from a sales order with the **Sales Order Planning** function is linked to the sales order with an automatic reservation.  

- An assembly order created automatically for a sales order line to fulfill the quantity in the **Qty. to Assemble to Order** field. This automatic reservation links the sales demand and the assembly supply so that sales order processors can customize and promise the assembly item to the customer directly. In addition, the reservation links the assembly output to the sales order line through to the shipping activity that fulfills the customer order.  

For supply or demand that isn't allocated, the planning system automatically assigns a reservation status **Surplus**. This could result from demand that is due to forecasted quantities or user-entered planning parameters. This is a legitimate surplus, which the system recognizes, and it doesn't give rise to action messages. The surplus could also be genuine, excess supply or demand that remains untracked. This is an indication of an imbalance in the order network, which causes the system to issue action messages. Note that an action message that suggests a change in quantity always refers to type **Surplus**. For more information, go to [Example: Order Tracking in Sales, Production, and Transfers](#example-order-tracking-in-sales-production-and-transfers) section in this article.  

Automatic reservations created during the planned run are handled in the following ways:  

- They apply to item quantities included in the availability calculation, just like manual reservations. For more information, go to the "Offsetting in Reservations" section in this article.  

- They're included and potentially changed in subsequent planning runs, unlike manually reserved items.  

## Order tracking  

Order Tracking helps the planner maintain a valid supply plan by providing an overview of the offsetting between demand and supply in the order network. The order tracking records serve as the foundation for creating dynamic action messages and planning line suggestions during planning runs.  

> [!NOTE]  
> The order tracking system offsets available stock as orders are entered into the order network. This implies that the system does not prioritize orders that may be more urgent in terms of their due date. It is therefore up to the logic of the planning system or the wisdom of the planner to rearrange these priorities in a meaningful way.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Order tracking policy and the Get Action Messages function are not integrated with Projects. That means that demand related to a project is not automatically tracked. Because it is not tracked, it could cause the use of an existing replenishment with project information to be tracked to another demand, for example, a sales order. Consequently, you may encounter a situation in which your information about available inventory is out of sync.  

### The order network  

The order tracking system is based on the principle that the order network must always remain balanced, ensuring every demand that enters the system is offset by a corresponding supply and vice versa. The system provides this by identifying logical links between all demand and supply entries in the order network.  

This principle implies that a change in demand results in a corresponding imbalance on the supply side of the order network. Conversely, a change in supply results in a corresponding imbalance on the demand side of the order network. In reality, the order network is in a state of constant flux as users enter, amend, and delete orders. Order Tracking processes orders dynamically, reacting to each change at the time that it enters the system and becomes a part of the order network. As soon as new order tracking records are created, the order network is in balance, but only until the next change occurs.  

To increase the transparency of calculations in the planning system, the **Untracked Planning Elements** page displays untracked quantities, which represent the difference in quantity between known demand and suggested supply. Each line on the page refers to the cause of the excess quantity, such as **Blanket Order**, **Safety Stock Level**, **Fixed Reorder Quantity**, **Minimum Order Qty.**, **Rounding**, or **Dampener**.  

### Offsetting in order tracking  

In contrast to reservations, which can only be made against available item quantities, order tracking is possible against all order network entities that are part of  the net requirements calculation of the planning system. The net requirements are calculated as follows:  

`net requirements = gross requirements + reorder point - scheduled receipts - planned receipts - projected available balance`  

> [!NOTE]  
> Demand that is related to forecasts or planning parameters is not order tracked.  

### Example: Order tracking in sales, production, and transfers  

The following scenario shows which order tracking entries are created in the *Reservation Entry* table as results of various order network changes.  

Assume the following data for two items that are set up for order tracking.  

|Item|Parameter|Detail|
|-|-|-|
|Item 1|Name|Component|
||Availability|100 units in EAST location<br /><br />- 30 units of LOTA<br />- 70 units of LOTB|  
|Item 2|Name|Produced Item|
||Production BOM|1 qty. per of Component|  
||Demand|Sale for 100 units at WEST location|  
||Supply|Released production order (generated with the *Sales Order Planning* function for the sale of 100 units)|  

On the **Manufacturing Setup** page, the **Components at Location** field is set to *EAST*.

The following order tracking entries exist in the *Reservation Entry* table based on the data in the table.  

<!--![First example of order tracking entries in Reservation Entry table.](media/supply_planning_RTAM_1.png "supply_planning_RTAM_1")  -->
**Reservation entries**

|Entry No.|Positive|Item No.|Location Code|Quantity|Reservation Status|Description|Lot No.|Source Type|Source ID|Binding|  
|--------|--------|--------|-------------|--------|------------------|-----------|-------|-----------|---------|-------| 
|8|-|COMPONENT|EAST|-70|Tracking|Component|-|5407|101004|-|
|8|Yes|COMPONENT|EAST|70|Tracking|Component|LOTB|32|-|-| 
|9|-|COMPONENT|EAST|-30|Tracking|Component|-|5407|1001004|-| 
|9|Yes|COMPONENT|EAST|30|Tracking|Component|LOTA|32|-|-| 
|10|-|PRODUCED ITEM|WEST|-100|Reservation|Produced Item|-|37|1001|Order-to-Order|
|10|Yes|PRODUCED ITEM|WEST|100|Reservation|Produced Item|-|5406|101004|Order-to-Order|


#### Entry numbers 8 and 9  

For the component need for LOTA and LOTB respectively, order tracking links are created from the demand in table 5407, *Prod. Order Component*, to the supply in table 32, *Item Ledger Entry*. The **Reservation Status** field contains *Tracking* to indicate that these entries are dynamic order tracking links between supply and demand.  

> [!NOTE]  
> The **Lot No.** field is empty on the demand lines because the lot numbers are not specified on the component lines of the released production order.  

#### Entry number 10  

From the sales demand in table 37, *Sales Lines*, an order tracking link is created to the supply in table 5406, *Prod. Order Line*. The **Reservation Status** field contains *Reservation*, and the **Binding** field contains *Order-to-Order*. This is because the released production order was generated specifically for the sales order and must remain linked, unlike order tracking links with a reservation status of Tracking, which is created and changed dynamically. For more information, go to the [Automatic Reservations](#automatic-reservations) section in this article.  

 At this point in the scenario, the 100 units of LOTA and LOTB are transferred to WEST location by a transfer order.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Only the transfer order shipment is posted at this point, not the receipt.  

 Now the following order tracking entries exist in the *Reservation Entry* table.  

<!-- ![Second example of order tracking entries in Reservation Entry table.](media/supply_planning_RTAM_2.png "supply_planning_RTAM_2")  -->
**Reservation entries**

|Entry No.|Positive|Item No.|Location Code|Quantity|Reservation Status|Description|Lot No.|Source Type|Source ID|Binding|  
|---------|--------|--------|-------------|--------|------------------|-----------|-------|-----------|---------|-------| 
|9|-|COMPONENT|EAST|-30|Surplus|Component|-|5407|1001004|-| 
|10|-|PRODUCED ITEM|WEST|-100|Reservation|Produced Item|-|37|1001|Order-to-Order|
|10|Yes|PRODUCED ITEM|WEST|100|Reservation|Produced Item|-|5406|101004|Order-to-Order|
|12|Yes|COMPONENT|WEST|70|Surplus|Component|LOTB|5741|1011|-| 
|14|Yes|COMPONENT|WEST|30|Surplus|Component|LOTA|5741|1011|-| 
|15|Yes|COMPONENT|OUT.LOG.|70|Surplus|Component|LOTB|32|-|-| 
|16|Yes|COMPONENT|OUT.LOG.|30|Surplus|Component|LOTA|32|-|-| 

#### Entry numbers 8 and 9  

Order tracking entries for the two lots of the component reflecting demand in table 5407 are changed from a reservation status of *Tracking* to *Surplus*. The reason is that the supplies that were linked to before, in table 32, are used by the shipment of the transfer order.  

Genuine surplus, as in this case, reflects excess supply or demand that remains untracked. It's an indication of an imbalance in the order network, which generates an action message by the planning system unless it's resolved dynamically.  

#### Entry numbers 12 to 16  

Because the two lots of the component are posted on the transfer order as shipped but not received, all related positive order tracking entries are of reservation type *Surplus*, indicating that they aren't allocated to any demands. For each lot number, one entry relates to table 5741, *Transfer Line*, and one entry relates to the item ledger entry at the in-transit location where the items now exist.  

At this point in the scenario, the transfer order of the components from *EAST* to *WEST* location is posted as received.  

Now the following order tracking entries exist in the *Reservation Entry* table.  

<!-- ![Third example of order tracking entries in Reservation Entry table.](media/supply_planning_RTAM_3.png "supply_planning_RTAM_3") -->
 **Reservation entries**

|Entry No.|Positive|Item No.|Location Code|Quantity|Reservation Status|Description|Lot No.|Source Type|Source ID|Binding|  
|---------|--------|--------|-------------|--------|------------------|-----------|-------|-----------|---------|-------| 
|8|-|COMPONENT|EAST|-70|Surplus|Component|-|5407|101004|-| 
|9|-|COMPONENT|EAST|-30|Surplus|Component|-|5407|1001004|-|
|10|-|PRODUCED ITEM|WEST|-100|Reservation|Produced Item|-|37|1001|Order-to-Order|
|10|Yes|PRODUCED ITEM|WEST|100|Reservation|Produced Item|-|5406|101004|Order-to-Order|
|17|Yes|COMPONENT|WEST|70|Surplus|Component|LOTB|32|-|-| 
|18|Yes|COMPONENT|WEST|30|Surplus|Component|LOTA|32|-|-| 

The order tracking entries are now similar to the first point in the scenario before the transfer order was posted as shipped only, except entries for the component are now of reservation status *Surplus*. This is because the component need is still at *EAST* location, reflecting that the **Location Code** field on the production order component line contains *EAST* as setup in the **Components at Location** field. The supply that was allocated to this demand before was transferred to *WEST* location and can't be fully tracked unless the component need on the production order line is changed to *WEST* location.  

At this point in the scenario, the **Location Code** on the production order component line is set to *WEST*. In addition, on the **Item Tracking Lines** page, the 30 units of LOTA and the 70 units of LOTB are assigned to the production order component line.  

Now the following order tracking entries exist in the *Reservation Entry* table.  

<!-- ![Fourth example of order tracking entries in Reservation Entry table.](media/supply_planning_RTAM_4.png "supply_planning_RTAM_4")   -->
 **Reservation entries**

|Entry No.|Positive|Item No.|Location Code|Quantity|Reservation Status|Description|Lot No.|Source Type|Source ID|Binding|  
|---------|--------|--------|-------------|--------|------------------|-----------|-------|-----------|---------|-------| 
|10|-|PRODUCED ITEM|WEST|-100|Reservation|Produced Item|-|37|1001|Order-to-Order|
|10|Yes|PRODUCED ITEM|WEST|100|Reservation|Produced Item|-|5406|101004|Order-to-Order|
|21|-|COMPONENT|WEST|-70|Tracking|Component|LOTB|5407|101004|-| 
|21|Yes|COMPONENT|WEST|70|Tracking|Component|LOTB|32|-|-| 
|22|-|COMPONENT|WEST|-30|Tracking|Component|LOTA|5407|1001004|-| 
|22|Yes|COMPONENT|WEST|30|Tracking|Component|LOTA|32|-|-| 

#### Entry numbers 21 and 22  

Since the component need changed to *WEST* location, and the supply is available as item ledger entries at *WEST* location, all order tracking entries for the two lot numbers are now fully tracked, indicated by the reservation status of *Tracking*.  

The **Lot No.** field is now filled in the order tracking entry for table 5407 because the lot numbers were assigned to the production order component lines.  

## Action messaging  

When the order tracking system detects an imbalance in the order network, it automatically creates an action message to notify the user. Action messages are system-generated calls for user action that specify the details of the imbalance and suggestions on how to restore balance to the order network. They display as planning lines on the **Planning Worksheets** page when you choose **Get Action Messages** action. In addition, action messages on planning lines are generated during the planning run to reflect the planning system's suggestions to restore balance to the order network. In both cases, the suggestions are run on the order network, when you choose **Carry Out Action Message** action.  

An action message addresses one BOM level at a time. If the user accepts the action message, this might give rise to additional action messages at the next BOM level.  

The following table shows the action messages that exist.  

|Action message|Description|  
|--------------------|---------------------------------------|  
|**Change Qty.**|Changes the quantity on an existing supply order to cover a changed or new demand.|  
|**Reschedule**|Reschedules the due date on an existing order.|  
|**Resched. & Chg. Qty.**|Reschedules the due date and changes the quantity on an existing order.|  
|**New**|Creates a new order if demand can't be fulfilled by either of the previous action messages.|  
|**Cancel**|Cancels an existing order.|  

The order tracking system always attempts to resolve an imbalance in the existing order network. If this isn't possible, it issues an action message to create a new order. Following is the prioritized list that the order tracking system uses when it determines how to restore balance. If an additional demand enters the order network, the system seeks to order track through the following checks:  

1. Check for any excess supply in the existing order tracking record for this demand.  
1. Check for planned and scheduled receipts in order of receipt date. The latest possible date is selected.  
1. Check for available stock.  
1. Check if a supply order exists in the current order tracking record. If so, the system issues an action message of type *Change* to increase the order.  
1. Check that no supply order exists in the current order tracking record. If so, the system issues an action message of type *New* to create a new order.  

An open demand passes through the list and offsets the available supply at each point. Any remaining demand is always covered by check 4 or check 5.  

If a decrease in demand quantity occurs, the order tracking system attempts to resolve the imbalance by performing the previous checks in reverse order. This means that existing action messages could be modified or even deleted, if necessary. The order tracking system always presents the net result of its calculations to the user.  

## Order tracking and planning  

When the planning system runs, it deletes all existing order tracking records and action message entries and recreates them as planning line suggestions according to supply/demand pairs and priorities. When the planning run finishes, the order network is in balance.  

### Planning system versus order tracking and action messaging  

 The following comparison shows the differences between the methods that are used by the planning system to create planning line suggestions and the methods that are used by the order tracking system to create order tracking records and action messages.  

- The planning system deals with the entire supply and demand pattern of a particular item, whereas order tracking deals with the order that activated it.  

- The planning system deals with all levels of the BOM hierarchy, whereas order tracking deals with one BOM level at a time.  

- The planning system establishes links between demand and supply according to the prioritized due date. Order tracking establishes links between demand and supply according to the order entry sequence.  

- The planning system takes planning parameters into account, whereas order tracking doesn't.  

- The planning system creates links in a user-activated batch mode when it balances demand and supply, whereas order tracking creates the links automatically and dynamically as the user enters orders.

# Reconcile bank accounts

Bank reconciliation helps ensure that what's in your books matches the statements you receive from your bank. Bank account reconciliation compares and matches entries in the bank accounts you set up in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with bank transactions at your bank. Reconciliation can then post the balances to your bank accounts in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to make them available to finance managers. Bank reconciliation is also a practical way to discover missing payments and resolve bookkeeping errors.

This article describes how to reconcile bank accounts from the **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** page.

However, you can also reconcile bank accounts on the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page when you process payments. Open bank account ledger entries related to the applied customer or vendor ledger entries close when you choose the **Post Payments and Reconcile Bank Account** action. This action automatically reconciles the bank account for the payments that you post with the journal. Learn more in [Applying Payments Automatically and Reconciling Bank Accounts](receivables-apply-payments-auto-reconcile-bank-accounts.md).

> [!NOTE]  
> The North American versions offers the **Bank Rec. Worksheet** page, which is better suited for checks and deposits but doesn't let you import bank statement files. To use this page instead of the **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** page, clear the **Bank Recon. with Auto. Match** field on the **General Ledger Setup** page. Learn more in [Reconciling Bank Accounts](LocalFunctionality/UnitedStates/how-to-reconcile-bank-accounts.md) under United States Local Functionality.

The lines on the **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** page are divided into two panes. The **Bank Statement Lines** pane shows either imported bank transactions or ledger entries with outstanding payments. The **Bank Account Ledger Entries** pane shows the ledger entries in the internal bank account.

## About bank reconciliation

Reconciling transactions in statements from your bank with bank entries in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is referred to as *matching*. There are three ways to match transactions with bank entries:

* Automatically, by using the **Match Automatically** action.
* Automatically, by using the **Reconcile with Copilot** action.

  This action is available as part of the bank reconciliation assist (preview) feature, which an AI-powered feature. Learn more in [Reconcile bank accounts with Copilot](bank-reconciliation-with-copilot.md).
* Manually, by selecting lines in both panes to link each bank statement line to one or more bank account ledger entries, and then using the **Match Manually** action.

The **Applied** checkbox is selected on lines where entries match. Learn more in [Set Up Rules for Automatic Application of Payments](receivables-how-set-up-payment-application-rules.md). If you enter a statement ending date on the bank reconciliation after you match its lines with entries, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will undo the matches for lines and entries that are after that date.

> [!NOTE]
> After you enter a date in the **Statement Date** field, the **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** page filters the bank ledger entries to show only entries up to that date. You can only post bank reconciliations with bank ledger entries on or before the statement ending date. The filter ensures that your bank ledger is balanced with your bank statement on the statement ending date, with the difference being the outstanding payments and checks.

When the value in the **Total Balance** field in the **Bank Statement Lines** pane equals the total value of the **Balance To Reconcile** field plus the **Balance Last Statement** field in the **Bank Account Ledger Entries** pane, you can choose the **Post** action. Unmatched bank account ledger entries remain on the page, indicating discrepancies that you should resolve to reconcile the bank account.

Any lines that can't be matched, indicated by a value in the **Difference** field, will remain on the **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** page after posting. They represent some kind of discrepancy that you must resolve before you can complete the bank account reconciliation. The following table describes a few typical business situations that can cause differences.

| Difference | Reason | Resolution |
|------------|--------|------------|
| A transaction in your bank account in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] isn't in the bank statement. | The bank transaction wasn't created although a posting was made in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. | Create the missing transaction (or prompt a debitor to make it). Then reimport the bank statement file or enter the transaction manually. |
| A transaction on the bank statement doesn't exist as a document or journal line in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. | A bank transaction was made without a corresponding posting in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], for example a journal line posting for an expense. | Create and post the missing entry. Learn more about a quick way in [To create missing ledger entries to match bank transactions with](bank-how-reconcile-bank-accounts-separately.md#to-create-missing-ledger-entries-to-match-bank-statement-lines). |
| A transaction in the internal bank account corresponds to a bank transaction but some information is too different to give a match. | Information, such as the amount or the customer name, was entered differently in the bank transaction or the internal posting. | Review the information, and then manually match the two. Optionally, correct the mismatch. |

You must resolve the differences. For example, create the missing entries and correct unmatched information until you can complete and post the bank account reconciliation.

You can fill in the **Bank Statement Lines** pane on the **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** page in the following ways:

* Automatically, by using the **Import Bank Statement** function to fill in the **Bank Statement Lines** pane with bank transactions according to an imported file or stream provided by the bank.
* Manually, by using the **Suggest Lines** function to fill in the **Bank Statement Lines** pane according to invoices in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] that have outstanding payments.

## Add bank statement lines by importing a bank statement

The **Bank Statement Lines** pane shows bank transactions according to an imported file or stream provided by the bank.

To import bank statements as bank feeds, you must set up the Envestnet Yodlee Bank Feed service. The setup includes linking your bank accounts in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to the related online bank accounts. Learn more in [Set Up the Envestnet Yodlee Bank Feeds Service](bank-how-setup-bank-statement-service.md).  

> [!TIP]
> You can also import bank statement files in comma or semicolon delimited format (.CSV). Use the **Set up a bank statement file format** assisted setup to define bank statement import formats and attach the format to a bank account. You can then use these formats when you import bank statements in the **Bank Account Reconciliation** page.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Bank Account Reconciliation**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action.
3. In the **Bank Account No.** field, select the relevant bank account. The bank account ledger entries that exist on the bank account appear in the **Bank Account Ledger Entries** pane.
4. In the **Statement Date** field, enter the date of the statement from the bank.
5. In the **Statement Ending Balance** field, enter the balance of the statement from the bank.
6. If you have a bank statement file, choose the **Import Bank Statement** action.
7. Locate the file, and then choose the **Open** button to import the bank transactions into the **Bank Statement Lines** pane on the **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** page.

## To fill in bank reconciliation lines with the Suggest Lines action

The **Bank Statement Lines** pane is filled in according to invoices in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] that have outstanding payments.  

1. On the **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** page, choose the **Suggest Lines** action.
2. In the **Starting Date** field, enter the earliest posting date for the ledger entries to be reconciled.
3. In the **Ending Date** field, enter the latest posting date for the ledger entries to be reconciled.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Typically, the ending date will match the date specified in the **Statement Date** field. However, if you want to reconcile transactions for only part of a period, you can enter a different ending date.

4. If you don't want the bank account ledger entries to include unmatched open reversed entries, choose the **Exclude Reversed Entries** toggle. By default, the list of bank account ledger entries include reversed entries up to the statement date.
5. Choose the **OK** button.

## Match bank statement lines with bank account ledger entries automatically

The **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** page offers automatic matching functionality based on a matching of text on a bank statement line (left pane) with text on one or more bank account ledger entries (right pane). You can overwrite the suggested automatic matching, and you can choose to not use automatic matching at all. Learn more in [Match bank statement lines with bank account ledger entries manually](#match-bank-statement-lines-with-bank-account-ledger-entries-manually).

You can investigate the basis for matches by using the **Match Details** action. For example, the details include the names of the fields that contained matching values.  

1. On the **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** page, choose the **Match Automatically**. The **Match Bank Entries** page opens.
2. In the **Transaction Date Tolerance (Days)** field, specify the span of days before and after the bank account ledger entry posting date within which the action searches for matching transaction dates in the bank statement.

    If you enter 0 or leave the field blank, the **Match Automatically** action only searches for matching transaction dates on the bank account ledger entry posting date.
3. Choose the **OK** button.

    The lines are color coded to make it easier to understand what to do with them. Bank statement lines and bank account ledger entries that are matched on the current bank reconciliation change to bold green font. Bank account ledger entries that are matched on other bank reconciliations are shown in italic blue font.
4. To remove a match, select the bank statement line, and then choose the **Remove Match** action.

> [!TIP]
> You can use a mix of manual and automatic matching. If you have manually matched entries, automatic matching will not overwrite your selections.

## Match bank statement lines with bank account ledger entries manually

> [!TIP]
> When matching lines and entries manually, the **Show All**, **Show Reversed Entries**, **Hide Reversed Entries**, and **Show Nonmatched** actions can make it easier to get an overview. By default, the bank account ledger entries don't include unmatched reversed entries. To include these entries in the list and match them manually, choose the **Show Reversed Entries** action. If you choose to hide reversed entries after you've made one or more matches, the matched entries are still shown.

> [!NOTE]
> You can't post a bank reconciliation if you do many-to-one matching and the combined amounts contain differences. This is true even if the combined differences balance to zero.
>
> Here's an example of a many-to-one matching that has differences. The value of 200 for bank statement entry 1 is matched to two bank ledger entries that have a total value of 180. The difference is 20. The value of 350 for bank statement 2 is matched to two other bank ledger entries that have a total value of 370. The difference is -20, which balances the value of 20 for bank statement 1.  
>
> To post a bank reconciliation with differences on the lines, post the differences and then match them against the posted entries.

1. On the **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** page, select an unapplied line in the **Bank Statement Lines** pane.
2. In the **Bank Account Ledger Entries** pane, select one or more banks account ledger entries that can be matched with the selected bank statement line. To choose multiple lines, select and hold the CTRL key, and then choose the lines.

   > [!TIP]
   > You can also manually match multiple bank statement lines with one bank account ledger entry. For example, this might be useful if your bank deposit contained several payment methods, such as credit cards from different issuers, and your bank lists those as separate lines.
3. Choose the **Match Manually** action.

    The selected bank statement line and the selected bank account ledger entries change to green font, and the **Applied** checkbox in the right pane is selected.
4. Repeat steps 1 through 3 for all bank statement lines that aren't matched.

> [!TIP]
> To remove a match, select the bank statement line, and then choose the **Remove Match** action. If you have matched multiple bank statement lines to a ledger entry, and need to remove one or more of the matched lines, all of the manual matches are removed for the ledger entry when you choose **Remove Match**.

## Validate your bank reconciliation

To double-check your bank account reconciliation before you post it, use the **Test Report** action to preview the reconciliation. The report is available in the following contexts:

* When you're preparing a bank reconciliation on the **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** page.
* When you're reconciling payments on the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page.

Lines that can't be matched stay on the **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** page after posting. These lines contain a value in the **Difference** field. The difference represents a discrepancy that you must resolve before you can complete the bank account reconciliation. The following table describes a few typical business situations that can cause differences.

| Difference | Reason | Resolution |
|------------|--------|------------|
| A transaction in your bank account in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] isn't in the bank statement. | The bank transaction wasn't created although a posting was made in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. | Create the missing transaction (or prompt a debitor to make it). Then reimport the bank statement file or enter the transaction manually. |
| A transaction on the bank statement doesn't exist as a document or journal line in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. | A bank transaction was made without a corresponding posting in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], for example a journal line posting for an expense. | Create and post the missing entry. Learn more about a quick way in [To create missing ledger entries to match bank transactions with](bank-how-reconcile-bank-accounts-separately.md#to-create-missing-ledger-entries-to-match-bank-statement-lines). |
| A transaction in the internal bank account corresponds to a bank transaction but some information is too different to give a match. | Information, such as the amount or the customer name, was entered differently in the bank transaction or the internal posting. | Review the information, and then manually match the two. Optionally, correct the mismatch. |

You must resolve the differences. For example, create the missing entries and correct unmatched information until you can complete and post the bank account reconciliation.

> [!NOTE]
> The Bank Reconciliation page and Test Report assume you're only reconciling within the period up until the statement ending date. If you match a bank statement line to a bank ledger entry before you enter a statement ending date, and then enter a statement ending date that is after the ending date for the bank ledger entry, the data in the Test Report will be incorrect.

The following table describes fields on the Test Report that can help you complete the bank reconciliation.

|Field  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|Statement Date| The date specified in the **Statement Date** field on the **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** page.|
|Balance Last Statement|The balance specified in the **Balance Last Statement** field on the **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** page. This field is filled in automatically from the most recent reconciliation for the same bank account. The value is zero if it's is your first bank account reconciliation.|
|Statement Ending Balance|The balance specified in the **Statement Ending Balance** field on the **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** page. |
|G/L Account No. <*number*> Balance at <*date*> | The balance on the G/L account on the statement ending date. This value is the unfiltered balance as of that date. If your bank uses your local currency, this balance should be the same as your bank account balance (shown on the right side of the report header) when you match all statement lines. An empty **()** in the name of this field means that your bank uses local currency.<br><br>A discrepancy in this field and the previous ones might indicate that you posted directly to the G/L account. It might also indicate that you're using the same G/L account for multiple banks, which we don't recommend. Banks are linked to the general ledger through the bank account posting group specified for the account.<br><br>The Test Report shows a warning if you have direct postings, even if the balance for the posting is zero. Direct postings that aren't balanced often lead to accumulated differences for future bank reconciliations. You should check the general ledger balance and ledger entries before you post the bank reconciliation. Learn more in about direct posting in [Avoid Direct Posting](#avoid-direct-posting).|
|G/L Account No. <*number*> Balance (<*LCY*>) at <*date*>| The balance on the G/L account on the statement ending date in local currency. The balance is converted to the bank account's currency using the exchange rate that was valid on the statement ending date. This value is the unfiltered balance as of that date. You compare to this balance to the **G/L Account No. <*number*> Balance at <*date*>* field if your bank uses a foreign currency. The value in the G/L Account No. <*number*> Balance at <*date*> field for local currency might differ slightly because currency conversion can result in small differences. Your bank's balance should be very close to this balance.  |
|Bank Account Balance at <*date*>| The balance on the bank account at the statement ending date.|
|Sum of Differences    | The sum of the differences for the statement lines. To access the details, turn on the **Print Outstanding Transactions** toggle when you enter criteria for the report. A difference is a bank statement line that isn't matched completely to one or more bank ledger entries. You can't post a bank account reconciliation that has differences. You can post a bank reconciliation that contains bank ledger entries that aren't matched to statement lines. This value is shown in the **Outstanding Bank Transactions** field and in a separate section if you turn on the Print Outstanding Transactions toggle.      |
|Statement Balance     | The value specified in the **Statement Ending Balance** field on the **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** page.  |
|Outstanding Bank Transactions     | The sum of unmatched, non-check bank ledger entries that have a posting date on or before the statement ending date. This happens when you register transactions before they're registered in your bank. For example, at the end of a period. When you create the next bank reconciliation, you can reconcile these entries.        |
|Outstanding Checks     | The sum of unmatched bank ledger entries for checks that have a posting date on or before the statement ending date. This happens when you register transactions before they're registered in your bank. For example, this can happen for checks if a vendor doesn't cash a check in the same period you registered it. When you create the next bank reconciliation, you can reconcile these entries.        |
|Bank Account Balance     | The sum of the values for the bank statement ending balance, outstanding bank transactions, and outstanding checks. After you handle all differences on matched entries, this balance matches your bank balance. For example, you accounted for all matched entries and the entries you couldn't match for this bank statement. You can post the reconciliation.        |

> [!TIP]
> If you run the **Test Report** from the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates the value in the **Statement Ending Balance** as follows:
>
> * balance last statement + sum of all lines in the payment reconciliation journal
>
> You can use the value to compare to your bank statement.

## To create missing ledger entries to match bank statement lines

Sometimes bank statement contains amounts for interest or fees charged. Such bank statement lines can't be matched because there aren't related ledger entries in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. You must then post a journal line for each transaction to create a related ledger entry that it can be matched with.

1. On the **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** page, choose the **Transfer to General Journal** action.  
2. On the **Trans. Bank Rec. to Gen. Jnl.** page, specify which general journal to use, and then choose the **OK** button.

    The **General Journals** page opens with new journal lines for any banks statement lines that are missing ledger entries.
3. Complete the journal line with information such as the balancing account. For more information, see [Work with General Journals](ui-work-general-journals.md).  
4. To review the result of posting before you post, choose the **Test Report** action, and then choose an option for accessing the report. The **Bank Account Statement** report shows the same fields as at the header of the **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** page.
5. Choose the **Post** action.

    After the entry is posted, match the bank statement line to it.
6. Refresh or reopen the **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** page. The new ledger entry appears in the **Bank Account Ledger Entries** pane.
7. Match the bank statement line with the bank account ledger entry, either manually or automatically.

## Find outstanding transactions in previous periods

You can use the Bank Statement report to find outstanding transactions in previous periods. Outstanding transactions were opened before the statement date and aren't closed, or were closed after the bank reconciliation was posted.

When you run the Bank Statement report from the **Bank Account Statement List** page, you can turn on the **Outstanding Entries** toggle, and the report includes a section that lists outstanding entries.

**Example**
We have bank account ledger entries A, B, and C in our bank account for the month of August. When we reconcile our bank account for August we find a bank statement line that matches entry A, but none for B and C. So we post the reconciliation with entry A reconciled and B and C as outstanding entries.

In September, we receive a payment for entry B and decide to reconcile our bank account. If we run the Bank Statement report before posting the reconciliation, we get one reconciled transaction and one outstanding.

If we print the report for August we get outstanding transactions for our B and C entries, even though we closed entry B in September.

> [!NOTE]
> The Bank Statement report has some known limitations if you import or manually enter bank transactions after you post a bank reconciliation.
>
> You can enter bank ledger entries on any date and with any posting date, so you don't always have to do it in a strict chronological order.. When you do a bank reconciliation, you reconcile a bank statement to the bank ledger entries you have registered up to the time you post the reconciliation, and with the posting date of the entries. Typically, that means a posting date on or before the statement ending date.
>
> When you post a bank reconciliation, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] takes a snapshot of the data and uses it to fill in the bank statement report's header. But, the outstanding transactions sections are actual lookups to the bank ledger entries that existed up to the actual date and time you posted the bank reconciliation. The totals in the lines typically match the totals in the header. However, if you import bank ledger entries after you posted the bank reconciliation, but the posting dates are before the statement ending date, the totals in the header might not match the totals in the outstanding transactions sections.

## Undo a bank account reconciliation

If you find a mistake in a posted bank reconciliation, you can use the **Undo** action on the **Bank Account Statement List** page to correct it. When you undo a posted bank reconciliation, the entries are moved to the **Bank Account Reconciliations** page and marked as **Open**, meaning they aren't reconciled. You can then correct the bank reconciliation and post it again.

> [!NOTE]
> In the North American version, to use the Undo feature for posted bank reconciliations and bank statements you must turn on the **Bank Recon. with Auto-Match** toggle on the **General Ledger Setup** page. The Undo feature is not available for bank statements posted from bank reconciliation worksheets.

### Reusing the bank statement number

The bank statement number used for the new bank reconciliation is taken from the bank account as is the Balance Last Statement. You can change these values before you start a new bank reconciliation. However, when you create a new bank reconciliation, [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] checks whether the statement number is already assigned to a posted bank statement. If the number is in use, but you want the new bank statement to use it instead, you can use the **Change Statement No.** action on the **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** page.

### Examples

The following examples show how to fix a mistake on a posted bank reconciliation, with or without using the same statement number.

#### Example 1

You did bank reconciliations for January, February, and March. The bank statement number was 100 for March. Later, you discover that March only included entries until the 30th, which means entries for the 31st are missing. So, you need to redo the bank reconciliation for March. In this case, we open the **Bank Account Statement List** page, choose the statement for March, and then choose **Undo**.

The new bank reconciliation is given the statement number 101. To reassign the number 100, choose **Change Statement No.** and enter **100**. 

> [!TIP]
> Remember to set the appropriate Statement ending date (in this example, that is March 31), and edit the **Balance Last Statement** field. 

#### Example 2

You did bank reconciliations for January, February, June, and July. You discover that February was incorrect. Let's assume it had statement number 100. Like Example 1, you use the Undo and Change Statement No. actions to change the statement number as in example #1 and you can now redo February bank reconciliation.  

After you post the corrected bank reconciliation for February, on the corresponding Bank Account card the **Last Statement No.** field will show **100**, and the **Balance Last Statement** field will show the ending balance for the February statement. 

If the next bank reconciliation you do is for March, [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] will assign 101 as the statement number and give it the correct **Balance Last Statement**.

If the next bank reconciliation you do is for August, consider changing the values in the **Last Statement No.** and **Balance Last Statement** fields on the **Bank Account** card before you create the next bank reconciliation, or use the **Change Statement No.** action and also change the value in the **Balance Last Statement** field on the bank reconciliation page.

> [!NOTE]
> The statement number is important when you do bank reconciliations with imported CAMT files that contain statement numbers, or when you reconcile based on printed bank statements. If you just download a range of bank transactions from your online bank, the statement number is usually not important.  
>
> The Balance Last Statement is kept on the bank account to minimize mistakes when doing bank reconciliations, but it's also editable, allowing you to do your bank reconciliations in any order you want. This also means that if you undo a bank statement, the new ending balance might not be the balance last statement on the next bank statement. There's no feature that allows you to move a balance forward to all subsequent bank statements, so be aware of this when using Undo.  

## Avoid direct posting

Don't use a G/L account that allows direct posting in your bank account posting group. Direct posting breaks the connection between the bank account ledger entry and the G/L account ledger entry. When you reconcile your bank account, the entries posted directly to the G/L account aren't included, which makes it difficult to complete the reconciliation.

This mistake often happens when entering an opening balance for a bank account. It's important that you don't post the opening balance directly to the general ledger. Entries in the G/L account that are posted directly to the G/L account causes problems. For example, these entries might prevent you from reconciling your bank account. For foreign currency bank accounts, the entries can cause differences to accumulate after you post more bank reconciliations due to currency exchange rate adjustments. Often, you post the opening bank balance directly to the bank account, and the amount then ends up in the G/L account. Alternatively, you reverse it later against the G/L account that you use to balance the opening general ledger balance. In both cases, you must balance any direct posting to the G/L account before you start your first bank reconciliation, and especially so if the bank account is in a foreign currency.

# Adjust item costs

The cost of an item (inventory value) that you purchase and later sell might change during its lifetime, for example because a freight cost is added to its purchase cost after you sell the item. Cost adjustment is especially relevant in situations where you sell goods before you invoice the purchase of those goods. To always know the correct inventory value, you should regularly adjust item costs. Correct costs help ensure that sales and profit statistics are up to date and that financial KPIs are correct. For more information, see [Design Details: Cost Adjustment](design-details-cost-adjustment.md).

The value in the **Unit Cost** field on the item card is based on the standard cost for items with the Standard costing method. For items with any other costing method, the value is based on the calculation of available inventory (invoiced costs and expected costs) divided by the quantity on hand.

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], item costs are automatically adjusted every time that an inventory transaction occurs, such as when posting a purchase invoice for an item.

You can also manually adjust the costs of one or more items. For example, manual adjustments are useful when you know that item costs are changed for reasons other than item transactions.

Item costs are adjusted by the FIFO or the Average costing method, depending on your selection in the **Set Up My Company** assisted setup guide or in the **Costing Method** field on the item card. For more information, see [Register New Items](inventory-how-register-new-items.md).  

For the FIFO costing method, an item’s unit cost is the actual value of any receipt of the item. Inventory is valued with the assumption that the first items placed in inventory are sold first.

If you use the Average costing method, then an item’s unit cost is calculated as the average unit cost at each point in time after a purchase. Inventory is valuated with the assumption that all inventories are sold simultaneously. For items that use this costing method, you can choose the **Unit Cost** field on the item card to view the history of transactions that the average cost is calculated from

Cost adjustment processes only value entries that aren't adjusted. In a situation where changed inbound costs need to be forwarded to related outbound entries, it creates new adjustment value entries. The adjustment value entries are based on the information in the original value entries but contain the adjustment amount. The cost adjustment function uses the posting date of the original value entry in the adjustment entry, unless that date is in a closed inventory period. In that case, application uses the starting date of the next open inventory period. If inventory periods aren't used, then the date in the **Allow Posting From** field on the **General Ledger Setup** page defines when the adjustment entry is posted.

## To adjust item costs manually

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Adjust Cost - Item Entries**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** page, specify which items to adjust costs for.
3. Choose the **OK** button.

## Track item cost adjustments

Item costs can change for many reasons, so it's important that you can keep track of cost adjustments. Use the **Inventory Cost Adjustment** page to manage and monitor the cost adjustment process. This page displays items along with their costing parameters and cost adjustment status. You can filter the list to focus on items that require adjustment or that are excluded from the cost adjustment process. To learn more about tracking cost adjustments, go to [Track item cost adjustments](finance-track-inventory-costs.md).

# Sales by Salesperson (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Sales by Salesperson** report provides an overview of sales performance for each salesperson. It showcases key metrics such as total sales amount and quantity. You can also view this information for each customer a salesperson sells to, and the items they sold.

:::image type="content" source="media/powerbi/sales/sales-by-salesperson.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Sales by Salesperson Power BI report" lightbox="media/powerbi/sales/sales-by-salesperson.png":::

## Use the report

This report helps management and sales teams track the sales amounts that each salesperson generates and their contribution to the overall revenue.

Sales managers can use the report to monitor the sales performance of each salesperson and identify top-performers. For example, this information is helpful when you determine rewards. The report also helps identify under-performers who perhaps need support.

For example, you might notice that a particular salesperson's sales declined over the last few months. With this information, you can provide extra training or resources to help that salesperson achieve their sales targets.

Salespeople can use the report to monitor your own sales performance and identify areas for improvement. By analyzing the sales amount, quantity, and gross profit, you can easily identify which customers and items contribute the most to your sales. With this information, you can focus your efforts on the most profitable areas.

For example, if you notice that a particular customer contributes a significant amount to your sales numbers, you can focus on building a stronger relationship with that customer to increase their loyalty.

## Key performance indicators

The report includes the following key performance indicators (KPIs) and measures:

- [**Sales Amount**](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#sales-amount)
- [**Sales Quantity**](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#sales-quantity)
- [**Gross Profit**](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#gross-profit)
- [**Gross Profit Margin**](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#gross-profit-margin)

[!INCLUDE[click-on-a-kpi-link](includes/click-on-a-kpi-link.md)] 

[!INCLUDE[powerbi-tip-track-kpis](includes/powerbi-tip-track-kpis.md)]

The **Moving Averages** report provides a comprehensive overview of your average purchases over a 30-day period. This report focuses on the purchase amount and compares the current purchase amount to a 30-day average. The comparison lets you quickly identify deviations from the norm. Use this information to address issues and ensure that purchasing activities align with business operations and profitability.

:::image type="content" source="media/purchases/purchases-moving-averages.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Moving Averages Power BI report" lightbox="media/purchases/purchases-moving-averages.png":::

## Use the report

The report helps management teams find key trends and make changes based on average purchase metrics.

CEOs need to track the moving average of purchase amounts over a specific period. Use this report to see performance trends and get help to make short term strategic decisions based on the trends.

Purchasing managers want to know which periods have a higher demand than others to plan purchasing schedules and budget accordingly. Use the report to analyze historical data and forecast upcoming trends so you can optimize inventory levels and reduce stock-outs.

For example, you might notice that purchasing demands are often higher towards the end of the year. You can work with your team to plan ahead and allocate staff to handle workload spikes.

# Primary capabilities of financial reporting

This article describes the capabilities that are most widely used for the financial reporting features in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## Out of the box financial reporting

To help you get started with financial reporting, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides account categories, subcategories, and mappings to the company’s chart of accounts for basic financial reporting.

## Custom financial reporting

If you're already familiar with financial reporting and you want more complex reports, you can create your own.

## Comparative views

Beyond monthly balances or net changes, you can apply multiple views to any report you create. For example, you can use formula combinations for standard month to date and year to date views, view trends over the last 12 months, compare current amounts with the prior month or year, and more.

## Direct tie to the general ledger

Financial reporting is tied directly to detailed transactional postings from the general ledger.

## Use dimensions

Dimensions are data tags you can attach to postings to the general ledger to provide more business insights to financial reporting. Adding dimensions enriches the reports and expands them into operational reporting.

## Budget integration

Financial reporting can easily compare budget and actual financial results. You can do the comparisons for any date range and view the results at the general ledger and dimension levels.

## Ability to drill down

Numbers in financial reporting that aren't calculated by a formula can take you to the original transactions. You can make active analyses from the financial report to the account level, and from there to the invoices, credit memos, and ledger entries. This quick research tool lets you determine where the number came from, when it happened, what type of document was used, and even which user created the entry.

## Export to Excel

The Export to Excel feature lets you format financial reporting so that it looks the same every month, without manual work. Export to Excel makes it easy to produce a professional-looking financial package where values update each period.

## No coding needed

Financial reporting doesn't require that you know how to code. Finance professionals can build their own reports and make changes exactly when they need to. It's helpful, however, to understand:

* The structure of the chart of accounts.
* The dimensions that are used.
* The budget amounts.
* The basic differences between balance sheet and income statement accounts.
* Basic formulas.

# Fulfilling Service Contracts 
One way to set up a service management business is to have standard contractual agreements between you and your customers that describe the level of service and the service expectations. You can create contract templates that include necessary information, such as customer, start date of contract, and invoice period.  
  
After you set up the template, you can customize the resulting contract to keep track of service hours, or other items that may vary from customer to customer. You can also set up a contract manually from a service contract quote. Finally, you can adjust your service pricing to keep track of discounts that a specific customer qualifies for, by specifying the discount amount on the **Service Contract** page.  

The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the topics that describe them.

# Cancel production orders that have consumption

Even when production doesn't go as planned, it's important to keep your inventory, cost, and financial records accurate. You can revert consumption or output transactions, return unused raw materials, and correct mistakes in your reported operations. For actual scrap occurrences, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides a process that lets you close orders and write off accumulated WIP.

When you post production transactions by mistake, you probably want to cancel (undo the transactions) and in some cases close the order. To do that, from the **Released Production Order** page, you can open the **Item Ledger entries** or **Capacity Ledger entries** pages and use the **Reverse Production Order Transaction** action.

- For item ledger entries of the type **Consumption**, the action creates item journal lines of the type **Consumption**. For the lines, it copies values from the original transaction, uses the opposite sign in the **Quantity** field, applies to the original entry, and posts the item journal.
- For item ledger entries of the types **Output** or **Capacity**, the action creates item journal lines of the type **Output**. For the lines, it copies values from original transaction, uses the opposite sign in the **Quantity**, **Scrap Quantity**, **Setup Time**, and **Run time** fields, applies to the original entry (only for item ledger entries), and posts the item journal. It also removes the **Finished** status from the related production routing line.

The **Reverse Production Order Transaction** action is only enabled for entries that are related to the production order. It uses the original posting date.

The action isn't supported under the following conditions:

- If the output entry was already applied to an outbound transaction.
- If consumption/output involve warehouse handling. Bins are supported.
- Entries were created through subcontracting purchase orders. You can undo receipt in the Posted Purchase Receipt page.

## Undo subcontracting receipts

You can undo subcontracting receipts before you post them as invoiced. To do so, go to the posted purchase receipt, select the line, and choose the **Undo** action. As a result, an identical line with an opposite sign in the **Quantity** field is created along with the capacity ledger entry. And, if the canceled receipt line is linked to the last routing operation, an item ledger entry of the type **Output**. You can't reverse a receipt if it's invoiced or if the production order is finished.

> [!NOTE]
> If posting a subcontracting receipt caused consumption of components due to the flushing method, the consumption transactions aren't reverted. You must reverse them separately by using an output journal or the **Reverse Production Order Transaction** action.

After you revert and correct the records, you can change the status of the production order to **Finished**. The steps and settings are the same for a scenario where there is no output to allocate accumulated WIP because of actual scrap. To set this up, turn on the **Finish Order Without Output** toggle on the **Manufacturing Setup** page.

> [!NOTE]
> After you turn on the toggle, you can't turn it off again. However, you can decide whether to write-off WIP for each order individually.

When you change the status of a released production order that has consumption or capacity ledger entries but no output, you can turn on the **Allow Finishing Prod. Order with no output** toggle on the **Change production order status** page.

The accumulated WIP amounts are posted to your inventory adjustment account. Remember to fill in the **Inventory Adjustment Account** on the **General Posting Setup** page for the entry defined by:

- The **Gen. Bus. Posting Group** field on the production order.
- The **Gen. Prod. Posting Group** field on the produced item.

## Reopen a finished production order to make corrections

After you complete a production order and set its status to **Finished**, you might discover a mistake. For example, you might find that consumption is missing or the item tracking information is incorrect. To make sure that your inventory and cost transactions are correct, use the **Reopen** action on the **Finished Production Orders** page to make adjustments. However, to protect your data there are a few restrictions:

- You can only reopen an order one time.
- You can't reopen an order that has no output and cost was written off to an adjustment account.

# Setting up sales

Before you can manage sales processes, you must configure the rules and values that define the company's sales policies.

You must define the general setup on the **Sales & Receivables** page, such as which sales documents are required, how their values are posted, and the type of lines to create by default. This general setup is typically performed once during the initial implementation.

A separate series of tasks related to registering new customers is to record any special price or discount agreements that you have with each customer. For more information, see [Record Special Sales Prices and Discounts](sales-how-record-sales-price-discount-payment-agreements.md).

Finance-related sales setup, such as payment methods and currencies, are covered in the Finance Setup section. For more information, see [Setting Up Finance](finance-setup-finance.md).

# Design Details: Searching for Dimension Combinations
When you close a page after you edit a set of dimensions, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] evaluates whether the edited set of dimensions exists. If the set does not exist, a new set is created and the dimension combination ID is returned.  

## Building Search Tree  
 Table 481 **Dimension Set Tree Node** is used when [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] evaluates whether a set of dimensions already exists in table 480 **Dimension Set Entry** table. The evaluation is performed by recursively traversing the search tree starting at the top level numbered 0. The top level 0 represents a dimension set with no dimension set entries. The children of this dimension set represent dimension sets with only one dimension set entry. The children of these dimension sets represent dimension sets with two children, and so on.  

### Example 1  
 The following diagram represents a search tree with six dimension sets. Only the distinguishing dimension set entry is displayed in the diagram.  

 ![Example of dimension tree structure.](media/nav2013_dimension_tree.png "Example of dimension tree structure")  

 The following table describes a complete list of dimension set entries that make up each dimension set.  

|Dimension Sets|Dimension Set Entries|  
|--------------------|---------------------------|  
|Set 0|None|  
|Set 1|AREA 30|  
|Set 2|AREA 30, DEPT ADM|  
|Set 3|AREA 30, DEPT PROD|  
|Set 4|AREA 30, DEPT ADM, PROJ VW|  
|Set 5|AREA 40|  
|Set 6|AREA 40, PROJ VW|  

### Example 2  
 This example shows how [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] evaluates whether a dimension set that consists of the dimension set entries AREA 40, DEPT PROD exists.  

 First, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] also updates the **Dimension Set Tree Node** table to make sure that the search tree looks like the following diagram. Thus dimension set 7 becomes a child of the dimension set 5.  

 ![Example of dimension tree structure in NAV 2013.](media/nav2013_dimension_tree_example2.png "Example of dimension tree structure in NAV 2013")  

### Finding Dimension Set ID  
 At a conceptual level, **Parent ID**, **Dimension**, and **Dimension Value**, in the search tree, are combined and used as the primary key because [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] traverses the tree in the same order as the dimension entries. The GET function (record) is used to search for dimension set ID. The following code example shows how to find the dimension set ID when there are three dimension values.  

```  
DimSet."Parent ID" := 0;  // 'root'  
IF UserDim.FINDSET THEN  
  REPEAT  
      DimSet.GET(DimSet."Parent ID",UserDim.DimCode,UserDim.DimValueCode);  
  UNTIL UserDim.NEXT = 0;  
EXIT(DimSet.ID);  

```  

However, to preserve the ability of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to rename both a dimension and a dimension value, table 349, **Dimension Value**, is extended with an integer field, **Dimension Value ID**. This table converts the field pair, **Dimension** and **Dimension Value**, to an integer value. When you rename the dimension and dimension value, the integer value is not changed.  

```  
DimSet."Parent ID" := 0;  // 'root'  
IF UserDim.FINDSET THEN  
  REPEAT  
      DimSet.GET(DimSet.ParentID,UserDim."Dimension Value ID");  
  UNTIL UserDim.NEXT = 0;  
EXIT(DimSet.ID);  

```

# Setting up project management

Before you can use [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to manage projects, you must set up resources, time sheets, and projects.

Then you can create projects and schedule resources for projects as well as manage budgets and track machine and employee hours with time sheets. For more information, see [Managing Projects](projects-manage-projects.md).  

The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the topics that describe them.

# Trace item-tracked items

You can see where an item-tracked item was used, including how and when it was received or produced, transferred, sold, consumed, or returned. You can also find all current instances of a specific serial or lot number in the database. You do this by using the Item Tracing and the [Find Entries](ui-find-entries.md) features.  

These features can be useful in quality control when you need to find out which customers received products with a particular lot number or when you need to find out which lot a defective component came from.  

 On the **Item Tracing** page, you can trace forwards and backwards in a sequence of posted inventory transactions for the serial or lot number.  

 On the **Find Entries** page, you can't see the sequence of transactions, but you can see all records of the serial or lot number, both posted entries and open records.  

 The two features can be used in combination by transferring a traced serial or lot number to the **Find Entries** page to finish a complete trace scenario. <!-- For more information, see [Walkthrough: Tracing Serial-Lot Numbers](walkthrough-tracing-serial-lot-numbers.md).   -->

## To trace item-tracked items  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Item Tracing**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  In the filter fields at the top of the page, enter the specific item numbers or a filter on the item numbers that you would like to trace.  
3.  In the **Show Components** field, select whether to also see where the components for the items came from. The following table describes the options.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**No**|Don't show components.|  
    |**Item-tracked Only**|Show only components that have lot or serial numbers.|  
    |**All**|Show all components.|  

4.  In the **Trace Method** field, select the method to use for tracing the item. The following table describes the options.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Usage->Origin**|Trace the item from where it was used to where it came from. For instance, if a manufactured item was sold to a customer, the **Item Tracing** page shows this with the sales shipment line first, which you can then expand to see from which production order it came.|  
    |**Origin->Usage**|Trace the item from where it came into inventory to where it was used. For instance, if a manufactured item was sold to a customer, the **Item Tracing** page shows this with the finished production order first, which you can then expand to see the sale shipment lines where the item was used.|  

5.  Choose the **Trace** action to run the trace.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  Only applied transactions are shown. If you have received the same lot on multiple transactions, the **Item Tracing** page may not show all transactions.   

> [!NOTE]  
>  If additional transaction history under an item tracing line has already been traced by another line above it, then the **Already Traced** check box is selected. To provide a simpler view, such underlying lines are not shown.  
>   
>  To find the item tracing lines where the transaction history has already been traced, choose the **Go to Already Traced** button. The item tracing line in question is selected, and all underlying lines are expanded.  

## To find item-tracked items with Find Entries  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Find Entries**, and then select the related link.  
2. Choose **Search for item references**.
3. In the **Serial No.** and **Lot No.** fields, enter the item tracking numbers that you want to trace.  
4. Choose the **Find** action to find all instances of the serial or lot number in the database.

# Assemble to project

Assemble to project helps you improve inventory management by assembling to order only when it's required.

When you choose an assemble-to-order item on a project planning line, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates an assembly order. The assembly order is based on the project planning line, and its lines are based on the item's assembly bill of materials (BOM). To learn more about assembly BOMs, go to [Work with Assembly BOMs](assembly-how-work-assembly-boms.md). The quantity of components on the assembly BOM is multiplied by the order quantity. The **Assemble-to-Order Lines** page shows details about the linked assembly order lines. The details can help you customize the assembly item. As in sales, you can't directly post linked assembly orders. To learn more about assembly orders, go to [Selling Inventory Items in Assemble-to-Order Flows](assembly-how-to-sell-inventory-items-in-assemble-to-order-flows.md).

Assembly orders are reserved for projects, and [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] synchronizes item tracking between project planning lines and assembly order.

## Integrate with warehouse management

Assemble to project integrates with warehouse management features to make assembly and shipping easier. The process also helps ensure that the flow from project assembly to delivery runs smoothly in internal warehouse processes. To learn more about internal warehouse flows for projects, go to [Flows for Production, Assembly, and Jobs](design-details-internal-warehouse-flows.md#flows-to-and-from-assembly-in-a-basic-warehouse-configuration).

The following table describes the warehouse configurations that assemble to order supports.

|Configuration  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|**No warehouse handling**|Use a project journal to post full or partial usage. The output and consumption of components post automatically for the assembly order.         |
|**Inventory pick**|Use an inventory pick to post full or partial usage. The output and consumption of components post automatically for the assembly order.          |
|**Warehouse pick**|Create and register warehouse picks for components, and then use a project journal to post usage. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] verifies whether the consumed assembly components were picked. The output and consumption of components post automatically for the assembly order.         |

## Known limitations

This section describes known limitations for assemble to project.

* The **Quantity to Assemble to Order** field isn't available for projects that are closed.
* For warehouse pick scenarios, the **Quantity to Assemble to Order** can be either zero or equal to the quantity. You can't mix assemble to order and assemble to stock on a project planning line. You must create separate project planning lines.
* Assemble to order doesn't affect billable parts of a project. An assembly is included on sales invoices, but not its components. You can't edit the **Quantity to Assemble to Order** field for billable lines.
* Order planning and the planning worksheet aren't affected because the project is the input for planning. The planning engine considers the assembly as demand.
* You can't enter a negative quantity in the **Quantity to Assemble to Order** field.
* You can't undo an assembly.

# Dimension Set Entries Overview
This topic describes how dimension set entries are stored and posted in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

## Dimension Sets  
A dimension set is a unique combination of dimension values. It is stored as dimension set entries in the database. Each dimension set entry represents a single dimension value. The dimension set is identified by a common dimension set ID that is assigned to each dimension set entry that belongs to the dimension set.  

The following example shows a dimension set that has three dimension set entries. The dimension set is identified by a dimension set ID, which is 108.  

|Dimension Set ID|Dimension Code|Dimension Value Code|Dimension Value Name|  
|----------------------|--------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|  
|108|AREA|70|America North|  
|108|BUSINESSGROUP|HOME|Home|  
|108|DEPARTMENT|SALES|Sales|  

## Dimension Set Entries  
Dimension sets are stored in the **Dimension Set Entry** table as dimension set entries with the same dimension set ID.  

![Flow of dimension set entries.](media/dimensionentrynav7.png "Flow of dimension set entries")  

When you create a new journal line, document header, or document line, you can specify a combination of dimension values. Instead of explicitly storing each dimension value in the database, a dimension set ID is assigned to the journal line, document header, or document line to specify the dimension set.  

When you edit and close the **Edit Dimension Set Entries** page, a check is performed to see whether the combination of dimension values exists as a dimension set in the table. If the combination occurs in the table, then the corresponding dimension set ID is assigned to the journal line, document header, or document line. Otherwise, a new dimension set is added to the table, and the new dimension set ID is assigned to the journal line, document header, or document line.

## Codeunit 408 Dimension Management
Codeunit 408, Dimension Management, is a function library that handles common tasks that are related to dimensions, such as copying from one table to another or from one document to another.

## Performance Improvement  
By storing dimension sets once in the database, database space is preserved and overall performance is improved.

# Create bank deposits

> [!NOTE]
> The ability to create bank deposits is new in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] 2022 release wave 1 for a lot of country/region versions. If you were using [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in the United States, Canada, or Mexico before that release, you might be using the earlier capabilities. You can continue, but the new capabilities will replace the old ones in a future release. To start using the new features described in this article, your administrator can go to the **Feature Management** page and turn on **Feature Update: Standardized bank reconciliation and deposits**.  

Use the **Bank Deposits** page to register deposits as a single document that posts one or more entries to a bank account. Typically, bank deposits are used to register cash deposits. The Bank Deposits page is available on the **Cash Management** menu on the Business Manager Role Center, and other Role Centers that deal with cash management.

Amounts on bank deposits can come from several sources:

* Sales, using a G/L account for revenue.
* Customers payments.
* Cash refunds from vendors, or cash payments to them. 

Bank deposit lines contain information about individual deposits, such as checks from customers. The total of the amounts on the lines must add up to the total amount of the deposit.

After you fill in the deposit information and lines, you must post it. Posting updates the relevant ledgers, including the general ledger, and the bank, customer, and vendor ledgers. Posted deposits are stored for future reference on the **Posted Bank Deposits** page.

The **Bank Deposit** report displays customer and vendor deposits with the original deposit amount, the amount of the deposit that remains open, and the amount applied. The report also shows the total posted deposit amount to reconcile.

## Before you start

There are a few things to set up before you can use bank deposits. You must have a number series and general journal template ready. You should also specify whether to post bank deposit amounts as a lump sum. That is, as a total of all the amounts on the deposit lines. Otherwise, each line is posted as an individual entry. Posting a deposit as a single bank ledger entry can make it easier to do bank reconciliation.

### Number series and lump sum deposits

You must set up a number series for bank deposits, and then specify the series in the **Bank Deposit Nos.** field on the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page. To learn more about number series, go to [Create Number Series](ui-create-number-series.md).

Also on the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page, to post deposits as lump sums rather than individual lines, turn on the **Post Bank Deposits as Lump Sum** toggle. Posting a deposit as a lump sum creates one bank ledger entry for the full amount of the deposit, which can make it easier to do bank reconciliation.

### General journal templates for bank deposits

You must also create a general journal template for deposits. You use general journals to post entries to bank, customer, vendor, fixed asset, and general ledger accounts. The journal templates design the general journal to suit the purpose of your work. That is, the fields on the journal template are exactly the ones you need.

The deposits are cash receipts, so you might want to reuse your number series for cash receipt journals. Alternatively, if you need to distinguish between bank deposit and cash receipt journal entries, use a different number series.

You also need to create a batch job for the template. To create a batch job, on the **General Journal Templates** page, choose the **Batches** action. To learn more about batches, go to [Using Journal Templates and Batches](ui-work-general-journals.md#use-journal-templates-and-batches).

## Dimensions on bank deposit lines

The lines on the bank deposit use the default dimensions you specified in the **Department Code** and **Customer group Code** fields. When you choose **Customer** or **Vendor** in the **Account Type** field, the dimensions for the customer or vendor replace the defaults. You can change the dimensions on the lines, if needed.

> [!TIP]
> Dimension on lines are set according to Default Dimension Priorities. Line dimensions prioritized over header dimensions. To avoid conflicts, you can create rules that prioritize when to use a dimension depending on the source. If you want to change how dimensions are prioritized, you can change their rankings on the **Default Dimension Priorities** page. For more information, see [To set up default dimension priorities](finance-dimensions.md#to-set-up-default-dimension-priorities).

## Create a bank deposit

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Bank Deposits**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose **New** to open the **Bank Deposit** page.
3. Choose the general journal template that you created for bank deposits.  

    > [!NOTE]
    > If the general journal template has more than one batch, you'll be prompted to choose one.

4. In the **Bank Account No.** field, choose the bank account in which to make the deposit.

    > [!TIP]
    > You can double-check that you're depositing to the correct account by using the **Account Card** and **Account Ledger Entries** actions to look up the ledger entries for the selected bank account. For example, to check whether similar deposits were made to the account.

5. In the **Total Deposit Amount** field, enter the total amount of the deposit. This total must be the sum of the amounts on all lines.
6. Fill in the remaining fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](../archive/SetupAndAdministration/includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

    The date in the **Posting Date** field and the dimensions in the **Department Code** and **Customergroup Code** fields are assigned to the lines that you create for the bank deposit. You can change them if needed.

7. Depending on whether you want to post the bank deposit as lump sum or each line individually to the bank ledger, turn the **Post as Lump Sum** toggle on or off. The default setting comes from the same toggle on the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The **Currency Code** field shows the currency that is specified for the bank account you chose. You cannot choose a different currency.

8. On the **Lines** FastTab, create a new line for each cash payment that you want to deposit.
9. In the **Account Type** field, specify where the payment originated. For bank deposits, the type is typically **Customer** or **Vendor**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You can also register a cash payment to a vendor. To do that, choose **Vendor** and then enter the payment amount as a negative number in the **Credit Amount** field on the line.

10. In the **Document No.** field, enter the document number of the invoice from which the credit amount originated. You can use a document number for each line, or the same number for all lines.

    > [!TIP]
    > Typically, you don't need to fill in the **Document Type** field for financial entries. For example, if you're depositing cash from a day's sale you leave the field blank. If you're depositing cash from a customer payment, you choose **Payment**.

11. If you're depositing a cash payment for a specific customer invoice, choose the **Apply Entries** action, and then enter the invoice number in the **Applies-to ID** field.
12. If you're ready to post the bank deposit, choose the **Post** action.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If the bank account has default dimensions where the **Value Posting** field contains **Code Mandatory**, **Same Code**, or **No Code**, you must post the deposit as a lump sum. If you don't post as a lump sum, posting might fail because the dimension values of the accounts on the bank deposit lines violate the value posting rules of the bank account.

    > [!TIP]
    > Before you post the deposit, you can use the **Test Report** action to review your data. The report shows whether there are any issues, such as missing data, that might prevent posting.  

## Apply multiple checks for multiple invoices for a customer in a lump sum deposit

You can post lump sum deposits from multiple checks on deposit lines for customer ledger entries. 

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Bank Deposits**, and then choose the related link.
2. Create or choose a line for the customer, and in the **External Document No.** field, enter the check number.
3. Choose **Apply Entries**.
4. On the **Apply Customer Entries** page, for each document you want to apply the check to, in the **Applies-to ID** field, enter the check number.
5. In the **Amount to apply** field, enter the amount on the check.

   > [!NOTE]
   > When you enter the amount to apply, the **Applies-to ID** field might reset to the bank deposit document number. Double-check the field, and if it reset, reenter the check number.  

6. Choose **OK**.
7. Repeat steps two through six for each check.

   > [!TIP]
   > Before you post the bank deposit, it's a good idea to use the **Test Report** action to validate the applications.

## Find posted bank deposits

The **Posted Bank Deposits** page lists your company's previous deposits. In the list, you can review the comments and dimensions that were specified for the deposits. You can open the bank deposit to view more details, and from there you can investigate further. For example, you can choose the **Find entries** action to view the posted bank ledger entries. From the bank ledger entry, you can find its corresponding posted general ledger entry.

If you want to look up all general ledger entries for the posted deposit lines, go to the **G/L Register** page and use the **General Ledger** action. The action shows all of the general ledger entries, including the entries for customers and vendors.

## Reverse a posted bank deposit

There are a couple of ways to reverse a posted bank deposit:

* On the **Posted Bank Deposits** page, choose the deposit, and then choose the **Undo Posting** action.
* On the **G/L Registers** page, find the register for the deposit, and then choose the **Reverse Register** action.

> [!NOTE]
> You can only reverse a register that contains a single type of entry. That is, the register must contain only customer entries or vendor entries, but not both. If a register contains both you must manually reverse the deposit.

# Set Up Base Calendars

You can assign a base calendar to your company and its business partners, such as customers, vendors, or locations. Delivery and receipt dates on future sales order, purchase order, transfer order, and production order lines are calculated according to the calendar’s specified working days. The main task in setting up a new base calendar is to specify and define the non-working days that you want to apply.  

## To set up a base calendar

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Base Calendar**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Choose the **New** action.  
3.  Fill in the **Code** field.  
4. Choose the **Maintain Base Calendar Changes** action.
5. On the **Base Calendar Changes** page, use the **Recurring System** field to mark a particular date or day as a recurring nonworking day. You can select either the **Annual Recurring** or **Weekly Recurring** option.  

    If you select **Annual Recurring**, you must also enter the relevant date in the **Date** field.  

    If you select **Weekly Recurring**, you must also select the relevant day of the week in the **Day** field. If you leave the field empty, you must fill in the **Date** field. The **Day** field is filled in automatically.  

When you make an entry, the **Nonworking** field is selected. You can choose to clear the check mark to make it a working day.  
 When you return to the base calendar card, you will observe that the nonworking day entries that you made have been updated. These entries now appear in red and the **Nonworking** field is selected.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  When setting up a new base calendar, you can select and copy lines from an existing calendar. You do this in the relevant **Base Calendar Changes** page.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  Any base calendar defined for the vendor or the location affects how the dates are calculated and rounded to working days.
Specifies a date formula for the time that it takes to replenish the item. It is used to calculate the **Planned Receipt Date** field, if calculating forward, and **Order Date** field, if calculating backwards. See [Lead Time Calculation](across-how-to-assign-base-calendars.md#lead-time-calculation).

## Lead Time Calculation

Any base calendar defined for the vendor or the location affects how the dates are calculated and rounded to working days. Accordingly, the two date fields on purchase order lines are calculated as follows under different conditions.

|Calculation Direction|Vendor Calendar Defined|Vendor Calendar Not Defined|
|---------------------|-----------------------|---------------------------|
|Forward|planned receipt date = order date + vendor lead time (per the vendor calendar and rounded to the next working day in first the vendor calendar and then the location calendar)|planned receipt date = order date + vendor lead time (per the location calendar)|
|Backward|order date = planned receipt date - vendor lead time (per the vendor calendar and rounded to the previous working day in first the vendor calendar and then the location calendar)|order date = planned receipt date - vendor lead time (per the location calendar)|

> [!NOTE]
> In addition to the lead time calculation that affects the planned receipt date and order date, as shown in the above table, warehouse handling time and safety lead time may be added to the formulas to make up the value in the **Expected Receipt Date** field, as follows: Planned Receipt Date + Safety Lead Time + Inbound Warehouse Handling Time = Expected Receipt Date.

> [!Important]
> If your location uses a significantly different calendar than your vendors do, then it is important that you set up specific calendars for those vendors, to calculate optimal vendor lead times. For information about how to set up vendor calendars, see [To assign a base calendar](across-how-to-assign-base-calendars.md#to-assign-a-base-calendar).

The contents of the **Lead Time Calculation** field is copied from either the item card or the SKU card, if the lead time is defined for the item, or on the **Item Vendor Catalog** page, if the lead time is defined for the vendor.

## To customize a calendar
The main task in customizing a base calendar for your company, or one of its business partners, is to enter any changes to working and nonworking day status.

For example, while a base calendar would typically list all Saturdays as non-working days, the customized calendar for a particular location may list all Saturdays during the months of November and December, and leading up to the holiday season, as working days.

The following procedure uses the case of the location as an example. Note that at this point, you have already assigned a base calendar to the location.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Locations**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the location that you want to update, and then select the **Customized Calendar** field. Note that a calendar must be selected in the **Base Calendar Code** field.
3. On the **Customized Calendar Entries** page opens, choose the **Maintain Customized Calendar Changes** action.
4. In the **Customized Calendar Changes**, add lines for customized calendar entries.

    When you enter a line, the **Nonworking** check box is selected. You can clear the check box if you want to change the status to a working day.

    You can use the **Recurring System** field to set a particular date or day as a recurring nonworking day. You can select either the **Annual Recurring** or **Weekly Recurring** option.

    If you select **Annual Recurring**, you must also enter the relevant date in the **Date** field. If you select **Weekly Recurring**, you must also select the relevant day of the week in the **Day** field. If you leave the field empty, you must fill in the **Date** field. The **Day** field is then filled in automatically. This could be useful if you want to mark an individual date as a nonworking or working day.

5. Choose the **OK** button.

On the **Customized Calendar Entries** page, you will observe that the date entries are updated with the changes that you made.

On the Location card, you will observe that the **Customized Calendar** field contains **Yes**, indicating that a customized calendar has been set up.

> [!Important]
> If you do not fill in the **Location Code** field on an order line, your company’s calendar is used.


If you do not fill in the **Shipping Agent Code** field on the order line, your company’s calendar is used.

> [!NOTE]  
> If you make changes to a base calendar for which customized calendar changes exist, all existing customized calendars are updated automatically.

## To assign a base calendar  
The following procedure schedules delivery dates on sales order lines for a customer as an example.

Base calendars are assigned to your own company, customers, vendors, locations, and shipping agents as follows:  

-   On the **Company Information** and **Customer** cards, the base calendar is assigned on the **Shipping** FastTab.  
-   On the **Vendor** card, the base calendar is assigned on the **Receiving** FastTab.  
-   On the **Location** card, the base calendar is assigned on the **Warehouse** FastTab.  
-   On the **Shipping Agents** page, the base calendar is assigned on the **Shipping Agent Services** page.  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customers**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Open the **Customer** card for whom you will assign a base calendar.  
3.  On the **Shipping** FastTab, in the **Base Calendar Code** field, select the base calendar that you want to assign.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  -   If you do not assign a base calendar to a company, all dates are calculated as working days.  
> -   If you enter a blank location on an order line, all dates are calculated as working days.  
> -   Any base calendar defined for the vendor or the location affects how the dates are calculated and rounded to working days.

> [!NOTE]  
>  Before you can make customized calendar entries, you must first assign a base calendar to the company.

# General Ledger Entries (Power BI report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **General Ledger Entries** report provides a detailed view of individual entries from the general ledger, so you can quickly filter and locate specific entries. This report is a valuable tool for tracking financial transactions, reconciliation, and facilitating efficient audits by giving easy access to detailed entry information.

:::image type="content" source="media/finance/general-ledger-entries-report.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the General Ledger Entries report" lightbox="media/finance/general-ledger-entries-report.png":::

## Use the report

The audiences for the report are:

- Finance managers
- Finance staff

Finance managers use the report to reconcile transactions for a specific fiscal period. By filtering the report to display only entries from that period, you can systematically review all recorded transactions. This process helps you find discrepancies, such as missing entries or erroneous amounts, and ensure that the general ledger accurately reflects the company's activities. Once reconciled, you can confidently prepare financial statements and provide insights into the organization's financial health for that period.

<!-- ## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The *General Ledger Entries* report includes the following KPIs and measures: 

- [**Amount**](####) -->

## Data used in the report

The report uses data from the following table in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]:

- General Ledger Entries

# Classifying data sensitivity fields

To classify the fields that hold sensitive or personal data, a Microsoft partner can set the ```DataClassification``` property on fields. This requires access to the database tables, either through the development environment or by running a Windows PowerShell script. For more information, see [Classifying Data](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-classifying-data).  

As a customer, you can add a second level of classification by specifying sensitivity levels for the data you store in standard and custom fields. Classifying data sensitivity helps ensure that you know where you keep personal data in your system, and makes it easier to respond to requests from data subjects. For example, if a contact or customer asks you to export their personal data. For more information, see [Responding to Requests About Personal Data](admin-responding-to-requests-about-personal-data.md).

> [!Important]  
> Microsoft is providing this Data Sensitivity Classification feature as a matter of convenience only. It's your responsibility to classify the data appropriately and comply with any laws and regulations that are applicable to you. Microsoft disclaims all responsibility towards any claims related to your classification of the data.  

The following table describes data sensitivity levels you can assign.

|Sensitivity|Description|
|----|----|
|Sensitive | Information about a data subject's racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious beliefs, involvement with trade unions, physical or mental health, sexuality, or details about criminal offenses. |
|Personal | Information that can be used to identify a data subject, either directly or in combination with other data or information.|
|Confidential | Business data that you use for accounting or other business purposes, and do not want to expose to other entities. For example, this might include ledger entries.|
|Normal | General data that does not belong to any other categories.|

## How do I classify my data?

Classifying the sensitivity of a large number of fields one-by-one would take a long time. To help speed up the process, we provide tools that you can use to bulk classify the sensitivity of fields, and then fine-tune classifications for specific fields. You can find tools on the Data Classification Worksheet page, which is available on the Administration of users, user groups, and permissions Role Center. You must be a system administrator to use the worksheet.
 
> [!Important]  
> When you open the Data Classification Worksheet page for the first time, it will be empty. You must run the Data Classification guide to generate the list of fields. To start the guide, choose the **Set Up Data Classifications** action.

For example, the Data Classification Worksheet page lets you do things like:  

* Use the Data Classification guide to export your fields to an Excel worksheet where you can bulk classify them. Using the Excel worksheet is particularly useful if you are collaborating with a Microsoft partner. After you update the worksheet, you can use the guide to import and apply the classifications. You can also use the guide to classify fields manually.  
* Choose a field and then filter the list to find similar fields that are likely to belong to the same classification as the field you based the search on.  
* Investigate a field by viewing its contents.  

> [!Tip]  
> We have defined sample sensitivity classifications for the tables and fields in the Cronus demonstration company. You can use those classifications as inspiration when you classify your own tables and fields.

# Work with Word Layouts

A Word report layout determines the content and format of a report when it is previewed and printed from Business Central. You create and modify these layouts using Microsoft Word.

[![Example of a word report layout document for Business Central.](media/word-layout.png)](media/word-layout.png#lightbox) 

When you modify a Word report layout, you specify the fields of the report dataset to include on report and how the fields are arranged. You also define the general format of the report, such as text font and size, margins, and background images. You will typically arrange the content of the report by adding tables to the layout.

To make general formatting and layout changes, such as changing text font, adding and modifying a table, or removing a data field, just use the basic editing features of Word, like you do with any Word document.

If you're designing a Word report layout from scratch or adding new data fields, then start by adding a table that includes rows and columns that will eventually hold the data fields.

> [!TIP]  
> Show the table gridlines so that you see the boundaries of table cells. Remember to hide the gridlines when you're done editing. To show or hide table gridlines, select the table, and then under **Layout** on the **Table** tab, choose **View Gridlines**.

## Embedding Fonts in Word Layouts for Consistency

To ensure that reports always display and print with the intended fonts, wherever users open or print the reports, you can embed the fonts in the Word document. However, embedding fonts can significantly increase the size of the Word files. Learn more about embedding fonts in Word at [Embed fonts in Word, PowerPoint, or Excel](https://support.office.com/article/Embed-fonts-in-Word-PowerPoint-or-Excel-cb3982aa-ea76-4323-b008-86670f222dbc).

## Adding data fields

A report dataset can consist of fields that display labels, data, and images. This topic describes the procedure for adding fields of a report dataset to an existing Word report layout for a report. You add fields by using the Word custom XML part for the report and adding content controls that map to the fields of the report dataset. Adding fields requires that you have some knowledge of the report's dataset so that you can identify the fields that you want to add to the layout.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
> You cannot modify built-in report layouts<!--Onprem. Built-in layouts can only be modified by using the development environment-->.  

###  <a name="OpenXMLPart"></a> To open the Custom XML part for the Report in Word  
  
1. If it's not already open, then open the Word report layout document in Word.  
  
     For more information, see [Create and Modify a Custom Report Layout](ui-how-create-custom-report-layout.md).  
  
2. Display the **Developer** tab in the ribbon of Microsoft Word.  
  
     By default, the **Developer** tab is not shown in the ribbon. Learn more at [Show the Developer Tab on the Ribbon](/visualstudio/vsto/how-to-show-the-developer-tab-on-the-ribbon).  
  
3. On the **Developer** tab, select **XML Mapping Pane**.  
  
4. In the **XML Mapping** pane, in the **Custom XML Part** dropdown list, choose the custom XML part for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] report, which is typically last in the list. The name of the custom XML part has the following format:  
  
     `urn:microsoft-dynamics-nav/reports/<report_name>/<ID>`  

     `<report_name>` is the name that is assigned to the report 

     `<ID>` is the identification number of the report.  
  
     After you select the custom XML part, the XML Mapping pane displays the labels and field controls that are available for the report.  
  
### To add a label or data field  
  
1. Place your cursor in the document where you want to add the control.  
  
2. In the **XML Mapping** pane, right-click the control that you want to add, choose **Insert Content Control**, and then choose **Plain Text**.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    > You cannot add a field by manually typing the dataset field name in the content control. You must use the **XML Mapping** pane to map the fields.  
  
### To add repeating rows of data fields to create a list  
  
1. In a table, add a table row that includes a column for each field that you want repeated.  
  
   This row will act as a placeholder for the repeating fields.  
  
2. Select the entire row.  
  
3. In the **XML Mapping** pane, right-click the control that corresponds to the report data item that contains the fields that you want repeated, choose **Insert Content Control**, and then choose **Repeating**.  
  
4. Add the repeating fields to the row as follows:  
  
    1. Place your pointer in a column.  
  
    2. In the **XML Mapping** pane, right-click the control that you want to add, choose **Insert Content Control**, and then choose **Plain Text**.  
  
    3. For each field, repeat steps a and b.  
  
## Adding image fields

A report dataset can include a field that contains an image, such as a company logo or a picture of an item. To add an image from the report dataset, you insert a **Picture** content control.  
  
Images align in the top-left corner of the content control and resize automatically in proportion to fit the boundary of the content control.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
> You can only add images that have a format that is supported by Word, such as .bmp, .jpeg, and .png file types. If you add an image that has a format that is not supported by Word, you will get an error when you run the report from the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] client.  
  
### To add an image  
  
1. Place your pointer in the document where you want to add the control.  
  
2. In the **XML Mapping** pane, right-click the control that you want to add, choose **Insert Content Control**, and then choose **Picture**.  
  
3. To increase or decrease the image size, drag a sizing handle away from or towards the center of the content control.  

##  <a name="RemoveField"></a> Removing label and data fields

Label and data fields of a report are contained in content controls in Word. The following figure illustrates a content control when it's selected in the Word document.  

![Content control for field in Word report layout.](media/nav_wordreportlayouts_contentcontrol.png "NAV_WordReportLayouts_ContentControl")  

The name of the label or data field name displays in the content control. In the example, the field name is CompanyAddr1.  

### To remove a label or data field  

1. Right-click the field that you want to delete, and then choose **Remove Content Control**.  

     The content control is removed, but the field name remains as text.

## Custom XML Part Overview

Word report layouts are built on *custom XML parts*. A custom XML part for a report consists of elements that correspond to the data items, columns, and labels that comprise the report's dataset. <!--OnPrem The data as defined in the Report Dataset Designer in Microsoft Dynamics NAV Development Environment. -->The custom XML part is used to map the data into a report when the report is run.

### XML structure of custom XML part

The following table provides a simplified overview of the XML of a custom XML part.  
  
|XML Elements|Description|  
|------------------|-----------------|  
|`<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?>`|Header|  
|`<WordReportXmlPart xmlns="urn:microsoft-dynamics-365/report/<reportname>/<id>/"`|XML namespace specification. `<reportname>` is the name that is assigned to the report. `<id>` is the ID that is assigned to the report.|  
|`..<Labels>`<br /><br /> `....<ColumnNameCaption>ColumnNameCaption</ColumnNameCaption>`<br /><br /> `....<LabelName>LabelCaption</LabelName>`<br /><br /> `..</Labels>`|Contains all the labels for the report.<!--OnPren The element includes labels that are related to columns that have the IncludeCaption Property.--><br />-   Label elements that are related to columns have the format `<ColumnNameCaption>ColumnNameCaption</ColumnNameCaption>`<!--OnPrem where `ColumnName` is determined by the column's Name Property.-->.<br />-  Label elements have the format `<LabelName>LabelName</LabelName`<!--OnPrem where LabelName is determined by the label's Name Property.-->.<br />-   Labels are listed in alphabetical order.|  
|`..<DataItem1>`<br /><br /> `....<DataItem1Column1>DataItem1Column1</DataItem1Column1>`|Top-level data item and columns. Columns are listed in alphabetical order.<!--OnPrem <br /><br /> The element names and values are determined by the Name Property of the data item or column.-->|  
|`....<DataItem2>`<br /><br /> `......<DataItem2Column1>DataItem2Column1</DataItem2Column1>`<br /><br /> `....</DataItem2>`<br /><br /> `....<DataItem3>`<br /><br /> `......<DataItem3Column1>DataItem3Column1</DataItem3Column1>`<br /><br /> `....</DataItem3>`|Data items and columns that are nested in the top-level data item. Columns are listed in alphabetical order under the respective data item.|  
|`..</DataItem1>`<br /><br /> `</WordReportXmlPart>`|Closing element.|  
  
### Custom XML part in Word

 In Word, you open the custom XML part in the **XML Mapping** pane, and then use the pane to map elements to content controls in the Word document. The **XML Mapping** pane is accessible from the **Developer** tab (learn more at [Show the Developer Tab on the Ribbon](/visualstudio/vsto/how-to-show-the-developer-tab-on-the-ribbon)).  
  
 The elements in the **XML Mapping** pane appear in a structure that is similar to the XML source. Label fields are grouped under a common **Labels** element and data item and columns are arranged in a hierarchal structure that corresponds to the XML source, with columns listed in alphabetical order. Elements are identified by their column name as defined in the report's dataset in AL code. Learn more in [Defining a Report Dataset](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-report-dataset).  
  
 The following figure illustrates the simple custom XML part from the previous section in the **XML Mapping** pane of a Word document.  
  
 ![Clip of the XML Mapping pane in word.](media/nav_reportlayout_xmlmappingpane.png "NAV_ReportLayout_XMLMappingPane")  
  
* To add a label or field to the layout, you insert a content control that maps to the element in the **XML Mapping** pane.  
  
* To create repeating rows of columns, insert a **Repeating** content control for the parent data item element, and then add content control for the columns.  
  
* For labels, the actual text that appears in the generated report is the value of the **Caption** property for the field in the data item table (if the label is related to the column in the report dataset) or a label in the Report Label Designer (if the label is not related to a column in the dataset).  
  
* The language of the label that is displayed when you run the report depends on the language setting of the report object.

# Exchanging Data Electronically
You can use the Data Exchange Framework to manage the exchange of business documents, bank files, currency exchange rates, and any other data files with your business partners.

In the standard version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the Data Exchange Framework is used in processes such as exchanging electronic documents, importing and exporting bank files, and updating exchange rates for currencies. For more information, see [About the Data Exchange Framework](across-about-the-data-exchange-framework.md).

As an administrator or Microsoft partner, you can use the framework in new integration features by specifying the data to exchange, and how to exchange it. For more information, see [Set Up Data Exchange Definitions](across-how-to-set-up-data-exchange-definitions.md).

The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the topics that describe them.

# Set up the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-finance-app-name](includes/power-bi-finance-app-name.md)]

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

This article explains how to set up the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-finance-app-name](includes/power-bi-finance-app-name.md)] in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

For the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-finance-app-name](includes/power-bi-finance-app-name.md)] to show correct KPIs and reports, do two things in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]:

1. Set up G/L account categories for your chart of accounts.
1. Map G/L account categories to corresponding categories used in the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/powerbi-name.md)] Finance semantic model.

## Prerequisites

Before you configure the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-finance-app-name](includes/power-bi-finance-app-name.md)] for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you must:

1. Have a connector (AL) app that contains APIs, setup pages, and embed pages. Connectors are preinstalled with [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].
1. Install the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] template app that contains a [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] semantic model and [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports for finance.
1. Run the **Connect to Power BI** assisted setup guide.

To learn more, go to [Install Power BI apps for Business Central](across-powerbi-install-business-central-apps.md).

## Configure date filtering for the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-finance-app-name](includes/power-bi-finance-app-name.md)] semantic model

This section describes how to configure date filtering for the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-finance-app-name](includes/power-bi-finance-app-name.md)]. You can configure the app to load data based on the **Start Date** and **End Date**. This filter helps improve performance in your [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] environment and reduce [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] load times by only loading the data you intend to analyze.

> [!NOTE]
> Configuring date filtering for the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-finance-app-name](includes/power-bi-finance-app-name.md)] is optional, and is designed to help manage large datasets.

The **Start Date** and **End Date** filter can apply to the following tables:

- G/L Entries (related to the Income Statement)
- G/L Budget Entries
- Customer Ledger Entries
- Vendor Ledger Entries

### Set up date filtering

1. Search and open the **[Power BI Connector Setup](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com?page=36951)** page.
1. Expand the **Finance Report** section.
1. Fill in the **Start Date** and **End Date** fields under **Income Statement & G/L Budget Entry Filters**.

Repeat steps 2-3 for the date setup under **Customer Ledger Entry Filters** and **Vendor Ledger Entry Filters**.

The following fields are available on the **Finance Report** FastTab:

|No.| Data Area | Field Name | Description |
|---| ---       | ---        | ---         |
|1  | Income Statement and G/L Budgets   | Start Date      | Specifies the starting date to apply to a range of income statement G/L entries and G/L budget entries.   |
|2  | Income Statement and G/L Budgets   | End Date        | Specifies the end date to apply to a range of income statement G/L entries and G/L budget entries.        |
|3  | Customer Ledger Entries            | Start Date      | Specifies the starting date to apply to a range of customer ledger entries.                               |  
|4  | Customer Ledger Entries            | End Date        | Specifies the end date to apply to a range of customer ledger entries.                                    |
|5  | Vendor Ledger Entries            | Start Date      | Specifies the starting date to apply to a range of vendor ledger entries.                                 |
|6  | Vendor Ledger Entries            | End Date        | Specifies the end date to apply to a range of vendor ledger entries.                                      |

## Set up G/L account categories for your chart of accounts

G/L account categories are groups of general ledger accounts. The categories are required for using the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/powerbi-name.md)] Finance app.

For each posting account in your chart of accounts, you must specify an **Account Category** and **Account Subcategory**. You don't need to set up the totaling accounts.

To learn more about how to work with G/L account categories, go to [G/L account categories](./finance-general-ledger.md#account-categories).

## Map G/L account categories to corresponding categories used in the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/powerbi-name.md)] Finance semantic model

The [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/powerbi-name.md)] Finance app has default mappings for G/L account categories in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to corresponding values in the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/powerbi-name.md)] Finance semantic model. This mapping enables the finance KPIs and reports to show correct values.

The following sections show the default mappings. You can change the default values of the **Business Central Category** columns to your choice of G/L account categories by choosing the **Power BI Account Categories** action on the **Power BI Connector Setup** setup page or directly on the **Power BI Account Categories** page.

### Level 1 Categories

Level 1 categories are the top-level categories without indentation.

| Power BI Account Category                 | Business Central Category |
| ---                                       | ---                       |
| Assets (Level 1 Category)                 | Assets                    |
| Liabilities (Level 1 Category)            | Liabilities               |
| Equity (Level 1 Category)                 | Equity                    |
| Revenue (Level 1 Category)                | Income                    |
| Cost of Goods Sold (Level 1 Category)     | Cost of Goods Sold        |
| Expense (Level 1 Category)                | Expense                   |

### Level 2 Categories

Level 2 categories are the second-level categories with indentation.

| Power BI Account Category	| Business Central Category     |
|---                    |---                              |
| Current Assets (Level 2 Category) | Current Assets   |
| Current Liabilities (Level 2 Category)  | Current Liabilities   |
| Shareholder's Equity (Level 2 Category) | Common Stock          |
| Interest Expense (Level 2 Category)     | Interest Expense      |
| Tax Expense (Level 2 Category)          | Tax Expense            |
| Extraordinary Expense (Level 2 Category) | Extraordinary Expense |
| FX Losses Expense (Level 2 Category)     | FX Losses Expense  |
| Depreciation and Amortization (Level 2 Category) 	| Depreciation and Amortization     |
| Interest Revenue (Level 2 Category)  | Interest Income        |
| FX Gains Revenue (Level 2 Category)  | FX Gains Income         |
| Extraordinary Revenue (Level 2 Category) | Extraordinary Income   |
| Fixed Assets (Level 2 Category)          | Fixed Assets           |
| Payroll Liabilities (Level 2 Category)   | Payroll Liabilities     |
| Long-term Liabilities (Level 2 Category)  | Long Term Liabilities   |

### Level 3 Categories

Level 3 categories are the subcategories of Level 2 with indentation.

| Power BI Account Category                 | Business Central Category |
| ---                                       | ---                       |
| Inventory (Level 3 Category)              | Inventory                 |
| Accounts Payable (Level 3 Category)       | Accounts Payable          |
| Accounts Receivable (Level 3 Category)    | Accounts Receivable       |
| Purchases (Level 3 Category)              | Purchases                 |
| Purchase Prepayments (Level 3 Category)   | Prepaid Expenses          |
| Liquid Assets (Level 3 Category)          | Cash                      |

## Troubleshooting

If you experience issues with the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-finance-app-name](includes/power-bi-finance-app-name.md)], the information in the following sections might help you get unblocked.

### Getting the "Column Entry No. in Table G/L Entries contains a duplicate value" error?

When you refresh data from your [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] environment into the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-finance-app-name](includes/power-bi-finance-app-name.md)], a refresh error might happen with the following error message:

```
Something went wrong
There was an error when processing the data in the dataset.
Please try again later or contact support. If you contact support, please provide these details.

Data source error: Column '<oii>Entry No.</oii>' in Table '<oii>G/L Entries</oii>' contains a duplicate value
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you get this error, you're affected by a bug in the semantic model for the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-finance-app-name](includes/power-bi-finance-app-name.md)].

This error indicates that there are duplicate G/L entries in the Finance fact table in the semantic model. The error displays when we attempt to combine the three sub-queries (Balance Sheet G/L Entries, Income Statement G/L Entries, and Close Income Statement G/L Entries) into the single G/L Entries Fact table.

The current Balance Sheet G/L Entries query has a hard-coded filter transformation. This filter assumes that the source code for closing entries is CLSINCOME. This leads the model to allow closing entries to exist in both the Balance Sheet query and the Closing Entries query, resulting in duplicate entries.

### Getting the "Column ‘G/L Account No.’ in Table ‘G/L Account’ contains a duplicate value" error?

When you refresh data from your [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] environment into the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-finance-app-name](includes/power-bi-finance-app-name.md)], a refresh error might happen due to how your **Begin-Total** and **End-Total** accounts are configured in your **Chart of Accounts**.

If you receive this error, review the totaling accounts.

```
Something went wrong
There was an error when processing the data in the dataset.
Please try again later or contact support. If you contact support, please provide these details.

Data source error: Column 'G/L Account No.' in Table 'G/L Account' contains a duplicate value 'X' and this is not allowed for columns on the one side of a many-to-one relationship or for columns that are used as the primary key of a table.
```

**Why did this happen?**

This error can happen because the Finance Connector app relies on the totaling accounts for hierarchy and indentation purposes.

Your totaling for an **End-Total** account must exactly reference both the **Begin-Total** and **End-Total** accounts. You can only use one **Begin-Total** account in one **End-Total** account.

**Fix the totaling on your G/L Accounts**

The following example shows how to set up the totaling accounts.

1. A **Begin-Total** account of **1300 (Vehicles)** and the **End-Total** account of **1390 (Vehicles, Total)**.
2. The totaling defined for the **End-Total** is **1300..1390**. Any other combination for your totaling account (such as 1300..1340, 1310..1390, or 1310..1340, etc.) can cause the error.
3. One **Begin-Total** account can only be used in one **End-Total** account. If you use a **Begin-Total** account in two or more **End-Total** accounts, the [!INCLUDE [power-bi-finance-app-name](includes/power-bi-finance-app-name.md)] can't match it to an **End-Total** account.

# Set up a sequence of workflow users

Before you can create approval workflows, you must set up the users who can submit requests and their approvers. For example, you can specify who receives a notification to act on a workflow step. You set up approval workflow participants on the **Approval User Setup** page. Learn more at [Set Up Approval Users](across-how-to-set-up-approval-users.md).

On the **Workflow User Groups** page, you can specify where a participant engages in an approval workflow by entering a number in the **Sequence No.** field. For example, you can specify that users engage in a sequential order, such as a chain of approvers. You can also specify a flat list of approvers by entering the same number. In the latter case, only one of the approvers must approve a request.

[!INCLUDE [workflow-requestor-approver](includes/workflow-requestor-approver.md)]

## To set up a workflow user group

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Workflow User Groups**, then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action. The **Workflow User Group** page opens.  
3. In the **Code** field, enter a maximum of 20 characters to identify the workflow.  
4. In the **Description** field, describe the workflow.  
5. On the **Workflow User Group Members** FastTab, fill in the fields on the first line, as described in the following table.  

   |Field|Description|
   |-----|-----------|
   |**User Name**|Specify the user who takes part in a workflow.<br /><br /> The user must exist on the **User Setup** page. Learn more at [Assign Permissions to Users and Groups](ui-define-granular-permissions.md).|
   |**Sequence No.**|Specify the order in which the workflow user engages in a workflow relative to other users. This field can specify, for example, when the user approves relative to other approvers by setting up the **Workflow User Group** option in the **Approver Type** field on the related workflow response.|

   > [!NOTE]
   > Typically, sequence numbers are sequential for users in a workflow user group. However, multiple users can have the same sequence number. When that's the case, only one of the users must approve a request before the workflow goes to the next step. For example, if user A and user B are both number two in the sequence, the workflow goes to the step three when when either user A or user B approves the request.
6. Repeat step 5 to add more workflow users to the workflow user group.

# Intelligent insights and cloud migration (on-premises only)

If you're using [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, you have full access to scenarios that are based on the intelligent cloud. For example, key performance indicators (KPIs) that are based on machine learning, or when you view your data in Power BI.  

However, if you use [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, you don't have access to the same insights. If you want to benefit from online scenarios, you must migrate to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online. For more information, see [Migrating On-Premises Data to Business Central Online](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/migrate-data) in the administration content for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

## Viewing Insights in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Online

For an on-premises environment for which data was migrated to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, the **Intelligent Cloud Insights** page in the online environment shows four key points of interest for most businesses:

- Cash availability
- Sales profitability
- Net income
- Inventory value

Next to the KPI charts, you get insights into potential areas of concern, including overdue payments. Choose each insight to explore the data.  

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Intelligent cloud insights.](media/across-intelligent-cloud/intelligentcloudApril19.png "Shows the Intelligent Cloud Insights page in Business Central online")

The page also connects to Power BI for even more insights. Optionally, connect to Azure AI for even more intelligent insights. For more information, see [The Sales and Inventory Forecast Extension](ui-extensions-sales-forecast.md).

# Work with carbon credit  

When companies can't reduce their emissions for various reasons, they can purchase carbon credits to offset their emissions. By buying carbon credits, a company can still emit the equivalent amount of gases while remaining carbon neutral. These credits are purchased from specialized providers, incentivizing emission reductions.  

In general, carbon credits are permits that allow the owner to emit a certain amount of carbon dioxide (CO₂) or other greenhouse gases (GHGs). One carbon credit typically represents the right to emit one metric ton of CO₂ or an equivalent amount of another GHG, so it's important to enable this option for some organizations.  

## Set up the carbon credit  

Carbon Credit in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can be set as the **Item**. To set up the **Item** as a carbon credit, follow the steps:
  
1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, and then select the related link. 
2. [Create new item as explained](inventory-how-register-new-items.md).   
3. Once the item is created, select the **GHG Credit** field on the **Sustainability** FastTab and add the value of carbon credit using the **Carbon Credit Per UOM** field.

> [!NOTE]
> **Carbon Credit Per UOM** represents the amount of CO₂ in the unit of measure configured in the **Emission Unit of Measure Code** in the **Sustainability Setup**. So, this means the total value of carbon credit is the amount of credited CO₂ per one **Base Unit of Measure** of used item.  

> [!NOTE]
> You can set up any type of item, whether it's inventory, service, or non-inventory, as a carbon credit.  

## To purchase carbon credit 

### Purchase documents 

To work with any purchase-related documents, follow the steps:

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 3.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon and:  
   1. Enter **Purchase Invoices** if you want invoice as a **Document Type**, and then select the related link.  
   2. Enter **Purchase Orders** if you want order as a **Document Type**, and then select the related link.   
2. Populate the document header based on the following instruction [how to work with purchase invoices and orders](purchasing-how-record-purchases.md). 
3. Choose the item configured as a carbon credit in the **No.** field in the purchase document lines, and add appropriate **Quantity** and **Direct Unit Cost**. 
4. Add the **Sustainability Account No.** you would use for decreasing your carbon dioxide (CO₂) value. The system will automatically populate the value in the **Emission CO2** field based on the value you have configured in the **Carbon Credit Per UOM** field on the **Item** card.
5. Post the document.

> [!NOTE]
> Although carbon credit will decrease the value of entries, you'll see a positive amount of value in the **Emission CO2**. But once you post the document, you'll see a value with a negative sign in the **Sustainability Ledger Entry** with the **GHG Credit** as a **Document Type**.  

### Sustainability journals 

To work with **Sustainability Journal** follow these steps:  

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 3.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sustainability Journal**, and then select the related link. 
2. On the **Sustainability Journal** page, enter as many lines as you intend to post in the same batch.  
3. Choose the **GHG Credit** in the **Document Type** field.    
4. In the **Account No.** field, you can select only non-blocked sustainability accounts where the **Direct Posting** field is selected and the **Accounting Type** field is set to **Posting**. The accounts must also be configured with a category and a subcategory. Choose the appropriate account to post-carbon credits.
5. Select **Manual Input** and enter the value you want to post as a carbon credit to the **Emission CO2** field.  
6. Post the journal.

# Process purchase returns or cancellations

If you want to return items to your vendor or cancel services that you have purchased, then you can create and post a purchase credit memo that specifies the requested change with regard to the original purchase invoice. To include the correct purchase invoice information, you can create the purchase credit memo directly from the posted purchase invoice or you can create a new purchase credit memo with copied invoice information.

If you need more control of the purchase return process, such as warehouse documents for the item handling or better overview when shipping back items from multiple purchase documents with one purchase return, then you can create purchase return orders. A purchase return order automatically issues the related purchase credit memo. For more information, see [To create a purchase return order based on one or more a posted purchase documents](purchasing-how-process-purchase-returns-cancellations.md#to-create-a-purchase-credit-memo-from-a-posted-purchase-invoice).

> [!NOTE]  
> If a posted purchase invoice has not yet been paid, then you can use the **Correct** or **Cancel** functions on the posted purchase invoice to automatically reverse the involved transactions. These functions only work for unpaid invoices, and they do not support partial returns or cancellations. You can also not correct or cancel purchase invoices that were posted with with receipts from more than one purchase order. For more information, see [Correct or Cancel Unpaid Purchase Invoices](purchasing-how-correct-cancel-unpaid-purchase-invoices.md).

Typically, you create a purchase credit memo or purchase return order in reaction to a credit memo sent to you by a vendor. The purchase credit memo or purchase return order functions as your internal documentation of the credit memo process for accounting purposes or to control the shipping of the involved items.

The change might relate to all the products on the original purchase invoice or only to some of the products. Accordingly, you can partially return received items or demand partial reimbursement of received services. In that case, you must edit the information on the purchase credit memo or purchase return order.

In addition to the original posted purchase invoice, you can apply the purchase credit memo or purchase return order to other purchase documents, for example another posted purchase invoice because you're also returning items delivered with that invoice.

The credit memo posting will also revert any item charges that were assigned to the posted document, so that the item's value entries are the same as before the item charge was assigned.

## Inventory costing
To preserve correct inventory valuation, you typically want to pick return items from inventory at the unit cost that they were purchased at, not at their current unit cost. This is referred to as exact cost reversing.

Two functions exist to assign exact cost reversing automatically.  

|Function|Description|  
|------------------|---------------------------------------|  
|**Get Posted Document Lines to Reverse** function on the **Purchase Return Order** page|Copies lines of one or more posted documents to be reversed into the purchase return order. For more information, see [To create a purchase return order based on one or more posted purchase documents](purchasing-how-process-purchase-returns-cancellations.md#to-create-a-purchase-return-order-based-on-one-or-more-posted-purchase-documents).|  
|**Copy from Document** function in the **Purchase Credit Memo** and **Purchase Return Order** pages|Copies both the header and lines of one posted document to be reversed.<br /><br /> Requires that the **Exact Cost Reversing Mandatory** check box is selected on the **Purchases & Payables Setup** page.|

To assign exact cost reversing manually, you must choose the **Appl.-from Item Entry** field on any type of return document line, and then select the number of the original purchase entry. This links the purchase credit memo or purchase return order to the original purchase sales entry and ensures that the item is valued at the original unit cost.

For more information, see [Design Details: Inventory Costing](design-details-inventory-costing.md).

## To create a purchase credit memo from a posted purchase invoice

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Posted Purchase Invoices**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Posted Purchase Invoices** page, select the posted purchase invoice that you want to reverse, and then choose the **Create Corrective Credit Memo** action.

    Most fields on the purchase credit memo header are filled with the information from the posted purchase invoice. You can edit all the fields, for example with new information that reflects the return agreement.
3. Edit information on the lines according to the agreement, such as the number of items returned or the amount to be reimbursement.
4. Choose the **Apply Entries** action.
5. On the **Apply Vendor Entries** page, select the line with the posted purchase document that you want to apply the purchase credit memo to, and then choose the **Applies-to ID** action. The number of the purchase credit memo is inserted in the **Applies-to ID** field.
6. In the **Amount to Apply** field, enter the amount that you want to apply if smaller than the original amount.

    At the bottom of the **Apply Vendor Entries** page, you can see the total amount to apply to reverse all involved entries, namely when the value in the **Balance** field is zero.
7. Choose the **OK** button. When you post the purchase credit memo, it will be applied to the specified posted purchase documents.

    When you have created or edited the needed purchase credit memo lines and the single or multiple applications are specified, you can proceed to post the purchase credit memo.
8. Choose the **Post** action.

The posted purchase invoices that you apply the credit memo to are now reversed. If you have already paid the original invoice, the vendor should now refund the payment to you. If the credit memo is only for part of the product on the original invoice, you might only pay the remaining amount on the original purchase invoice to close it.

The purchase credit memo is removed and replaced with a new document in the list of posted purchase credit memos.

## To create a purchase credit memo by copying a posted purchase invoice

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Credit Memos**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action to open a new empty purchase credit memo.
3. In the **Vendor** field, enter the name of an existing vendor.
4. Choose the **Copy from Document** action.
5. On the **Copy Purchase Document** page, in the **Document Type** field, select **Posted Invoice**.
6. Choose the **Document No.** field to open the **Posted Purchase Invoices** page, and then select the posted purchase invoice that contains lines that you want to reverse.
7. Select the **Recalculate Lines** check box if you want the copied posted purchase invoice lines to be updated with any changes in item price and unit cost since the invoice was posted.
8. Choose the **OK** button. The copied invoice lines are inserted in the purchase credit memo.
9. Complete the purchase credit memo as explained in [To create a purchase credit memo from a posted purchase invoice](purchasing-how-process-purchase-returns-cancellations.md#to-create-a-purchase-credit-memo-from-a-posted-purchase-invoice).

## To create a purchase return order based on one or more posted purchase documents

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Return Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. Fill in the fields on the **General** FastTab as necessary.
4. On the **Lines** FastTab, fill the lines manually, or copy information from other documents to fill the lines automatically:

    - Use the **Get Posted Document Lines to Reverse** function to copy one or more posted document lines from one or more posted documents. This function always exactly reverses the costs from the posted document line. This function is described in the following steps.    
    - Use the **Copy from Document** function to copy an existing document to the return order. Use this function to copy the entire document. It can be either a posted document or a document that isn't yet posted. This function only enables exact cost reversing when the **Exact Cost Reversing Mandatory** check box is selected on the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page.  

5. Choose the **Get Posted Document Lines to Reverse** action.
6. At the top of the **Posted Purchase Document Lines** page, select the **Show Reversible Lines Only** check box if you want to see only lines that have quantities that haven't yet been returned. For example, if a posted purchase invoice quantity has already been returned, you might not want to include that quantity on a new purchase return document.

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  This field only works for posted receipts and posted invoice lines, not for posted return or posted credit memo lines.  

    At the left side of the page, the different document types are listed, and the number in brackets shows the number of documents available of each document type.

7. In the **Document Type Filter** field, select the type of posted document lines you would like to use.  
8. Select the lines that you would like to copy to the new document.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  If you use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd> to select all lines, all lines within the filter you have set are copied, but the **Show Reversible Quantity Only** filter is ignored. For example, suppose you have filtered the lines to a particular document number with two lines, one of which has already been returned. Even if the **Show Reversible Quantity Only** field is selected, if you select <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd> to copy all lines, both lines are copied, instead of only the one that has not yet been reversed.  

9. Choose the **OK** button to copy the lines to the new document.  

    The following processes occur:  

    - For posted document lines of the type **Item**, a new document line is created that is a copy of the posted document line, with the quantity that hasn't yet been reversed. The **Appl.-to Item Entry** field is filled in as appropriate with the number of the item ledger entry of the posted document line.  

    - For posted document lines that aren't of the type **Item**, such as item charges, a new document line is created that is a copy of the original posted document line.  

    - Calculates the **Unit Cost (LCY)** field on the new line from the costs on the corresponding item ledger entries.  

    - If the copied document is a posted shipment, posted receipt, posted return receipt, or posted return shipment, the unit price is calculated automatically from the item card.  

    - If the copied document is a posted invoice or credit memo, the unit price, invoice discounts, and line discounts from the posted document line are copied.  

    - If the posted document line contains item tracking lines, the **Appl.-to Item Entry** field on the item tracking lines is filled with the appropriate item ledger entry numbers from the posted item tracking lines.  

     When you copy from a posted invoice or posted credit memo, application copies any relevant invoice discounts and line discounts as valid at the time of posting that document from the posted document line to the new document line. Be aware, however, that if the **Calc. Inv. Discount** option is activated on the **Purchases & Payables Setup** page, then the invoice discount will be newly calculated when you post the new document line. The line amount for the new line might therefore be different than the line amount for the posted document line, depending on the new calculation of the invoice discount.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  If part of the quantity of the posted document line has already been reversed or sold or consumed, a line is created for only the quantity that remains in inventory or that has not been returned. If the full quantity of the posted document line has already been reversed, a new document line is not created.  
    >
    >  If the flow of goods in the posted document is the same as the flow of goods in the new document, a copy of the original posted document line in the new document is created. The **Appl.-from Item Entry** field is not filled in because, in this case, exact cost reversing is not possible. For example, if you use the **Get Posted Document Lines to Reverse** function to get a posted purchase credit memo line for a new purchase credit memo, only the original posted credit memo line is copied to the new credit memo.  

10. On the **Purchase Return Order** page, in the **Return Reason Code** field on each line, select the reason for the return.
11. Choose the **Post** action.

## To create a replacement purchase order from a purchase return order

You might agree with your vendor that they compensate you for a purchased item by replacing the item. The replacement item can be the same or it can be different. This situation could occur if the vendor mistakenly shipped the wrong item.  

1.  On the **Purchase Return Order** page for an active return process, on an empty line, make a negative entry for the replacement item by inserting a negative amount in the **Quantity** field.  
2. Choose the **Move Negative Lines** action.  
3. On the **Move Negative Purchase Lines** page, fill in the fields as necessary.
4. Choose the **OK** button. The negative line is deleted from the purchase return order, and a new purchase order is created. For more information, see [Record Purchases](purchasing-how-record-purchases.md).  

## To create a purchase allowance

If you receive items from your vendor that aren't what you wanted, for example, if they're slightly damaged, the wrong color or the wrong size, the vendor might offer you a purchase allowance.  

You can post this reduced purchase cost as an item charge on a credit memo or return order and link it to the posted receipt. The following describes it for a purchase return order, but the same steps apply to a purchase credit memo.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Credit Memos**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action to open a new empty purchase credit memo.  
3. Fill in the credit memo header with information about the vendor who sent you the purchase allowance.  
4. On the **Lines** FastTab, in the **Type** field, select **Charge (Item)**.  
5. In the **No.** field, select the appropriate item charge value.  

    You might want to create a special item charge number to cover purchase allowances.  
6. In the **Quantity** field, enter **1**.  
7. In the **Direct Unit Cost** field, enter the amount of the purchase allowance.  
8. Assign the purchase allowance as an item charge to the items in the posted receipt. For more information, see [Use Item Charges to Account for Additional Trade Costs](payables-how-assign-item-charges.md). When you have assigned the allowance, return to the **Purchase Credit Memo** page.

When you post the purchase return order, the purchase allowance is added to the relevant purchase entry amount. In this way, you can maintain accurate inventory valuation.  

## To combine return shipments

If you want to return items covered by different purchase return orders to the same vendor, then you can use the **Combine Return Shipments** function.  

When you ship the items, you post the related purchase return orders as shipped and this creates posted purchase return shipments.  

When you're ready to invoice these items, instead of invoicing each purchase return order separately, you can create a purchase credit memo and automatically copy the posted purchase return shipment lines to this document. Then you can post the purchase credit memo and conveniently invoice all the open purchase return orders at the same time.  

When return shipments are combined on a credit memo and posted, then a posted purchase credit memo is created for the invoiced lines. The **Quantity Invoiced** field on the originating purchase return order is updated based on the invoiced quantity. However, this original purchase return order isn't deleted, even if it has been fully received and invoiced, and you must therefore delete the purchase return order manually.

> [!NOTE]  
> The following procedure assumes that there are several purchase return orders for the vendor, and that they have been posted as shipped.     

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Credit Memos**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. On the **General** FastTab, fill in the fields as necessary.  
4. Choose the **Get Return Shipment Lines** action.  
5. Select multiple return shipment lines that you want to include in the invoice.  

    If an incorrect return shipment line was selected or you want to start over, you can just delete the lines on the purchase credit memo and then use the **Get Return Shipment Lines** function again.  
6. Choose the **Post** action.  

### To remove open purchase return orders after combined return shipment posting  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Delete Invoiced Purchase Return Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary, and then choose the **OK** button.  
3. Alternatively, delete the individual purchase return orders manually.

# Sales by Location (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Sales by Location** report provides an overview of sales performance at locations. It showcases key metrics such as total sales amount, total quantity sold, and cost of goods sold. You can break down the metrics further by specific items sold at each location.

:::image type="content" source="media/powerbi/sales/sales-by-location.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Sales by Location Power BI report" lightbox="media/powerbi/sales/sales-by-location.png":::

## Use the report

Leadership and management teams use the report to help them track revenue and cost breakdown per location. The report is valuable for any organization that operates across multiple locations.

For COOs of retail companies with multiple warehouse locations, it's important to have a high-level view of the sales performance of each location. The overview can help you make informed decisions about resource allocation and expansion plans. You can quickly view the total revenue generated by each location and identify under-performing locations. This information helps you make better decisions about resource allocation to ensure that the organization is operating efficiently and effectively across all locations.

Regional managers who oversee several warehouse locations can track revenue and cost breakdown per location, identify areas for improvement, and adjust sales strategies. Analyze the total sales amount, quantity sold, cost of goods sold, and gross profit for each location to find out which locations perform well and which ones need improvement.

## Key performance indicators

The report includes the following key performance indicators (KPIs) and measures:

- **[Sales Amount](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#sales-amount)**  
- **[Sales Quantity](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#sales-quantity)**  
- **[Cost Amount](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#cost-amount)**  
- **[Cost Amount Non-Inv](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#cost-amount-non-inv)**  
- **[Gross Profit](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#gross-profit)**  
- **[Gross Profit Margin](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#gross-profit-margin)**

[!INCLUDE[click-on-a-kpi-link](includes/click-on-a-kpi-link.md)] 

[!INCLUDE[powerbi-tip-track-kpis](includes/powerbi-tip-track-kpis.md)]

# Design Details: Central Concepts of the Planning System

The planning functions are contained in a batch project that first selects the relevant items and period to plan for. Then, according to each item's low-level code (BOM position), the batch job calls a code unit that calculates a supply plan. The code unit balances supply-demand sets and suggests actions for the user to take. The suggested actions appear as lines in the planning worksheet or the requisition worksheet.  

![Contents of the Planning Worksheets page.](media/design_details_central_concepts_of_the_planning_system_planning_worksheets.png "Contents of the Planning Worksheets page")  

The planner of a company, such as a purchaser or a production planner, is presumed to be the user of the planning system. The planning system assists the user by performing the extensive but rather straightforward calculations of a plan. The user can then concentrate on solving the more difficult problems, such as when things differ from normal.  

The planning system is driven by anticipated and actual customer demand, such as forecast and sales orders. Planning calculations suggest actions you can take regarding supply from vendors, assembly or production, or transfers from other warehouses. An example of a suggested action could be to create new supply orders, such as purchase or production orders. If supply orders already exist, the suggested actions could be to increase or expedite orders to meet changes in demand.  

Another goal of the planning system is to ensure that the inventory does not grow unnecessarily. If demand decreases, the planning system will suggest that the user postpones, decreases quantity, or cancels existing supply orders.  

A code unit contains the planning logic and the following functions:

* MRP and MPS
* Calculate Net Change Plan
* Calculate Regenerative Plan

However, the supply plan calculation involves different sub-systems.  

The planning system doesn't include dedicated logic for capacity leveling or fine scheduling. Those types of scheduling work are done separately. The lack of direct integration between the two areas also means that substantial capacity or schedule changes will require you to rerun planning.  

## Planning parameters

The planning parameters that you set for an item or a group of items control which actions the planning system will suggest in various situations. Define planning parameters for each item to control when, how much, and how to replenish.  

You can also define planning parameters for any combination of item, variant, and location by setting up a stock-keeping unit (SKU) for each combination, and then specifying individual parameters. Learn more at [Design Details: Handling Reordering Policies](design-details-handling-reordering-policies.md) and [Design Details: Planning Parameters](design-details-planning-parameters.md).  

## Planning starting date

The planning system helps you avoid having open orders in the past and suggested actions that aren't possible. Planning treats all dates before the starting date as a frozen zone. The following rule applies to the frozen zone:  

* All supply and demand before the starting date of the planning period is considered part of inventory or shipped. In other words, it assumes that the plan for the past runs according to the given plan. Learn more at [Process orders before the planning start date](design-details-balancing-demand-and-supply.md#process-orders-before-the-planning-start-date).  

## Dynamic order tracking (pegging)

Dynamic order tracking and its simultaneous creation of action messages in the planning worksheet isn't a part of the supply planning system. When a demand or supply is created or changed, dynamic order tracking links the demand and the quantities to cover it in real time.  

For example, if you enter or change a sales order, dynamic order tracking instantly searches for supply to cover the demand. The supply could be from inventory or from an expected supply order (such as a purchase order or a production order). When it finds a supply source, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] links the demand and supply. You access the link on view-only pages from the document lines. When supply can't be found, the dynamic order tracking system creates action messages in the planning worksheet with supply plan suggestions.  

Dynamic order tracking helps you assess whether to accept supply order suggestions. From the supply side, it shows the demand that created the supply. From the demand side, it identifies the supply that should cover the demand.  

:::image type="content" source="media/nav_app_supply_planning_1_dynamic_order_tracking.png" alt-text="Example of dynamic order tracking.":::

Learn more at [Design Details: Reservation, Order Tracking, and Action Messaging](design-details-reservation-order-tracking-and-action-messaging.md).  

In companies with a low item flow and less advanced product structures, it might be enough to use dynamic order tracking for supply planning. However, in busier environments, the planning system should be used to ensure a properly balanced supply plan.  

### Dynamic order tracking versus the planning system

It might be hard to differentiate between the planning system and dynamic order tracking. Both features display output in the planning worksheet by suggesting actions that the planner should take. However, the way this output is produced differs.  

The planning system deals with the entire supply and demand pattern of an item. It considers all levels of the BOM hierarchy along the timeline. Dynamic order tracking only addresses the situation of the order that activated it. When balancing demand and supply, the planning system creates links in a user-activated batch mode. Dynamic order tracking creates the links automatically when you enter a demand or a supply. For example, when you create a sales or purchase order.  

Dynamic order tracking links demand and supply on a first-come-first-served basis when you enter data. This basis can lead to disorder in priorities. For example, a sales order entered first with a due date next month might be linked to the supply in inventory. The next sales order due tomorrow may cause an action message to create a new purchase order to cover it. The following image shows this scenario.  

:::image type="content" source="media/nav_app_supply_planning_1_dynamic_order_tracking_graph.png" alt-text="Example of order tracking in supply planning 1.":::

The planning system deals with demand and supply for items in a prioritized order. The order is prioritized according to due dates and order types. That is, on a first-needed-first-served basis. It deletes all order tracking links that were created dynamically and re-establishes them according to due date priority. When the planning system has run, it has solved all imbalances between demand and supply, as illustrated below for the same data.

:::image type="content" source="media/nav_app_supply_planning_1_planning_graph.png" alt-text="Example of order tracking in supply planning 2.":::  

After you run planning, the Action Message Entry table doesn't contain any action messages. Those messages are replaced by the actions suggested in the planning worksheet. Learn more at [Order Tracking Links during Planning](design-details-balancing-demand-and-supply.md#serial-and-lot-numbers-are-loaded-by-specification-level).  

## Sequence and priority in planning

The sequence of the calculations in your plan is important for getting the project done in a reasonable amount of time. The prioritization of requirements and resources also plays an important role in getting the best results.  

The planning system is demand-driven. High-level items should be planned before low-level items because they might generate demand for lower-level items. For example, plan retail locations before distribution centers because the retail location might include demand from the distribution center. On a detailed balancing level, if a released supply order can cover a sales order the system shouldn't create a new supply order. A supply with a specific lot number shouldn't be allocated to cover a generic demand if another demand requires this specific lot.  

### Item priority / low-level code

In a manufacturing environment, the demand for a finished, sellable item will result in derived demand for components that comprise the finished item. The bill-of-material structure controls the component structure and can cover several levels of semi-finished items. Planning an item at one level will cause derived demand for components at the next level. This hierarchy will eventually result in derived demand for purchased items. The planning system plans for items in order of their ranking in the total BOM hierarchy. The system starts with finished sellable items at the top level and continues down the product structure to the lower-level items (according to the low-level code).  

The following image shows the sequence in which [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] suggests supply orders at the top level. It assumes the suggestions were accepted and shows lower-level items as well.

:::image type="content" source="media/nav_app_supply_planning_1_bom_planning.png" alt-text="Planning for bills of material.":::

To learn more about manufacturing considerations, go to [Load inventory profiles](design-details-balancing-demand-and-supply.md#load-inventory-profiles).  

#### Optimizing performance for low-level calculations

Low-level code calculations can affect system performance. To reduce the effect, you can turn off the **Dynamic low-level code calculation** toggle on the **Manufacturing Setup** page. When you do, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] suggests that you create a recurrent job queue entry to update low-level codes daily. You can ensure that the job will run outside working hours by specifying a start time in the **Earliest Start Date/Time** field.

You can also speed up low-level code calculations by turning on the **Optimize low-level code calculation** toggle on the **Manufacturing Setup** page.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you choose to optimize performance, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will use new calculation methods to determine low-level codes. If you have an extension that relies on the events used by the old calculations, the extension might stop working.

### Locations / transfer-level priority

Companies with more than one location might need to plan for each location individually. For example, an item's safety stock level and its reordering policy might differ from one location to another. You must specify the planning parameters per item and location.  

You can use SKUs to specify individual planning parameters. An SKU can be regarded as an item at a specific location. If you haven't defined a SKU for that location, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will use the parameters set on the item card. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates a plan for active locations only, where there's demand or supply for a given item.  

Any item can be handled at any location, but [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] has a strict approach to the concept of locations. For example, a sales order for an item at one location can't be fulfilled by stock from another location. The quantity on stock must first be transferred to the location specified on the sales order.

:::image type="content" source="media/nav_app_supply_planning_1_sku_planning.png" alt-text="Planning for stock-keeping units.":::

Learn more at [Design Details: Transfers in Planning](design-details-transfers-in-planning.md).  

### Order priority

Within a given SKU, the requested or available date represents the highest priority; the demand of today should be dealt with before the demand of the coming days. But apart from this kind of priority, the different demand and supply types are sorted according to business importance to decide which demand should be satisfied first. On the supply side, the order priority determines the source of supply to apply first. Learn more at [Prioritize orders](design-details-balancing-demand-and-supply.md#prioritize-orders).  

## Demand forecasts and blanket orders

Forecasts and blanket orders both represent anticipated demand. The blanket order, which covers a customer's intended purchases over a specific period of time, acts to lessen the uncertainty of the overall forecast. The blanket order is a customer-specific forecast on top of the unspecified forecast, as illustrated in the following image.  

:::image type="content" source="media/nav_app_supply_planning_1_forecast_and_blanket.png" alt-text="Planning with forecasts.":::

Learn more at [Forecast Demand is Reduced by Sales Orders](design-details-balancing-demand-and-supply.md#forecast-demand-is-reduced-by-sales-orders).  

## Planning assignment

All items should be replanned for when the demand or supply pattern has changed since the last time a plan was calculated. For example, if you enter a new sales order or change an existing one, recalculate the plan. Other reasons for replanning include a change in forecast or safety stock quantity. Changing a bill-of-material by adding or removing a component would most likely also indicate a change, but for the component item only.  

The planning system monitors such events and assigns the appropriate items for planning.  

For multiple locations, the assignment happens at the item level per location combination. If a sales order has been created at only one location, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] assigns the item at that location for planning.  

The reason for selecting items for planning is a matter of system performance. If an item's demand-supply pattern hasn't changed, the planning system won't suggest any actions to take. Without the planning assignment, the system would have to perform the calculations for all items to find out what to plan for. To learn more about the reasons to assign items for planning, go to [Design Details: Planning Assignment Table](design-details-planning-assignment-table.md).  

The following are the planning options that are available:  

* **Calculate Regenerative Plan** calculates all selected items, whether it's necessary or not.  
* **Calculate Net Change Plan** calculates only the items that have had a change in their demand and supply pattern and, therefore, have been assigned for planning.  

Some people believe that net change planning should be performed on the fly, for example, when sales orders are entered. However, planning on the fly could be confusing because dynamic order tracking and action messaging are also calculated on the fly. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers real-time available-to-promise control. It provides pop–up warnings when you enter sales orders and the current supply plan can't fulfill the demand.  

The planning system only plans for the items that you've prepared with appropriate planning parameters. Otherwise, it assumes that you'll plan the items manually or semi-automatically by using the Order Planning feature. To learn more about the automatic planning procedures, go to [Design Details: Balancing Demand and Supply](design-details-balancing-demand-and-supply.md).  

## Item dimensions

Demand and supply can carry variant codes and location codes that must be respected when the planning system balances demand and supply.  

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] treats variant and location codes as item dimensions on a sales order line, inventory ledger entry, and so on. Accordingly, it calculates a plan for each combination of variant and location as if the combination were a separate item number.  

Instead of calculating theoretical combinations of variant and location, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates only the combinations that actually exist in the database. To learn more about how the planning system deals with location codes on demand, go to [Design Details: Demand at Blank Location](design-details-balancing-demand-and-supply.md).  

## Item attributes

Items often have general attributes, such as am item number, variant code, location code, and type of order. However, each demand and supply event can have other specifications, such as serial or lot numbers. The planning system plans these attributes in certain ways depending on their level of specification.  

An order-to-order link between demand and supply is another type of attribute that affects the planning system. Learn more at [Order-to-order links](#order-to-order-links).

### Specific attributes

Some demand attributes are specific and a supply must match them exactly.

* Serial or lot numbers that require specific application (These attributes are required if you turn on the **SN Specific Tracking** or **Lot Specific Tracking** toggle on the **Item Tracking Code Card** page for the item tracking code that is used by the item.)  
* Links to supply orders created manually or automatically for a specific demand (order-to-order links).  

The planning system applies the following rules to these attributes:  

* Demand with specific attributes can only be fulfilled by supply with matching attributes.  
* Supply with specific attributes can also satisfy demand that doesn't specifically require those attributes.  

If inventory or projected supplies can't meet a demand for specific attributes, the planning system suggests a new supply order without regarding planning parameters.  

### Non-specific attributes

Serial or lot-numbered items without a specific item tracking setup might have non-specific serial or lot numbers. These types of numbers can be applied to any serial or lot number. The planning system has more freedom to match, for example, a serialized demand with a serialized supply, typically in inventory.  

Demand-supply with serial or lot numbers, specific or non-specific, are high priority and are exempt from the frozen zone. They'll be part of planning even if they're due before the planning starting date. Learn more at [Serial and lot numbers are loaded by specification level](design-details-balancing-demand-and-supply.md#serial-and-lot-numbers-are-loaded-by-specification-level).

To learn more about how the planning system balances attributes, go to [Serial and lot numbers and order-to-order links are exempt from the previous period](design-details-balancing-demand-and-supply.md#serial-and-lot-numbers-and-order-to-order-links-are-exempt-from-the-previous-period).  

## Order-to-order links

Order-to-order means that you purchase, assemble, or produce an item for a specific demand. There are several reasons to choose this policy:

* The demand is infrequent.
* The lead-time is insignificant.
* The required attributes vary.  

Another case that uses order-to-order links is when an assembly order is linked to a sales order in an assemble-to-order scenario.  

Order-to-order links are applied between demand and supply in four ways:  

* When the planned item uses the **Order** reordering policy  
* When you use the make-to-order manufacturing policy to create multi-level or project-type production orders (producing components on the same production order)  
* When you create production orders for sales orders with the sales order planning feature  
* When you assemble an item to a sales order (**Assembly Policy** is set to **Assemble-to-Order**)  

The planning system suggests that you only order the required quantity. The purchase, production, or assembly order continues to match the demand. For example, if a sales order is changed in time or quantity, the planning system suggests that you change the supply order accordingly.  

When order-to-order links exist, the planning system doesn't involve linked supply or inventory in the balancing procedure. Planners can decide whether to use the linked supply or a new demand. In the latter case, they can delete the supply order or manually reserve the linked supply.  

Reservations and order tracking links break if a situation becomes impossible. For example, when moving the demand to a date that's earlier than the supply. Order-to-order links adapt to changes in the demand or supply and never break.  

## Reservations

The planning system doesn't include reserved quantities in calculations. For example, if a quantity for a sales order is fully or partially reserved, you can't use the quantity to cover other demand.

The planning system does include reserved quantities in the projected inventory profile. It must consider all quantities to determine when the reorder point has passed and how many to reorder to reach the maximum inventory level. Unnecessary reservations can increase the risk that inventory levels run low because the planning logic doesn't detect reserved quantities.  

The following image shows how reservations can hinder planning.  

:::image type="content" source="media/nav_app_supply_planning_1_reservations.png" alt-text="Planning with reservations.":::

Learn more at [Design Details: Reservation, Order Tracking, and Action Messaging](design-details-reservation-order-tracking-and-action-messaging.md).  

## Warnings

The first column in the planning worksheet is for the warning fields. A warning icon displays when you create a planning line for an unusual situation.  

Supply on planning lines with warnings typically won't be modified according to planning parameters. Instead, the planning system suggests a supply to cover the exact quantity of the demand. However, the system can be set up to respect planning parameters for planning lines with certain warnings. The warning information is shown on the **Untracked Planning Elements** page, which also shows order tracking links to non-order network entities. There are three types of warnings:  

* Emergency  
* Exception  
* Attention  

:::image type="content" source="media/nav_app_supply_planning_1_warnings.png" alt-text="Warnings in the planning worksheet.":::

### Emergency

The emergency warning displays in two situations:  

* When the inventory is negative on the planning starting date  
* When back-dated supply or demand events exist  

If an item's inventory is negative on the planning starting date, the planning system suggests an emergency supply for the negative quantity to arrive on the planning starting date. The warning text states the starting date and the quantity of the emergency order. Learn more at [Handling Projected Negative Inventory](design-details-handling-reordering-policies.md#handling-projected-negative-inventory).  

Document lines with due dates before the planning starting date are consolidated into an emergency supply order. The order is planned to arrive on the planning starting date.  

### Exception

The exception warning is displayed if the projected available inventory drops below the safety stock quantity. The planning system will suggest a supply order to meet the demand on its due date. The warning text states the item's safety stock quantity and the date on which it is violated.  

Violating the safety stock level is an exception. It shouldn't happen if the reorder point is set correctly. Learn more at [The Role of the Reorder Point](design-details-handling-reordering-policies.md#the-role-of-the-reorder-point).  

Exception order proposals help ensure that the projected available inventory is never lower than the safety stock level. The proposed quantity covers the safety stock, without considering planning parameters. However, in some scenarios, order modifiers will be considered.  

> [!NOTE]

### Attention

The attention warning is displayed in three situations:  

* The planning starting date is earlier than the work date.  
* The planning line suggests changing a released purchase or production order.  
* The projected inventory exceeds the overflow level on the due date. Learn more at [Stay below the overflow level](design-details-handling-reordering-policies.md#stay-below-the-overflow-level).  

> [!NOTE]  
> In planning lines with warnings, the **Accept Action Message** field is not selected because the planner is expected to investigate the lines before carrying out the plan.  

## Error logs

On the **Calculate Plan** request page, you can select the **Stop and Show First Error** field to have the planning run stop when it encounters the first error. A message is displayed with information about the error. If an error exists, the planning worksheet will show only the planning lines that were successfully made before the error happened.  

If the field isn't selected, the **Calculate Plan** batch job will continue until it has completed. Errors won't interrupt the batch job. If there are errors, a message states how many items were affected. The **Planning Error Log** page provides more details about the error and links to the affected documents or setups.

## Planning flexibility

It isn't always practical to plan an existing supply order. For example, when production has started or you hire extra people on a specific day to do the project. To indicate whether the planning system can change an order, all supply order lines have a **Planning Flexibility** field with two options: **Unlimited** or **None**. If the field is set to **None**, the planning system won't try to change the supply order line.  

You can manually choose an option in the field, however, in some cases it'll be set automatically by [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The fact that you can manually set planning flexibility is important because it makes it easy to adapt the use of the feature to different workflows and business cases. To learn more about how this field is used, go to [Design Details: Transfers in Planning](design-details-transfers-in-planning.md).  

## Order planning

The basic supply planning tool represented by the **Order Planning** page is designed for manual decision making. It doesn't consider any planning parameters and is therefore not discussed further in this article. Learn more at [Plan for New Demand Order by Order](production-how-to-plan-for-new-demand.md).  

> [!NOTE]  
> We recommend that you don't use order planning if your company already uses the planning or requisition worksheets. Supply orders created through the **Order Planning** page may be changed or deleted during the automated planning runs. These changes happen because the automated planning run uses planning parameters that you might not have considered when you manually made the plan in the Order Planning page.  

## Finite loading

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides a rough-cut schedule to plan reasonable use of resources. It doesn't automatically create and maintain detailed schedules based on priorities or optimization rules.  

The intended use of the capacity-constrained resource feature is as follows:

* To avoid overloading resources
* To ensure that capacity isn't left unallocated if it could decrease the turn-around time of a production order

When planning with capacity-constrained resources, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] ensures that resources aren't loaded above their capacity (critical load). It assigns each operation to the nearest available time slot. If the time slot isn't large enough to complete the operation, it splits the operation into two or more parts in the nearest available time slots.  

> [!NOTE]  
> In case of operation splitting, the set-up time is only assigned one time because it's assumed that some manual adjustment is done to optimize the schedule.  

You can add dampener time to resources to minimize operation splitting. This time lets [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] schedule the load on the last possible day by slightly exceeding the critical load percent.
