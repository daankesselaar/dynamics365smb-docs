# Reverse Output Posting

There are times when output posting must be reversed. An example of this would be if a data entry error occurred and an incorrect amount of output is posted to a production order.  

## To reverse an output posting

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Output Journal**, and then choose the related link. Select your batch.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. For more information, see [Batch Post Output and Run Times](production-how-to-post-output-quantity.md).
3. In the **Applies-To Entry** field, select the associated item ledger entry. This reverses the capacity and item ledger entries.  
4. Post the reversal by posting the journal.  

The output journal entries are posted to the item ledger as a positive adjustment.

# Reconcile inventory costs with the general ledger

When you post inventory transactions, such as sales shipments, purchase invoices, or inventory adjustments, the changed item costs are recorded in item value entries. To reflect this change of inventory value in your financial books, the inventory costs also need to be posted to the related inventory accounts in the general ledger, such as the inventory account, adjustment account, and COGS account in the general ledger.

Unless you have selected the **Automatic Cost Posting** check box in the **Inventory Setup** window, inventory costs aren't recorded dynamically in the general ledger, and COGS isn't calculated with a sale. Therefore, you must post to the general ledger manually by running the **Post Inventory Cost to G/L** batch job to update the general ledger and potentially print a report of the value entries that are posted.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Before you use this batch job, you should run the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job. This ensures that, when you run this batch job, the costs that will be posted to the general ledger are up to date. This is referred to as cost adjustment. For more information, see [Adjust Item Costs](inventory-how-adjust-item-costs.md).

## To post inventory costs manually

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Post Inventory Cost to G/L**, and then choose the related link.

2. Post inventory costs to the general ledger manually by running the batch job. When you run this batch job, general ledger entries are created on the basis of value entries. To calculate the value to post, it uses the difference between the **Cost Amount (Actual)** field and the **Cost Posted to G/L** field in the value entries. If you have selected the **Expected Cost Posting to G/L** checkbox on the **Inventory Setup** page, the batch job also posts the difference between the **Cost Amount (Expected)** field and the **Exp. Cost Posted to G/L** field to interim accounts in the general ledger. You can post the entries so that they are summarized per posting group.

|Option  |Description  |
|--------------|---------|
|**Posting Method**|The batch job can either post inventory value to the general ledger per posting group or per posted entry. If you post per entry, you achieve a detailed specification of how the inventory affects the general ledger, but you also get numerous G/L entries. If you post per posting group, the batch job creates a general ledger entry per posting date per posting group combination. This means that a general ledger entry is created for each combination of posting date, general business posting group, general product posting group, inventory posting group, and location code. In addition, the batch job creates separate general ledger entries for costs with different signs.|
|**Document No.**|In this field, you can enter a document number if you have chosen the *Post per Inventory Posting Group* option. The document number appears on posted entries.|
|**Post**|Select this field if you want the batch job to post to the general ledger automatically. If you don't choose to post the inventory cost to G/L, the batch job will only print a test report showing the values that can be posted to the general ledger, and on the report will appear: **Test Report (not posted)**.|

> [!NOTE]  
> When you run this batch job, you might encounter errors having to do with missing setup or incompatible dimension setup. If the batch job encounters errors in the dimension setup, it overrides these errors and uses the dimensions of the value entry. For any other errors, the batch job skips posting the value entries and lists them at the end of the report in a section titled “Skipped Entries.” To post these entries, you must fix the errors.
> For example if you have not selected the **Expected Cost Posting to G/L** check box in the **Inventory Setup** window, then the last section of the report will list value entries that are skipped because they represent expected costs.

To see a list of errors before running the posting batch job, you can run the **Post Invt. Cost to G/L - Test** report. The test report lists all the errors encountered during a test posting. You can then fix the errors, and run the inventory cost posting batch job without skipping any entries.

If you would like to get an overview of what values could be posted to the general ledger without actually performing the posting, you can run the **Post Inventory Cost to G/L** batch job without actually posting the values to the general ledger. You do this by clearing the check mark from the **Post** field on the request page. This way, when you run the batch job, the report is produced showing the values that are ready to be posted to the general ledger, but they aren't posted.

## To audit the reconciliation between the inventory ledger and the general ledger

The **Inventory - G/L Reconciliation** page provides the following:

- Exposes reconciliation differences by comparing what is recorded in G/L and what is recorded in the inventory ledger (value entries).
- Displays unreconciled cost amounts in the value entries in the inventory ledger as if they were mapped to corresponding inventory-related accounts in G/L and compares those to the totals recorded in the same accounts in G/L.
- Reflects the double entry structure of G/L by visually presenting data as such. For example, a COGS entry has a corresponding inventory entry.
- Lets users drill down and see the entries that make up the cost amounts.
- Includes filters to narrow the analysis by date, item, and location.
- Explains reasons for reconciliation differences in informative messages.


The **Name** column on the far left in the grid lists the various G/L account types that are associated with inventory.

The **Inventory**, **Inventory (Interim)**, and **WIP Inventory** columns show the invoiced, non-invoiced, and WIP totals of each G/L account type. These are calculated from value entries, that is, they're projected onto the G/L account types where they'll end when they're eventually posted to G/L.

The **Total** column shows the sum (in bold font) of the value entry amounts in the three inventory columns.

The **G/L Total** column shows the amounts (in bold font) for each G/L account type that exists in G/L. These are calculated from G/L entries, that is, they represent inventory costs already posted to G/L.

The **Difference** column represents the difference between the value in the **G/L Total** and **Total** fields.

In the top of the **Inventory - G/L Reconciliation** page, you can enter filters to limit, for example, the period of time for which you want information.

If you select the **Show Warning** check box and if there are any discrepancies between the inventory totals and G/L totals, application shows messages in the **Warning** field of the grid that explain the discrepancy. If you choose the Warning field, application gives you more information on what the warning means.

When you have entered all relevant filters, choose the **Show Matrix** action. The data is calculated and the matrix page appears.

On the far left column in the grid, you see the various general ledger account types that are associated with inventory. The grid then shows the invoiced, non-invoiced (interim), and WIP inventory totals for each of these account types. These totals are calculated from the value entries.

The next columns show the totals for the same account types calculated from the general ledger entries.

Choose the  amount in any of the total fields to see the inventory report entries that were used to calculate the totals. For inventory totals, the inventory report entries are the sums of the value entries for the items. For the G/L totals, the inventory report entries are the sums from the general ledger entries.

## Reporting Costs and Reconciling with the General Ledger
Other reports, tracing functions, and a special reconciliation tool are available to the auditor or controller responsible for reporting a correct and balanced inventory value to the finance department.

The following table describes them.    

|**To**|**See**|  
|------------|-------------|  
|View the inventory value of selected items, including information about the quantities and values of increases and decreases in inventory over a selected period.|**Inventory Valuation** report|  
|View the inventory value of selected production orders in your WIP (work in process) inventory, such as the quantities and values of consumption, capacity usage, and output in ongoing production orders.|**Inventory Valuation - WIP** report|  
|View the inventory value of selected items, including their actual and expected cost on the date specified.|**Invt. Valuation - Cost Spec.** report|  
|Use a report to analyze the reasons for cost variances or to gain insight into the cost shares of sold items (COGS).|**Cost Shares Breakdown** report|

# Setting up finance

Before you can begin to run your business, you must specify how you want to manage company finance processes. First, you set up the core of the company's accounting records: the chart of accounts (COA). Then you set up posting groups, which make the process of assigning default general ledger posting accounts to customers, vendors, and items more efficient.

Some finance setup can be done automatically with assisted setup guides, and some must be done manually. Learn more at [Getting Ready for Doing Business](ui-get-ready-business.md). The **General Ledger Setup** page specifies how to handle of your company's different accounting processes. For example, use this page to specify invoice rounding details, the currency code for your local currency, address formats, and whether you want to use an additional reporting currency. Learn more at [Understanding the General Ledger and the Chart of Accounts](finance-general-ledger.md).  

You can use dimensions to add different types of information to every transaction. You can set up your company's basic dimensions, such as *Projects* and *Departments*. Later, add more dimensions when you need them. For example, you can set up temporary dimensions to use for a limited time period, such during a sales campaign. Learn more at [Working with Dimensions](finance-dimensions.md).

Many of the setup tasks must be completed before you can begin recording financial transactions, but most settings can be adjusted as needed. That said, there are optional setup tasks as well. For example, you need only set-up intercompany postings and consolidations if you're working with multiple companies. And other setup tasks, such as specifying the period during which posting is allowed, might have to be repeated periodically.  

The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the articles that describe them.

# Expected Capacity Need (Power BI report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Expected Capacity Need** report provides insights into the capacity you expect to require for each work center. It helps manufacturing managers plan production orders and allocate resources efficiently to meet production demands.

:::image type="content" source="media/manufacturing/expected-capacity-need-v26.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Expected Capacity Need Power BI Report" lightbox="media/manufacturing/expected-capacity-need-v26.png":::

## Use the report

The report is meant for manufacturing managers and supervisors.

Manufacturing managers use the report to view the expected capacity needs of each work center. The data can help you allocate resources efficiently to meet production demands. This report shows the backlog of production orders and the work center availability to meet the demands. You can further break down production orders to see which orders are scheduled for each work center group and take actions to handle the expected capacity need.

Production supervisors use this report to understand the workload on your work center group, and take action to handle the expected capacity need. The report provides insights into the expected capacity need, capacity used, and capacity used variance. These insights help you optimize the use of resources.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The *Expected Capacity Need* report includes the following KPIs and measures:

- [Prod Order Expected Capacity Need](manufacturing-powerbi-kpis.md#prod-order-expected-capacity-need)
- [Prod Order Actual Capacity Need](manufacturing-powerbi-kpis.md#prod-order-actual-capacity-need)
- [Prod Order Capacity Need Dev %](manufacturing-powerbi-kpis.md#prod-order-capacity-need-dev-percent)

# Merge duplicate records

Over time, as different people create new customers, vendors, or contacts, or you create new records during data migration, there's a risk that you duplicate records. If you find a duplicate, you can use the **Merge Duplicate** page from the card of the record that you want to keep. The page gives you an overview of duplicated field values and lets you select which values to keep or discard when you merge two records into one.

> [!NOTE]
> Only users with the MERGE DUPLICATES permission set can use this functionality.

> [!TIP]
> The **Merge Duplicate** page shows all fields where the values are different for the two records being compared. Therefore, if the page shows only a few fields, it might indicate a duplicate. If the page shows many fields, the record probably isn't a duplicate.

The following procedure is based on a customer card. The steps are similar for a vendor and contact cards.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customers**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the customer that you know or suspect that a duplicate record exists for, and then choose the **Edit** action.
3. On the **Customer Card** page, choose the **Merge With** action.
4. On the **Merge Duplicate** page, in the **Merge With** field, select the customer that you believe is a duplicate of the one you opened, which shows in the **Current** field.

    The **Fields** FastTab lists fields where the values are different for the two customers. This means that if the selected customer is really a duplicate, then only few fields should be listed, such as typing errors and other data entry mistakes.

    The **Related Tables** FastTab lists tables where there are fields with a relation to both customers. The **Current Count** and **Duplicate Count** fields show the number of fields in related tables where the **No.** value of both the current and the duplicate customer is used. On the **Merge Duplicate** page, this section is informational only. However, if there are merge conflicts, you can resolve them on the **Merge Duplicate Conflicts** page. Refer to steps 8 through 12.

5. For each field where you want to use another value than the current one, select the **Override** checkbox. The value in the **Alternate Value** field transfers to the current record when you complete the process.
6. After you specify the values to keep or override, choose the **Merge** action.

    [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] checks whether the merge of values for the duplicate customer into the current customer causes conflicts. A conflict exists if a value in at least one primary-key field is the same for both customers while the value in the **No** field is different for the two customers.

7. If no conflicts are found, choose the **Yes** button in the confirmation message.

    The duplicate customer is renamed so that all use of its **No.** value in all fields with relations to the customer table are replaced with the **No.** value of the current customer.
8. If conflicts exist, choose the **Resolve (xx) conflicts before merge** action on the **Conflicts** FastTab, which displays if conflicts exist.
9. On the **Merge Duplicate Conflicts** page, select the line for a related table with a conflict, and then choose the **View Details** action.

    The **Merge Duplicate** page now shows the fields in the selected table that cause a merge conflict between the two customer records. Notice in both the summarized values in the **Current** and **Conflicts With** fields and on the lines that at least one primary-key field is the same for both customers and the value of the **No.** field is different for the two customers.   
10. If you don't want to keep the duplicate customer record, choose the **Remove Duplicate** action, and then choose the **Close** button.

    Identical field values, other than the value in the **No.** field, are removed from the duplicate record and inserted on the current record.
11. If you want to keep the duplicate customer record after the merge,  choose the **Rename Duplicate**.
12. On lines, not for the **No.** field, where the field has the same value on both records, change the value in the **Alternate Value** field, and then choose the **Close** button.

    The conflicting field value is updated on the duplicate record so that it can be merged with the current record. The duplicate record continues to exist after the merge.
13. Repeat steps 8 through 12 until all conflicts are resolved. The **Conflicts** FastTab disappears.
14. On the **Merge Duplicate** page, choose the **Merge** action again, and then select the **Yes** button in the confirmation message box.

> [!NOTE]
> For contacts, you can use functionality to find duplicate contacts before you use the **Merge Duplicate** page. For more information, see [Search for duplicate contacts](marketing-setup-contacts.md#search-for-duplicate-contacts).

# Integrate with Microsoft Dataverse via data sync

Business apps often use data from more than one source. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] combines data into a single set of logic that makes it easier to connect [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to other Dynamics 365 applications. For example, [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] or your own application built on [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)]. To learn more about [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)], go to [What is Dataverse?](/power-apps/maker/data-platform/data-platform-intro).

The following steps provide an overview of the steps to integrate [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

> [!Note]  
> These tasks require the **System Administrator** security role in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

1. Assign licenses for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] to the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] users who will use the integrated apps.

2. Set up a connection to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)]. To learn more, go to [Connect to Dataverse](admin-how-to-set-up-a-dynamics-crm-connection.md).  

3. Synchronize data between the apps. To learn more, go to [Synchronizing Business Central and Dataverse](admin-synchronizing-business-central-and-sales.md).

## Get started with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)]

To get started with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)], you'll need a Microsoft Power Apps account. If you don't already have a Power Apps account, you can get one for free by visiting [powerapps.com](https://make.powerapps.com/?utm_source=padocs&utm_medium=linkinadoc&utm_campaign=referralsfromdoc) and choosing the **Get started free** link. To learn more about how to get started with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)], go to the [Get started with Dataverse](/training/modules/get-started-with-powerapps-common-data-service/) module from Microsoft training.

## Bi-directional or uni-directional data synchronization

You can synchronize data either to or from one Dynamics 365 business app to another, or in both directions in near-real time, through [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)]. For example, if you integrate [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)], a salesperson can create a sales order in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] and the order synchronizes to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Conversely, from [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)], the salesperson can check the availability of the item on the order in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. 

## Standard and custom entities

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] securely stores data in a set of tables, which are sets of records similar to how a table stores data within a database. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] includes a base set of standard tables that cover typical scenarios, but you can also create custom tables specific to your organization. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can view standard and custom tables being synchronized on the Integration Table Mappings page.

## About the Business Central Base Integration Solution

The Base Integration Solution is a key component of the integration. The solution adds the required roles and access levels to the user accounts for the integration, and it creates tables needed to map [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] company to business unit in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)].

By default, the **Set up [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] connection** assisted setup guide imports the solution. To do that, the setup guide uses an administrator user account that you specify. This account must be a valid user in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] with the **System Administrator** security role.  

To learn more about user accounts, go to the following articles:

* [Setting Up User Accounts for Integrating with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)]](admin-setting-up-integration-with-dynamics-sales.md)
* [Create users in Microsoft Dynamics 365 (online) and assign security roles](/dynamics365/customer-engagement/admin/create-users-assign-online-security-roles)

The administrator account is used only one time during the setup for the configuration changes that the Base Integration Solution makes in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)]. After the solution imports, the account is no longer needed. Integration will continue to use the user account that is automatically created specifically for the integration.

In addition to customizing [!INCLUDE [cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)], the solution also creates a security role in [!INCLUDE [cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] for the integration:

* **Business Central Dataverse Integration** - Allows you to manage the connection between [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and [!INCLUDE [cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)]. Typically, this role is assigned only to the user account that's automatically created for synchronization. To learn more about this role, go to [Setting Up User Accounts for Integrating with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)]](admin-setting-up-integration-with-dynamics-sales.md).

When you set up the connection, you create the integration table mappings that you need to synchronize data. Entities in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] are mapped to tables and table fields in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] through integration tables. To learn more about mappings, go to [Standard Entity Mapping for Synchronization](admin-synchronizing-business-central-and-sales.md#standard-table-mapping-for-synchronization).

## Handle differences in local and base transaction currencies

You can connect to a [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] environment that has a different base currency than the local currency in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. You make the connection in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on the **Dataverse Connection Setup** page or by using the **Set up connection to Dataverse** assisted setup guide.

To be able to connect, ensure that the base transaction currency setting in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] has the currency that set on the **Currencies** page in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], and at least one exchange rate is specified for the currency on the **Currency Exchange Rates** page.

Here's an example. You're connecting [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] with Euro (EUR) set as the local currency on the **General Ledger Setup** page to a [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] environment that has a base transaction currency set to US dollar (USD). You'll need to have USD on the **Currencies** page in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and the appropriate exchange rate.

When you enable the connection to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)], [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] adds its local currency to the **Currency** entity in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] with the exchange rate from the **Currency Factor** field on the **Currency Exchange Rates** page.

Currency synchronization is unidirectional, from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to [!INCLUDE [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)], monetary amounts convert and synchronize as follows:

* Amounts in the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] base currency convert to the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] local currency based on the latest exchange rate synchronized from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].
* Amounts in the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] local currency synchronize with the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] local currency in one of the other (non-base) currencies in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)].

## What happens when you copy a company

You can safely copy companies that integrate with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]. Copying companies helps reduce the risk of data inconsistencies and can save you valuable time. To learn more about copying companies, go to [Copy a company](about-new-company.md#copy-a-company).

# View and edit in Excel from Business Central

With pages that display a list of records in rows and columns, such as a list of customers, sale orders, or invoices, you can export the list to Microsoft Excel and view it there. Depending on the page, you have two options for viewing in Excel. Both are available from the **Share** icon ![Share a page in another app.](media/share-icon.png) at the top of a page. You can either select the **Open in Excel** action or the **Edit in Excel** action on the page. This article explains the two actions.

## Open in Excel

With the **Open in Excel** action, you can make changes to the records in Excel, but you can't publish the changes back to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. You can only save the changes to the Excel file, without affecting data in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

- Excel respects filters on the page that limit the records shown. The Excel workbook has the same rows and columns that appear on the page in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].
- This action works on both Windows and macOS.
- [!INCLUDE[open-edit-excel](includes/open-and-edit-excel.md)]

<!-- 
> [!IMPORTANT]
> For [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, the **Open in Excel** action is available by default. However, if you set up [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises for editing data in Excel, then the **Open in Excel** action is replaced by the **Edit in Excel** action.-->

[!INCLUDE [send-report-excel](includes/send-report-excel.md)] 

> [!NOTE]
> In Excel, whole numbers in columns will have a decimal symbol at the end (like a period `.` or comma `,`) even though the decimal symbol isn't shown in Business Central. The decimal symbol depends on your device's region settings. For example, `10` in Business Central could appear as `10.` or `10,` in Excel. You can change the format in Excel by selecting the values, then selecting <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>1</kbd>. To learn more about changing the number format in Excel, go to [Format numbers](https://support.microsoft.com/office/format-numbers-f27f865b-2dc5-4970-b289-5286be8b994a).

## Edit in Excel

The **Edit in Excel** action is available on most lists, but not all. With the **Edit in Excel** action, you make changes to records in Excel and then publish the changes back to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. When Excel opens, the **Excel Add-in** pane displays.

- With this action, Excel respects most filters on the page that limit the records shown, so the Excel workbook has almost the same records and columns.
- To get the latest data from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], choose **Refresh** in the Excel Add-in pane.
- [!INCLUDE[open-edit-excel](includes/open-and-edit-excel.md)]

### First-time sign-in

The **Edit in Excel** action requires that the Business Central add-in is installed in Excel. In some cases, your administrator might set up the add-in to install automatically for you. In this case, you just have to sign in to Business Central in the **Excel Add-in** pane with your user name and password. Otherwise, the **New Office Add-in** pane opens. To install the add-in, choose **Trust this add-in**, which installs the add-in directly from the Office Store.

If the add-in doesn't install, either contact your admin or try to install it manually. For more information, see [Install the add-in manually for your own use](admin-deploy-excel-addin.md#install).

### Work across environments and companies

You can switch the company that you're working with. To switch a company, select the **Options** icon ![Excel add-in options.](media/cogwheel.png "Excel add-in options") in the Excel Add-in pane, then select the company from the **Company** field.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When changing the company, make sure that the **Environment** field is not empty. If it is, then set it to one of the available options; otherwise, the add-in will not work correctly.  

If you make changes to the add-in, you must reload it to update the connection. To reload, use the ![Excel add-in menu](media/excel-addin-menu.png "Excel add-in menu") menu in the upper-right corner of the add-in. If you can't load the add-in, talk to your administrator. If you're the administrator, see [Get the Business Central add-in for Excel](admin-deploy-excel-addin.md).

> [!NOTE]
> The add-in works with Excel for the web (online) from any device as long as you use a supported browser. It also works with the Excel app for Windows (PC), but not for macOS.
>
> For [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, the **Edit in Excel** action is only available if the Excel add-in has been configured by your administrator, and only available for the web client. For administrators, if you want to learn how to install the Excel add-in, see [Setting up the Business Central add-in for Excel in Business Central on-premises](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/configuring-excel-addin).

### Limits when using Excel for the web

When **Edit in Excel** is used on list pages for tables with many columns, the resulting workbook might have too many columns for the file to be viewed in Excel for the web. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically limits the exported workbook to 100 columns when OneDrive is configured for system features.

# Set up Sales Order Agent (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]

Sales Order Agent in Business Central automates processing sales orders from customer email requests. This article explains how to set up, activate, configure Sales Order Agent, and manage user access.

Learn more about the agent in [Sales Order Agent overview](sales-order-agent.md).

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/production-ready-preview-dynamics365.md)]

<!--[!INCLUDE [limited-public-preview](includes/limited-public-preview.md)]-->

## Prerequisites

Before configuring and activating Sales Order Agent, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

- The Business Central environment is one of these country/region versions: AU (Australia), CA (Canada), GB (Great Britain), NZ (New Zealand), or US (United States).

  Sales Order Agent is currently unavailable in other country/region versions. Learn more about geographic and language availability at [Copilot international availability](https://aka.ms/bapcopilot-intl-report-external).
- Set up the email account for receiving incoming requests for sales quotes and orders.

   Sales Order Agent monitors incoming emails to this mailbox. The email account must be a **Microsoft 365** type (user mailbox or shared mailbox) in your organization. Learn more at [Set up email](admin-how-setup-email.md).

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > To activate and configure the agent, you need **Read and manage (Full Access)** and **Send as** permission on the mailbox, unless it's your personal mailbox. As an Exchange admin, delegate these permissions to all users who need to activate and configure the agent. Learn more in [Use the Exchange admin center to edit shared mailbox delegation](/microsoft-365/admin/email/create-a-shared-mailbox#use-the-eac-to-edit-shared-mailbox-delegation).
   >
   > When a user activates the agent, it runs as a background task in the context of that user and needs access to the shared mailbox to process emails. It might take a few hours for Exchange to propagate the permissions to the selected users.
- Set up the Business Central environment for billing agent capabilities (preview version 26.0 sandbox environments in the United Kingdom and United States only).

   Agents use Microsoft Copilot Studio messages when a user runs it, which your company is charged for. Learn more in [Manage consumption-based billing](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/tenant-admin-center-manage-consumption-billing).

- Turn on the **Allow HttpClient Requests** toggle in the **Sales Order Agent** extension settings (sandbox environments only).

   Open the [Extension management](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=2500) page, select **Sales Order Agent**, and then turn on the **Allow HttpClient Requests** toggle.

## Turn on the Sales Order Agent capability for the environment

The agent capability is on if the ![Shows the Sales Order Agent icon](media/soa-icon.png) **Sales Order Agent** icon appears in the top navigation menu of the role center.

![Shows the Sales Order Agent icon on a role center](media/soa-in-role-center.svg "Shows the Sales Order Agent icon on a role center")

If the icon isn't present, turn it on from the **Copilot & agent capabilities** page, like other Copilot features in Business Central. Sales Order Agent is listed under **Production ready previews**. Learn more in [Configure Copilot and AI agent capabilities](enable-ai.md).

Next, configure and activate the agent so it can process customer sales orders.

## Configure and activate Sales Order Agent

Configure and activate Sales Order Agent for your company. Only one Sales Order Agent is allowed per company, but you can give access to many users.

1. In the navigation bar at the upper right of the role center, select ![Shows the Sales Order Agent icon](media/soa-icon.png) **Sales Order Agent**   > **Activate**.

1. On the **Configure the Copilot agent** page, turn on the **Monitor incoming information** toggle, select the **Mailbox** checkbox, and then set the **Mailbox** field to the email account you want the agent to monitor.

   ![Shows the Sales Order Agent configuration page](media/soa-configuration.png "Shows the Sales Order Agent configuration page")

1. Select **Manage user access** to specify the users who can manage or interact with the agent. You can add more users now or later. Learn more in [Manage user access to the Sales Order Agent](#manage-agent-permissions-and-user-access).
1. Turn on the **Active** toggle.
1. On the right side of the page, select the **Go to next card** arrow to choose how the agent helps with inquiries, quotes, and orders.

    The following table describes several options:

    |Option|Description|Default|
    |-|-|-|
    |Select only available items|Specifies whether the agent considers item availability when searching for the customer's requested items.<br><br>When on, the agent checks inventory to determine whether the customer's requested item quantity is available based on their requested delivery date and location code. If there aren't enough items, the agent prepares the reply to the user that the requested items aren't available, even in situations when fewer items are available. <br><br>When off, the agent includes the customer's requested item quantity regardless of availability. That is, quotes can be created for the items that aren't available and their availability can become negative.<br><br>Learn more about item availability in [Get an availability overview](inventory-how-availability-overview.md) or open the [Item Availability page](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com?page=4410).|On|
    |Create sales documents|When on, the agent can create sales quotes and orders from email inquiries based on the remaining options in this table.<br><br>When off, the agent handles only email communication and doesn't create quotes or orders. The remaining options are irrelevant and can’t be set.|On|
    |Review quotes when created and updated|When on, the agent adds a review step for a Business Central user to review and confirm the sales quote before creating an outgoing email with the quote details and attachment. <br><br>When off, the agent creates or modifies sales quotes as requested and then automatically proceeds with creating an outgoing email with the quote as an attachment. The user must review and confirm the email before the agent sends it to the customer. |Off|
    |Make orders from quotes|When on, the agent converts confirmed sales quotes into orders after the customer agrees to the quote via email and the Business Central user confirms the email.<br><br>When off, you have to create the order manually.|On|
    |Review orders when created and updated|When on, the agent adds a review step for a Business Central user to review and confirm the sales order before creating an outgoing email with the order details and attachment. <br><br>When off, the agent creates the sales order as requested and then automatically proceeds with creating an outgoing email with the order as an attachment. The user must review and confirm the order before the agent sends it to the customer. |Off|

1. Select **Update** to complete the setup.
1. Ensure Sales Order Agent's language is set to a supported language.

   When you configure the agent, it uses the same language as the display language of your workspace. [Learn how to change the agent's language](#change-language-and-regional-settings).

The **Sales Order Agent** icon changes to ![Shows the Sales Order Agent icon after configured](media/soa-activated-icon.png), indicating the agent is active and ready to handle incoming quote requests to the mailbox.

When Sales Order Agent is active, a scheduled task added to job queue runs every 20 seconds on the mailbox. This task monitors new unread messages in the mailbox. If a new unread message is found, Sales Order Agent imports the message into Business Central and verifies whether there's already a task for the mail thread. If a task for the thread already exists, Sales Order Agent incorporates the new message into the existing task. Otherwise, it creates a new task for the message.

> [!NOTE]
> The ![Shows the Sales Order Agent icon when the agent is configured but not active](media/soa-not-activated-icon.png) icon indicates the agent is configured with the mailbox, but it's not active. To activate, select the icon, then select ![Shows the configuration icon for Sales Order Agent](media/soa-configure-icon.png) **Configure Sales Order Agent** to reopen the configuration page. From there, turn on the **Active** toggle.

## Manage agent permissions and user access

### Add agent users

As an administrator, you can specify which users have permission to use or configure Sales Order Agent. There are two ways to add and configure agent users: 

#### [From Configure Sales Order Agent](#tab/soaconfig)

1. Open the **Configure Sales Order Agent** page by selecting ![Shows the Sales Order Agent icon after configured](media/soa-activated-icon.png) **Sales Order Agent** > ![Shows the configuration icon for Sales Order Agent](media/soa-configure-icon.png) **Configure**.
1. Turn off the **Active** toggle.
1. Select **Manage user access**.
1. On the **Select users that can manage or interact with the Agent** page, you can do the following steps:

   - To add a user, select an empty line, select the **User Name** field, then select the user from the list.
   - To give a user permission to configure Sales Order Agent, select the **Can configure** checkbox. <br><br> The **Can configure** setting defines whether a user has access to update the agent configuration (for example, updating the designated mailbox, activating and deactivating the agent, and other settings) or only to work with the agent tasks (for example, reviewing and confirming agent steps).
   - To remove a user's access to the agent, select ![Shows the icon to show more option on a field](media/show-more-options-icon.png) **Show more options** next to the user name, and then select **Delete**.

#### [From Sales Order Agent card page](#tab/soapage)

1. To open the **Sales Order Agent** card page, search (<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Q</kbd>) for **Agents**, and then select **SALES ORDER AGENT - [COMPANY]**.
1. Set **Status** to **Disabled** to deactivate the agent.
1. In the **User access** section, you can do the following steps:

   - To add a user, select an empty line, select the **User Name** field, and then select the user from the list.
   - To give a user permission to configure Sales Order Agent, select the **Can configure** checkbox.
   - To remove a user's access to the agent, select ![Shows the icon to show more option on a field](media/show-more-options-icon.png) **Show more options** next to the user name, and then select **Delete**.

---

### Manage agent permissions to objects, data, and UI elements

Sales Order Agent has a user account in Business Central, similar to other users. To access this account, search for and open the **Agents** page, and then select **SALES ORDER AGENT - [COMPANY]** to open the agent card page.

The **Agent Permission Sets** section lists all the permission sets currently assigned to the agent. By default, Sales Order Agent has the **SOA AGENT – EDIT** permission set. This set restricts access to only the objects, data, and UI elements (such as pages, fields, and actions) necessary for handling sales quote requests.

You can't modify the **SOA AGENT – EDIT** permission set directly, because it's a system permissions set. However, you can create a copy of **SOA AGENT – EDIT** permission set, modify the copy to suit your needs, and then add it to the **Agent Permission Sets** section, along with any other permission sets.

Before you can add or delete permission sets applied to the agent, change the **State** to disabled. When you're done making changes, set it back to **Enabled**.

The following system permissions are available for controlling user access to the agent's functionality:

- **Configure All Agents** (ID 9665): Grants a user access to manage the configuration settings of Sales Order Agent.
- **Manage Agent Tasks** (ID 9670): Allows a user to work with agent tasks displayed in the Copilot pane.

These system permissions are also included in the following permission sets, entitlements, and license types:

- The **SECURITY** permission set includes the **Configure All Agents** permission.
- The **System Execute - Basic** permission set includes the **Manage Agent Tasks** permission.
- The **System Tables - Basic** permission set includes all virtual tables used by the agent (labeled as "Agent *" tables).
- Essential and Premium license entitlements now include **Manage Agent Tasks** permissions.
- All license types include **Configure All Agents** permissions.

Users can configure Sales Order Agent if they have the **Configure All Agents** permission or are listed as an agent user with the **Can Configure** field selected.

Users can work with agent tasks in the Copilot pane if they have the **Manage Agent Tasks** permission (either explicitly or as part of their Essential or Premium license permissions) and are listed as an agent user.

## Change language and regional settings

[!INCLUDE[soa-language-support](includes/soa-language-support.md)]

1. To open the **Sales Order Agent** card page, search (<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Q</kbd>) for **Agents**, and then select **SALES ORDER AGENT - [COMPANY]**.
1. Select **User Settings**.
1. Set **Language** to a supported English locale.

# Managing inventory costs

Cost management, also referred to as 'costing,' concerns recording and reporting business operating costs. Costing includes the reporting of manufacturing costs and inventory costs, that is, the value of items.

To make sure that inventory costs are recorded correctly, you must set up various fields and pages before you begin to make item transactions. Typically, businesses choose a specific costing method and apply that to inventory items, for example, to help them track the value of items on stock.

The following tables describe a sequence of tasks, with links to the articles that describe them.

|**To...**|**Go to...**|  
|------------|-------------|
|Specify a default costing method for the company to govern how incoming cost is used to assess inventory value and the cost of goods sold.|[Set Up General Inventory Information](inventory-how-setup-general.md)|  
|Specify a costing method on individual items if they require a different costing method.|[Register New Items](inventory-how-register-new-items.md)|  
|Define inventory periods to control inventory value over time by disallowing transaction posting in closed inventory periods.|[Work with Inventory Periods](finance-how-to-work-with-inventory-periods.md)|  
|Ensure that sales returns are applied to the original outbound transaction to preserve inventory value.|**Exact Cost Reversing Mandatory** field on the **Sales & Receivables** page|  
|Ensure that purchase returns are applied to the original inbound transaction to preserve inventory value.|**Exact Cost Reversing Mandatory** field on the **Purchases & Payables** page|
|Set up the rounding rules to apply when adjusting or suggesting item prices and when adjusting or suggesting standard costs.|**Rounding Method** page|  

Central principles to understand are that costing methods define how items are valued when they leave inventory, that cost adjustment updates the cost of goods sold with related purchase costs posted after the sale, and that inventory values must be posted to dedicated G/L accounts at regular intervals.

|**To...**|**Go to...**|  
|------------|-------------|  
|Ensure that you know the cost of shipped items by assigning added item costs, such as freight, physical handling, insurance, and transportation that you incur after selling.|[Use Item Charges to Account for Additional Trade Costs](payables-how-assign-item-charges.md)|
|Appreciate or depreciate the value of one or more items in inventory by posting their current, calculated value.|[Revalue Inventory](inventory-how-revalue-inventory.md)|
|View and manually change certain item application entries that are created automatically during inventory transactions.|[Remove and Reapply Item Ledger Entries](finance-how-to-remove-and-reapply-item-entries.md)|
|Ensure that the cost automatically posts to the general ledger when you post an inventory transaction.|**Automatic Cost Posting** field on the **Inventory Setup** page.|
|Ensure that expected costs post to the general ledger so the interim G/L accounts show an estimate of the amounts due and the cost of the traded items before you invoice them.|**Expected Cost Posting to G/L** field on the **Inventory Setup** page.|
|Define whether to calculate the average cost for an item only, or per item for each stockkeeping unit and for each variant of the item.|**Average Cost Calc. Type** field on the **Inventory Setup** page.|
|Select the period of time you want to use for calculating the weighted average cost of items that use the average costing method.|**Average Cost Period** field on the **Inventory Setup** page.|

# Company information overview

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] organizes business entities in *companies*. For each company, you must fill in some of the basic company details and relevant information on the **Company Information** page. The information on the [**Company Information**](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=1) page is used in documents, such as invoice headers. You can set up more than one company, such as a parent company and a subsidiary.  

If the company's inventory warehouse is located at a different address than the company headquarters, you can complete the various ship-to fields and the **Location Code** field on the **Shipping** FastTab. The information in these fields is then printed on purchase orders, for example, so vendors ship items to the correct location.  

For each company you set up, you must fill in the **Company Information** page, together with the **General Ledger Setup** page. You must also set up each area in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], such as the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page, for each company. Learn more at [Overview of Tasks to Set Up [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]](setup.md).  

The **Company Information** page contains different fields and FastTabs, depending on your country/region. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)] The following table describes the most common FastTabs.

[!INCLUDE [admin-company-info-fasttabs](includes/admin-company-info-fasttabs.md)]

After you fill in the information, you can close the page.  

## Working with multiple companies

If your [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes multiple companies, your users might want to use *company badges* to help them quickly identify and keep track of which company they're currently working in. For more information, see [Display a company badge](#badge).

There are a few features you can use to switch among companies as you work, like the company switcher (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>O</kbd>). Learn more at [Switch to Another Company or Environment](ui-organization-switch.md).

## <a name="badge"></a>Display a company badge

When there's more than one company or environment, the company switcher shows on the upper-right side of the app bar near the search icon. By default, the company switcher uses a standard company icon, like ![company icon Launcher.](media/ui-experience/company-icon.png "Displays the company switcher icon used when there is a single environment") and ![company-icon-mult-env](media/ui-experience/company-icon-multi-env.png "Displays the company switcher icon used when there are multiple environments").

:::image type="content" source="media/ui-experience/company-switch-2.png" alt-text="Shows the company switcher icon in the heading of the Business Central client.":::  

Starting in 2023 release wave 2, version 23, the company badge appears in the browser tab when using the web client. It's also in page links that you [copy and paste](across-share-data-features.md#copying-a-link) in rich text editors, like Word, Outlook, and Teams.

The following video shows how to work with company badges.

> [!VIDEO https://learn-video.azurefd.net/vod/player?id=fefe2ce4-d700-4e04-b319-b8557e75dfe9]
 
### Set the company badge

On the **Company Information** page, you can replace the standard company icon with a custom badge on a per-company basis. A company badge can make it easier to identify the company you're working in.

1. On the **Company Badge** FastTab, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
2. When done, refresh the browser (select <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>F5</kbd>) to update the badge in the client.  

> [!TIP]
> A company badge also indicates the type of environment the company is in. A round company badge signifies a production environment, and a square badge signifies a sandbox environment.

## Change company display name

The company name is always displayed at the top left corner and works as an action that you can choose to go back to the Role Center. You can change this name on the **Company Information** page.

1. Choose the ![Sprocket icon to open the Settings menu.](media/ui-experience/settings_icon_small.png) icon, and then choose the **Company Information** action.
2. In the **Name** field, enter the new company name.
3. Leave the page. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] restarts and displays the new company in the top-left corner.

## Experience

The default user experience in a [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] trial doesn't reveal all capabilities. You can switch on the full experience on the **Company Information** page.  

For more information, go to [Change Which Features are Displayed](ui-experiences.md).

# Set Up Put-away Templates

With directed put-away and pick functionality, the most appropriate bin for your items at any given time is suggested, according to the put-away template that you have set up for the warehouse, the bin rankings you have given to the bins, and the minimum and maximum quantities that you have set up for fixed bins.  

You can set up a number of put-away templates and select one of them to govern put-aways in general in your warehouse. You can also select a put-away template for any item or stockkeeping unit that might have special put-away requirements.  

## To set up put-away templates

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Put-away Templates**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. Enter a code that is the unique identifier of the template you are about to create.  
4. Enter a short description, if you wish.  
5. Fill in the first line with the bin requirements that you want fulfilled first and foremost when suggesting a put-away.

    For example, if want the default put-away method to be based on fixed bins, then choose the **Find Fixed Bin** field. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  
6. Fill in the second line with the bin requirements that would be your second choice to fulfill in finding a bin for put-away. The second line is used only if a bin that meets the requirements of the first line cannot be found.  
7. Continue to fill in the lines until you have described all the acceptable bin placements that you want to use in the put-away process.  
8. On the last line in the put-away template, select the **Find Floating Bin** check box.  

You can create various put-away templates and then apply them as you see fit. The put-away template that you selected for the item or stockkeeping unit, if any is used first. If these fields are not filled in, then the put-away template that you selected for the warehouse on the **Bin Policies** FastTab on the location card is used.

# Ad-hoc analysis of sustainability data

This article explains how to use the **Data Analysis** feature to analyze sustainability data directly from list pages and queries. You don't have to run a report or switch to another application, such as Excel. The feature provides an interactive and versatile way to calculate, summarize, and examine data. Instead of running reports using options and filters, you can add multiple tabs that represent different tasks or views on the data. Some examples are "Emission overview" or "Emission By Scope," or any other view you can imagine. To learn more about how to use the **Data Analysis** feature, go to [Analyze list and query data with analysis mode](analysis-mode.md).

Use the following list pages for ad-hoc analysis of sustainability data:

- [Sustainability Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=6220&layout=analysis)

## Sustainability ad-hoc analysis scenarios

Use the **Data Analysis** feature for quick fact checking and ad-hoc analysis:

- If you don't want to run a report.
- If a report for your specific need doesn't exist.
- If you want to quickly iterate to get a good overview on a part of your business.

The following sections provide examples of sustainability scenarios in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

| Area | To... | Open this page in analysis mode | Using these fields |
| ---- | ----- | ------------------------------- |------------------- |
| [Emission overview (sum by category)](#example-emission-overview-sum-by-category) | Analyze your emissions by category. | [Sustainability Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=6220&layout=analysis) | **Account Category**, **Account Name**, **Emission NH4**, **Emission CO2**, and **Emission N2O**.|
| [Average emissions by category](#example-average-emissions-by-category) | Analyze your average emissions by category. | [Sustainability Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=6220&layout=analysis) | **Account Category**, **Account Name**, **Emission NH4**, **Emission CO2**, and **Emission N2O**.|
| [Emissions by scope](#example-emissions-by-scope) | Analyze your emissions by scope. | [Sustainability Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=6220&layout=analysis) | **Emission Scope**, **Account Category**, **Emission NH4**, **Emission CO2**, and **Emission N2O**.|

## Example: Emission overview (sum by category)

To analyze your emissions by category, follow these steps:

1. Open the [Sustainability Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=6220&layout=analysis) page and turn on analysis mode.
1. Go to the **Columns** menu and remove all columns (select the box next to the **Search** field).
1. Turn on **Pivot** mode (located directly above the **Search** field).
1. Drag the **Account Category** and **Account Name** fields to the **Row Groups** area. Drag the fields in that order.
1. Drag the fields **Emission NH4**, **Emission CO2**, and **Emission N2O** to the **Values** area.
1. Rename your analysis tab to **Emission overview (sum)** or something that describes this analysis for you.

The following image shows the result of these steps.

:::image type="content" source="media/data-analysis-sustainability-entries.png" alt-text="Example 1 of how to do data analysis on the Sustainability Ledger Entries page." lightbox="media/data-analysis-sustainability-entries.png":::

## Example: Average emissions by category

To analyze your average emissions by category, follow these steps:

1. Open the [Sustainability Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=6220&layout=analysis) page and turn on analysis mode.

## Data foundation for ad-hoc analysis on sustainability

The information that you enter in a sustainability journal is temporary and you can change it while it's in the journal. When you post a sustainability journal, the information is transferred to sustainability ledger entries on individual sustainability accounts, where you can't change it. However, you can post reversing or correcting entries. The [Sustainability Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=6220) list page is the main data source for ad-hoc analysis of sustainability data.

To learn more about posting sustainability entries, go to [Record sustainability entries](finance-sustainability-journal.md).

# View the Status of Synchronization Jobs


Use the **Coupled Data Synchronization Errors** page to view the status of synchronization jobs that have been run for coupled records in a Dataverse or [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] integrations. This includes jobs that were run from the job queue and manual synchronization jobs that ran on records from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For example, viewing their status is helpful when troubleshooting because it gives you access to details about errors related to coupled records. Typically, these types of errors are caused by user actions, for example, when:  

* Two people made a change to the same data in both business apps.
* Someone deleted data in one of the apps, but not both.

> [!Note]
> The **Coupled Data Synchronization Errors** page shows information about jobs related to coupled records. If you resolve all of the errors but records are still not synchronizing, it might have something to do with a setting for the integration. Typically, your administrator will need to resolve those types of errors.   

## Example
This video shows an example of how to troubleshoot errors that happened while synchronizing with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)]. The process will be the same for all integrations. 

> [!VIDEO https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2097304]


## To view and resolve synchronization errors for coupled records
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Coupled Data Synchronization Errors**, and then choose the related link.
2. The **Coupled Data Synchronization Errors** page shows issues that occurred when you synchronized coupled records. The following table includes actions that you can use to resolve issues one by one:

|Action|Description|
|----|----|
|**Remove Coupling**|Uncouples the records and they will no longer synchronize. To restart the synchronization you must couple them again. |
|**Retry** and **Retry All**|For each record where an error is found, synchronization is skipped unless you fix the issue. Retry will include the selected record in the next synchronization, and **Retry All** includes all of the records.|
|**Synchronize**|The app will try to resolve a conflict where data was changed in both business apps. You can choose the data to use.|
|**Restore Records** and **Delete Records**|These are useful when a record was deleted in one of the business apps. Delete Records deletes the record or row in the app where it still exists. Restore Records recreates the record or row in the business app where it was deleted.|

> [!NOTE]
> To reduce the number of conflicts you need to resolve, you can set up your integration table mappings to apply these actions automatically. For more information, [Mapping Integration Tables](admin-how-to-modify-table-mappings-for-synchronization.md#mapping-integration-tables).

## To view the synchronization log for a specific (manually synchronized) record
1. Open, for example, a customer, item or any other record that is synchronizing data between [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and Dataverse or [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)].
2. Choose the **Synchronization Log** action to view the synchronization log for a selected record. For example, a specific customer you synchronized manually.

## Remove Couplings Between Records
When something goes wrong in your integration and you need to uncouple records to stop synchronizing them, you can do so for one or more records at a time. You can uncouple one or more records from list pages or the **Coupled Data Synchronization Errors** page by choosing one or more lines and choosing **Delete Coupling**. You can also remove all couplings for one or more table mappings on the **Integration Table Mappings** page. 

If an entity with a unidirectional coupling is deleted in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you must manually delete the broken coupling. To do that, on the **Coupled Data Synchronization Errors** page, choose the **Find for Deleted** action, and then delete the couplings.

# Gross Requirement (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Gross Requirement** report looks at all outbound transactions to determine the quantity required per item.

The report shows the gross requirement for an item and the different documents that include it. This information is coupled with the **Project Available Balance** that calculates the balance at any point in time.

:::image type="content" source="media/inventory/gross-requirement.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Gross Requirement Power BI Report" lightbox="media/inventory/gross-requirement.png":::

## Use the report

The report helps management and procurement officers to determine whether the organization is keeping up with demand.

Managers can use the report to ensure that stock levels are high enough to maintain the production schedule and sales demand for each item. The report helps identify bottlenecks in production by showing items where the available inventory doesn't meet the gross requirement.

Procurement officers can view sales and production volumes and ensure your available balance meets the requirements for each item. With this information, you can make informed decisions on the items you should replenish.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The *Gross Requirement* report includes the following KPIs:

- [**Gross Requirement**](inventory-powerbi-kpis.md#gross-requirement)
- [**Project Available Balance**](inventory-powerbi-kpis.md#projected-available-balance)
- [**Qty. on Sales Order**](inventory-powerbi-kpis.md#qty-on-sales-order)

# Suggest vendor payments

On the **Payment Journal** page, you can use the **Suggest Vendor Payments** batch job to suggest payment lines. Based on your settings, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] suggests lines for:

- Payments that are due soon.
- Payments where a payment discount is available.

To benefit fully from payment suggestions, you must prioritize your vendors. To learn more about prioritizing vendors, go to [Prioritize Vendors](purchasing-how-prioritize-vendors.md).  

> [!NOTE]  
> The batch job excludes vendor ledger entries that are **On Hold** or that are already applied and have a value in the **Applies-to ID** field.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> If you want to take advantage of payment discounts, and have entered an available amount, the amount will be used for:  
>
> * Prioritized overdue vendor entries first, in order of priority.
> * Overdue vendor entries that aren't prioritized.  
> * Open vendor entries that qualify for payment discounts. The entries are arranged by vendor number.  

## Use the Suggest Vendor Payments action

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Payment Journals**, and then select the related link.  
2. Open the journal, and then select the **Suggest Vendor Payments** action.  
3. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  
4. Select the **OK** button.  

## Insert the due date as posting date on payment journal lines

When you use the **Suggest Vendor Payments** batch job to create payment lines for your vendors, you can fill two special fields to ensure that the generated lines use the due date to calculate the posting date. These fields are **Calculate Posting Date from Applies-to-Doc. Due Date** and **Applies-to-Doc. Due Date Offset**.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> You can't use the **Calculate Posting Date from Applies-to-Doc. Due Date** field together with the **Find Payment Discounts** field or the **Summarize per Vendor** field. If the posting date is based on the due date, some payment discounts might not calculate correctly because the posting date is after the payment discount date.  

Also, if the calculated posting date is in the past, then the posting date is moved up to the work date and a warning displays.  

You can also manually create payment lines using the due date to calculate the posting date. After you apply vendor ledger entries, you can use the **Calculate Posting Date** action to update the posting date on the journal line with the due date of the related purchase invoice. To learn more about this manual process, go to [Apply Purchase Transactions Manually](payables-how-apply-purchase-transactions-manually.md).  

> [!NOTE]  
> If the purchase invoice is overdue, the posting date is set to the work date and the font on the line changes to red.

# Invoice sales

You can usually create either a sales order or sales invoice to record your agreement with a customer to sell certain products on certain delivery and payment terms.  

However, you must use a sales order instead of a sales invoice if you:  

* Need to ship only part of an order quantity, for example, because the full quantity isn't on hand.  
* Ship products after you post the corresponding sales invoices.
* Sell items your vendor delivers directly to your customer, known as drop shipment. Learn more at [Make Drop Shipments](sales-how-drop-shipment.md).  

In all other situations, sales orders and sales invoices work in the same way. Learn more about how to use sales orders at [Sell Products](sales-how-sell-products.md).

You can negotiate with the customer by first creating a sales quote, which you can convert to a sales invoice when you agree on the sale. Learn more at [Make Sales Quotes](sales-how-make-offers.md).

## Create sales invoices

If the customer decides to buy, you post the sales invoice to create the related quantity and value entries. When you post the sales invoice, you can also email it as a PDF attachment. You can prefill the email body with a summary of the invoice and payment information, such as providing a link to PayPal. Learn more at [Send Documents by Email](ui-how-send-documents-email.md#to-send-documents-by-email). When the customer pays the invoice, you can register that payment in different ways, depending on the size and preferred workflows of your organization. Learn more at [Registering Payments](#register-payments) section.  

Item cards can be of the **Inventory**, **Service**, or **Non-Inventory** type to specify if the item is a physical inventory unit, a labor time unit, or a physical unit not kept on inventory, respectively. Learn more at [Register New Items](inventory-how-register-new-items.md). The sales invoice process is the same for all three item types.

You can fill customer fields on the sales invoice in one of two ways, depending on whether the customer is already registered. See step 2 in the following procedure.

### To create a sales invoice

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Invoices**, and then choose the related link.  
2. In the **Customer Name** field, enter the name of an existing customer. If, however, the customer is new and therefore not registered, follow these steps to populate standard customer information on the **Sales Invoice** page:

    1. In the **Customer Name** field, enter the name of the new customer.
    2. In the dialog box about registering the new customer, choose **OK**.
    3. On the **Select a template for a new customer** page, choose a template to base the new customer card on, then choose **OK**.
    4. A new customer card displays the information on the selected customer template. Fill in the remaining fields. Learn more at [Register New Customers](sales-how-register-new-customers.md).  
    5. When you complete the customer card, choose **Close** to return to the **Sales Invoice** page.

   Several fields on the sales invoice are now filled with information that you specified on the new customer card.  
3. Fill in the remaining fields on the **Sales Invoice** page as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

    > [!NOTE]  
    > If you allow the customer to pay immediately, for example, by cash or PayPal, then fill in the **Payment Method Code** field. The payment is then recorded as soon as you post the sales invoice. If you select *Cash*, then the payment is recorded in a specified balancing account.

    You're now ready to fill in the **Lines** FastTab with products you're selling to the customer or for any transaction with the customer you want to record in a general ledger (G/L) account.

4. On the **Lines** FastTab, in the **Type** field, select the type of product, charge, or transaction you post for the customer on the sales line.
   > [!TIP]
   > If you set up recurring sales lines for the customer, such as a monthly replenishment order, you can reflect that in the order by choosing the **Get Recurring Sales Lines** action.
5. In the **No.** field, select a record to post according to the value in the **Type** field.

    You leave the **No.** field blank in the following cases:

    * If the line is for a comment. Write the comment in the **Description** field.
    * If the line is for a catalog item. Choose the **Select Catalog Items** action. Learn more at [Work With Catalog Items](inventory-how-work-nonstock-items.md).

6. In the **Quantity** field, enter how many units of the product, charge, or transaction the line should record for the customer.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > If the item is of the **Service** type, or the **Type** field contains **Resource**, then the quantity is a time unit, such as hours, as indicated in the **Unit of Measure Code** field on the line. Learn more at [Set Up Item Units of Measure](inventory-how-setup-units-of-measure.md)

    The value in the **Line Amount** field is calculated as *Unit Price* × *Quantity*.  

    The price and line amounts are with or without sales tax, depending on what you selected in the **Prices Including Tax** field on the customer card.  
7. If you want to give a discount, enter a percentage in the **Line Discount %** field. The value in the **Line Amount** field updates accordingly.  

    If special item prices are set up on the **Sales Prices and Sales Line Discounts** FastTab on the customer or item card, upon meeting the price criteria the price and amount on the sales line automatically update. Learn more at [Record Sales Price, Discount, and Payment Agreements](sales-how-record-sales-price-discount-payment-agreements.md).  
8. Repeat steps 4 through 7 for every product or charge that you want to invoice the customer for.

    The totals fields under the lines are automatically updated, as you create or modify lines, to display the amounts posted to the ledgers.

    > [!NOTE]
    > In rare cases, the posted amounts might differ from what displays in the totals fields. The difference is typically due to rounding calculations for VAT or sales tax.<br /><br />To verify the amounts before you post, use the **Customer Statistics** FactBox. Also, when you choose the **Release** action, the values in the totals fields update to include rounding calculations.

9. In the **Inv. Discount Amount Excl. Tax** field, enter an amount that should be deducted from the value shown in the **Total Incl. Tax** field.

    If you set up invoice discounts for the customer, then the specified percentage value is automatically inserted in the **Invoice Discount %** field if the discount criteria are met, and the related amount is inserted in the **Inv. Discount Amount Excl. Tax** field. Learn more at [Record Sales Price, Discount, and Payment Agreements](sales-how-record-sales-price-discount-payment-agreements.md).

10. When the sales invoice lines are completed, choose the **Post and Send** action.  

The **Post and Send Confirmation** dialog box displays the customer's preferred method of receiving documents. You can change the sending method by choosing the lookup button for the **Send Document to** field. Learn more at [Set Up Document Sending Profiles](sales-how-setup-document-send-profiles.md).

The related item and customer ledger entries are now created in your system, and the sales invoice is output as a PDF document. The sales invoice is removed from the list of sales invoices and replaced with a new document in the list of posted sales invoices.  

### Calculate invoice discounts on sales

[!INCLUDE [sales-invoice-discounts](includes/sales-invoice-discounts.md)]

## Posted invoices

[!INCLUDE [posted-invoices](includes/posted-invoices.md)]

You can easily correct or cancel a posted sales invoice before the final payment. For example, you might want to correct a typing mistake, or the customer requests a change. Learn more at [Correct or Cancel Unpaid Sales Invoices](sales-how-correct-cancel-sales-invoice.md). If the posted sales invoice is paid, you must create a sales credit memo to reverse the sale. Learn more at [Process Sales Returns or Cancellations](sales-how-process-sales-returns-cancellations.md).  

[Open the **Posted Sales Invoices** list](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=143) in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## Register payments

Depending on your business needs, you can get paid and register a payment in different ways: manually, automatically, and through payment services.  

You can process the payments straight from the customer card. Use the **Register Customer Payments** action to get an overview of unpaid invoices for that customer. Then, mark the invoice as paid partially or in full. This payment reconciliation processes your customer payments by matching amounts received in your bank account with the related unpaid sales invoices, and then posts the payments. Learn more in the [To reconcile payments individually](receivables-how-reconcile-customer-payments-list-unpaid-sales-documents.md#to-register-customer-payments-individually) section.  

In business environments where the customer pays after delivery. According to the payment terms, a posted sales invoice remains open (unpaid) until someone verifies the payment and applies it to the posted sales invoice. You can apply payments manually or automatically. Learn more at [Reconcile Customer Payments with the Cash Receipt Journal or from Customer Ledger Entries](receivables-how-apply-sales-transactions-manually.md) and [Reconcile Payments Using Automatic Application](receivables-how-reconcile-payments-auto-application.md).  

In business environments where customers pay immediately, such as via PayPal or cash, payment is recorded immediately when you post the sales invoice. Also, the posted sales invoice is closed as fully applied. You select the relevant method in the **Payment Method Code** field on the sales order. For electronic payments, such as PayPal, you must also fill in the **Payment Service** field. Learn more at [Enable Customer Payments Through Payment Services](sales-how-enable-payment-service-extensions.md).

You can even create directly paid invoices for unregistered customers by setting up a "cash customer" card for them, which you point to on the sales invoice. Learn more at [Set Up Cash Customers](finance-how-to-set-up-cash-customers.md).  

> [!TIP]
> If you want to send your customers reminders of overdue payments, you need to first set up reminder levels and terms. Learn more at [Set Up Reminder Terms and Levels](finance-setup-reminders.md).

# Use job queues to schedule tasks

Use the **Job Queue Entries** page to schedule and run specific reports and codeunits. You can set jobs to run one time, or on a recurring basis. For example, you might want to run the **Salesperson * Sales Statistics** report weekly to track sales by salesperson each week, or run the **Delegate Approval Requests** codeunit daily to prevent documents from piling up.

The **Job Queue Entries** page lists all existing jobs. If you add a job queue entry that runs on a schedule, you must provide some information. For example:

* The type of object to run, such as a report or codeunit. You must have permission to run the report or codeunit.
* The name and object ID of the object.
* Parameters to specify the behavior of the job queue entry. For example, you can add a parameter to only send posted sales orders.
* The schedule for when, and how often, the job queue entry runs.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> If you're assigned the SUPER permissions set that comes with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you have permission to run all objects included in your license. If you have the Delegated Admin role, you can create and schedule job queue entries, but only administrators and licensed users can run them.

After a job finishes successfully, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] removes it from the list of job queue entries, unless it's a recurring job. For recurring jobs, the **Earliest Start Time** field is adjusted to show the next time that the job will run.

## Examples of what you can schedule using job queue entries

### Schedule reports

You can schedule a report or batch job to run at a specific date and time. Scheduled reports and batch jobs are entered in the job queue and processed at the scheduled time, similar to other jobs. You choose the **Schedule** option after you choose the **Send to** action, and then you enter information such as printer, time, date, and recurrence.  

To learn more about scheduling, go to [Scheduling a Report to Run](ui-work-report.md#ScheduleReport)

### Schedule synchronization between [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)]

If you integrate [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)], the job queue lets you schedule when to synchronize data. Depending on the direction and rules you define, the job queue entry can create records in one app to match records in the other. A good example is when you register a contact in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)], the job queue entry can set up that contact for you in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. To learn more about scheduling, go to [Scheduling a Synchronization between Business Central and Dynamics 365 Sales](admin-scheduled-synchronization-using-the-synchronization-job-queue-entries.md).

### Schedule when to post sales and purchase orders

You can use job queue entries to schedule business processes to run in the background. For example, background tasks are useful when multiple users post sales orders at the same time, but only one order can be processed at a time. To learn more about background posting, go to [To set up background posting with job queues](ui-batch-posting.md#to-set-up-background-posting-with-job-queues).

## Important for scheduling recurring jobs

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Recurring job queues can affect performance, so you shouldn't run them too frequently. When you set up how often to run a recurring job, try to set the largest time interval you can. For example, if you're about to set a recurrence of five minutes, consider whether it can be 15 minutes, or even once per hour instead. When planning for recurring job queues, consider which areas of the application the job will affect. Is it an area where many users work and will be impacted by heavy activity? Consider the length of a single job run and the business motivations for running jobs with a given cadence.

## The earliest start date

The value in the **Earliest Start Date/Time** field on the **Job Queue Entry Card** page shows the next time the job will run. There are several factors that can affect whether a job queue entry actually runs at that time.

The most common factors are the number of job queue entries in an environment, and the overall number of scheduled tasks. To protect performance levels, there are operational limits. If you have many entries and, for example, one of them fails or takes longer than expected, the next job might not start at the expected time. If you have codeunits that are generating 100,000 or more scheduled tasks, you should investigate whether you actually need all of those tasks. You can access the list of all scheduled tasks on the **Scheduled Tasks** page.

To learn more about monitoring the status of job queue entries, go to [To view status for any job](#to-view-status-for-any-job). To learn more about operational limits, go to [Asynchronous task limits](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/operational-limits-online#Task).

## Monitor status or errors in the job queue

Data that the job queue generates is stored, so that you can troubleshoot errors.  

For each job queue entry, you can view and change the status. When you create a job queue entry, its status is set to **On Hold**. You can set the status to **Ready** and back to **On Hold**, for example. Otherwise, status information is updated automatically.

The following table describes the values of the **Status** field.

| Status | Description |
|--|--|
| Ready | The job queue entry is ready to be run. |
| In Process | The job queue entry is in process. This field updates while the job queue is running. |
| On Hold | The default status of the job queue entry when you create it. Choose the **Set Status to Ready** action to change the status to **Ready**. Choose the **Set On Hold** action to revert the status to **On Hold**. To learn more, go to [About On Hold](#about-on-hold).|
| On Hold Due to Inactivity | Used primarily for job queue entries that schedule synchronization between [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and another application, such as [!INCLUDE [cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)]. To learn more about this status, go to [About inactivity timeouts](/dynamics365/business-central/admin-scheduled-synchronization-using-the-synchronization-job-queue-entries#about-inactivity-timeouts). |
|Waiting | Only relevant for job queue entries that are assigned a category code. Indicates that the job is scheduled, but the underlying scheduled task isn't active. After the job queue entry that's currently running and is in the same category finishes, the status of the next job in the category with the status Waiting becomes Ready. |
| Error | Something went wrong. Choose **Show Error** to show the error message. |
| Finished | The job queue entry is complete. |

### About On Hold

Setting a job queue entry to **On Hold** doesn't affect a job that's already running. After a job starts, it continues to run until completion, regardless of any subsequent changes made to the job queue entry, such as putting it on hold.<br><br>The **On Hold** status is typically used to prevent a job from automatically starting when it reaches its scheduled start time. It allows you to temporarily pause a job before it begins processing. <br><br>If you need to stop or cancel a running job, you can manually intervene in the process. For example, you can stop the corresponding session or process.

### To view status for any job

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Job Queue Entries**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Job Queue Entries** page, select a job queue entry, and then choose the **Log Entries** action.  

> [!TIP]
> For in-depth analysis based on telemetry, you can use Application Insights in Microsoft Azure to review the status of job queue entries. To learn more about telemetry, go to [Monitoring and Analyzing Telemetry](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/telemetry-overview) and [Analyzing Job Queue Lifecycle Trace Telemetry](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/telemetry-job-queue-lifecycle-trace).

## View scheduled tasks

The **Scheduled Tasks** page in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] shows which tasks are ready to run in the job queue. The page also shows information about the company that each task is set up to run in. However, only tasks that are marked as belonging to the current environment can run.  

For example, all scheduled tasks stop if the company is in an environment that's a copy of another environment. Use the **Scheduled Tasks** page to set tasks as ready to run in the job queue.  

> [!NOTE]
> Internal administrators and licensed users can schedule tasks to run. Delegated administrators can set up and schedule tasks to run, but only licensed users can run them.

## The My Job Queue part

The **My Job Queue** part on your home page shows the job queues entries that you started but aren't finished. By default the part isn't displayed, but you can add it to your home page. To learn more about personalization, go to [Personalize Your Workspace](ui-personalization-user.md).  

The part shows the following information:

* Which documents with your ID in the **User ID** field are being processed or are queued, including documents that are posting in the background.
* Whether there was an error when posting a document or in the job queue entry.

The My Job Queue part also lets you cancel a document posting.

> [!TIP]
> Another useful feature is the **Job Queue Tasks** cue on your home page. The cue makes it easy to monitor job queue entries based on their status. To learn more, go to [The Job Queue Tasks cue](#the-job-queue-tasks-cue).

### To view an error from the My Job Queue part

1. On an entry with the status **Error**, choose the **Show Error** action.
2. Review the error message and fix the problem.

## The Job Queue Tasks cue

The **Job Queue Tasks** cue on your home page makes it easy to keep an eye on your job queue entries. The cue shows tiles for three statuses:

* Tasks Failed: These tasks need attention. Tasks display in this tile after they exceed the maximum number of attempts to run that you specified for the job queue entry. To learn more, go to [Handle job queue entry issues](#handle-job-queue-entry-issues).
* Tasks in Process: These tasks are running.
* Tasks in Queue: These tasks are waiting their turn.

You can configure the **Job Queue Tasks** cue to use color indicators, so it's easy to know when job queue entries need attention. To learn more about color indicators for cues, go to [Set Up a Colored Indicator on Cues for the Company or Individual Users](admin-how-set-up-colored-indicator-on-cues.md).

## Handle job queue entry issues

Job queue entries stop running when there's an error. For example, this can be a problem when an entry connects to an external service, such as a bank feed. If the service is temporarily not available and the job queue entry can't connect, the entry will show an error and stop running. You'll have to manually restart the job queue entry. However, the **Maximum No. of Attempts** and **Rerun Delay (sec.)** fields can help you avoid this situation. The **Maximum No. of Attempts** field lets you specify how many times the job queue entry can fail before it stops trying to run. The **Rerun Delay (sec.)** field lets you specify the amount of time, in seconds, between attempts. The combination of these two fields might keep the job queue entry running until the external service becomes available.

If a job queue entry shows an error, your first option to resolve the issue is to restart the job queue entry. You can set the status of the job queue entry to **On Hold** and then to **Ready**, or just restart it.

If a restart doesn't help, the issue might be in the code. You can find the owner (also called the *publisher*) of the code in the AL stack trace in the Job Queue log. If the error comes from an app/extension, contact your Microsoft partner. If the error comes from a Microsoft application, open a support request with Microsoft.

If you contact your Microsoft partner or Microsoft for support, provide the following information:

* The ID of the job queue entry runs where the error occurred
* The timestamp of when the error occurred
* Your timezone

> [!TIP]
> Depending on whether your [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is earlier or later than version 22.1, gather the information in the following ways:
>
> * For earlier versions, provide a screenshot of the **Job Queue Log Entries** page.
> * For later versions, use the **Copy details** action on the Job Queue Log Entries page to copy the information (job queue ID, timestamp, and your timezone).

### Get notified when a job queue entry fails

If something goes wrong and a job queue entry fails, or isn't scheduled for some reason, you might want to be notified so you can react quickly. You can set up notifications to alert you, your job queue administrator, or both. The notification lets you:

* Restart the job queue entry, which is typically the first thing to try.
* Go directly to details about the failure.

To set up notifications for job queue entry failures, start the **Set Up Job Queue Notifications** assisted setup guide from the **Assisted Setup** page. Use the guide to enter the following settings:

* Who to notify about a failure. You can notify the person who started the job queue entry, or job queue entry administrators, or both.
* How you want to be notified. You can turn on in-product notifications that show at the top of your home page.

   :::image type="content" source="media/in product notification example.png" alt-text="Shows a notification at the top of a home page.":::

   Or, use [external business events](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/business-events-overview#query-business-central-catalog-of-business-events-in-dataverse) to start a Power Automate flow. You can specify when, how, and who to notify for the flow. Your Power Automate flow must subscribe to the **Job queue task failed** event. To make it easier to create a flow that uses external business events, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides the [Notify in Outlook when Job Queue in Business Central fails](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2288541) Power Platform template. An assisted setup guide helps you get set up in just a few steps. To learn more about Power Automate flows, go to [Use Power Automate flows in Business Central](/dynamics365/business-central/across-how-use-financials-data-source-flow).
* When you want to be notified. You can choose to be notified immediately, or specify thresholds to be notified only after a number of job queue entries fail.

After you set up notifications, you can always turn them on or off. On the **My Notifications** page, for the **Job Queue Failed Notification**, select or clear the **Enabled** checkbox.

## Monitor the job queue with telemetry

Administrators can use [Azure Application Insights](/azure/azure-monitor/app/app-insights-overview) to gather and analyze telemetry that helps identify problems. To learn more about telemetry, go to [Monitoring and Analyzing Telemetry](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/telemetry-overview) and [Analyzing Job Queue Lifecycle Trace Telemetry](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/telemetry-job-queue-lifecycle-trace).

Telemetry lets administrators set up alerts on job queue issues that send a text message, email, or a message in Teams if something isn't right. To learn more about these alerts, go to [Alert on Telemetry](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/telemetry-alert).

# Process purchase returns or cancellations

If you want to return items to your vendor or cancel services you purchased, you can create and post a purchase credit memo that specifies the requested change to the original purchase invoice. To include the correct purchase invoice information, you can create the purchase credit memo directly from the posted purchase invoice or you can create a new purchase credit memo with copied invoice information.

If you need more control of the purchase return process, such as warehouse documents for the item handling or better overview when shipping back items from multiple purchase documents with one purchase return, then you can create purchase return orders. A purchase return order automatically issues the related purchase credit memo. Learn more at [To create a purchase return order based on one or more a posted purchase documents](purchasing-how-process-purchase-returns-cancellations.md#to-create-a-purchase-credit-memo-from-a-posted-purchase-invoice).

> [!NOTE]  
> If a posted purchase invoice isn't paid, you can use the **Correct** or **Cancel** actions on the posted purchase invoice to automatically reverse the transactions. These actions only work for unpaid invoices, and they don't support partial returns or cancellations. Also, you can't correct or cancel purchase invoices that were posted with receipts from more than one purchase order. Learn more at [Correct or Cancel Unpaid Purchase Invoices](purchasing-how-correct-cancel-unpaid-purchase-invoices.md).

Typically, you create a purchase credit memo or purchase return order in reaction to a credit memo sent to you by a vendor. You can use purchase credit memos or purchase return orders to document your credit memo process. For example, they're useful for accounting purposes or to control the shipping of the items.

The change might relate to all or only some of the products on the original purchase invoice. Accordingly, you can partially return received items or ask for partial reimbursement of received services. In that case, you must edit the information on the purchase credit memo or purchase return order.

In addition to the original posted purchase invoice, you can apply the purchase credit memo or purchase return order to other purchase documents. For example, another posted purchase invoice because you're also returning items delivered with that invoice.

The credit memo posting also reverts item charges that were assigned to the posted document, so that the item's value entries are the same as before you assigned the item charge.

## Inventory costing

To keep inventory valuation correct, you typically want to pick return items from inventory at the unit cost that they were purchased at, not at their current unit cost. This process is referred to as exact cost reversing.

There are two actions that assign exact cost reversing automatically.  

|Function|Description|  
|------------------|---------------------------------------|  
|**Get Posted Document Lines to Reverse** action on the **Purchase Return Order** page|Copies lines of one or more posted documents to be reversed into the purchase return order. Learn more at [To create a purchase return order based on one or more posted purchase documents](purchasing-how-process-purchase-returns-cancellations.md#to-create-a-purchase-return-order-based-on-one-or-more-posted-purchase-documents).|  
|**Copy from Document** action on the **Purchase Credit Memo** and **Purchase Return Order** pages|Copies both the header and lines of one posted document to reverse.<br /><br /> Requires that the **Exact Cost Reversing Mandatory** checkbox is selected on the **Purchases & Payables Setup** page.|

To assign exact cost reversing manually, choose the **Appl.-from Item Entry** field on any type of return document line, and then select the number of the original purchase entry. This setting links the purchase credit memo or purchase return order to the original purchase sales entry. It also ensures that the item is valued at the original unit cost.

## To create a purchase credit memo from a posted purchase invoice

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Posted Purchase Invoices**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Posted Purchase Invoices** page, select the posted purchase invoice that you want to reverse, and then choose the **Create Corrective Credit Memo** action.

    Most fields on the purchase credit memo header are filled with the information from the posted purchase invoice. You can edit all the fields, for example with new information that reflects the return agreement.
3. Edit information on the lines according to the agreement, such as the number of items returned or the amount to be reimbursement.
4. Choose the **Apply Entries** action.
5. On the **Apply Vendor Entries** page, select the line with the posted purchase document that you want to apply the purchase credit memo to, and then choose the **Applies-to ID** action. The number of the purchase credit memo is inserted in the **Applies-to ID** field.
6. In the **Amount to Apply** field, enter the amount that you want to apply if smaller than the original amount.

    At the bottom of the **Apply Vendor Entries** page, you can see the total amount to apply to reverse all involved entries, namely when the value in the **Balance** field is zero.
7. Choose the **OK** button. When you post the purchase credit memo, it's applied to the specified posted purchase documents.
8. Choose the **Post** action.

The posted purchase invoices that you apply the credit memo to are now reversed. If you already paid the original invoice, the vendor should now refund the payment to you. If the credit memo is only for part of the product on the original invoice, you might only pay the remaining amount on the original purchase invoice to close it.

The purchase credit memo is removed and replaced with a new document in the list of posted purchase credit memos.

## To create a purchase credit memo by copying a posted purchase invoice

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Credit Memos**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action to open a new empty purchase credit memo.
3. In the **Vendor** field, enter the name of an existing vendor.
4. Choose the **Copy from Document** action.
5. On the **Copy Purchase Document** page, in the **Document Type** field, select **Posted Invoice**.
6. Choose the **Document No.** field to open the **Posted Purchase Invoices** page, and then select the posted purchase invoice that contains lines that you want to reverse.
7. Select the **Recalculate Lines** check box if you want the copied posted purchase invoice lines to be updated with any changes in item price and unit cost since the invoice was posted.
8. Choose the **OK** button. The copied invoice lines are inserted in the purchase credit memo.
9. Complete the purchase credit memo as explained in [To create a purchase credit memo from a posted purchase invoice](purchasing-how-process-purchase-returns-cancellations.md#to-create-a-purchase-credit-memo-from-a-posted-purchase-invoice).

## To create a purchase return order based on one or more posted purchase documents

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Return Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. Fill in the fields on the **General** FastTab as necessary.
4. On the **Lines** FastTab, fill the lines manually, or copy information from other documents to fill the lines automatically:

    - Use the **Get Posted Document Lines to Reverse** action to copy one or more posted document lines from one or more posted documents. This action always exactly reverses the costs from the posted document line.
    - Use the **Copy from Document** action to copy an entire existing document to the return order. It can be either a posted or unposted document. This action only enables exact cost reversing when the **Exact Cost Reversing Mandatory** checkbox is selected on the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page.  

5. Choose the **Get Posted Document Lines to Reverse** action.
6. At the top of the **Posted Purchase Document Lines** page, select the **Show Reversible Lines Only** checkbox if you only want lines that have quantities that aren't yet returned. For example, if a posted purchase invoice quantity was already returned, you might not want to include that quantity on a new purchase return document.

    > [!NOTE]  
    > This field only works for posted receipts and posted invoice lines. It doesn't work for posted return or posted credit memo lines.  

    The left side of the page lists the different document types. The number in brackets shows the number of documents available of each document type.

7. In the **Document Type Filter** field, select the type of posted document lines you want to use.  
8. Select the lines that you want to copy to the new document.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > If you use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd> to select all lines, all lines within the filter you set are copied, but the **Show Reversible Quantity Only** filter is ignored. For example, suppose you filtered the lines to a particular document number with two lines, and one of which was already returned. Even if the **Show Reversible Quantity Only** field is selected, if you select <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd> to copy all lines, both lines are copied, instead of only the one that isn't reversed.  

9. Choose the **OK** button to copy the lines to the new document.  

    The following processes occur:  

    - For posted document lines of the type **Item**, a new document line is created as a copy of the posted document line, with the quantity that isn't reversed yet. The **Appl.-to Item Entry** field shows the number of the item ledger entry of the posted document line.  

    - For posted document lines that aren't of the type **Item**, such as item charges, a new document line is created as a copy of the original posted document line.  

    - Calculates the **Unit Cost (LCY)** field on the new line from the costs on the corresponding item ledger entries.  

    - If the copied document is a posted shipment, posted receipt, posted return receipt, or posted return shipment, the unit price is calculated automatically from the item.  

    - If the copied document is a posted invoice or credit memo, the unit price, invoice discounts, and line discounts from the posted document line are copied.  

    - If the posted document line contains item tracking lines, the **Appl.-to Item Entry** field on the item tracking lines is filled with the appropriate item ledger entry numbers from the posted item tracking lines.  

     When you copy from a posted invoice or posted credit memo, you copy the invoice discounts and line discounts that were valid at the time the document posted. Be aware, however, that if the **Calc. Inv. Discount** toggle on the **Purchases & Payables Setup** page is turned on, the invoice discount recalculates when you post the new document line. The amount for the new line might therefore be different than the line amount for the posted document line, depending on the new calculation of the invoice discount.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > If part of the quantity of the posted document line is reversed, sold, or consumed, a line is created for the quantity that remains in inventory or that wasn't returned. If the full quantity of the posted document line was already reversed, a new document line isn't created.  
    >
    > If the flow of goods in the posted document is the same as the flow of goods in the new document, a copy of the original posted document line in the new document is created. The **Appl.-from Item Entry** field isn't filled in because exact cost reversing isn't possible. For example, if you use the **Get Posted Document Lines to Reverse** action to get a posted purchase credit memo line for a new purchase credit memo, only the original posted credit memo line is copied to the new credit memo.  

10. On the **Purchase Return Order** page, in the **Return Reason Code** field on each line, select the reason for the return.
11. Choose the **Post** action.

## To create a replacement purchase order from a purchase return order

You might agree with your vendor that they compensate you for a purchased item by replacing the item. The replacement item can be the same or it can be different. This situation could occur if the vendor mistakenly shipped the wrong item.  

1. On the **Purchase Return Order** page for an active return process, on an empty line, make a negative entry for the replacement item by entering a negative amount in the **Quantity** field.  
2. Choose the **Move Negative Lines** action.  
3. On the **Move Negative Purchase Lines** page, fill in the fields as necessary.
4. Choose the **OK** button. The negative line is deleted from the purchase return order, and a new purchase order is created. Learn more at [Record Purchases](purchasing-how-record-purchases.md).  

## To create a purchase allowance

If you receive items that what you want, for example, the items are damaged, the wrong color, or the wrong size, the vendor might offer you a purchase allowance.  

You can post this reduced purchase cost as an item charge on a credit memo or return order and link it to the posted receipt. The following steps describe it for a purchase return order, but the same steps apply to a purchase credit memo.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Credit Memos**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action to open a new empty purchase credit memo.  
3. Fill in the credit memo header with information about the vendor who sent you the purchase allowance.  
4. On the **Lines** FastTab, in the **Type** field, select **Charge (Item)**.  
5. In the **No.** field, select the appropriate item charge value.  

    You might want to create a special item charge number to cover purchase allowances.  
6. In the **Quantity** field, enter **1**.  
7. In the **Direct Unit Cost** field, enter the amount of the purchase allowance.  
8. Assign the purchase allowance as an item charge to the items in the posted receipt. For more information, see [Use Item Charges to Account for Additional Trade Costs](payables-how-assign-item-charges.md). After you assign the allowance, return to the **Purchase Credit Memo** page.

When you post the purchase return order, the purchase allowance is added to the relevant purchase entry amount. In this way, you can maintain accurate inventory valuation.  

## To combine return shipments

If you want to return items covered by different purchase return orders to the same vendor, you can use the **Combine Return Shipments** action.  

When you ship the items, you post the related purchase return orders as shipped, which creates posted purchase return shipments.  

When you're ready to invoice these items, instead of invoicing each purchase return order separately, you can create a purchase credit memo and automatically copy the posted purchase return shipment lines to it. Then you can post the purchase credit memo and invoice all the open purchase return orders at the same time.  

When return shipments are combined on a credit memo and posted, then a posted purchase credit memo is created for the invoiced lines. The **Quantity Invoiced** field on the originating purchase return order is updated based on the invoiced quantity. However, the original purchase return order isn't deleted, even if it was fully received and invoiced. You must delete the purchase return order manually.

> [!NOTE]  
> The following procedure assumes that there are several purchase return orders for the vendor, and that they're posted as shipped.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Credit Memos**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. On the **General** FastTab, fill in the fields as necessary.  
4. Choose the **Get Return Shipment Lines** action.  
5. Select multiple return shipment lines that you want to include in the invoice.  

    If an incorrect return shipment line was selected or you want to start over, you can just delete the lines on the purchase credit memo and then use the **Get Return Shipment Lines** action again.  
6. Choose the **Post** action.  

### To remove open purchase return orders after combined return shipment posting  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Delete Invoiced Purchase Return Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary, and then choose the **OK** button.  
3. Alternatively, delete the individual purchase return orders manually.

# Adjust item costs

The cost of an item (inventory value) that you purchase and later sell might change during its lifetime, for example because a freight cost is added to its purchase cost after you sell the item. Cost adjustment is especially relevant in situations where you sell goods before you invoice the purchase of those goods. To always know the correct inventory value, you should regularly adjust item costs. Correct costs help ensure that sales and profit statistics are up to date and that financial KPIs are correct. To learn more, go to [Design Details: Cost Adjustment](design-details-cost-adjustment.md).

The value in the **Unit Cost** field on the item card is based on the standard cost for items with the Standard costing method. For items with any other costing method, the value is based on the calculation of available inventory (invoiced costs and expected costs) divided by the quantity on hand.

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], item costs are automatically adjusted every time that an inventory transaction occurs, such as when posting a purchase invoice for an item. However, you can also manually adjust the costs of one or more items if needed. For example, manual adjustments are useful when you know that item costs are changed for reasons other than item transactions.

For both automatic and manual adjustments, item costs are adjusted by the FIFO or the Average costing method, depending on your selection in the **Set Up My Company** assisted setup guide or in the **Costing Method** field on the item card. To learn more, go to [Register New Items](inventory-how-register-new-items.md).  

For the FIFO costing method, an item’s unit cost is the actual value of any receipt of the item. Inventory is valued with the assumption that the first items placed in inventory are sold first.

If you use the Average costing method, then an item’s unit cost is calculated as the average unit cost at each point in time after a purchase. Inventory is valuated with the assumption that all inventories are sold simultaneously. For items that use this costing method, you can choose the **Unit Cost** field on the item card to view the history of transactions that the average cost is calculated from

Cost adjustment processes only value entries that aren't adjusted. In a situation where changed inbound costs need to be forwarded to related outbound entries, it creates new adjustment value entries. The adjustment value entries are based on the information in the original value entries but contain the adjustment amount. The cost adjustment function uses the posting date of the original value entry in the adjustment entry, unless that date is in a closed inventory period. In that case, application uses the starting date of the next open inventory period. If inventory periods aren't used, then the date in the **Allow Posting From** field on the **General Ledger Setup** page defines when the adjustment entry is posted.

## To adjust item costs manually

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Adjust Cost - Item Entries**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** page, specify which items to adjust costs for.
3. Choose the **OK** button.

## Track item cost adjustments

Item costs can change for many reasons, so it's important that you can keep track of cost adjustments. Use the **Inventory Cost Adjustment** page to manage and monitor the cost adjustment process. This page displays items along with their costing parameters and cost adjustment status. You can filter the list to focus on items that require adjustment or that are excluded from the cost adjustment process. To learn more about tracking cost adjustments, go to [Track item cost adjustments](finance-track-inventory-costs.md).

# Prod. Order List (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2025w1](includes/applies-to-2025w1.md)]

The **Prod. Order List** report organizes production orders and offers a mix of high-level summaries, categorical insights, and access to detailed records. It helps you efficiently evaluate key metrics, including costs and order counts, while enabling deeper exploration of specific details. For example, statuses, source items, and document-level dates. This report also lets you track planned versus finished output and analyze variances across production orders.

:::image type="content" source="media/manufacturing/prod-order-list-v26.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Prod Order List Power BI Report" lightbox="media/manufacturing/prod-order-list-v26.png":::

The **Total Actual Cost** key performance indicator (KPI) card presents KPIs related to cost analysis. The primary KPI is the **Actual Total Cost**, serving as the central metric for monitoring actual manufacturing costs. Below this metric, comparative measures such as **Total Expected Cost** and **Total Standard Cost** are provided, offering context for evaluating cost performance. Additionally, variance percentages display for these measures, highlighting the deviations relative to the actual total cost.

The **No. of Production Orders by Status** chart shows the distribution of production orders based on their statuses. The chart uses the **No. of Production Orders** measure to calculate the distinct count of production orders, while the production order **Status** field acts as the dimension to classify orders into categories such as **Released**, **Planned**, and **Finished**.

The **No. of Production Orders by Source Item** chart displays the distribution of production orders based on their originating source items. It uses the **No. of Production Orders** measure to calculate the distinct count of production orders, while the **Source No.** field serves as the dimension to classify orders by their source items.

The **Prod. Order List Details** table serves as the final visual on the page, offering document-level details for each production order. The key fields in the table are:

- Status
- Production Order No.
- Source No.
- Routing No.
- Starting, ending, and due dates
- Planned Quantity
- Finished Quantity
- Variance quantity

When used in conjunction with the bar charts, this table provides deeper context and lets you analyze the highlighted dimensions in greater detail and gain a more comprehensive understanding of the data.

## Use the report

Manufacturing Managers use the **Prod. Order List** report to monitor key metrics and ensure efficient production operations. The **Total Actual Cost** KPI card helps you analyze manufacturing costs by comparing **Actual Total Cost** with **Total Expected Cost** and **Total Standard Cost**. The variance percentages highlight any significant deviations. The **No. of Production Orders by Status** and **No. of Production Orders by Source Item** charts let you quickly assess production progress and resource allocation. By analyzing these visuals together with the **Prod. Order List Details** table, you can evaluate planned versus finished output, identify variances, and make data-driven decisions to address issues like cost overruns or production delays.

Production supervisors rely on the **Prod. Order List** report to manage day-to-day operations and keep production on schedule. The **No. of Production Orders by Status** chart helps you monitor the distribution of orders across different stages, enabling you to spot bottlenecks or delays. The **Prod. Order List Details** table provides document-level details, such as planned and finished quantities, starting and due dates, and routing information, allowing you to track specific orders closely. Using the **No. of Production Orders by Source Item** chart, you can assess how production orders are distributed across source items, facilitating better resource planning. Together, these insights support more effective coordination and progress updates for smooth production workflows.

## Key performance indicators (KPIs)

The Prod. Order List report includes the following KPIs and measures:

- [Actual Total Cost](manufacturing-powerbi-kpis.md#total-actual-cost)
- [Expected Total Cost](manufacturing-powerbi-kpis.md#total-expected-cost)
- [Standard Total Cost](manufacturing-powerbi-kpis.md#total-standard-cost)
- [Total Expected Cost Dev %](manufacturing-powerbi-kpis.md#total-expected-cost-dev-percent)

# Set Up Statuses for Service Orders and Repairs

You must set up repair status options that identify the progress of repair and maintenance of service items in service orders. You must set up at least nine repair status options that identify situations or actions taken when servicing service items.  

You can set the priority level for service order status options. The four priorities are **High**, **Medium High**, **Medium Low**, and **Low**.  

When you change the repair status of a service item in a service order, the service order status is updated. The repair status of each service item is linked to the service order status. If the service items are linked to two or more service order status options, the service order status with the highest priority is selected.  

Before you can set up a repair status, you must set up service status priorities.

## To set up service status priorities

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Order Status**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the service order status you want to set a priority for.  
3. In the **Priority** field, choose the priority you want for this service order status.  

Repeat steps 2 and 3 until you have set the priority for each of the four status options: **Pending**, **In Process**, **Finished**, and **On Hold**.  

## To set up a repair status

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Repair Status**, and then choose the related link.
2. Create a new repair status.  
3. Fill in the **Code** and **Description** fields.  
4. In the **Service Order Status** field, choose the order status to link the repair status to. The **Priority** field displays the priority of the service order status you have chosen.  
5. Choose a repair status. You can choose only one. A repair status cannot be linked more than one repair status option.  
6. To be able to post service orders, including service items, with this repair status, choose the **Posting Allowed** field.  
7. To be able to manually change the service order status option to **Pending** in service orders including service items with this repair status, choose the **Pending Status Allowed** check box.  
8. Choose the **In Process Status Allowed**, **Finished Status Allowed**, and **On Hold Status Allowed** check boxes in the same way.

Repeat these steps for each of the repair status options you want to create.

# Post Multiple Documents at the Same Time

Instead of posting individual documents one by one, you can select multiple non-posted documents in a list for immediate posting or for batch posting according to a schedule, such as at the end of the day. This may be useful if only a supervisor can post documents created by other users or to avoid system performance issues from posting during work hours.

## To post multiple purchase orders immediately

The following procedure explains how to post multiple purchase orders immediately. The steps are similar for all purchase and sales documents.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Orders**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Purchase Orders** page, proceed to select all orders to be posted:
3. In the **No.** field, choose the three vertical dots to open the context menu, and then choose the **Select More** action.
4. Select the check box for all the lines representing orders that you want to post at the same time.
5. Choose the **Posting** action, and then choose the **Post** action.
6. Choose the **Yes** button on the confirmation message.

## To batch post multiple purchase orders

The following procedure explains how to batch post purchase orders. The steps are similar for all purchase and sales documents where the **Batch Post** action is available.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Purchase Orders** page, proceed to select all orders to be posted:
3. In the **No.** field, choose the three vertical dots to open the context menu, and then choose the **Select More** action.
4. Select the check box for all the lines representing orders that you want to post at the same time.
5. Choose the **Posting** action, and then choose the **Post Batch** action.
6. On the **Batch Post Purchase Order** page, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
7. Choose the **OK** button.
8. To view potential issues that occurred during batch posting of documents, open the **Error Message Register** page.

> [!NOTE]
> Posting of multiple documents might take some time and block other users. Consider enabling background posting. For more information, see [Use Job Queues to Schedule Tasks](admin-job-queues-schedule-tasks.md).

## To set up background posting with job queues
Job queues are an effective tool to schedule the running of business processes in the background, such as when multiple users are trying to post sales orders, but only one order can be processed at a time.  

The following procedure explains how to set up background posting of sales orders. The steps are similar for purchasing.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales & Receivables Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page, choose the **Post with Job Queue** check box.
3. Choose the **Job Queue Category Code** field, and then specify the **SALESPOST** code.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Some jobs change the same data and should not run at the same time because that can cause conflicts. For example, background jobs for sales documents will try to modify the same data at the same time. Job queue categories help prevent these kinds of conflicts by ensuring that when one job is running, another job that belongs to the same job queue category will not run until it finishes. For example, a job that belongs to a Sales job queue category will wait until all other sales related jobs are done. You specify a job queue category on the **Background Posting** FastTab on the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page.
    >
    > [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides job queue categories for sales, purchase, and general ledger posting. We recommend that one of these, or one that you create, is always specified. If you experience failures due to conflicts, consider setting up a category for all sales, purchase, and general ledger background posting.

    If you also want sales documents to be printed when they are posted, select the **Post & Print with Job Queue** check box on the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page.  
    If you select **PDF** in the **Report Output Type** field, successfully posted purchase orders will be available in the **Report Inbox** part on your Role Center.

    > [!IMPORTANT]  
    > If you set up a job that will post and print documents, and the printer displays a dialog box, such as a request for credentials or a warning about low printer ink, your document is posted but not printed. The corresponding job queue entry eventually times out and the **Status** field is set to **Error**. Accordingly, we recommend that you do not use a printer setup that requires interaction with the display of printer dialog boxes in conjunction with background posting.

    Next time that you post sales documents, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically creates a job queue entry for each document and run the jobs in the background, one by one.

4. To verify that the job queue is working as expected, post a sales order. For more information, see [Sell Products](sales-how-sell-products.md).
    The sales order will now be added to a dedicated job queue entry, which defines when the documents are posted. 

### To view status from a sales or purchase document
If the job queue cannot post the sales order, the status is changed to **Error** and the sales order is added to the list of sales orders that the user must handle manually.
1. From the document that you have tried to post with background posting, choose the **Job Queue Status** field, which will contain **Error**.
2. Review the error message and fix the problem.

Alternatively, you can review on the **Job Queue Log Entries** page if the sales order was posted successfully. For more information, see the [Monitor the job queue](#monitor-the-job-queue) section.

## To create a job queue entry for batch posting of sales orders

Alternatively, you can postpone postings for when it is convenient for your organization. For example, in your business it might make sense to run certain routines when most of the data entry for the day has concluded. You can achieve this by setting the job queue up to run various batch-posting reports, such as the **Batch Post Sales Orders**, **Batch Post Sales Invoices**, and similar reports. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports background posting for all sales, purchasing, and service documents.

The following procedure shows how to set the **Batch Post Sales Orders** report up to automatically post sales orders at 4 PM on weekdays.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Job Queue Entries**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. In the **Object Type to Run** field, select **Report**.  
4. In the **Object ID to Run** field, select 296, **Batch Post Sales Orders**.

   You can also use following reports:
  
   * 900 **Batch Post Assembly Orders**
   * 497 **Batch Post Purchase Invoices**
   * 496 **Batch Post Purchase Orders**
   * 498 **Batch Post Purch. Credit Memos**
   * 6665 **Batch Post Purch. Ret. Orders**
   * 298 **Batch Post Sales Credit Memos**
   * 297 **Batch Post Sales Invoices**
   * 296 **Batch Post Sales Orders**
   * 6655 **Batch Post Sales Return Orders**
   * 6005 **Batch Post Service Cr. Memos**
   * 6004 **Batch Post Service Invoices**
   * 6001 **Batch Post Service Orders**

5. Select the **Report Request Page** check box.
6. In the **Batch Post Sales Orders** request page, define what is included during automatic posting of sales orders, and then choose the **OK** button.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Remember to set strict filters; otherwise, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will post all documents, even if they are not ready. Consider setting a filter on the **Status** field for the value *Released*, and a filter on the **Posting Date** field for the value *..today*. For more information, see [Sorting, Searching, and Filtering](ui-enter-criteria-filters.md).
7. Select all check boxes from **Run on Mondays** through **Run on Fridays**.
8. In the **Starting Time** field, enter 4 PM.
9. Choose the **Set Status to Ready** action.

Sales orders that are within defined filters will now be posted every weekday at 4 PM.

## Monitor the job queue

If you set up background posting with job queues, make it a regular task to monitor the job queue to catch any issues. You can track the status in the **Job Queue Entries** page. For more information, see [Use Job Queues to Schedule Tasks](admin-job-queues-schedule-tasks.md).  

As an administrator, you can use [Application Insights](/azure/azure-monitor/app/app-insights-overview) to gather and analyze telemetry that you can use to identify problems. For more information, see [Monitoring and Analyzing Telemetry](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/telemetry-overview) in the developer and administration content.

# Print the picking list

You can print an inventory picking list directly from a sales order and other documents that initiate the shipment of items.

This report is typically used in companies without dedicated functionality for warehouse management, so that an inventory worker can view or print the picking list from the related sales document. In companies with higher volume or more complex processes, shipping and picking are planned and performed in dedicated warehouse documents. Learn more at [Outbound Warehouse Flow](design-details-outbound-warehouse-flow.md).

## To print a picking list from a sales order

The following procedure is based on a sales order. The steps are similar for all other documents that can be used to initiate shipment of items, such as a transfer order.

1. Choose the ![Search for Page or Report.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Sales Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the sales order that you want to pick items for.  
3. Choose the **Report** action, and then choose the **Picking List by Order** action.  
4. Choose the **Print** button to print the picking list or choose the **Preview** button to view it on the screen.

You can also save the picking list as a document, for example, to send to someone or to add as an attachment to the sales order. Learn more at [Manage Attachments, Links, and Notes on Cards and Documents](ui-how-add-link-to-record.md).

> [!NOTE]
> If you used the **Explode BOM** function on the sales order, then only the components of the related assembly item are shown in the report. Learn more at [Work with Bills of Material](inventory-how-work-BOMs.md).

## To print a single set of pick instructions for multiple sales documents

You can use filters to consolidate picking for several sales documents into a single set of pick instructions.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Orders**, and then choose the related link.
1. Choose the **Pick Instruction** action.
1. In the **Document Type** field, choose the type of document you're working with.
1. In the **No.** field, enter a filter to identify the documents. The following are examples of ways to filter.

   * To filter on a consecutive series of document numbers, enter the first and last document numbers separated by **..**. For example, **10000..10010**.
   * To filter on specific documents, enter each document number separated by a **|**. For example, **10000|10005|10010**.

# Create new companies in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the container for business data that belongs to a business unit or legal entity is referred to as a *company*. When you sign up for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you're given a demonstration company and an empty company, *My Company*. Switching between the companies is easy: just go to **My Settings** and move to the other company. But you can also create new companies in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] depending on your business needs.  

> [!NOTE]
> To create a new company, you must be assigned to the **Super** permission set.

When you create a new company, an assisted setup guide helps you get the basics in place. Then, you can import data from your legacy system or another company in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

[!INCLUDE [about-ui-learn](includes/about-ui-learn.md)]

## Choose the right template

If you decide to add a company to your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can use the **Create New Company** assisted setup guide to get started. The setup guide is available from the **Companies** page and from the lookup in the **Company** field on the **My Settings** page.  

The setup guide offers three templates and a blank option:

- **Evaluation - Sample Data**  
    Create a company that's similar to the demonstration company with sample data and setup data. This type of company is available to you without switching to a 30-day trial period, which the other types do.  
- **Advanced Evaluation - Complete Sample Data**
    Create a company with the Advanced functionality scope, which has everything you need to evaluate the product for companies with advanced processes. This type of company is available to you without switching to a 30-day trial period, which the other types do.
- **Production - Setup Data Only**  
    Create a company that's similar to **My Company**, with setup data such as a chart of accounts, payment methods, and financial report definitions, but without sample data. You can use this company for a 30-day trial period.
- **Create New - No Data**  
    Create a blank company without setup data. You can use this company for a 30-day trial period.  

If you want to get started easily with a new company, choose **Production - Setup Data Only** and then import your own business data, such as customers, items, and vendors. Choose the **New** template if you want to set up everything from scratch. In that case, you can use the **Company Setup** assisted setup guide to help you get started with essential setup data.  

> [!NOTE]  
> When you create a new company, it takes a few minutes before you can access it in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The setup status on the **Companies** page shows when the new company is ready for you. Then, you can switch to the new company by using **My Settings**.  

During your 30 day trial, you can create any number of new companies, but they're only available during your trial. For more information, contact your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] partner. See also the [Dynamics 365 Business Central trial FAQ](trial-faq.md) article.

## Set up the company

When you sign in to a new company, the **Company Setup** assisted setup guide helps you get started. The guide asks for information about your business, such as the address, bank details, and inventory costing method. This information forms the basis for many areas in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] so you don't have to set them up manually.  

For example, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes your company address in invoices and other documents and your bank information in payments. The costing method is used to calculate prices and inventory valuation.  

After the basics are in place, you can set up the remaining core areas. Then, you're ready to add business data, such as customers and vendors. For more information, see [Set Up [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]](setup.md).  

## Companies and environments

# Set Up Base Calendars

You can assign a base calendar to your company and its business partners, such as customers, vendors, or locations. Delivery and receipt dates on future sales order, purchase order, transfer order, and production order lines are calculated according to the calendar’s specified working days. The main task in setting up a new base calendar is to specify and define the non-working days that you want to apply.  

## To set up a base calendar

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Base Calendar**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Choose the **New** action.  
3.  Fill in the **Code** field.  
4. Choose the **Maintain Base Calendar Changes** action.
5. On the **Base Calendar Changes** page, use the **Recurring System** field to mark a particular date or day as a recurring nonworking day. You can select either the **Annual Recurring** or **Weekly Recurring** option.  

    If you select **Annual Recurring**, you must also enter the relevant date in the **Date** field.  

    If you select **Weekly Recurring**, you must also select the relevant day of the week in the **Day** field. If you leave the field empty, you must fill in the **Date** field. The **Day** field is filled in automatically.  

When you make an entry, the **Nonworking** field is selected. You can choose to clear the check mark to make it a working day.  
 When you return to the base calendar card, you will observe that the nonworking day entries that you made have been updated. These entries now appear in red and the **Nonworking** field is selected.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  When setting up a new base calendar, you can select and copy lines from an existing calendar. You do this in the relevant **Base Calendar Changes** page.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  Any base calendar defined for the vendor or the location affects how the dates are calculated and rounded to working days.
Specifies a date formula for the time that it takes to replenish the item. It is used to calculate the **Planned Receipt Date** field, if calculating forward, and **Order Date** field, if calculating backwards. See [Lead Time Calculation](across-how-to-assign-base-calendars.md#lead-time-calculation).

## Lead Time Calculation

Any base calendar defined for the vendor or the location affects how the dates are calculated and rounded to working days. Accordingly, the two date fields on purchase order lines are calculated as follows under different conditions.

|Calculation Direction|Vendor Calendar Defined|Vendor Calendar Not Defined|
|---------------------|-----------------------|---------------------------|
|Forward|planned receipt date = order date + vendor lead time (per the vendor calendar and rounded to the next working day in first the vendor calendar and then the location calendar)|planned receipt date = order date + vendor lead time (per the location calendar)|
|Backward|order date = planned receipt date - vendor lead time (per the vendor calendar and rounded to the previous working day in first the vendor calendar and then the location calendar)|order date = planned receipt date - vendor lead time (per the location calendar)|

> [!NOTE]
> In addition to the lead time calculation that affects the planned receipt date and order date, as shown in the above table, warehouse handling time and safety lead time may be added to the formulas to make up the value in the **Expected Receipt Date** field, as follows: Planned Receipt Date + Safety Lead Time + Inbound Warehouse Handling Time = Expected Receipt Date.

> [!Important]
> If your location uses a significantly different calendar than your vendors do, then it is important that you set up specific calendars for those vendors, to calculate optimal vendor lead times. For information about how to set up vendor calendars, see [To assign a base calendar](across-how-to-assign-base-calendars.md#to-assign-a-base-calendar).

The contents of the **Lead Time Calculation** field is copied from either the item card or the SKU card, if the lead time is defined for the item, or on the **Item Vendor Catalog** page, if the lead time is defined for the vendor.

## To customize a calendar
The main task in customizing a base calendar for your company, or one of its business partners, is to enter any changes to working and nonworking day status.

For example, while a base calendar would typically list all Saturdays as non-working days, the customized calendar for a particular location may list all Saturdays during the months of November and December, and leading up to the holiday season, as working days.

The following procedure uses the case of the location as an example. Note that at this point, you have already assigned a base calendar to the location.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Locations**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the location that you want to update, and then select the **Customized Calendar** field. Note that a calendar must be selected in the **Base Calendar Code** field.
3. On the **Customized Calendar Entries** page opens, choose the **Maintain Customized Calendar Changes** action.
4. In the **Customized Calendar Changes**, add lines for customized calendar entries.

    When you enter a line, the **Nonworking** check box is selected. You can clear the check box if you want to change the status to a working day.

    You can use the **Recurring System** field to set a particular date or day as a recurring nonworking day. You can select either the **Annual Recurring** or **Weekly Recurring** option.

    If you select **Annual Recurring**, you must also enter the relevant date in the **Date** field. If you select **Weekly Recurring**, you must also select the relevant day of the week in the **Day** field. If you leave the field empty, you must fill in the **Date** field. The **Day** field is then filled in automatically. This could be useful if you want to mark an individual date as a nonworking or working day.

5. Choose the **OK** button.

On the **Customized Calendar Entries** page, you will observe that the date entries are updated with the changes that you made.

On the Location card, you will observe that the **Customized Calendar** field contains **Yes**, indicating that a customized calendar has been set up.

> [!Important]
> If you do not fill in the **Location Code** field on an order line, your company’s calendar is used.


If you do not fill in the **Shipping Agent Code** field on the order line, your company’s calendar is used.

> [!NOTE]  
> If you make changes to a base calendar for which customized calendar changes exist, all existing customized calendars are updated automatically.

## To assign a base calendar  
The following procedure schedules delivery dates on sales order lines for a customer as an example.

Base calendars are assigned to your own company, customers, vendors, locations, and shipping agents as follows:  

-   On the **Company Information** and **Customer** cards, the base calendar is assigned on the **Shipping** FastTab.  
-   On the **Vendor** card, the base calendar is assigned on the **Receiving** FastTab.  
-   On the **Location** card, the base calendar is assigned on the **Warehouse** FastTab.  
-   On the **Shipping Agents** page, the base calendar is assigned on the **Shipping Agent Services** page.  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customers**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Open the **Customer** card for whom you will assign a base calendar.  
3.  On the **Shipping** FastTab, in the **Base Calendar Code** field, select the base calendar that you want to assign.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  -   If you do not assign a base calendar to a company, all dates are calculated as working days.  
> -   If you enter a blank location on an order line, all dates are calculated as working days.  
> -   Any base calendar defined for the vendor or the location affects how the dates are calculated and rounded to working days.

> [!NOTE]  
>  Before you can make customized calendar entries, you must first assign a base calendar to the company.

# Warehouse management overview

There are two things that are important to all businesses that physically move goods in and out of their warehouse:

* They have an overview of inventory levels and item placement in the warehouse.
* They can quickly and accurately receive, pick, and ship items.

To help businesses achieve those things, warehouse features in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] add the following capabilities to inventory management:

* Bins
* Warehouse shipments
* Inventory picks
* Movement worksheet

Implement these features in different combinations to tailor your warehouse processes for your business. Allow for increasing complexity as your company grows and your processes change.

## Overview of different configuration options

You can configure warehouse features in various ways. It's important to choose options that improve your processes without causing overhead. The following table gives an overview of typical configurations for dealing with physical goods.

|Complexity Level|Description|Settings|Bin Code|Example of Inbound Flow|Example of Outbound Flow|Example of Internal Flow|  
|---|----------------|----------|---------|------------------|------------------|------------------|
|No dedicated warehouse activity.|Posting from orders and journals.||Optional. Controlled by the **Bin Code is Mandatory** toggle.|Purchase order|Sales order| Production order -> Consumption journal|  
|Basic|Consolidated receive/ship posting for multiple orders.|**Require Receipt**<br>**Require Ship**.|Optional. Controlled by the Bin Code is Mandatory toggle|Purchase Orders -> Warehouse Receipt|Sales Order -> Warehouse Shipment|Same as above.|
|Basic|Order-by-order.|Purchase, Sales, Service & Transfer: Require Put-away or Require Pick. </br><br/> Production, Assembly, Projects: Inventory Picks, Inventory Movement, Inventory Put-Away </br></br>**NOTE**: You can still post receipts, shipments, consumption, output directly from the source documents at locations where you activated these settings.|Optional. Controlled by the **Bin Code is Mandatory** toggle.|Purchase Order -> Inventory Put-away|Sales Order -> Inventory Pick|Production Order -> Inventory Pick|
|Advanced|Consolidated receive/ship posting for multiple orders.<br /><br />Consolidated pick/put-away activities for multiple source documents.|Purchase, Sales, Service & Transfer: Require Receive + Require Put-away,</br> Require Ship + Require Pick</br></br> Production, Assembly, Projects: Warehouse Picks |Optional. Controlled by the Bin Code is Mandatory toggle|Purchase Orders -> Warehouse Receipt -> Warehouse Put-away|Sales Orders -> Warehouse Shipments -> Pick Worksheet -> Warehouse Picks| Production order -> Pick Worksheet -> Warehouse Picks -> Consumption journal|
|Advanced|Same as above + Directed pick/put-away activities|Directed Pick and Put-away (dependent toggles are enabled automatically)|Mandatory|Same as above.|Same as above.| Production order -> Pick Worksheet -> Warehouse Picks Consumption journal|

Complexity increases with the size of your organization and how many departments and people are involved. A process can be simple, for example, when the same person creates and posts a sales document. Processes can also be more complex, and involve several steps and people. The following steps are an example of a more complex process:

1. An order processor creates a sales order.
1. A warehouse manager creates pick instructions.
1. A warehouse employee finishes the flow by posting the warehouse shipment.

The types of documents you use in your warehouse activities also affect the level of complexity. For example, you can use warehouse receipt and warehouse put-away documents for your inbound flow, but use inventory pick documents for your outbound flow.

Another factor that impacts complexity is how your physical warehouse is represented in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Learn more at [Modeling the physical warehouse](#modeling-the-physical-warehouse).

## Modeling the physical warehouse

You have several options for representing the real-world setup of your warehouse in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Your choices determine how you work with warehouse features.

The placement of items can be shelves, locations, or bins, and there are pros and cons for each option.

### Locations and bins

To handle physical goods, you must have at least one location. You can use multiple locations or use bins to model your warehouse and organizational structure.

Typically, locations are the preferred way to organize operations that are distributed across geographic areas. In some cases, however, you might want to create several locations that are located at the same place. Using locations has the following advantages:

* Grant access by using the **Warehouse Employee** and **Responsibility Centers** pages.
* Define calendars, routings, and inbound and outbound handling times for date calculation and planning. Learn more at [About Planning Functionality](production-about-planning-functionality.md).
* Specify default dimensions and use different inventory posting setups.
* Set up planning parameters. Learn more at [Planning parameters](production-about-planning-functionality.md#planning-parameters).  
* Use different warehouse features for each location.

### Shelves and bins

If you always store an item in the same place, you can use the **Shelf No.** field on the **Item Card** or **Stock-keeping Unit Card** pages. This field can be a basic manual storage system in environments without bins. The field's value is copied from the item card to document lines and reports, but it's only informational. The value isn't used in warehouse activities or availability calculations.

Bins represent the basic warehouse structure, and are used to make suggestions about the placement of items:

* One or more fixed bins for an item.
* Bins for specific operations, such as a shipping bin or a production output bin.
* Bin capacity and weight restrictions (for directed put-away and pick only).
* Bin rating (for directed put-away and pick only).

## Typical warehouse workflow

The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the articles that describe them.

|**To**|**See**|  
|------------|-------------|  
|In a basic flow on an order-by-order basis, use an inventory put-away to record the receipt of items at locations, including any over-receipt. Or, if you're consolidating multiple orders in the receipt, use a warehouse receipt.|[Inbound flow](design-details-inbound-warehouse-flow.md)|
|Record the shipment of items from warehouse locations. On an order-by-order basis, use an inventory pick. Or, if you're consolidating multiple orders in the shipment, use a warehouse shipment.|[Outbound flow](design-details-outbound-warehouse-flow.md)|
|Handle items within the warehouse location. For example, when you move components to production or do a physical inventory count.|[Internal flow](design-details-internal-warehouse-flows.md)|

Set up the warehouse processes that are right for your business. Learn more at [Setting Up Warehouse Management](warehouse-setup-warehouse.md).

## Terminology related to warehouse management

### Complexity levels

We use the terms "basic" and "advanced" to differentiate between levels of complexity. This simple differentiation covers several levels of complexity in location setups, each supported by different warehouse documents. The most advanced level of warehousing is referred to as "Directed put-away and pick." To use directed put-away and pick for a location, turn on the **directed put-away and pick** toggle on the **Location Card** page.

### Warehouse flows

* Inbound flow - Move items into the warehouse location and make them available, such as purchases and inbound transfers.
* Outbound flow - Pick and ship items to customers or other locations.
* Internal flow - Handle items within a location. For example, move components to production or count physical inventory.

### Basic documents  

The following documents are used in basic warehouse flows.

* Inventory Put-away
* Inventory Picks
* Inventory Movement
* Item Journal
* Item Reclassification Journal

### Advanced documents  

The following documents are used in advanced warehouse flows.

* Warehouse Receipt
* Put-away Worksheet
* Warehouse Put-away
* Pick Worksheet
* Warehouse Picks
* Movement Worksheet
* Warehouse Movement
* Internal Warehouse Picks
* Internal Warehouse Put-away
* Bin Creation Worksheet
* Bin Content Creation Worksheet
* Warehouse Item Journal
* Warehouse Item Reclassification Journal

### Pages and settings

This section describes the concepts behind the key pages and settings for warehousing.

#### Bins and bin content

A bin is a storage device designed to contain discrete parts. It's the smallest container unit in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Item quantities in bins are referred to as *bin contents*. A lookup from the **Item** field or **Bin Code** field on any warehouse-related document line displays the calculated availability of the item in the bin.  

Bin contents can be **Fixed**, **Dedicated**, or **Default** to define how to use the bin content. Bins with none of these properties are referred to as *floating* bins.  

A fixed bin holds items that are assigned to the bin code. The fixed bin property ensures that even if the bin is emptied, the bin content doesn't disappear. You can select the bin again as soon as its contents are replenished.  

A dedicated bin holds bin content that can only be picked for the dedicated resource that uses the bin. For example, a machine center. Other nonpick content, such as outbound quantities on a shipment posting, can be consumed from a dedicated bin. Only bin content considered by the **Create Pick** algorithm is protected in a dedicated bin.  

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses the **Default** bin property to suggest bins for warehouse activities. At locations that use directed put-away and pick, the default bin property isn't used. At locations where bins are required, the property specifies where to place items in inbound flows. In outbound flows, the property specifies where to take items from.  

> [!NOTE]  
> If outbound items are in several bins, items are taken from the nondefault bins to empty that bin content first. The remaining items are taken from the default bin.  

You can have one default bin per item per location.  

#### Bin type

Locations that use directed put-away and pick can use bin types. Bin types control the activities that you allow for a bin. 

The following types of bins are available:  

|Bin Type|Description|  
|------------------|---------------------------------------|  
|RECEIVE|Items that are received but aren't put away.|  
|SHIP|Items that are picked for warehouse shipment lines but aren't posted as shipped.|  
|PUT AWAY|Typically, items to store in large units of measure but that you don't want to access for picking purposes. These bins aren't used for picking, either for production orders or shipments, so their use might be limited. This type of bin is useful when you purchase a large quantity of items. The bins should always have a low bin-ranking, so that items with higher-ranking PUTPICK bins are put away first. Regularly replenish this type of bin so that their items are available in PUTPICK or PICK type bins.|  
|PICK|Items to be used for picking only. You can only use movements to replenishment of these bins, not put-aways.|  
|PUTPICK|Items in bins that are suggested for both put-aways and picks. Bins of this type probably have different bin rankings. Set up your bulk storage bins with lower bin rankings than ordinary pick bins or bins in your forward picking area.|  
|QC|This bin is used for inventory adjustments if you specify this bin on the location card in the **Adjustment Bin Code** field. You can also set up bins of this type for defective items and items being inspected. You can move items to this type of bin if you want to make them inaccessible to the usual item flow. **Note:**  Unlike all other bin types, the **QC** bin type has none of the item handling checkboxes selected by default. Content you place in a QC bin is excluded from item flows.|  

You can operate your warehouse with all of the eight possible bin types, or you can choose to operate with just the RECEIVE, PUTPICK, SHIP, and QC bin types. These four bin types enable suggestions to be made that support the flow of items and allow you to record inventory discrepancies.
With the exceptions of the PICK, PUTPICK, and PUTAWAY types of bins, the bin type defines the activity allowed for a bin. For example, you can only use a RECEIVE type of bin to receive items or pick items from.  

> [!NOTE]  
> You must use movements to move items to RECEIVE and QC bins. Similarly, use movements to move items from SHIP and QC bins.  

#### Bin ranking

In advanced warehousing, you can automate and optimize how to collect items in put-away and pick worksheets by ranking bins. Items are suggested for picks and put-aways based on the bin ranks.

Put-away processes are optimized according to bin ranking by suggesting higher-ranking bins before lower-ranking bins. Pick processes suggest items with the highest bin ranking from bin content first. Bin replenishment suggests lower-ranking bins before higher-ranking bins.  

Bin ranking and bin contents are the basic properties that guide warehouse employees in the warehouse.  

#### Bin setup

In advanced warehousing, you can specify the following capacity values to control how, and in which, bins you store items:

* Quantity
* Total cubage
* Weight  

You can assign a base unit of measure (UOM) to items. A base UOM might be pieces, pallets, liters, grams, or boxes. You can also create larger UOMs based on your base UOM. For example, if pieces are your base UOM, a pallet might equal 16 pieces.  

If an item has more than one UOM, set the maximum quantity for every UOM on the item card. If you handle an item in pieces and pallets, the **Max. Qty.** field on the **Bin Content** page for that item must also be in pieces and pallets. Otherwise, the allowed quantity for that bin isn't calculated correctly.  

Before you set capacity restrictions for bin contents on a bin, make sure that the UOM and dimensions of the item are set up on the item.  

> [!NOTE]  
> You can only use multiple UOMs at locations that use directed put-away and pick. In all other configurations, you can only use bin contents in the base UOM. In transactions with a UOM that's larger than the item's base UOM, the quantity is converted to the base UOM.  

#### Zone

In advanced warehousing, bins can be grouped in zones to manage how the workflow of warehouse activities is directed for locations.  

A zone could be a receiving zone or a stocking zone, and each zone can consist of one or more bins.  

Most properties assigned to a zone are assigned to the bins that are created for the zone.  

#### Warehouse class

In advanced warehousing, you can assign warehouse class codes to the following entities: 

* Items
* Bins
* Zones

Warehouse classes control where to store items. You can divide a zone into several warehouse classes. For example, you might store items in the receiving zone as frozen, hazardous, or another class.

When you work with warehouse classes and a default receiving/shipping bin, you must manually choose the appropriate bins in the warehouse receipt and shipment lines.  

In inbound flows, the class code is only highlighted on inbound lines where the item class code doesn't match the default receiving bin. If the correct default bins aren't assigned, then the quantity can't be received.  

#### Location

A location is a physical structure or place where inventory is received, stored, and shipped. A location can be a warehouse, service car, showroom, plant, or an area in a plant. Inventory is often organized in bins and zones.

#### First expired first out (FEFO)

If you select the **Pick According to FEFO** checkbox on the **Bin Policies** FastTab on the **Location Card** page, item-tracked items are picked at the location according to their expiration date. Items with the earliest expiration dates are picked first.  

Warehouse activities in all pick and movement documents are sorted according to FEFO, unless the items have serial or lot numbers assigned. If some, but not all, of the quantity on the line has serial or lot numbers assigned, the remaining quantity is sorted according to FEFO.  

When using FEFO, items that expire first are gathered in a temporary item tracking list based on the expiration date. If two items have the same expiration date, the item with the lowest lot or serial number is picked first. If the lot or serial numbers are the same, the item that was registered first is selected first. Standard criteria for selecting items in pick bins, such as Bin Ranking and Break Bulk, are applied to the temporary FEFO item tracking list.  

Learn more at [Enable Picking Items by FEFO](warehouse-picking-by-fefo.md).

#### Put-away template

Put-away templates specify a set of prioritized rules that apply when you create put-aways. For example, a put-away template can require you to place items in a bin with bin content that has the same UOM. If a similar bin with enough capacity can't be found, the item must be placed in an empty bin. You assign a put-away template to an item and a location.

# View a financial report on-screen, as a PDF, or in Excel

After you set up definitions for your financial reports, you can start using the data to support your finance and accounting processes. The Financial Reporting feature offers multiple ways to view the reports:

- On-screen, with drill-through to the underlying numbers.
- As PDF documents designed for sharing and printing.
- As Excel files that use the template or layout of your choice.

This article describes each approach.

## View a financial report on-screen

You can view any report on-screen with drill-through to the underlying numbers.

To view a financial report, follow these steps:

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 4.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Financial Reports**, and then choose the related link.
1. On the **Financial Reports** page, select the financial report you want to view, and then choose the **View Financial Report** action.

The page has **Options** and **Dimensions** FastTabs. If the FastTabs aren't available, you might need to enable them with the **Show all options** action.

On the **Options** FastTab, specify how the report shows data. For example:

- Use the **View by** field to specify the period for which to summarize data. Specifying a period is a good way to make the data more granular.
- Use the **Date Filter** field to show amounts for a certain data or date range.
- The **Show All Lines** toggle specifies whether the page displays all lines, or excludes empty lines, as defined in the row definition.
- The **Negative Amount Format** field allows you to define how you want to format negative numbers.

On the **Dimensions** FastTab, you can choose to filter data according to global dimensions.

> [!TIP]
> If you change a setting, to refresh the data on the screen, use the **Recalculate** action.

### Show or hide the Row No. field on a report

The **Row No.** field might show when you view a report on-screen. The field doesn't show when you view the report in a PDF. To show or hide the field, personalize the page. To learn more, go to [Personalize your workspace](ui-personalization-user.md).

## Integrate financial reports with Excel

You can integrate a financial report with an Excel workbook template, adjust the layout to suit your needs, and then update the Excel template with data from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For example, this integration makes it easier to generate your monthly and yearly financial statements in a format that works for you.

### Set up Excel integration for a financial report (create an Excel template)

To set up Excel integration for a financial report, follow these steps to create an Excel template.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 4.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Financial Reports**, and then choose the related link.
1. On the **Financial Reports** page, select the financial report to enable with Excel, and then choose the **View Financial Report** action.
1. On the **Financial Report** page, choose the **Create New Excel Template** action. This action downloads a template Excel workbook with a single worksheet named after the report.
1. Copy the worksheet, and rename it to **Data**.
1. Rename the report worksheet to your liking.
1. In the report worksheet, mark all cells that show data from the financial report, including column and row headers. On the **Home** ribbon, find the **Number** menu and choose **General** as the category.
1. Choose the leftmost cell of the area with data from the financial report, and set a reference to the equivalent cell in the Data worksheet. Drag the formula to extend it to all cells in the first row, and then drag the row down to cover all rows in the financial report.
1. Hide the **Data** worksheet.
1. Format the report worksheet to suit your needs.
1. Save the workbook in OneDrive, or a similar place where the file is backed up and versioned.
1. Close the workbook.

> [!TIP]
> The **Row No.** field is shown on the data worksheet, but you might not want to include it on your worksheet.

> [!NOTE]
> If you make changes to the row or column definitions of the report you created a template for, you must update the template too. Each row and column in the Excel template must be in the same position as the generated report.

### Run a financial report with an Excel template

To run a financial report with an Excel template, follow these steps:

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 4.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Financial Reports**, and then choose the related link.
1. On the **Financial Reports** page, select the financial report to enable with Excel, and then choose the **Export to Excel/PDF** menu.
1. Choose the **Update Copy of Existing Document** action.
1. Upload your Excel template (close the Excel workbook before uploading it).
1. On the **Name/Value Lookup** page, choose the Data worksheet.
1. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] runs the financial report and merges the resulting data with your Excel template.

### Example: Use and update an Excel template to create a monthly report

You can create an Excel template that contains the reports that you include in your reporting package. Each report in the workbook must have a data tab and a tab that has the formatted report. When you update your monthly package, use the **Update Copy of Existing Document** for each report. Be sure to save after each update.

Follow these steps to produce your monthly financial report.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 4.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Financial Reports**, and then choose the related link.
1. Choose the financial report you used to create the Excel template, and then choose the **View Financial Report** action.
1. Change the date filter to the next month.
1. Choose the **Export to Excel/PDF** and **Update Copy of Existing Document** actions.
1. Select the template you saved in OneDrive (or a similar place.) Make sure that the Excel file is closed. Otherwise, an error message will state that the file is in use.
1. The next screen shows the worksheets/tabs that are available in the Excel workbook. Choose the **Data** tab, and then choose **OK**. If you choose the tab labeled **IS**, your formatting will be overwritten and you'll need to start over.
1. The Excel workbook is updated with data and downloaded to you. Be sure to enable editing to show your changes when opening the workbook.
1. Save the workbook with a different name than the original template.

## Save Excel templates as Excel layouts

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/introduced_in_2025rw1.md)]

# OneDrive in Business Central FAQ

[!INCLUDE [online_only](includes/online_only.md)]

This article answers common questions about using OneDrive for Business with [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## Does this work with all [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] clients?

Yes. You can open files in OneDrive from the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] mobile apps, when viewing card details in Microsoft Teams, or even from the Outlook add-in.  

## Is OneDrive the same as SharePoint for storing files?

No. OneDrive is private by default, allowing you to organize and share content, while SharePoint offers a shared file repository for your organization. Additionally, OneDrive is included in your Microsoft 365 subscription.

## Does [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] support consumer OneDrive?

No. This integration is exclusively intended for OneDrive for Business and only supports your work account. 

## Are all OneDrive for Business plans supported?

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't support standalone OneDrive for Business plans. OneDrive must be part of a Microsoft 365 business or enterprise plan. Learn more at [Compare OneDrive plans](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/onedrive/compare-onedrive-plans?market=af&activetab=tab:primaryr2).

## Where can I see OneDrive service health?

Administrators can access the Service health dashboard in the Microsoft 365 admin center. The dashboard includes OneDrive's service availability. Visit the [Service health dashboard](https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/Home?#/servicehealth).

## Is OneDrive integration available to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on premises?

Yes, but unlike [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, it does require more setup. Learn more in [Configuring Business Central on-premises](admin-onedrive-integration-onpremises.md).  

## Does [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on premises connect with SharePoint Server?

No. This deployment combination isn't supported, even if SharePoint Server is enabled with My Sites.  

## Does [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online connect with SharePoint Server?

No. This deployment combination isn't supported, even if SharePoint Server is enabled with My Sites.  

## How does this work in an organization with multiple environments?

The integration assumes that company names are unique across [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] environments. When company names are unique across the organization, opening a file in OneDrive will copy the file to a folder named after the current company. If company names aren't unique across environments, files from identical company names might be placed together in the same folder.  

## We changed the company name. What happens to my previous files?

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't automatically migrate files you opened earlier in OneDrive to the new folder. After you rename your company, the Open in OneDrive action will copy files to a folder that has the new company name.   

## When I want to attach a file in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], how do I pick a file from OneDrive?

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't provide a cloud file picker. You must download the file from OneDrive to your device, and then upload it to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. 

## I want to open files in SharePoint instead. How do I do this?

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't provide features to copy files to SharePoint and open them from a SharePoint library. Contact your Microsoft partner to understand your options, or search for apps on AppSource.  

## How do I turn off integration to OneDrive?

Run the **OneDrive Setup** assisted setup guide and turn off the **Use OneDrive for app features** and **Use OneDrive for system features** switches.

## Should I use the SharePoint Connection Setup page to connect to SharePoint?

> **APPLIES TO:** Business Central on-premises, version 21 and 22

This page is a legacy feature where all [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] files from all users are sent to a single SharePoint folder. We recommend that you don't configure the Shared Documents FastTab on the **SharePoint Connection Setup** page because this page is [deprecated](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/upgrade/deprecated-features-w1#microsoft-sharepoint-connection-setup) and removed in 2023 release wave 2, version 23.0. We recommend that you use the **OneDrive Setup** instead.  

## Which version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports OneDrive?

Integration with OneDrive became available in 2021 release wave 2.  

## <a name="features"></a>Which features are affected by OneDrive integration?

In the **OneDrive Setup** assisted setup guide for setting up OneDrive integration, you can turn on or off features for handling Business Central files in OneDrive. The features are divided between two options:

|Option|Description|
|------|----------|
|**Use for app features**|If you turn on this option, the **Open in OneDrive** and **Share** actions are made available on files in Business Central, like files attached to documents or in the report inbox. These actions let users copy, open, and share files in OneDrive. Learn more in [Opening and Sharing Business Central Files in OneDrive](across-share-onedrive.md).
|**Use for system features**|Turning on this option activates the following features:<ul><li> The **Open in Excel** and **Edit in Excel** actions on list pages automatically copy the Excel file to OneDrive, then open it in Excel Online. Learn more in [Viewing and Editing in Excel](across-work-with-excel.md).</li><li> Sending a report to an Excel or Word file automatically copies the file to OneDrive, then opens it in the Excel or Word online. Learn more in [Saving a report to a file](ui-work-report.md#save-a-report-to-a-file).|

## Will Microsoft continue to improve the integration to OneDrive?

At Microsoft, we're constantly listening to feedback from our diverse user community and acting upon the top suggestions. To learn about what's next for integrations with Microsoft 365 apps, see the [Dynamics 365 release plan](/dynamics365-release-plan/2021wave1).  

If you want to participate in improving OneDrive integration, or have an idea that would improve file sharing and collaboration in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], add an idea or vote for existing ideas at [https://aka.ms/BusinessCentralIdeas](https://aka.ms/BusinessCentralIdeas).

## Does OneDrive work for guest users and delegated admins?

OneDrive features don't work when you're signed in to Business Central as a guest user. For example, if you select **Open in OneDrive** or **Share** on a file, you get the message "Could not connect to your OneDrive for Business."

If you're signed in as a delegated admin, files are downloaded instead of connecting to OneDrive.

These limitations apply to all OneDrive-based features in Business Central, including file sharing, opening, or editing.

## Troubleshooting

This section provides information about how to identify and fix problems you might experience when using OneDrive with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

### Business Central can't find my OneDrive

When this message displays, "Could not determine the location of your OneDrive for Business, contact your partner to set this up.", check whether the user accessed their OneDrive at least one time. If they haven't, ask the person to visit [https://portal.office.com/onedrive](https://portal.office.com/onedrive) to set it up. This step can take a while. If the message still displays after 24 hours, contact Support.  

### I'm having problems sharing from Outlook

Learn more at [Can't share OneDrive files from Outlook.com](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/can-t-share-onedrive-files-from-outlook-com-05d4cb21-40a2-40e3-b111-82cddb82d22f) on Microsoft Support.

### Actions Open in OneDrive and Share are missing

There are a couple things you can check:

- Check that the application features for OneDrive are turned on in the **OneDrive Setup** assisted setup guide. Learn more in [Configure OneDrive using OneDrive Setup](admin-onedrive-integration.md#configure-onedrive-using-onedrive-setup).
- Check that Microsoft OneDrive is set to **Agree** in the **Privacy Notices Status** page. Learn more in [Privacy Notices Status](privacy-notices-status.md).

# Design Details: Expected Cost Posting
Expected costs represent the estimation of, for example, a purchased item’s cost that you record before you receive the invoice for the item.  

 You can post expected cost to inventory and to the general ledger. When you post a quantity that is only received or shipped but not invoiced, then a value entry is created with the expected cost. This expected cost affects the inventory value, but is not posted to the general ledger unless you set up the system up to do so.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  Expected costs are only managed for item transactions. Expected costs are not for immaterial transaction types, such as capacity and item charges.  

 If only the quantity part of an inventory increase has been posted, then the inventory value in the general ledger does not change unless you have selected the **Expected Cost Posting to G/L** check box on the **Inventory Setup** page. In that case, the expected cost is posted to interim accounts at the time of receipt. After the receipt has been fully invoiced, the interim accounts are then balanced and the actual cost is posted to the inventory account.  

 To support reconciliation and traceability work, the invoiced value entry shows the expected cost amount that has been posted to balance the interim accounts.  

## Prerequisites for posting expected costs

To make it possible to post expected costs you need to do the following:
1. On the **Inventory Setup** page, select the **Automatic Cost Posting** check box and the **Expected Cost Posting to G/L** check box.
2. Set up which interim accounts to use during the expected cost posting process.  

  On the **Inventory Posting Setup** page, verify the **Inventory Account** and the **Inventory Account (Interim)** fields for the **Location Code and Invt. Posting Group Code** of the item you will be purchasing. To learn more about these accounts see [Design Details - Accounts in the General Ledger](design-details-accounts-in-the-general-ledger.md).
3. On the **General Posting Setup** page, verify the **Invt. Accrual Acc. (Interim)** field for the **Gen. Bus. Posting Group** and the **Gen. Prod. Posting Group** you will be using.
4. When you create a purchase order the default is that the **Vendor Invoice No.** field is required. You need to turn that off on the **Purchase & Payables Setup** page, by unselecting the **Ext. Doc. No. Mandatory** field.

## Example  

> [!NOTE]  
> The account numbers used in this example are there for reference only, and will be different in your system. Set them up as directed in the Prerequisites above.

You post a purchase order as received. The expected cost is LCY 95.00.  

 **Value Entries**  

|Posting Date|Entry Type|Cost Amount (Expected)|Expected Cost Posted to G/L|Expected Cost|Item Ledger Entry No.|Entry No.|  
|------------------|----------------|------------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------|---------------------------|---------------|

|01-01-20|Inventory Account (Interim)|2131|95.00|1|  

 At a later date, you post the purchase order as invoiced. The invoiced cost is LCY 100.00.  

 **Value Entries**  

|Posting Date|Cost Amount (Actual)|Cost Amount (Expected)|Cost Posted to G/L|Expected Cost|Item Ledger Entry No.|Entry No.|

This action automatically generates a text suggestion that's engaging, creative, and specific to the item that's shown. Suggestions are based on various inputs, including:

- The item's attributes, category, and name.
- Personal writing style preferences, like tone of voice, emphasized quality, format and length.

You can change the value of these input options to influence the outcome of the AI-generated text. Before you save a suggestion, you can easily review and edit it for accuracy or try another suggestion.

Some key benefits of this feature include:

- Decreases the time used on copy writing, which can accelerate time-to-market for items being sold in online shops.
- Unlocks creativity to provide more engaging product descriptions.
- Improves consistency of marketing material for product lines.

## What are the system's capabilities?

The [!INCLUDE[feature-marketing-text-suggestions](includes/feature-marketing-text-suggestions.md)] feature uses Microsoft's Azure OpenAI Service to access powerful language models that analyze and generate natural language. These models have been trained on a wide body of text datasets. As a result, Copilot can generate suggested, personalized responses in English based on a minimal amount of input data, like an item's attributes, category, or description. Learn more about Azure OpenAI Service at [Microsoft's Azure OpenAI Service](/azure/cognitive-services/openai/overview).

## What is the system's intended use?

This feature is intended to assist users in creating marketing text for items in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Writers use the feature to quickly get compelling and engaging text suggestions, which are then reviewed and edited for accuracy. 

## How was item marketing text evaluated? What metrics are used to measure performance?

- The feature underwent extensive testing where numerous texts in different languages were evaluated by language experts against various criteria. Testing was based on [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]'s demonstration data and other fictitious product catalogs.
- This feature is built in accordance with Microsoft's Responsible AI Standard. Learn more about responsible AI from Microsoft at [Empowering responsible AI practices](https://aka.ms/RAI).

## How does Microsoft monitor the quality of generated content?

Microsoft has various systems in place to ensure Copilot capabilities remain operational and generate content of the highest quality.

# Manufacturing analytics

Businesses capture lots of data during daily activities that supports business intelligence (BI) for manufacturing, such as:

- Utilization
- Capacity
- Work center load
- Production time
- Production scrap

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides features to help you gather, analyze, and share your organization's manufacturing data:

- Power BI reports for manufacturing
- Ad-hoc analysis on lists
- Ad-hoc analysis of data in Excel (using Open in Excel)
- Built-in manufacturing analytics tools
- Built-in manufacturing reports

Each feature has its advantages and disadvantages, depending on the type of analysis you want to do and your role. To learn more, go to [Analytics, business intelligence, and reporting overview](reports-bi-reporting.md).

This article introduces how you can use these analytical features to gain insights into your manufacturing processes.

## Analytics needs in manufacturing

When you think about analytics in manufacturing, it might help to use a persona-based model that describes different needs at a high-level.

:::image type="content" source="/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/media/analytics-personas.svg" alt-text="Illustration of different personas for analytics" lightbox="/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/media/analytics-personas.svg":::

People in different roles have different needs when it comes to data, and they use data in different ways. For example, people in manufacturing interact with data differently than people in finance.

:::image type="content" source="/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/media/analytics-personas-scenarios.svg" alt-text="Illustration of how different personas have different analytics needs." lightbox="/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/media/analytics-personas-scenarios.svg":::

| Role  | Data aggregation | Typical ways to consume data          |
|------------------- |-------------------| ---------------------- |
| COO / CFO / CEO | Performance data  | KPIs, dashboards, financial reports               |
| Plant Manager     | Trends, summaries | Built-in managerial reports, ad-hoc analysis      |
| Factory worker | Detailed data     | Built-in operational reports, on-screen task data |

## Using Power BI to monitor key performance indicators in manufacturing

A key performance indicator (KPI) is a measurable value that shows how effectively you’re meeting your goals. Businesses often use the following KPIs to monitor production performance:

- Total Actual Cost with sub-cost calculations such as Actual Material Cost, Actual Capacity Cost, and more
- Expected Cost, Expected Cost Variance, and Expected Cost Dev %
- Total Standard Cost, Standard Cost Variance, and Standard Cost Dev %
- Planned vs. Finished Quantity

:::image type="content" source="media/manufacturing/finished-production-order-breakdown-v26.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Finished Production Order Breakdown Power BI Report" lightbox="media/manufacturing/finished-production-order-breakdown-v26.png":::

These KPIs, and more, are available for manufacturing in the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-manufacturing-app-name](includes/power-bi-manufacturing-app-name.md)] for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. To learn more, go to [Manufacturing KPIs](manufacturing-powerbi-kpis.md).

### Reports in the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-manufacturing-app-name](includes/power-bi-manufacturing-app-name.md)]

[!INCLUDE [power-bi-manufacturing-app](includes/power-bi-manufacturing-app.md)]

To learn more, go to [Power BI Manufacturing app](manufacturing-powerbi-app.md).

## Ad-hoc analysis of manufacturing data

Sometimes you just need to check whether the numbers add up correctly, or quickly confirm a figure. The following features are great for ad-hoc analyses:

- Data analysis on ledger list pages
- Open in Excel

The Data Analysis feature lets you open almost any list page, such as **Item Ledger Entries** or **Capacity Ledger Entries**, enter analysis mode, and then group, filter, and pivot data as you see fit.

Similarly, you can use the **Open in Excel** action to open a list page, optionally filter the list to a subset of the data, and then use Excel to work with the data. For example, by using features such as Analyze Data, What-If Analysis, or Forecast Sheet.

> [!TIP]
> If you configure OneDrive for system features, the Excel workbook opens in your browser.

## Built-in reports for manufacturing

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes several built-in reports to help manufacturing organizations report on their data.

[!INCLUDE [report-explorer-manufacturing](includes/report-explorer-manufacturing.md)]

To learn more about reports that are relevant for manufacturing, go to [Built-in production report overview](production-reports.md).

## On-screen manufacturing analytics

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] has several pages that give you manufacturing overviews and tasks to do, such as:

- [View the load in work and machine centers](production-how-to-view-the-load-on-work-centers.md)  

## Print barcodes for finished goods on production orders

To remove a step or two from the process of tracking finished goods, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers a **Print Label** action on the **Released Production Order** and **Finished Production Order** pages. The action prints a report that includes the **Item No.**, **Description**, **Unit of Measure**, and 1D and 2D barcode information from the orders. On the request page, you can also specify whether to print the **Lot No.**, **Serial No.** or **Package No.** values as barcodes.

> [!NOTE]
> Some printers and barcode/QR code formats require a specific implementation. You might need to upload a different Word template.
>
> Check with your equipment supplier to learn how to print Word documents on your device.
 If you decide to clone the report to create your own custom version, you can easily connect if you select **Prod. Output Item Label** on the **Report Selection Production Order** page.

title: Mapping the tables and fields to synchronize

# Mapping the tables and fields to synchronize

The basis of synchronizing data is mapping the tables and fields in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with tables and columns in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)], so they can exchange the data. Mapping happens through integration tables.

## Mapping integration tables

An integration table is a table in the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] database that represents a table, such as an account, in [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)]. Integration tables include fields that correspond to columns in the [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] table. For example, the Account integration table connects to the Accounts table in [!INCLUDE[cds_short_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)]. There must be an integration table mapping for each table in [!INCLUDE[cds_short_md](includes/cds_short_md.md)] that you want to synchronize with data in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

When you create the connection between the apps, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] sets up some default mappings. You can change the table mappings if you want. For more information, see [Standard Table Mapping for Synchronization](admin-synchronizing-business-central-and-sales.md#standard-table-mapping-for-synchronization). If you changed the default mappings and want to revert your changes, on the **Integration Table Mappings** page, choose **Use Default Synchronization Setup**.

> [!Note]
> If you are using an on-premises version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the integration table mappings are stored in table 5335 Integration Table Mappings, where you can view and edit the mappings. Complex mappings and synchronization rules are defined in codeunit 5341.

> [!TIP]
> When a coupled record changes, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically synchronizes the data with Dataverse. Automatic synchronization is great in most cases. However, frequent changes to large amounts of coupled records in a table can slow down data synchronization.
>
> To avoid slow performance, on the **Integration Table Mappings** page, you can enable or disable event-based data synchronization for any table. By default, event-based synchronization is turned on so that existing integrations aren’t affected. Your administrator can turn it on or off for specific tables.

### Add table and field mappings to existing integration tables

[!INCLUDE [preview](includes/preview.md)]

On the **Integration Table Mappings** page, you can use the New Table Mapping action to add new table mappings to integration tables. The action starts the **Create new integration mappings** assisted setup guide, which helps you set up new integration table and field mappings.

The guide lets you map the tables in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with existing integration tables in Dataverse. You can also specify the Dataverse table's unique identifier in **Integration Table Unique Identifier Field Name** and the **Integration Table Modified on Field Name**, which are needed for data synchronization to work.

> [!NOTE]
> The lookup on the Table column shows all [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] tables, including custom tables, that aren't yet mapped. It excludes those that already exist on your Integration Table Mappings page. The lookup on the Integration Table column shows only Dataverse tables (AL Proxy Tables) that are part of out-of-the-box integrations. To add additional or custom Dataverse tables, you'll need help from a developer to create and deploy them through an extension.

The Advanced action opens extra table mapping settings that you can set up. In the **Advanced** section, the **Table Filter** field lets you specify filters for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Use the **Integration Table Filter** field for Dataverse data to consider in data synchronization together with the configuration template codes in **Table Config. Template Code** and **Int. Tbl. Config. Code** to prefill missing data when new data comes from either application.

The guide also helps you specify the fields you want the new mapping to contain. You can match a [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] field in the **Field Name** column with a Dataverse field name in the **Integration Field Name** column. You can also specify a **Direction**, whether the field always has the same value in the **Constant** column, and whether validations or transformations need to be applied during field mapping.

> [!NOTE]
> To reduce errors, the lookup for the **Integration Table Field** column filters to a list of available fields. To map fields that the filters don't include, you'll need help from a developer.
>
> * Fields must be enabled.
> * You can't use the guide to map FlowField and FlowFilter fields.
> * You can only map fields of the type BigInteger, Boolean, Code, Date, DateFormula, DateTime, Decimal, Duration, GUID, Integer, Option, and Text.

> [!TIP]
> You can also add new field mappings to existing integration table mappings through the **Integration Field Mappings** list page, which you can access by choosing **Fields** on the **Integration Table Mappings** page.
>
> Simply choose **New Field Mapping** to open the field mapping step of the **Create new integration mappings** assisted setup guide, and then proceed as described in this article.

New field mappings you add to an existing table mapping are in a Disabled state. You can choose **Edit List** to enable them later.

### Synchronization rules

An integration table mapping also includes rules that control how integration synchronization jobs synchronize records in a [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] table and a table in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)]. For examples of rules for an integration with Sales, go to [Synchronization Rules](#synchronization-rules).

### Strategies for autoresolving conflicts

Data conflicts can easily occur when business applications exchange data on an ongoing basis. For example, someone might delete or change a row in one of the applications, or both. To reduce the number of conflicts to manually resolve, you can specify resolution strategies. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically resolves conflicts according to the rules in the strategies.

Integration table mappings include rules that control how synchronization jobs synchronize records. On the **Integration Table Mapping** page, in the **Resolve Deletion Conflicts** and **Resolve Update Conflicts** columns, you can specify how [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] resolves conflicts that occur because records were deleted in tables in one or the other business application, or updated in both. 

In the **Resolve Deletion Conflicts** column, you can choose to have [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically restore deleted records, remove the coupling between the records, or do nothing. If you do nothing, you must manually resolve conflicts. 

In the **Resolve Update Conflicts** column, you can choose to have [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically send a data update to the integration table when sending data to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)], or to get a data update from the integration table when getting data from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)], or do nothing. If you do nothing, you must manually resolve conflicts.

After you specify the strategy, on the **Coupled Data Synchronization Errors** page, you can choose the **Retry All** action to automatically resolve conflicts.

## Mapping integration fields

Mapping tables is only the first step. You must also map the fields on the tables. Integration field mappings link fields in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] tables with corresponding columns in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)], and determine whether to synchronize data in each table. The standard table mapping that [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides includes field mappings, but you can change the mappings. For more information, see [Viewing Table Mappings](admin-synchronizing-business-central-and-sales.md#tip-for-admins-viewing-table-mappings).

> [!Note]
> If you are using an on-premises version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], integration field mappings are defined in table 5336 Integration Field Mapping.

You can manually map the fields, or you can automate the process by mapping multiple fields at the same time based on criteria for matching their values. For more information, see [To couple multiple records based on field value matching](admin-how-to-couple-and-synchronize-records-manually.md).

### Handle differences in field values

Sometimes the values in the fields that you want to map are different. For example, in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] the language code for the United States is "U.S.," but in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] it's "US." That means you must transform the value when you synchronize data. You can specify transformation rules for the fields on the **Integration Table Mappings** page by choosing **Mapping**, and then **Fields**. Predefined rules are provided, but you can also create your own. For more information, see [Transformation Rules](across-how-to-set-up-data-exchange-definitions.md#transformation-rules).

### Handle missing option values

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] contains option set columns that provide values that you can map to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] fields of the type **Option** for automatic synchronization. During synchronization, nonmapped options are ignored and the missing options are appended to the related [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] table and added to the **CDS Option Mapping** system table to be handled manually later. For example, by adding the missing options in either product and then updating the mapping. For more information, see [Handling Missing Option Values](admin-cds-missing-option-values.md).

## Couple records

Coupling links rows in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] to records in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For example, accounts in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] are typically coupled with customers in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Coupling records offers the following benefits:

* It makes synchronization possible.
* Users can open records or rows in one business app from the other.

Coupling requires that the apps are already integrated.

Couplings can be set up automatically by using the synchronization jobs, or manually by editing the record in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For more information, see [Synchronizing Data in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)]](admin-synchronizing-business-central-and-sales.md) and [Couple and Synchronize Records Manually](admin-manual-synchronization-of-table-mappings.md#synchronize-individual-table-mappings).

## Filter records and rows  

If you don't want to synchronize all rows for a specific table in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] or table in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can set up filters to limit the data that is synchronized. You set up filters on the **Integration Table Mappings** page.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Integration Table Mappings**, and then choose the related link.
2. To filter the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] records, set the **Table Filter** field.  
3. To filter the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] rows, set the **Integration Table Filter** field.  

## Create new records  

By default, only coupled records in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and rows in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] are synchronized by the integration synchronization jobs. You can set up table mappings to create new records or rows in the destination app for each row in the source app that isn't already coupled.  

For example, the SALESPEOPLE - Dynamics 365 Sales synchronization job uses the table mapping SALESPEOPLE. The synchronization job copies data from users in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] to salespersons in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. If you set up the table mapping to create new records, for every user in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] that isn't already coupled to a salesperson in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], a new salesperson row is created in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

### To create new records during synchronization  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Integration Table Mappings**, and then choose the related link.
2. In the table mapping entry in the list, clear the **Synch. Only Coupled Records** field.  

## Use configuration templates on table mappings

You can specify one or more configuration templates to use for new [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] records, and another template to use new [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] rows.  

If you install the default synchronization setup, most of the time, two configuration templates are automatically created and used on the table mapping for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] customers and [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] accounts: **CDSCUST** and **CDSACCOUNT**.  

* **CDSCUST** creates and synchronizes new customers in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] based on accounts in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)].  

     To create this template, copy an existing configuration template for customers. The **CDSCUST** is created only if there's an existing configuration template and the **Currency Code** field in the template is blank. If a field in the configuration template contains a value, the value replaces the value in the mapped column for the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] account. For example, if the **Country/Region** column in an account in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] contains *U.S.* and the **Country/Region** field in the configuration template is **GB**, then **GB** is used as the **Country/Region** for the customer in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

* **CDSACCOUNT** creates and synchronizes new accounts in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] based on an account in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

You can add more templates, and use filters to define conditions under which [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] applies them. The templates apply to data moving in either direction. For example, you might use a template for domestic customers in the United States, and another for foreign customers in the European Union, or vice versa. In that case, when the data synchronizes, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses the country/region code for the customer to apply the appropriate template.

### To specify configuration templates on a table mapping  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Integration Table Mappings**, and then choose the related link.
2. In the table mapping entry in the list, in the **Table Config Templates** field, choose to the configuration template to use for new records in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  
3. If you have multiple templates, to define the conditions that determine when to use the template, enter criteria in the **Integration Table Filter** field, and then enter a number in the **Priority** field. The priority determines the order in which [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] evaluates whether to use the templates.

   > [!NOTE]
   > The **Table Config Template Code** and **Int. Tbl. Config Template Code** fields show different values depending on the number of templates that you configure for a specific integration table mapping:
   >
   > * If you configure a single configuration template, the name of the configuration template shows in order to stay compatible with current capabilities.
   > * If you configure multiple configuration templates, the number of configured configuration templates shows.

# Defer revenues and expenses

To recognize revenues or expenses in a later period than the transaction posted in, you can set up a schedule to automatically defer them.

To distribute revenues or expenses to accounting periods, you set up a deferral template for the resource, item, or G/L account that the revenue or expense is for. When you post the sales or purchase document, the revenue or expense is deferred to the accounting periods you specify in the deferral template and the posting date.

> [!NOTE]
> Sales and purchase journals validate the source code. The validation requires that the source code for sales journals and purchase journals aren't identical when you're using deferrals. If the source code is set up to be identical, you can work around this limitation by creating a template and batch that use another source code.

## To set up a G/L account for deferral

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Chart of Accounts**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action.
3. Fill in the fields as necessary to create a G/L account for deferred revenues. For more information, see [The General Ledger and the Chart of Accounts](finance-general-ledger.md).
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 to create a new G/L account for deferred expenses.

For both types of deferral, select **Balance Sheet** in the **Type** field, and name the accounts appropriately, such as *Unearned Income* for deferred revenues and *Unpaid Expenses* for deferred expenses.

## To set up a deferral template

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Deferral Templates**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action.
3. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
4. In the **Calc. Method** field, specify how to calculate the value in the **Amount** field for each period on the **Deferral Schedule** page. You can choose between the following options:

   * **Straight-Line**: The periodic deferral amounts are calculated according to the number of periods, distributed according to period length.
   * **Equal per Period**: The periodic deferral amounts are calculated according to the number of periods, distributed evenly on periods.
   * **Days per Period**: The periodic deferral amounts are calculated according to the number of days in the period.
   * **User-Defined**: The periodic deferral amounts aren't calculated. You must manually fill the **Amount** field for each period in the Deferral Schedule page. To learn more, go go [To change a deferral schedule from a sales invoice](#to-change-a-deferral-schedule-from-a-sales-invoice).
5. In the **Period Desc.** field, specify a description that shows on entries for the deferral posting. You can enter the following placeholder codes for typical values. The values are added automatically when the period description displays.

   * %1 = The day number of the period posting date
   * %2 = The week number of the period posting date
   * %3 = The month number of the period posting date
   * %4 = The month name of the period posting date
   * %5 = The accounting period name of the period posting date
   * %6 = The fiscal year of the period posting date

Example: The posting date is 02/06/2025. If you enter “Expenses deferred for %4 %6”, the description display "Expenses deferred for February 2025".

## To assign a deferral template to an item

> [!NOTE]  
> The steps in this procedure are the same as when you assign a deferral template to a G/L account or a resource.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the card for the item for which revenues or expenses must be deferred to the accounting periods when the item was sold or purchased.
3. On the **Costs & Posting** FastTab, in the **Default Deferral Template** field, select the relevant deferral template.

## To change a deferral schedule from a sales invoice

> [!NOTE]  
> The steps in this procedure are the same as when you change a deferral schedule, for expenses, from a purchase invoice.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Invoices**, and then choose the related link.
2. Create a sales invoice for an item that has a deferral template assigned. For more information, see [Invoice Sales](sales-how-invoice-sales.md).

    Notice that as soon as you enter the item (or resource or G/L account) on the invoice line, the **Deferral Code** field is filled with the code of the assigned deferral template.
3. Choose the **Deferral Schedule** action.
4. On the **Deferral Schedule** page, change settings on the header or values on the lines, for example, to defer the amount to another accounting period.
5. Choose the **Calculate Schedule** action.
6. Choose the **OK** button. The deferral schedule is updated for the sales invoice. The related deferral template is unchanged.

## To preview how deferred revenues or expenses post to the general ledger

> [!NOTE]  
> The steps in this procedure are the same as when you preview how expense deferrals are posted.

1. On the **Sales Invoice** page, choose the **Preview Posting** action.
2. On the **Posting Preview** page, choose the **G/L Entry** action, and then choose the **Show Related Entries** action.

G/L entries to be posted to the specified deferral account, for example, Unearned Income, are denoted by the description that you entered in the **Period Desc.** field in the deferral template, for example, "Expenses deferred for February 2016".

## To review posted deferrals in the Sales Deferral Summary or the Purchasing Deferral Summary report

> [!NOTE]  
> The steps in this procedure are the same as when you review the Purchasing Deferral Summary report.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Deferral Summary**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Sales Deferral Summary** page, in the **Balance as of** field, enter the date up to which you want to see deferred revenues.
3. Choose the **Preview** button.

## To specify a period in which to allow deferral posting

You can specify a period in which people can post transactions by entering dates in the **Allow Posting From** and **Allow Posting To** fields as follows:

* For all users, on the **General Ledger Setup** page
* For specific users, on the **User Setup** page

If you do that, you must make an exception for deferrals to allow them to be posted outside the period. To define the period, follow these steps.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Ledger Setup** or **User Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. In the **Allow Deferral Posting From** and **Allow Deferral Posting To** fields, enter a start and end date for the period.

### Video guidance

The following video shows how to define the period in which you allow people to post deferred revenue and expenses, and how to specify exceptions.

# Configure API Templates

The API library for [!INCLUDE[prod_short_md](includes/prod_short.md)] provides a simplified representation of the underlying entities. All the properties in the application are not exposed through the associated API. The **API Setup** page allows you to define templates that are used to populate empty properties on an entity when you create a POST action through the API. 

For example, if a configuration template is defined for the item entity, when a new item record is created through the items API, any properties for the new item that are not defined in the API call will be populated from the selected template. If, for example, no value is defined for the **Gen. Prod. Posting Group** field through the API, but a value is defined in the selected template, then the posting group value defined in the template will be applied to the new item. 

## Setting up the Entity Template

To use templates with the API library, you must first set up and define properties for the templates. You can set up these templates on the **Configuration Templates** page. For more information, see [Migrate On-Premises Data to Business Central Online](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/migrate-data) (in English only) in the administration content.  

## Assign the template to an API

To assign a template to an API, you must go through the following steps.

> [!NOTE]  
> API templates can only be set up with the following API pages: contacts, countriesRegions, currencies, customers, employees, itemCategories, paymentMethods, paymentTerms, shipmentMethods, unitsOfMeasure, and vendors.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **API Setup**, and choose the related link.
2. Choose **New**, and then choose the **Order** value for the record.  

    If there is more than one template selected for an API (Page ID), the templates are applied in the order defined in the **Order** column.  

    When each template is applied, field values defined in the template are only applied to fields that have not already had a value defined, either explicitly in the API, or in a previously applied template in the order.  
3. Select a **Page ID** value.  

    This is the page for the API to which the template will be applied. The **Page ID** lookup provides a list of all APIs available in the library.
4. Select a value in the **Template Code** field.  

    The template code is the code for the template that was defined on the **Configuration Templates** page. The template values defined are applied to the API.  
5. In the **Conditions** field, specify which template should be applied.  

    The defined template is applied to a new record created through the API if, and only if, the conditions defined in the **Conditions** field are met by the values already defined for the new instance of the entity.

# Working with RDLC Layouts

RDLC layouts are based on report definition layout files (.rdl or .rdlc file types). The design concepts for RDLC layouts are similar to other layout types. The layout determines what fields to show and how they're arranged. However, designing RDLC layouts is more advanced than Word and Excel layouts.

[![Shows the different elements of an RDLC layout.](media/rdlc-layout.png)](media/rdlc-layout.png#lightbox)

## Required tools

To modify RDL layouts, you can use either Microsoft SQL Server Report Builder or Microsoft Visual Studio with the RDLC Report Designer extension.

- Report Builder is a stand-alone app installed on your computer by you or an administrator. With Business Central on-premises, Report Builder is automatically installed with the Business Central Server installation. For more information about installing Report Builder, see [Install Report Builder](/sql/reporting-services/install-windows/install-report-builder) in the SQL Server documentation.

- RDLC Report Designer is an extension for Visual Studio 2019 and later. You can download and install RDLC Report Designer from the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ProBITools.MicrosoftRdlcReportDesignerforVisualStudio-18001).

## Create and modify RDLC layouts

Creating and modifying RDLC layouts is an advanced task, which is typically done by power users or developers. The basic concepts aren't specific to Business Central report layouts. For this reason, we refer you to the following documentation:

- [Create RDL Layout Report](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-howto-rdl-report-layout)

   This article explains how to create an RDLC report layout from AL code.

- [Reports, Report Parts, and Report Definitions](/sql/reporting-services/report-design/reports-report-parts-and-report-definitions-report-builder-and-ssrs?)

   This links you to the SQL Server Reporting Services documentation for RDL/RDLC. This article explains the concepts behind RDL/RDLC and how to use Report Builder.

> [!NOTE]
> Report Builder only recognizes the .rdl file type, not .rdlc. Layout files exported from Business Central are .rdlc file types. So to modify these layout in Report Builder, rename the file type to .rdl.

# Control add-in resiliency in Business Central

From update 20.0 of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], control add-ins that perform slowly are automatically detected and a dialog similar to the following is displayed.

![Busy control add-in.](media/controladdin-resiliency.png "Busy control add-in.")

An unhealthy control add-in might affect your Business Central experience and cause the page you're working on to start slowly. It has no impact on data and your changes are always saved. If you see the warning as shown above, you can hide it, but it might come back and if the problem persists, you should contact your administrator.

# Work with calendar dates and times

You can enter dates and times in multiple ways. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_long.md)] includes powerful features that accelerate data entry, or help you write complex calendar expressions. There are various places throughout the application where you can enter dates and times in fields. For example, on a sales order, you can set the shipment date. When filtering lists or report data, you can enter dates and times to pinpoint only the data that you're interested in.

[!INCLUDE [about-ui-learn](includes/about-ui-learn.md)]

## Check your region and language settings

The **My Settings** page specifies the **Region** and **Language** that you're using in the application. These settings influence how you enter dates and times.

- The **Region** setting determines how dates, times, numbers, and currencies are shown or formatted.

- For date patterns that involve words, the language of the words that you use must correspond to the **Language** setting.

> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_long.md)] uses the Gregorian calendar system.

## Entering dates

In a date field, you can enter a date using the standard format for your region setting. Different regions can use different separators between the days, months, and years. For example, some regions use dashes (mm-dd-yyyy) and others use forward slashes (mm/dd/yyyy).  

> [!TIP]
> You can use any separators, even a space, and the date will automatically be changed to use separators that match your region.

> [!NOTE]
> The format in which dates are displayed on printed reports or emailed documents isn't influenced by your personal choice of region setting.

To work more productively with dates and times, you can use any of the methods or formats that are described in the following sections.

### Picking dates from the calendar

Any field displaying a calendar icon can be set using the calendar date picker. To display the calendar date picker, activate the calendar icon or select the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Home</kbd> keyboard shortcut in the field.

![Date fields.](media/ui-date-field.png "Example of a date field")

See also [Keyboard Shortcuts in the calendar date picker](keyboard-shortcuts.md#calendarshortcuts).

### Day\-week\-year pattern

You can enter a date as a weekday followed by a week number and, optionally, a year. For example, Mon25 or mon25 means Monday in week 25. If you don't enter a year, the year of the work date is used.

Instead of entering the entire word for the day of the week, you can enter part of the word, starting from the beginning. If there were conflicts (such as with s which could be Saturday or Sunday), the days are evaluated according to the region setting. The input is first evaluated against work date and today as well, which you want to keep in mind when abbreviating. For example, _t_ already means today, so it can't mean Tuesday or Thursday.

The week number scheme is always ISO 8601, where week 1 is the week with 4 January in it, or the week with the first Thursday of the year.

### Digit patterns

In a date field you can enter two, four, six, or eight digits:

- Two digits are interpreted as the day, and it adds the month and the year of the work date.

- Four digits are interpreted as the day and the month, and it adds the year of the work date. Your region settings determine the order of the day and month. Even if your region settings have the year before the day and month, four digits are interpreted as the day and month.

- If the date you want to enter is in the range 01/01/1950 through 12/31/2049, you can enter the year with two digits; otherwise, enter the year with four digits.

  > [!NOTE]
  > If you're using [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, the two-digit year range may be different. Administrators can change the range by modifying the **CalendarTwoDigitYearMax** setting of the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] server. For more information, see [Configuring Business Central Server](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/configure-server-instance#General).

### Today

Enter the word for _today_, in the language specified on the **My Settings** page, to set the date on a record to today's date. Instead of entering the entire word, you can enter part of the word, starting from the beginning. For example, in English, you can enter _t_ or _tod_, as long as it isn't also the start of another word.

### Period

To filter on a specific accounting period, in a date field enter the letter p, or the word period, followed by a number that identifies the accounting period, like p2 or period4. The accounting period is relative to the fiscal year of the current work date that set in your Role Center. For example, if the work date is **03/21/22**, then _p1_, or just _p_, filters on the first accounting period of the fiscal year 2022 (such as 01/01/22..01/31/22). _p15_ filters on the 15th accounting period from the start of fiscal year 2022 (such as 03/01/23..03/31/23).

The accounting periods are defined on the **Accounting Periods** page. To view or change the accounting periods, open the page [here](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=100).

### Work Date

Use a work date to specify a date that isn't today's date on records. For example, a work date is useful when you need to set a particular date for multiple records. You specify the work date on the **My Settings** page. 

A fast way to enter the work date on records is to enter some or all of the word _work_. Start from the beginning of the word in the language in which you use [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_long.md)]. For example, in English, you can enter _w_ or _work_. The language is also specified on the **My Settings** page.

If a work date isn't specified, today's date is used. To learn more, go to [Change Basic Settings, such as the Work Date](ui-change-basic-settings.md#work-date).

### Closing date

When you close a fiscal year, you can use closing dates to indicate that an entry is a closing entry. A closing date technically is between two dates, for example between December 31 and January 1.

To specify that a date is a closing date, put C just before the date, such as C123101. Use this format in combination with all the date patterns.

### Examples

The following table contains examples of dates using all the formats. It assumes region settings that format dates according to: **year.month.day.**, a week starting on Monday, and the English language.

|**Entry**      |**Interpretation**      |
|---------------|------------------------|
|2022.12.31.|2022.12.31.|
|221231|2022.12.31.|

|t23|Tuesday of week 23 of the work date year|
|t 23|Tuesday of week 23 of the work date year|
|t-1|Tuesday of week 1 of the work date year|

##  <a name="BKMK_SettingDateRanges"></a> Setting ranges

To display only the data contained in that range, on lists, totals, and reports you can filter on dates, times, and datetimes with a start value and optionally an end value. The standard rules apply to the way you set date ranges.

|**Meaning**|**Sample expression (Date)**|**Data included in the filter**|
|-----------|---------------------|--------------------|
|Interval|12 15 00..01 15 01<br /><br />..12 15 00<br /><br />p1..p4|Records with dates between and including 12 15 00 and 01 15 01.<br /><br />Records with dates of 12 15 00 or earlier.<br /><br />Date range that includes the second, third, and fourth accounting periods, such as 01/01/20..04/30/20.|
|Either/or|12 15 00\|12 16 00|Records with dates of either 12 15 00 or 12 16 00. If there are records with dates on both days, they all display.|
|Combination|12 15 00\|12 01 00..12 10 00  <br /><br />..12 14 00\|12 30 00..|Records with dates of 12 15 00 or on dates between and including 12 01 00 and 12 10 00.  <br /><br />Records with dates of 12 14 00 or earlier, or dates of 12 30 00 or later, that is, all records except records with dates between and including 12 15 00 and 12 29 00.|

You can use any of the valid formats in date range filters. For example, mon14 3..t 4p applied on a datetime field results in a filter from 3 AM on Monday in week 14 of the current work date year until today at 4PM.

## Use date formulas

A date formula is a short, abbreviated combination of letters and numbers that specifies how to calculate dates. You can enter date formulas in various date calculation fields or filters.

> [!NOTE]
> In all data formula fields, one day is automatically included to cover today as the day when the period starts. Accordingly, for example, if you enter 1W, then the period is actually eight days because today is included. To specify a period of seven days \(one true week\) including the period starting date, then you must enter 6D or 1W-1D.

Here are some examples of how date formulas can be used:

- The date formula in the recurring frequency field in recurring journals determines how often the entry on the journal line posts.
- The date formula in the **Grace Period** field for a specified reminder level determines the period of time that must pass from the due date (or from the date of the previous reminder) before a reminder is created.
- The date formula in the **Due Date Calculation** field determines how to calculate the due date on the reminder.

The date formula can contain a maximum of 20 characters, both numbers and letters. You can use the following letters, which are abbreviations for calendar units.

|  Letter  |  Meaning  |
|----------|----------------------|
|C|Current|
|D|Day\(s\)|
|W|Week\(s\)|
|M|Month\(s\)|
|Q|Quarter\(s\)|
|Y|Year\(s\)|

You can construct a date formula in three ways.

The following example shows how to use C, for current, and a time unit.

|  Expression  |  Meaning  |
|--------------|-----------|
|CW|Current week|
|CM|Current month (last day of the month)|

The following example shows how to use a number and a time unit. A number can't be larger than 9999.

|  Expression  |  Meaning  |
|--------------|-----------|
|10D|10 days from today|
|2W|2 weeks from today|

The following example shows how to use a time unit and a number.

|  Expression  |  Meaning  |
|--------------|-----------|
|D10|The next 10th day of a month|
|WD4|The next 4th day of a week \(Thursday\)|

The following example shows how you can combine these three forms as needed.

|  Expression  |  Meaning  |
|--------------|-----------|
|CM+10D|Current month \+ 10 days|

The following example shows how you can use a minus sign to indicate a date in the past.

|  Expression  |  Meaning  |
|--------------|-----------|
|-1Y|1 year ago from today|

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If the location uses a base calendar, then the date formula that you enter in, for example, the **Shipping Time** field is interpreted according to the calendar working days. For example, 1W  means seven working days.
<!--
# Entering Date Ranges
You can set filters containing a start date and an end date to display only the data contained in that date range or time interval. Special rules apply to the way you set date ranges. Let's take the **Customer Top 10** as an example:

![Setting a date range in the request page for the Customer Top 10 list.](./media/ui-enter-date-ranges/customer-top10-list.png)

Here you can limit the report to a date range such as the past 2 weeks, or a total of 6 weeks, or whatever range you want. To set date ranges, you enter dates and then use either **..** or **|** to set the range. In our example, to show the top 10 customers for the first two weeks of May, you would set the date filter to *05 01 17..05 14 17*.
Here are a couple of other examples:

| Meaning | Example | Entries included |
|---|---|---|
|Equal to| 12 15 16 |Only those posted on December 15 2016.|
|Interval| 12 15 16..01 15 17<br /><br />..12 15 16|Those posted on dates between and including December 15 2016 and January 15 2017.<br /><br />Those posted on December 15 2016 or earlier.|
|Either/or|12 15 16&#124;12 16 16|Those posted on either December 15 or December 16 2016. If there are entries posted on both days, they will all be displayed.|

You can also combine the various format types.

| Example | Entries included |
|---|---|
|12 15 16&#124;12 01 16..05 31 17 | Entries posted either on December 15 2016 or on dates between and including December 01 2016 and May 31 2017. |
|..12 14 16&#124;12 30 16.. | Entries posted on December 14 or earlier, or entries posted on December 30 or later - that is, all entries except those posted on dates between and including December 15 and 29. |

Note that we have used the US date format MMDDYY here. As [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] becomes available in other markets, you'll be able to use the formats that you are used to.

## Use Date Formulas
A date formula is a short, abbreviated combination of letters and numbers that specifies how to calculate dates. You can enter date formulas in various date calculation fields and in recurring frequency fields in recurring journals.

> [!NOTE]
> In all data formula fields, one day is automatically included to cover today as the day when the period starts. Accordingly, for example, if you enter **1W**, then the period is actually eight days because today is included. To specify a period of seven days (one true week) including the period starting date, then you must enter **6D** or **1W\-1D**.

Here are some examples of how date formulas can be used:

- The date formula in the recurring frequency field in recurring journals determines how often the entry on the journal line will be posted.

- The date formula in the **Grace Period** field for a specified reminder level determines the period of time that must pass from the due date (or from the due date of the previous reminder) before a reminder will be created.

- The date formula in the **Due Date Calculation** field determines how to calculate the due date on the reminder.

The date calculation formula can contain a maximum of 20 characters, both numbers and letters. You can use the following letters, which are abbreviations for time specifications.

|  Letter  |  Time specification  |
|----------|----------------------|
|C|Current|
|D|Day\(s\)|
|W|Week\(s\)|
|M|Month\(s\)|
|Q|Quarter\(s\)|
|Y|Year\(s\)|

You can construct a date formula in three ways.

The following example shows how to use **C**, for current, and a time unit.

|  Expression  |  Meaning  |
|--------------|-----------|
|CW|Current week|
|CM|Current month|

The following example shows how to use a number and a time unit. A number cannot be larger than 9999.

|  Expression  |  Meaning  |
|--------------|-----------|
|10D|10 days from today|
|2W|2 weeks from today|

The following example shows how to use a time unit and a number.

|  Expression  |  Meaning  |
|--------------|-----------|
|D10|The next 10th day of a month|
|WD4|The next 4th day of a week \(Thursday\)|

The following example shows how you can combine these three forms as needed.

|  Expression  |  Meaning  |
|--------------|-----------|
|CM\+10D|Current month \+ 10 days|

The following example shows how you can use a minus sign to indicate a date in the past.

|  Expression  |  Meaning  |
|--------------|-----------|
|-1Y|1 year ago from today|

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If the location uses a base calendar, then the date formula that you enter in, for example, the **Shipping Time** field is interpreted according to the calendar working days. For example, **1W**  means seven working days.

-->

## Entering times

When you enter times, you can insert any nonspace separators that you want between the units. If you use double digits for each unit up to milliseconds, then it isn't required.

You only have to write the largest units that you require; the rest are set to zero. You can also leave out any AM/PM indicator.

The following table lists the various ways in which times can be entered and how they're interpreted. It assumes region settings that format times according to **Hours:Minutes:Seconds.Milliseconds** and use the AM and PM indicators.

|**Entry**      |**Interpretation**      |
|---------------|------------------------|
|05:23:17|05:23:17|
|5|05:00:00|
|5AM|05:00:00|
|5P|17:00:00|
|12|12:00:00|
|12A|00:00:00|
|12P|12:00:00|
|17|17:00:00|
|5:30|05:30:00|
|0530|05:30:00|
|5:30:5|05:30:05|
|053005|05:30:05|
|5:30:5,50|05:30:05.5|
|053005050|05:30:05.05|

> [!NOTE]
> Milliseconds are interpreted as decimal notation. So, for example, 3, 30, and 300 all mean 300 milliseconds, while 03 means 30 and 003 means 3 milliseconds.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You can't use 24:00 to mean midnight, or use any value greater than 24:00.

The word for *time* in the language used by [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_long.md)] is the current time on your computer or mobile device. You can enter a part of the word starting from the beginning, such as **t** or **TIM**.

## Entering combined dates and times

[!INCLUDE [datetimes](includes/datetimes.md)]

## Entering duration

Some fields in the application represent a duration, or amount of elapsed time, instead of a specific date or time. You enter a duration as a number followed by its unit of measure.

Here are some examples.

|**Duration**|**Unit of measure**|
|------------|-------------------|
|2h|2 hrs|
|6h 30 m|6 hrs 30 mins|
|6.5h|6 hrs 30 mins|
|90m|1 hr 30 mins|
|2d 6h 30m|2 days 6 hrs 30 mins|
|2d 6h 30m 56s 600ms|2 days 6 hrs 30 mins 56 secs 600 msecs|

You can also enter a number that automatically converts to a duration. The number converts according to the default unit of measure that is specified for the duration field.

It's easy to find out which unit of measure a duration field uses. Enter a number, and then look at the unit of measure it converts to.

For example, if the unit of measure is hours, the number 5 converts to 5 hrs.

# Consolidate Balances for a Company that is a Customer and a Vendor
A company that you do business with might be both a customer and a vendor. When that's the case, you can avoid making unnecessary payments or receipts, and perhaps save on transaction fees, by consolidating the company's customer and vendor balances. Consolidation compares the company's balances as a vendor and as a customer, and then nets the amount so that that either the customer or vendor balance remains, depending on which amount was higher. 

To consolidate the balances, you must first link the customer and vendor companies through a contact that has the type **Company**. A customer or vendor can only have one contact of the type **Company**. For more information, see [Create Contacts](marketing-create-contact-companies.md).

After you link the companies, the **Customer Card** page offers the **Balance as Vendor** field, and the **Vendor Card** page includes the **Balance as Customer** field.

Though it's not a requirement, the customer and vendor companies are typically the same legal entity. 

## Before you start
Before you consolidate balances, specify a few settings on the **Marketing Setup** page. 

* On the **Interactions** FastTab, you must specify business relation codes in the **Customers** and **Vendors** fields. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses this information to determine the type of relation to display for contacts. 
* Optional: On the **Duplicates** FastTab, turn duplicate search on or off. By default, duplicate search is turned on. For more information, see [Handling duplicates](#handling-duplicates). 

## Link an existing customer and vendor company through a contact
The following steps describe how to link a customer and a vendor through a contact.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customer** or **Vendor**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the customer or vendor, and then choose the **Contact** action.   
3. Choose the contact, and then choose the **Link with existing** action.
4. Choose the type of entity to create a business relation with.
5. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

## Create a vendor from a customer, or vice versa
You can create a new vendor from an existing customer, or a new customer from a vendor. From the **Customer** or **Vendor** pages, open the **Contact** page. Choose the **Create as** action, and then either the **Customer** or **Vendor** options. 

## Create a new customer or vendor and link them through a vendor or customer contact
1. Create a new customer or vendor. For more information, see [Register New Customers](sales-how-register-new-customers.md).
2. After you set up the customer or vendor, choose the **Create** action, and then choose either the **Customer** or **Vendor** options. 

## To consolidate the customer and vendor balances for a contact company
On the **Payment Journal** page, use the **Net Customer/Vendor Balances** action to consolidate the customer and vendor balances into a single net amount. The action creates, but doesn't post, payment journal lines that contain the net balances.

> [!NOTE]
> If the customer or vendor balances contain amounts that are in different currencies, a line is created for the amount in each currency.

## Handling duplicates
If you turn on duplicate search on the **Duplicates** FastTab on the **Marketing Setup** page, a warning will display when you change the values of fields that are part of the setup for duplicate search strings. When a duplicate is found, you can take the following actions:

* Combine the duplicate contacts into a single contact that is the same for both the customer and vendor by using the **Merge With** capability on the **Contact Card** page. Typically, merging contacts is done only when the customer and vendor are the same legal entity. For more information, see [Merge Duplicate Records](sales-how-merge-duplicate-records.md). 
* Delete the vendor business relation for the vendor or customer contact, and then use the **Link to Existing** action to link to a different contact.

# Get started creating report layouts

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes many built-in layouts that you can use on your reports. Other layouts might be added as part of extensions. In addition, you can create your own report layouts, either from scratch or based on an existing layout.

> [!NOTE]
> You can also use report layouts to add content to email messages. Report layouts can help save time and ensure consistency by reusing the same content when you communicate with your customers. Only custom report layouts of the **Word** type can be used with email. You can't use layouts of the **RDLC** with email. Learn more in [Set up reusable email texts and layouts](admin-how-setup-email.md#set-up-reusable-email-texts-and-layouts).

## Overview of report layouts

It can be helpful to think of a report layout as a file that is imported and assigned to a report. You manage all layouts in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in basically the same way, regardless of the layout type. Usually, you work from the **Report Layouts** page. The layouts differ mainly in the way that you design them. Each layout is designed by using the software that the layout is built on, such Word, Excel, or SQL Server Report Builder.

The process of setting up a layout for a report involves three or four basic tasks.

1. Choose the layout type.
2. Export a copy of an existing layout so that you can use it as a starting point.
3. Make changes to the layout file in the appropriate application.
4. Add the new layout file to the report.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You can modify or replace only user-defined layouts. You can't modify or replace *extension layouts*, which are layouts that originate from an extension. On the **Report Layouts** page, you can tell whether a layout is a user-defined layout or an extension layout by looking in the **Extension** column. For an extension layout, the **Extension** column shows information about the source extension. For a user-defined layout, the **Extension** column is blank.
>
> Learn more about the difference between extension layouts and user-defined layouts in [Layout sources](ui-manage-report-layouts.md#layout-sources).

## Get started

Depending on your situation, the actual tasks vary. Use the following table to get started.

| What do you want to do? | Learn more |
|---|---|
| Figure out the best layout type to use for my situation. | [Decide what type of layout you want](#decide) |
| Create a new layout for a report, either from scratch or based on a copy of an existing layout. | [Create a new layout](#create) |
| Make changes to the layout that a report uses. | [Modify a layout](#modify) |
| Replace the current layout file that a report uses with a new version of the layout file. | [Replace a layout](#replace) |
| Change the current layout that a report uses to another layout. | [Set the layout used by a report](ui-set-report-layout.md) |

| Validate a layout. | [Validate a layout](#validate) |
| View information about a layout. | [Get information about a layout](#get-information-about-a-layout) |
| Delete a user-defined layout. | [Delete a layout](#delete) |

## <a name="decide"></a>Decide what type of layout you want

The first task when you create a layout is to decide which [layout type](ui-manage-report-layouts.md#layout-types) you want. You can choose among the **Word**, **Excel**, and **RDLC** layout types. Your choice depends on how you want the generated report to look. It also depends on your knowledge of the software that is used to create the layout, such as Word, Excel, and SQL Server Report Builder.

* **Excel** layouts are generally the easiest to create and modify because summarizing data, adding graphics, and styling are common Excel features. However, not all reports have datasets optimized for Excel layouts. Aggregations and complex calculations work best with **RDLC** or **Word** layouts. The same applies to documents.
* If you're making only style changes, such as changes to the font type, size, and colors, a **Word** layout is a good choice.
* The capabilities for adding and rearranging data fields are more advanced in **Word** and **RDLC** layouts than in **Excel** layouts.
* **Word** and **RDLC** layouts are good choices for printable reports.
* The design concepts for **Word** and **RDLC** layouts are similar, but each has specific features that affect the report's appearance in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The same report might look different depending on whether a **Word** or **RDLC** layout is used.

## <a name="create"></a>Create a new layout

There are different methods for creating a new layout. The easiest methods involve using a copy of an existing layout. For these methods, you can either save the existing layout directly as a copy, or export it and then import it into a new layout. Another, more advanced method is to create a layout from scratch by using a blank layout.

### [Copy a layout](#tab/copy)

Copying an existing layout lets you quickly create a new, identical layout that you can customize.

1. [!INCLUDE[open-report-layouts-page](includes/open-report-layouts-page.md)]

   The **Report Layouts** page lists all layouts for all reports.
1. Select the layout that you want to copy for the new layout, and then select the **Edit Info** action.

    If you select an extension layout, you're asked whether you want to edit a copy of it. Select **Yes**.

    > [!TIP]
    > To find the layout that you want, use the search field, the filter pane, and column sorting.

1. In the **Layout Name** field, enter a new name.
1. Turn on the **Save Changes to Copy** toggle, if it isn't already on.
1. Select **OK**.

    The new layout appears on the **Report Layouts** page.

If needed, you can change the settings in your new layout. To learn more, go to [Modify a layout](#modify).

### [Export a layout copy and import it as a new layout](#tab/export)

1. [!INCLUDE[open-report-layouts-page](includes/open-report-layouts-page.md)]
1. Select the layout that you want to copy for the new layout, and then select the **Export Layout** action.

    The layout file is downloaded to your device.

    > [!TIP]
    > To find the layout that you want, use the search field, the filter pane, and column sorting.

1. Open the layout file in the appropriate application, such as Word (for a .docx file) or Excel (for an .xlsx file).

    Learn more in the following articles:

    * [Work with Word Layouts](ui-how-add-fields-word-report-layout.md)
    * [Working with Microsoft Excel Layouts](ui-excel-report-layouts.md)
    * [Working with RDLC Layouts](ui-rdlc-report-layouts.md)

1. Make the required changes to the file, and then save it.
1. On the **Report Layouts** page, select **New**.
1. In the **Add New Layout for a Report** dialog box, fill in the fields described in the following table.

    | Field | Description | Mandatory |
    |---|---|---|
    | Report ID | Enter the ID that is assigned to the report. | Yes |
    | Layout Name | Enter a brief, descriptive name for the layout to help you easily identify it. | Yes |
    | Description | Enter more detailed information about the layout. | No |
    | Format Options | Set this field to match the type of the layout (for example, **Word**, **Excel**, or **RDLC**). | Yes |

1. Select **OK**.
1. Follow one of these steps to upload the layout file for the report:

    [!INCLUDE[file-upload](includes/file-upload.md)]

    The selected file is uploaded to the layout, and you're returned to the **Report Layouts** page.

To view how the report looks with the new layout, select the layout in the list, and then select **Run Report**.

### [Create from blank](#tab/blank)

When you create a new layout from a blank layout, you must design it completely. The layout file provides all the report fields that you can add and arrange as you require.

1. [!INCLUDE[open-report-layouts-page](includes/open-report-layouts-page.md)]
1. Select any layout that is for the same report that you want use the new layout for.
1. Select **New**.
1. In the **Add New Layout for a Report** dialog box, set the following fields.

    | Field | Description | Mandatory |
    |---|---|---|
    | Report ID | Enter the ID that is assigned to the report. | Yes |
    | Layout Name | Enter a brief descriptive name for the layout to help you easily identify it. | Yes |
    | Description | Enter more detailed information about the layout. | No |
    | Format Options | Set this field to match the type of the layout (for example, **Word**, **Excel**, or **RDLC**). | Yes |

1. Turn on the **Create a blank layout from the report object** option.
1. Select **OK**.

    The new layout appears in the list. The layout is blank, but all the report fields and captions are available so that you can start to add them to the layout.

1. You can now start to [Modify a layout](#modify).

## Mark a layout as obsolete

A layout can become obsolete for various reasons. For example, the data model might change, making the layout outdated, or a more efficient layout might be introduced, making the current layout redundant. Marking a layout as obsolete signals to others that it might be removed in a later release, so they should use an alternative layout.

To identify which layouts are obsolete, refer to the **Obsolete** column on the **Report Layouts page**. You can mark a user-defined layout as obsolete if needed. 

1. [!INCLUDE[open-report-layouts-page](includes/open-report-layouts-page.md)]
2. Select the layout that you want to change, and then select the **Edit Info** action.
3. Turn on the **Mark layout as obsolete** toggle.
4. Select **OK**.

> [!NOTE]
> Extension layouts are marked as obsolete in AL code using the [ObsoleteState property](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/properties/devenv-obsoletestate-property) and can't be changed using the **Edit Info** action.

# Release and reopen sales and purchase documents

In this article, you learn how to release or reopen sales and purchase documents like an order, invoice, and quote. You release sales and purchase documents to move them to the next stage of processing before they're posted. When an order is released, it's included in all availability calculations from the expected receipt date of the items.

## Release a sales or purchase document

1. Open the document that you want to release as follows:

   1. In the upper right, select the ![Shows the question mark icon that opens the search box.](media/ui-search/search_small.png) icon to open the search box.
   1. Enter the document type you're looking for, such as **Sales orders** or **Purchase orders**, then choose the related link.
   1. In the list, select the document to open it.
1. In the action bar at the top, select **Release**.

   The **Status** field changes to **Released**.

## Reopen a sales or purchase document

You can make changes to a released sales and purchase document by reopening it.

1. Open the document that you want to reopen as follows:

   1. In the upper right, select the ![Shows the question mark icon that opens the search box.](media/ui-search/search_small.png) icon to open the search box.
   1. Enter the document type you're looking for, such as **Sales orders** or **Purchase orders**, then choose the related link.
   1. In the list, select the document to open it.
1. In the action bar at the top, select **Reopen**.

   The **Status** field changes to **Open**.

You can now make changes to the document before you release it again.

> [!NOTE]
> On document lines that have already been handled in the warehouse, the only change you can make is to change the quantity.

# Use the same Microsoft 365 Account in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_long.md)] and Microsoft Invoicing
When you sign up for a trial with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can move to a 30-day evaluation phase, you can start a subscription, or you can stop using [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. In all cases, you may at some point have seen something called **Microsoft Invoicing** and clicked it. This was an app that was part of what is now Microsoft 365 Business Standard and was formerly known as Microsoft 365 Business Premium subscription, so not everyone will have seen that tile in their Microsoft 365 experience.  

Microsoft Invoicing is no longer available, but if you need to sign into Invoicing to retrieve your data, you might see a message that you cannot access Microsoft Invoicing because your account is used in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

You see a similar message if you install the mobile app for Invoicing.  

## Workaround
Invoicing and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] have a shared platform. That means that you are recognized as an existing user of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] when you click Invoicing in the Microsoft 365 admin center. The reason is that Invoicing cannot use the same company as [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

So you will have to sign in to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and rename your existing company, and then create a new company that you can then use in Invoicing. No data is moved or overwritten during this workaround.

### To rename your company
1. Sign in to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].
2. In the top right corner, choose the **Settings** icon ![Settings.](media/ui-experience/settings_icon_small.png "Settings icon for role center"), and then choose **My Settings**.
3. In the **Company** field, choose a different company.
4. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Companies**, and then choose the related link.  
5. On the **Companies** page, choose **Edit List**.  
6. Change the name of the *My Company* entry to something else.  

    Wait a number of minutes. We’ll be making a number of changes in the underlying database, and that takes a while.
7.	When the system is ready again, choose the **Create New Company** button.  
8.  In the dialog that appears, specify the name as *My Company*, and choose the **Production – Setup Data Only** option.  

This again takes a number of minutes. When the process completes, you will be able to access Invoicing as part of your Microsoft 365 Business Standard experience. but only to export data since the Invoicing app is deprecated.  

### What about my data?
When you rename the original My Company, the database tables that store your existing [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] data are renamed, but the data itself is not touched.  

If you use both Invoicing and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the data is stored in two different containers (the two companies). Nothing is shared, so you'll have to manage customers and items in both companies.

# Create Blanket Assembly Orders

You can use assembly management to customize an assembly item to a customer's request during the sales process. For more information, see [Sell Items Assembled to Order](assembly-how-to-sell-items-assembled-to-order.md).  

 As with any other type of item, you can also create blanket sales orders for customized assembly items before periodically making the actual sales orders according to the blanket order agreement. This process involves several extra steps when you compare it to creating a regular blanket sales order, and it uses a variation of a linked assembly order, which is a blanket assembly order.

> [!NOTE]  
>  Like all blanket orders, quantities on assembly blanket orders are only forecasts and are not operational until they are converted to actual assembly orders. Therefore, order functionality, such as availability calculation, reservation, and item tracking, is not active on blanket assembly orders.  

## To create a blanket assembly order for an assemble\-to\-order item  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Blanket Sales Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Create a new blanket sales order with one line for an assembly item. For more information, see [Create Blanket Sales Orders](sales-how-to-create-blanket-sales-orders.md).  
3. In the **Qty. to Assemble to Order** field on the blanket assembly order line, enter the full quantity.

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  You should not create blanket order agreements for a partial quantity. Therefore, you must enter the same quantity that you entered in the **Quantity** field on the blanket sales order line.  

4. Choose the **Assemble to Order** action, and then choose the **Assemble-to-Order Lines** action. Alternatively, choose the **Qty. to Assemble to Order)** field on the line.  
5. On the **Assemble-to-Order Lines** page, review or modify the assembly order lines according to the blanket order agreement that you have made with the customer. If you want to view more information, choose the **Show Document** action to open the complete blanket assembly order. You cannot change the contents of most fields, and you cannot post.  
6. When you have adjusted the assembly order lines according to the blanket order agreement, close the **Assemble-to-Order Lines** page to return to the **Blanket Sales Order** page.  
7. When the customer requests to create a sales order based on the agreed blanket sales order, create a sales order for the agreed assembly item or items. For more information, see [Create Blanket Sales Orders](sales-how-to-create-blanket-sales-orders.md).

The linked blanket assembly order and any customizations are linked to that new sales order to prepare for assembly of the item or items to be sold.

# Return Order Overview (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2025w1](includes/applies-to-2025w1.md)]

The **Return Order Overview** report tracks and analyzes return orders, providing insights into return amounts, quantities, reasons for return, and the financial effect on the organization. The report gives a high-level summary of return trends for item categories and customers, and analyzes the return amount over time.

:::image type="content" source="media/powerbi/sales/sales-returns-overview.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Return Order Overview report" lightbox="media/powerbi/sales/sales-returns-overview.png":::

## Use the report

Leadership and management teams use the report to identify key factors that cause return orders and credit memos.

For CEOs, you want to evaluate return trends to inform key business decisions. For example, you identify 60% of return reasons are attributed to damage during delivery. In response, you engage a new logistics partner to optimize shipping procedures and minimize product returns.

As a product manager, you want to identify the item attributes which contribute the most to return orders, to inform future product development. By analyzing the return amount, you identify a specific item category with lower profitability. These insights help identify a persistent component fault and implement production process improvements to reduce item defects.

As a salesperson, this report helps you monitor individual customer returns, to assist with managing client relationships. Using this report, you notice that a particular customer has the highest [Return Rate](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#return-rate) and their return amount increased over the past month. Using this information, you decide to offer a special discount to rebuild client trust in the business.

## Key performance indicators

The report includes the following key performance indicators (KPIs) and measures:

- [Sales Amount](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#sales-amount)
- [Sales Quantity](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#sales-quantity)
- [Gross Profit](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#gross-profit)
- [Return Rate](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#return-rate)
- [No. of Return Orders](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#no-of-return-orders)

[!INCLUDE[click-on-a-kpi-link](includes/click-on-a-kpi-link.md)]

[!INCLUDE[powerbi-tip-track-kpis](includes/powerbi-tip-track-kpis.md)]

## Data used in the report

The report uses data from the following tables in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]:

- Sales Line
- Value Entry
- Customer
- Item Category
- Reason Code

# Revalue inventory
If you want to appreciate or depreciate an item or a specific item ledger entry, you must use the revaluation journal.

## To revalue inventory
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Revaluation Journal**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **Calculate Inventory Value** action.
3. On the **Calculate Inventory Value** page, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
4. Choose the **OK** button.
5. On each line on the **Item Revaluation Journals** page, in the **Unit Cost (Revalued)** field, enter the new unit cost. Alternatively, enter the new total amount in the **Inventory Value (Revalued)** field.

    The relevant fields are automatically updated. The **Amount** field shows the actual change in inventory value for the selected item ledger entry. It calculates the difference between the **Inventory Value (Calculated)** field and the **Inventory Value (Revalued)** field.
6. When you have completed all lines in the revaluation journal, choose the **Post** action.

New value entries are now created to reflect the revaluations that you have posted. You can see the new values on the respective item cards.

# Set up VAT statement templates and VAT statement names

Tax authorities can, and do, change their requirements for posting VAT. VAT Statement templates and VAT statement names can help you prepare for upcoming changes and make a smooth transition to the new requirements. You can use VAT statement templates to set up different Reports when choosing to print the statement. Each VAT Statement Template can have multiple Vat Statement names, which in turn define the calculations, and you can create a new VAT statement name when requirements change. For example, one name might calculate VAT for this year based on the current requirements, and another might calculate VAT based on requirements for next year. Names are also a way to keep a history of VAT statement formats, for example, so that you can look back to see how you calculated VAT in previous years.

## To define a VAT statement

VAT statements let you calculate your VAT settlement amount for a certain period, for example, a quarter.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Statements**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **Name** field, and then choose **New** on the **VAT Statement Names** page.
3. Fill in the required fields. Usually you want to have a setting for each VAT Bus. Posting Group / VAT Prod. Posting Group combination. For Row numbers it does make sense to use equivalent numbers or codes as in your official VAT Statement [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  

> [!Tip]
> You can filter the information that the statement will include, depending on what you choose in the **Type** field. **Account Totaling** is useful when you want the VAT from a specific account.
**VAT Entry Totaling** gets VAT from the accounts assigned to the selections in the **Gen. Posting Type**, **VAT Bus. Posting Group**, and/or the **VAT Prod. Posting Group** fields. **Row Totaling** lets you enter a value or quick filter criteria in the **Row Totaling** field. For more information, see [Searching, filtering, and Sorting Data](ui-enter-criteria-filters.md). **Description** is often used to add a note to the statement. For example, you could use it as a heading when you've used row totaling.

## To preview the VAT statement

After you define a VAT statement, you can preview it to make sure it meets your needs.
> [!Tip]
> It is best practice to have one section in the VAT Statement using **Type** **Vat Entry Totaling** and another section below using **Type** **Account Totaling** to reconcile the amounts based on the **VAT Entry** table compared to the amount on the **G/L Accounts**. You can also use the **G/L - VAT Reconciliation** Report for this purpose.

1. Choose **Preview**.
2. Enter a date filter to limit the statement to a specific period. For more information about how to customize the page to show the date filter, see [Searching, filtering, and Sorting Data](ui-enter-criteria-filters.md).
3. You can select various options to specify the type of VAT entries to include in the statement.
4. On the lines where the **Type** field contains **VAT Entry Totaling** you can see a list of VAT entries by choosing the amount in the **Column Amount** field.
5. You can use personalization to show more fields in the lines. For example the Unrealized Base Amount and Unrealized VAT Amount, if you're using unrealized VAT.

# Transfer inventory between locations

You can transfer inventory items between locations by creating transfer orders. Alternatively, you can use the item reclassification journal.

> [!NOTE]
> To transfer items, you must set up locations and transfer routes. To learn more about setting up locations, go to [Set up locations](inventory-how-setup-locations.md). You can't use transfer orders for *blank* locations.

## Transfer orders

You can ship an outbound transfer from one location and receive an inbound transfer at the destination. You can:

* Track a quantity in transit.
* Define calendars, routings, and inbound and outbound handling times for date calculation and planning. To learn more about planning, go to [About Planning Functionality](production-about-planning-functionality.md).
* Use different warehouse features for inbound and outbound locations.
* Use transfer orders for direct transfers, with some limitations.

## Item reclassification journals

You can use the **Item Reclassification Journals** page to:

* Direct transfer of items between locations.
* Move items between bins. To learn more about transferring items between bins, go to [Move Items Unplanned in Basic Warehouse Configurations](warehouse-how-to-move-items-ad-hoc-in-basic-warehousing.md).
* Change a lot or serial number to a new lot or serial number. To learn more about reclassifying serial and lot numbers, go to [Reclassify serial or lot numbers](inventory-how-work-item-tracking.md#to-reclassify-serial-or-lot-numbers).
* Change the expiration date to a new date.
* Reclassify items from a blank location to an actual location.
* Create warehouse entries if you don't manage warehouse activities.

## To transfer items with a transfer order

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Transfer orders**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Transfer Order** page, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

    > [!NOTE]  
    > If you filled in the **In-Transit Code**, **Shipping Agent Code**, and **Shipping Agent Service** fields on the **Trans. Route Spec.** page when you set up the transfer route, the corresponding fields on the transfer order are filled in automatically.

    When you fill in the **Shipping Agent Service** field, the receipt date at the transfer-to location is calculated by adding the shipping time of the shipping agent service to the shipment date.

3. There are several ways to fill in the lines:

    |Option  |Description  |
    |---------|---------|
    |Manually     | On the **Lines** FastTab, fill in a line for an item, or use the **Select items** action to choose multiple items.        |
    |Automatically     | * Choose the **Get Bin Content** action to select existing items from a specific bin at the location.<br><br>* Choose the **Get Receipt Lines** to select items that just arrived at the transfer-from location.        |

    You can now ship the items.
4. Choose the **Post** action, choose the **Ship** option, and then choose the **OK** button.

    The items are now in transit between the specified locations according to the transfer route.

    As a warehouse worker at the transfer-from location, proceed to receive the items. The transfer order lines are the same as when shipped and can't be edited.
5. Choose the **Post** action, choose the **Receive** option, and then choose the **OK** button.

### Undo a transfer shipment

If you find a mistake in a quantity on a posted transfer order, as long as the shipment isn't received you can easily correct the quantity. On the **Posted Transfer Shipment** page, the **Undo Shipment** action creates corrective lines, as follows:

* The value in the **Quantity Shipped** field is decreased by the undone quantity.
* The value in the **Qty. to Ship** field is increased by the undone quantity.
* The **Correction** checkbox is selected for the lines.

If the quantity shipped in a warehouse shipment, a corrective line is created in the posted warehouse shipment.

To complete the correction, reopen the transfer order, enter the correct quantity, and then post the order. If you're using a warehouse shipment to ship the order, create and post a new warehouse shipment.

### Post multiple transfer orders in a batch

The following procedure explains how to post transfer orders in a batch.

1. 1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Transfer orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Transfer Orders** page, select the orders to post.
3. In the **No.** field, open the context menu and choose **Select More**.
4. Select the checkbox for the lines for each order that you want to post.
5. Choose the **Post** action, and then choose **Post Batch**.
6. On the **Batch Post Transfer Order** page, fill in the fields as necessary.

   > [!TIP]
    > For transfer orders that use an in-transit location, you can choose either **Ship** or **Receive**. Repeat this step if you need to do both. For orders where **Direct Posting** is turned on, both options work in the same way and post the order completely.

7. Select **OK**.
8. To view potential issues, open the **Error Message Register** page.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Posting multiple documents might take some time and block other users. Consider enabling background posting. For more information, see [Use Job Queues to Schedule Tasks](/dynamics365/business-central/admin-job-queues-schedule-tasks).

### Schedule a job queue entry to post multiple documents in a batch

Alternatively, you can use the job queue to schedule posting to happen at a time that's convenient for your organization. For example, it might make sense for your business to run certain routines when most of the data entry is done for the day.

The following procedure shows how to set up the **Batch Post Transfer Orders** report to automatically post direct transfer orders at 4 PM on weekdays. That time is just an example. The steps are the same for other documents.  

1. Search for the **Job Queue Entries** page, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. In the **Object Type to Run** field, select **Report**.  
4. In the **Object ID to Run** field, select **5707, Batch Post Transfer Orders**.
5. Select the **Report Request Page** checkbox.
6. On the **Batch Post Transfer Orders** request page, choose the **Ship** option, filter on **Direct Transfer**, and then select **OK**.

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > It's important to set filters. Otherwise, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will post all documents, even if they aren't ready. Consider setting a filter on the **Status** field for the value **Released**, and a filter on the **Posting Date** field for the value **..today**. To learn more about filters, go to [Sorting, Searching, and Filtering](/dynamics365/business-central/ui-enter-criteria-filters).

7. Select all checkboxes from **Run on Mondays** to **Run on Fridays**.
8. In the **Starting Time** field, enter **4 PM**.
9. Choose the **Set Status to Ready** action.

### Comparison of different settings for transfer orders

You can post transfer orders in different modes, with or without an in-transit location. Turn off the **Direct Transfer** toggle and select the temporary location in the **In Transit Code** field on the **Transfer Order** page. When you post the shipment of a transfer order that uses the in-transit location, the items on the line are no longer available at one of your locations because they're in transit. Direct posting ensures that an in-transit location isn't used and the shipment and receipt process simultaneously. The exact behavior of direct posting might can be different based on the value selected in the **Direct Transfer Posting** field on the **Inventory Setup** page.

The following table describes how the combinations differ.

|Capability|The **Direct Transfer** field is disabled in the **Transfer Order** page|**Direct Transfer** is enabled on the **Transfer Order** page</br>**Direct Transfer Posting** is set to **Direct Transfer** on the **Inventory Setup** page|**Direct Transfer** is enabled in the **Transfer Order** page</br>**Direct Transfer Posting** is set to **Receipt and Shipment** on the **Inventory Setup** page|
|---|---|---|---|
|Use in-transit location|Yes|No|No|
|Can post receipt without shipment.</br>Can use **Undo receipt**.|Yes|No|No|
|Partial posting|Yes|No|Yes|
|Item ledger entries|4:</br>Transfer from From-Location,</br>Transfer to In-Transit,</br>Transfer from In-Transit,</br>Transfer to To-Location.|2:</br>Transfer from From-Location,</br>Transfer to To-Location.|4:</br>Transfer from From-Location,</br>Transfer to *blank*,</br>Transfer from *blank*,</br>Transfer to To-Location.|

|Reservation: inbound and outbound|Yes|Yes|Yes|
|Item Charges - assign to posted transfer receipt|Yes|No|Yes|
|Warehouse handling|Full|No|Limited, see below|

Warehouse handling matrix for configuration: **Direct Transfer** is enabled on the **Transfer Order** page and **Direct Transfer Posting** is set to **Direct Transfer** on the **Inventory Setup** page.

|From \ To|To: No warehouse handling|To: Warehouse receipt|To: Inventory Put-away|To: Directed put-away and pick|
|-|-|-|-|-|
|**From: No warehouse handling**|1|Not supported|1, 4|Not supported|
|**From: Warehouse shipment**|1, 2|Not supported|1,2,4|Not supported|
|**From: Inventory put-away**|1, 3|Not supported|1,3,4|Not supported|
|**From: Directed put-away and pick**|2|Not supported|2|Not supported|

The numbers in the cells show the posting options that are supported.

1. Post from transfer order. For some combinations, you might need to fill in the **Qty. to Ship** field.
2. Create and post a warehouse shipment.
3. Create and post an inventory pick.
4. Create and post an inventory put-away. For some combinations you might need to fill in the **Qty. to Ship** field.

Regardless of the method, the shipment and receipt transactions are performed. For example you can create a transfer order from a location that requires inventory-pick to a location that requires inventory put-away. You can create and post the inventory put-away, and both the shipment and receipt transactions are created. You can also post such documents from a transfer order or from an inventory pick.  

For more information about warehouse handling, see [Warehouse management overview](design-details-warehouse-management.md).

## To transfer items with the item reclassification journal

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Item Reclass. Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Item Reclass. Journal** page, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
3. In the **Location Code** field, enter the location where the items are currently stored.

    > [!NOTE]  
    > To transfer items that have no location code, leave the **Location Code** field blank.
4. In the **New Location Code** field, enter the location that you want to transfer the items to.
5. Choose the **Post** action.

# Depreciation methods for fixed assets

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports eight different methods of depreciation for fixed assets:

* Straight-Line (SL)
* Declining-Balance 1 (DB1)
* Declining-Balance 2 (DB2)
* DB1/SL
* DB2/SL
* Half-Year Convention
* Manual
* User-defined depreciation

## Straight-Line depreciation

With Straight-Line depreciation, you deprecate the asset value either with a fixed yearly percentage or with a fixed yearly amount over the depreciation period. When you use the straight-line method, you must specify one of the following options in the fixed asset depreciation book:  

* The depreciation period (years or months) or a depreciation ending date  
* A fixed yearly percentage  
* A fixed yearly amount  
* Depreciation period  

### Depreciation period

If you enter the depreciation period (the number of depreciation years, the number of depreciation months, or the depreciation ending date), the following formula calculates the depreciation amount:  

* Depreciation Amount = ((Book value - Salvage Value) x Number of Depreciation Days) / Remaining Depreciation Days*  

The remaining depreciation days are calculated as the number of depreciation days minus the number of days between the starting date and the last fixed asset entry date.  

Book value can be reduced by posted appreciation, write-down, custom 1, or custom 2 amounts depending on whether the **Include in Depr. Calculation** field is deactivated and whether the **Part of Book Value** field is activated on the **FA Posting Type Setup** page. This calculation ensures that the fixed asset is fully depreciated at the depreciation ending date.  

### Fixed yearly percentage

If you enter a fixed yearly percentage, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses the following formula to calculate the depreciation amount:  

* Depreciation Amount = (Straight-Line % x Depreciable Basis x Number of Depr. Days) / (100 x 360)*  

### Fixed yearly amount

If you enter a fixed yearly amount, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses the following formula to calculate the depreciation amount:  

* Depreciation Amount = (Fixed Depreciation Amount x Number of Depreciation Days) / 360*  

### Example - Straight-Line depreciation

A fixed asset has an acquisition cost of LCY 100,000. The estimated life is eight years. The **Calculate Depreciation** batch job is run biannually.  

For this example, the fixed asset ledger entry looks like this:  

| Date | FA Posting Type | Days | Amount | Book Value |
| ---- | --------------- | ---- | ------ | ---------- |
| 01/01/20 |Acquisition Cost |(Depreciation starting date) |100,000.00 |100,000.00 |
| 06/30/20 |Depreciation |180 |-6,250.00 |93,750.00 |
| 12/31/20 |Depreciation |180 |-6,250.00 |87,500.00 |
| 06/30/21 |Depreciation |180 |-6,250.00 |81,250.00 |
| 12/31/21 |Depreciation |180 |-6,250.00 |75,000.00 |
| ...      |             |    |          |          |
| 06/30/27 |Depreciation |180 |-6,250.00 |6,250.00  |
| 12/31/27 |Depreciation |180 |-6,250.00 |0         |

## Declining-Balance 1 depreciation

This depreciation method allocates the largest part of an asset's cost to the early years of its useful lifetime. If you use this method, you must enter a fixed yearly percentage.  

The following formula calculates depreciation amounts:  

* Depreciation Amount = (Declining-Bal. % x Number of Depreciation Days x Depr. Basis) / (100 x 360)*  

The depreciable basis is calculated as the book value at the beginning of the year. The number of depreciation days are the number of days between the posting date and the last depreciation date. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates depreciation assuming that any depreciation done in the fiscal year is done with this formula.  

The posted depreciation amount can contain entries with various posting types (write-down, custom1, and custom2) posted since the starting date of the current fiscal year. These posting types are included in the posted depreciation amount if there are check marks in the **Depreciation Type** and the **Part of Book Value** fields on the **FA Posting Type Setup** page.  

### Example 1 - Declining-Balance 1 depreciation

A fixed asset has an acquisition cost of LCY 100,000. The **Declining-Balance %** field is 25. The **Calculate Depreciation** batch job is run biannually.  

The following table shows how the fixed asset ledger entries look.  

| Date | FA Posting Type | Days | Amount | Book Value |
| ---- | --------------- | ---- | ------ | ---------- |
| 01/01/20 |Acquisition Costs |(Depreciation starting date) |100,000.00 |100,000.00 |
| 06/30/20 |Depreciation |180 |-12,500.00 |87,500.00 |
| 12/31/20 |Depreciation |180 |-12,500.00 |75,000.00 |
| 06/30/21 |Depreciation |180 |-9,375.00 |65,625.00 |
| 12/31/21 |Depreciation |180 |-9,375.00 |56,250.00 |
| 06/30/22 |Depreciation |180 |-7,031.25 |49,218.75 |
| 12/31/22 |Depreciation |180 |-7,031.25 |42,187.50 |
| 06/30/23 |Depreciation |180 |-5,273.44 |36,914.06 |
| 12/31/23 |Depreciation |180 |-5,273.44 |31,640.62 |
| 06/30/24 |Depreciation |180 |-3,955.08 |27,685.54 |
| 12/31/24 |Depreciation |180 |-3,955.08 |23,730.46 |
| ...      |             |    |          |          |

Calculation method:  

* Year 1: *25% of 100,000 = 25,000 = 12,500 + 12,500*
* Year 2: *25% of 75,000 = 18,750 = 9,375 + 9,375*
* Year 3: *25% of 56,250 = 14,062.50 = 7,031.25 + 7,031.25*
* ...

The calculation continues until the book value equals the final rounding amount or the salvage value that you entered.  

### Example 2 - Declining-Balance 1 depreciation

An asset's book value is 100,000 on 12/31/2022. You post a depreciation of 1,778 on 2/2/23, which is the expected (proportional) amount of the year's depreciation at 32 days. If you run depreciation on 6/30/2023 [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will suggest 8,222, because there are 148 days from 2/2/2023 until 6/30/2023. The expected remaining depreciation for 6/30/2023 is calculated using the following formula:

* *148/360 x 0.20 x 100,000 = 8,222*

### Example 3 - Declining-Balance 1 depreciation

If you post an amount that doesn't align with the Declining Balance 1 depreciation method, for example, 5,000, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] suggests the remainder of the expected amount.

An asset's book value is 100,000 on 12/31/2022. You post a depreciation of 5,000 on 2/2/2023, which is more than the expected (proportional) amount on 2/2/2023 at 32 days. If you run depreciation on 6/30/2023, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will suggest 8,222, because there are 148 days from 2/2/2023 until 6/30/2023. The expected remaining depreciation for 6/30/2023 is calculated using the following formula:

* *148/360 x 0.20 x 100,000 = 8,222*

### Example 4 - Declining-Balance 1 depreciation

An asset's book value is 100,000 on 12/31/2023. You post a depreciation of 95,000 on 2/2/2023, which exceeds the allowed depreciation amount for the year. If you run depreciation on 6/30/2023, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will suggest 5000, because there are 148 days from 2/2/2023 until 6/30/2023. The expected remaining depreciation for 6/30/2023 is calculated using the following formula: 

* *148/360 x 0.20 x 100,000 = 8,222*

However, the remaining book value is only 5,000, so [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] suggests 5,000 because a book value can't be negative.

## Declining-Balance 2 depreciation

The Declining-Balance 1 and Declining-Balance 2 methods calculate the same total depreciation amount for each year. However, if you run the **Calculate Depreciation** batch job more than once a year, the Declining-Balance 1 method results in equal depreciation amounts for each depreciation period. The Declining-Balance 2 method, on the other hand, results in depreciation amounts that decline for each period.  

### Example - Declining-Balance 2 depreciation

A fixed asset has an acquisition cost of LCY 100,000. The **Declining-Balance %** field is 25. The **Calculate Depreciation** batch job is run biannually. The fixed asset ledger entries look like this:  

| Date     | FA Posting Type  | Days                       | Amount    | Book Value |
| -------- | ---------------- | -------------------------  | --------- | ---------- |
| 01/01/20 |Acquisition Costs |(Depreciation starting date)|100,000.00 |100,000.00 |
| 06/30/20 |Depreciation      |180                         |-13,397.46 | 86,602.54 |
| 12/31/20 |Depreciation      |180                         |-11,602.54 | 75,000.00 |
| 06/30/21 |Depreciation      |180                         |-10,048.09 | 64,951.91 |
| 12/31/21 |Depreciation      |180                         |-8,701.91  | 56,250.00 |
| ...      |                  |                            |           |           |

Calculation Method:  

* *BV* = Book value  
* *ND* = Number of depreciation days  
* *DBP* = Declining-balance percent  
* *P* = *DBP*/100  
* *D* = *ND*/360  

The formula to calculate the depreciation amounts is:  

* *DA* = *BV* x (1 – (1 –P)<sup>D</sup>)

The depreciation values are:  

| Date     | Calculation                                                |
| -------- | -----------                                                |
| 06/30/20 |DA = 100,000.00 x (1 -(1 - 0.25)<sup>0.5</sup>) = 13,397.46 |
| 12/31/20 |DA = 86,602.54 x (1 - (1 - 0.25)<sup>0.5</sup>) = 11,602.54 |
| 06/30/21 |DA = 75,000.00 x (1 - (1 - 0.25)<sup>0.5</sup>) = 10,048.09 |
| 12/31/21 |DA = 64,951.91 x (1 - (1 - 0.25)<sup>0.5</sup>) = 8,701.91  |
| ...      |                                                            |

## DB1/SL depreciation

DB1/SL is an abbreviated combination of Declining-Balance 1 and Straight-Line. The calculation continues until the book value equals the final rounding amount, or the salvage value that you entered.  

The **Calculate Depreciation** batch job calculates a straight-line amount and a declining balance amount, but only the greater of the two amounts are transferred to the journal.  

You can use various percentages to calculate declining-balance.  

If you use this method, you must enter the estimated useful lifetime and a declining balance percentage on the **FA Depreciation Books** page.  

> [!NOTE]
> If you use any of the declining balance depreciation methods, and you want to run depreciation for multiple years, you must run each year's depreciation separately. If you run depreciation for the whole period from acquisition date to the end of the last fiscal year or last accounting period, it's likely that the results are incorrect. For example, if you imported legacy data and you use the actual acquisition dates for your assets and want to catch up on accumulated depreciation. For declining balance methods, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates the allowed depreciation per year, starting with the registered book value for each year. It can't do a multi-year depreciation in one step.
>
> The **Fixed asset - Projected Value** report can project depreciations for multi-year periods, which might be confusing compared to the results you get if you run depreciations for multiple years using one of the declining balance methods. 

### Example - DB1-SL depreciation

A fixed asset has an acquisition cost of LCY 100,000. On the **FA Depreciation Books** page, the **Declining-Balance %** field contains 25 and the **No. of Depreciation Years** field contains **8**. The **Calculate Depreciation** batch job is run biannually.  

The fixed asset ledger entries look like this:  

| Date | FA Posting Type | Days | Amount | Book Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 01/01/20 |Acquisition Costs |(Depreciation starting date) |100,000.00 |100,000.00 |
| 06/30/20 |Depreciation |180 |-12,500.00 |87,500.00 |
| 12/31/20 |Depreciation |180 |-12,500.00 |75,000.00 |
| 06/30/21 |Depreciation |180 |-9,375.00 |65,625.00 |
| 12/31/21 |Depreciation |180 |-9,375.00 |56,250.00 |
| 06/30/22 |Depreciation |180 |-7,031.25 |49,218.75 |

| 12/31/27 |Depreciation |180 |-3,955.07 |0.00 SL |

`SL` after the book value means that the straight-line method was used.  

Calculation method:  

* Year 1 (2020):  

    *Declining-balance amount: 25% of 100,000 = 25,000 = 12,500 + 12,500*  

    *Straight-line amount = 100,000 / 8 = 12,500 = 6,250 + 6,250*  

    The declining-balance amount is used because it's the greater amount.  
* ...
* Year 5 (2025):  

    *Declining-balance amount: 25% of 23,730.46 = 4,943.85= 2,471.92 + 2,471.92*  

    *Straight-line amount = 23,730.46/3 = 7,910.15 = 3,995.07 + 3,995.08*  

    The straight-line amount is used because it's the greater amount.  

## Half-Year Convention depreciation

The Half-Year Convention method is only applied if you turn on the **Use Half-Year Convention** toggle for the fixed asset on the **Fixed Asset Card** page.  

You can use this depreciation method with the following depreciation methods:  

* Straight-Line  
* Declining-Balance 1  
* DB1/SL  

When you apply the Half-Year Convention method, a fixed asset has six months of depreciation in the first fiscal year, regardless of the contents of the **Depreciation Starting Date** field.  

> [!NOTE]  
> The estimated life of the fixed asset that is remaining after the first fiscal year always contains a half-year using the Half-Year Convention Method. Thus, for the Half-Year Convention method to be applied correctly, the **Depreciation Ending Date** field on the **FA Depreciation Book** page must always contain a date which is exactly six months before the final date of the fiscal year in which the fixed asset fully depreciates.  

### Example - Half-Year Convention depreciation

A fixed asset has an acquisition cost of LCY 100,000. The **Depreciation Starting Date** is 03/01/20. The estimated life is five years, so the **Depreciation Ending Date** must be 06/30/25. The **Calculate Depreciation** batch job is run annually. This example is based on a calendar fiscal year.  

The fixed asset ledger entries look like this:  

| Date | FA Posting Type | Days | Amount | Book Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 03/01/20 |Acquisition Cost |(Depreciation starting date) |100,000.00 |100,000.00 |
| 12/31/20 |Depreciation |270 |-10,000.00 |90,000.00 |
| 12/31/21 |Depreciation |360 |-20,000.00 |70,000.00 |
| 12/31/22 |Depreciation |360 |-20,000.00 |50,000.00 |
| 12/31/23 |Depreciation |360 |-20,000.00 |30,000.00 |
| 12/31/24 |Depreciation |360 |-20,000.00 |10,000.00 |
| 12/31/25 |Depreciation |180 |-10,000.00 |0.00 |

## Example - DB1/SL depreciation using Half-Year Convention

A fixed asset has an acquisition cost of LCY 100,000. The **Depreciation Starting Date** is 11/01/20. The estimated life is five years, so the **Depreciation Ending Date** must be 06/30/25. On the **FA Depreciation Books** page, the **Declining-Balance %** field contains 40. The **Calculate Depreciation** batch job is run annually. This example is based on a calendar fiscal year.  

The fixed asset ledger entries look like this:  

| Date | FA Posting Type | Days | Amount | Book Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 11/01/20 |Acquisition Cost |(Depreciation starting date) |100,000.00 |100,000.00 |
| 12/31/20 |Depreciation |60 |-20,000.00 |80,000.00 |
| 12/31/21 |Depreciation |360 |-32,000.00 |48,000.00 |
| 12/31/22 |Depreciation |360 |-19,200.00 |28,800.00 |
| 12/31/23 |Depreciation |360 |-11,520.00 |17,280.00 |
| 12/31/24 |Depreciation |360 |-11,520.00 |5,760.00 SL |
| 12/31/25 |Depreciation |180 |-5,760.00 |0.00 SL |

`SL` after the book value means that the straight-line method was used.  

Calculation method:  

* Year 1:  

    *Declining-balance amount = Full year amount = 40% of 100,000 = 40,000.* Thus, for half a year 40,000 / 2 = 20,000  

    *Straight-line amount = Full year amount = 100,000 / 5 = 20,000.* Thus, for half a year = 20,000 / 2 = 10,000  

    The declining-balance amount is used because it's the greater amount.  
* ...
* Year 5 (2024):  

    *Declining-balance amount = 40% of 17,280.00 = 6,912.00*  

    *Straight-line amount = 28,800 / 1.5 = 11,520.00*  

    The straight-line amount is used because it's the greater amount.  

## Duplicate entries to other depreciation books

If you have three depreciation books, B1, B2 and B3, and you want to duplicate entries from B1 to B2 and B3, you can turn on the **Part of Duplication List** toggle on the depreciation book cards for B2 and B3. For example, this setting can be useful in the following situations:

* Depreciation book B1 integrates with the general ledger and uses the fixed asset G/L journal.
* Depreciation books B2 and B3 don't integrate with the general ledger and use the fixed asset journal.  

When you make an entry in B1 in the fixed asset G/L journal, and turn on the **Part of Duplication List** toggle, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] duplicates the entry in book B2 and B3 in the fixed asset journal when you post the entry.  

> [!NOTE]  
> You can't duplicate in the same journal and journal batch as you're duplicating from. If you post entries in the fixed asset G/L journal, you can duplicate them in the fixed asset journal or in the fixed asset G/L journal using another batch.  

> [!NOTE]  
> You can't use the same number series in the fixed asset G/L journal and the fixed asset journal. When you post entries in the fixed asset G/L journal, you must leave the **Document No.** field empty. If you enter a number in the field, the number is duplicated in the fixed asset journal. You must manually change the document number before you can post the journal.  

## Manual depreciation

Use the manual method for assets that aren't subject to depreciation, for example, land. You must enter depreciation in the fixed asset G/L journal. The **Calculate Depreciation** batch job omits fixed assets that use the manual depreciation method.

## User-defined depreciation

If the built-in depreciation methods don't meet your needs, you can define your own depreciation method by using depreciation tables. To learn more about applying a user-defined depreciation method, go to [Set Up User-Defined Depreciation Method](fa-how-setup-user-defined-depreciation-method.md).

# Enabling Power BI integration with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]

[!INCLUDE[azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id](~/../shared-content/shared/azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id.md)]

This article describes how to get [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] ready for integration with Power BI. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online is already enabled for integration, although there's some information about licensing that you might want to read. For [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, you'll have set up your environment to connect to Power BI before users can work with it.

## <a name="license"></a>Power BI Licensing

With [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], users get a free Power BI license that provides access to the most common features in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and Power BI. You can also purchase a Power BI Pro license that provides access to additional features. The following table provides an overview of the features available with each license.

|Power License|View reports|Create reports|Share reports|Refresh reports| [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] Apps|
|-------------|--------||
|Power BI free|![a checkmark.](media/check.png) (in your personal workspace)  | ![another checkmark](media/check.png) (in your personal workspace) |(limited)|(limited)||
|Power BI Pro|![yet another checkmark.](media/check.png) |![it's a checkmark](media/check.png)|![again a checkmark](media/check.png)|(extensive)|![last checkmark](media/check.png)|

You can't use a [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] free license for the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] Apps. To learn more, go to [Prerequisites for installing Power BI apps for Business Central](across-powerbi-install-business-central-apps.md#prerequisites)

> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE[about_bc_licensing_for_powerbi](includes/about_bc_licensing_for_powerbi.md)]
>
> [!INCLUDE[about_licensing](includes/about_licensing.md)]

To learn more about [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] licensing in general, go to [Licensing the Power BI service for users in your organization](/power-bi/admin/service-admin-licensing-organization) or [Sign up for the Power BI service as an individual](/power-bi/fundamentals/service-self-service-signup-for-power-bi).

## <a name="exposedata"></a>Expose data through API or OData web services

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers two ways to expose data that can be consumed by [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports: 

* API pages or queries
* Open Data Protocol (OData) web services

### API pages and queries (recommended)

> **APPLIES TO:** [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online only.

Developers can define page objects and query objects that are of the type *API*. This way, they can expose data from database tables through a webhook-supported, OData v4-enabled, REST service. This type of data can't be displayed in the user interface, but is intended for building reliable integration services.

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online comes with a set of built-in APIs that you can use to get data for typical business entities, like customers, items, sales orders, and more. No extra work or setup is required to use these APIs as a data source for [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports. To learn more about these APIs, go to [Business Central API V2.0](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/api-reference/v2.0/).

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online also supports custom APIs. Application developers of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] solutions can create their own API pages and queries and package them into apps. You then install the apps on your tenant. When they're installed, you use the API pages for your [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports, like you'd do with the built-in APIs (v2.0). To learn more about how to create an API by exposing pages or queries, go to [Developing a Custom API](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-develop-custom-api).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Starting in February 2022, [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online are sourced from a secondary, read-only database replica for performance reasons. AL developers should avoid designing API pages that make database modifications while the pages are opening or loading records. In particular, consider the code on the AL triggers: `OnInit`, `OnOpenPage`, `OnFindRecord`, `OnNextRecord`, `OnAfterGetRecord`, and `OnAfterGetCurrRecord`. In some cases, these database modifications might cause performance problems and prevent the report from refreshing data. To learn more, go to [Performance Articles For Developers](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/performance/performance-developer?branch=main#writing-efficient-web-services) in the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] development content.
>
> In rare cases, the behavior causes an error when you try to get data from the API for a report in Power BI Desktop. However, if the custom API requires database modifications, Power BI Desktop users can force the behavior. To learn more, go to [Building Power BI Reports to Display Business Central Data](across-how-use-financials-data-source-powerbi.md#fixing-problems).

### OData web services (not recommended)

You can publish [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] application objects, such as codeunits, pages, and queries, as [OData web services](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/webservices/odata-web-services). With [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, there are many web services published by default. An easy way to find the web services is to search for *web services* in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. On the **Web Services** page, make sure the **Publish** field is selected for the web services. To learn more about publishing web services, go to [Publish a Web Service](across-how-publish-web-service.md).

To learn about what you can do to ensure the best performance of web services, as seen from the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] server (the endpoint) and from the consumer (the client), read [Writing efficient Web Services](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/performance/performance-developer#writing-efficient-web-services).

### Choosing whether to use API pages or OData web services

We recommend that you use API pages instead of OData web services. API pages load data faster in [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports than OData web services. Plus, they're more flexible because they let you get data from table fields that aren't defined in a page object.

Stability is another reason for why you shouldn't base your [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports on UI pages exposed as OData web services. Fields on UI pages in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can change between updates. The changes are done either by the app publisher (the organization that develops the code), or with per-tenant extensions or apps that modify the page. In both cases, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't know about [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] report dependencies on page objects, so the change in the UI page might break your [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports. This problem doesn't happen if you base your reports on API pages or queries.

<!--## <a name="setup"></a>Set up [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises for Power BI integration

This section explains the requirements for a [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises deployment to integrate with Power BI.

1. Configure either [NavUserPassword](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/authenticating-users-with-navuserpassword) or [Microsoft Entra ID](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/authenticating-users-with-azure-ad-overview) as the authentication method for the deployment.  
    
    > [!NOTE]
    > Power BI integration doesn't support Windows authentication and is not supported on Windows Client.

2. Enable OData web services and the ODataV4 endpoint.

    OData web service must be enabled on the [!INCLUDE[server](includes/server.md)], and OData port opened in firewall. For more information, see [Configuring Business Central Server - OData Web Services](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/configure-server-instance#ODataServices).

    The local server must be accessible from the Internet.

3. Give [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] user accounts a web service access key.

    A web service access key is only needed to view [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] data in Power BI. You can assign a web service access key to each user account. Or instead, create a specific account with a web service access key for use by all users. For more information, see [Web Services Authentication](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/webservices/web-services-authentication#generate-a-web-service-access-key).

    <!--
    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > With [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] online, the use of access keys (Basic Auth) for web service authentication is [deprecated](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/upgrade/deprecated-features-w1#accesskeys). We recommend that you use OAuth2 instead. For more information, see [Use OAuth to Authorize Business Central Web Services](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/webservices/authenticate-web-services-using-oauth).-->

<!--4. Create an application registration for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in Microsoft Azure.

    To view Power BI reports embedded in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] pages, an application must be registered for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in Microsoft Azure. The registered application needs permission to Power BI services. At a minimum, the app requires  **User.ReadWrite.All** permission. For users to view reports from shared Power BI workspaces, the app requires **Workspace.Read.All** permission. For more information, see [Registering [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] On-Premises in Microsoft Entra ID for Integrating with Other Services](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/register-app-azure).

    > [!NOTE]
    > If your deployment uses NavUserPassword authentication, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] connects to the same Power BI service for all users. You'll specify this service account as part of registering the application. With Microsoft Entra authentication, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] connects to the Power BI service associated with the individual user accounts.

    <!-- Windows authentication can also be used but you can't get data from BC in Power BI -->
<!--5. Make the initial connection from Business Central to Power BI.

    Before end-users can use Power BI in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], an Azure application administrator will have to give consent to the Power BI service.

    To make the initial connection, open [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], and run **Get Started with Power BI** from the Home page. This action will lead you through the consent process, and check your Power BI license. When prompted sign in using an Microsoft Entra admin account. For more information, see [Connect to Power BI - one time only](across-working-with-powerbi.md#connect).-->

## Setting up Dataflows

Dataflows enable you to ingest, transform, and load data into a Power BI workspace and then use the data as the basis for your reports. These dataflows can in some cases experience transient errors while doing a scheduled refresh. The error message looks like this: `DataSource.Error: OData: Unable to read data from the transport connection: An existing connection was forcibly closed by the remote host.` 

Using PowerAutomate, you can set up retries for this situation. For more information, see [Automatically retry a dataflow on failure](/power-query/dataflows/automatically-retry-dataflow).

# Configuring OneDrive integration with Business Central on-premises

[!INCLUDE[azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id](~/../shared-content/shared/azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id.md)]

This article explains how to configure OneDrive for work or school (formerly known as OneDrive for Business) integration with Business Central on-premises. Unlike [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, the connection between Business Central and OneDrive isn't set up automatically. If the connection isn't configured, users can't use the features for OneDrive.

There are two tasks that need to be done to configure the OneDrive integration.

- The first task involves registering an application (app) on your Microsoft Entra tenant of your Microsoft 365 plan. The registered app is used for authentication purposes. This task is typically done in the Azure portal and in Business Central web client.
- The second task involves setting up the connection to the OneDrive URL and turning on the OneDrive features in the Business Central. This task in done in the Business Central web client. It's done differently for version 21 than for versions 19 and 20. Version 21 introduces a new **OneDrive Setup** that replaces the **SharePoint Connections Setup**.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises can only be connected to OneDrive hosted by Microsoft in the cloud. Connecting [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on premises to the My Sites repository of SharePoint Server isn't supported.

## <a name="registerapp"></a>Register an app in Microsoft Entra ID for OneDrive integration

In this task, you add a registered app for Business Central in the Microsoft Entra tenant of your Microsoft 365 plan. Like other Azure services that work with Business Central, OneDrive requires a registered app in Microsoft Entra ID. The registered app provides authentication and authorization services between Business Central and SharePoint, which is used by OneDrive.

For detailed steps for completing this step, see [Register an application in Microsoft Entra ID](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/register-app-azure#register-an-application-in-azure-active-directory) in the developer and IT pro help.

As you register the application, consider the following points:

- If you've already registered an application as part of an integration with another Microsoft product, such as Power BI, then you reuse that registered app. In this case, you'll just have to set the SharePoint permissions for the existing registered app.

- Be sure to configure the registered app with the following delegated permissions to the SharePoint API:

    - AllSites.FullControl
    - User.ReadWrite.All
    
    For Business Central 2021 release wave 2 (version 19), set these permissions instead:
    
    - AllSites.Write
    - MyFiles.Write
    - User.Read.All 

- If you're using Business Central version 19 or 20, copy the **Application (client) ID** and **client secret** used by the registered app. You'll need this information in the next task.

## <a name="url"></a>Get your OneDrive URL

[!INCLUDE[onedrive-url](includes/onedrive-url.md)]

## Set up the OneDrive connection in version 21 and later

Use this procedure if you're using Business Central 2022 release wave 2 (version 21) or later.

### Prerequisites

- Indirect, modify, and delete (imd) permission on table **Document Service Scenario** as a minimum

### Run OneDrive setup

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **OneDrive Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. The first time you run the assisted setup, you see the **Your privacy**. Read the information on the page, and if you agree to the terms choose **Agree** to continue.
3. On the **Configure file handling** page, you have the following options to choose from:

   [!INCLUDE[onedrive-feature-options](includes/onedrive-feature-options.md)]

4. On the **Configure Business Central** page, enter OneDrive's URL in the **OneDrive URL** field.

   [How do I find my OneDrive URL?](#url)
5. Choose **Test Connection** and wait for the results.
   - If the test succeeds, choose **Done**, then you're ready to go.
   - If the test fails, you get a message that describes the problem. Typically the problem has to do with the URL that you provided. Choose **OK** to return to the **Configure Business Central** page, verify the URL, and try again.
   - If you haven't already set up the Microsoft Entra ID registered app, the **Set Up Microsoft Entra ID** guide opens.
6. When completed, the privacy notice for OneDrive integration is agreed for all users. If you want to change it so users must agree or disagree for themselves, then go the **Privacy Notices Status** page and select **Let User Decide** for the OneDrive integration. Users will then be prompted to agree or disagree with the privacy notice the first time they use the OneDrive features. Learn more in [Privacy Notices](privacy-notices-status.md).

## Set up the connection in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] version 19 and 20

Use this procedure if you're using Business Central 2022 release wave 1 (version 20) or 2021 release wave 2 (version 19).
> [!IMPORTANT]
> By configuring this feature, you also enable legacy features that send files to OneDrive.  
>
>* The Open in Excel feature will automatically copy the Excel file to OneDrive, then open it in Excel Online. 
>* Exporting any report to a file will automatically copy the file to OneDrive, then open it in Excel Online, Word Online or OneDrive. 
>* Other features may also automatically open in OneDrive.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Microsoft SharePoint Connection Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. In the **Description** field, enter a description for the connection, like **OneDrive**.
3. In the **Folder** field, enter **Business Central**.
4. In the **Location** field, enter the URL for your OneDrive.

   [How do I find my OneDrive URL?](#url)
5. In the **Client ID** field, enter the client ID from your registered app.
6. In the **Client Secret** field, enter the secret from your registered app. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The **SharePoint Connection Setup** page is used to configure multiple legacy features. The **General** section configures the connection to OneDrive, and the **Shared Documents** section redirects files to SharePoint instead. The  **SharePoint Connection Setup** has been deprecated and will be removed in coming release. We recommend that you do not configure the **Shared Documents** section. Learn more in [Deprecated Features in the Base App ](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/upgrade/deprecated-features-w1#microsoft-sharepoint-connection-setup).

## After upgrade to version 21

When you upgrade to version 21 or later, the existing connection to OneDrive that's configured on the **SharePoint Connection Setup** page will still work. But because the **SharePoint Connection Setup** page will be removed in version 23, we recommend that you switch to the new OneDrive integration, as described in the next section. Making this switch now make it easier when the **SharePoint Connection Setup** is eventually removed. Plus, it enables you to use the **OneDrive Setup** assisted setup guide to manage the OneDrive features that are accessible to users.

## Switching from legacy SharePoint to new OneDrive integration 

To switch to the new OneDrive integration, you run the **OneDrive Setup** assisted setup guide, which you can open directly or from the legacy **SharePoint Connection Setup** page. The **OneDrive Setup** assisted setup leads you through the transition, providing information about the changes being made along the way.

Before you get started with the switch or as you're doing it, refer to the next section to learn about some aspects and considerations about the process. 

### <a name="onedrivesetupmigration"></a>About switching to the new OneDrive integration

In addition to OneDrive integration, Business Central can also integrate with other services, like Power BI and Universal print. Integration with these other services also requires a registered Microsoft Entra app for authentication. The Microsoft Entra app used by these other services is configured in the **Set up your Microsoft Entra accounts** assisted setup. When you switch from the legacy SharePoint connection setup, the new **OneDrive Setup** assisted setup changes your OneDrive integration to also use the **Set up your Microsoft Entra accounts** assisted setup&mdash;so all integrations use the same Microsoft Entra app.

This change has implications when switching to the new OneDrive integration, depending on whether there's already a Microsoft app configured in the **Set up your Microsoft Entra accounts** assisted setup. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> After you switch to the new OneDrive setup, you can no longer use the **SharePoint Connection Setup** page to configure OneDrive integration.

#### How the changes affect the integration

The **OneDrive Setup** assisted setup will always use the app that's configured in the **Set up your Microsoft Entra accounts** assisted setup, if there's one. When you run the **OneDrive Setup** assisted setup, it compares the app configured in **Set up your Microsoft Entra accounts** with your current app configured in **SharePoint Connection Setup**.

> [!TIP]
> In the **SharePoint Connection Setup** page and **Set up your Microsoft Entra accounts** assisted setup, the Microsoft Entra app is identified by the **client ID**.

- If the app in **Set up your Microsoft Entra accounts** is different than the app in **SharePoint Connection Setup**, the OneDrive integration changes to use the app in **Set up your Microsoft Entra accounts**.

   In **OneDrive Setup** while making the switch, you get a message similar to the following text: 

   **The Microsoft Entra application used for authentication will be configured for all Business Central integrations. This means the client id will change to NNNNNNNNN-NNNN-NNNN-NNNN-NNNNNNNNNNNN, you may want to test it has the correct permissions.**

  `NNNNNNNNN-NNNN-NNNN-NNNN-NNNNNNNNNNNN` represents the client ID of the app in **Set up your Microsoft Entra accounts** that OneDrive integration has been switched to. 

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > For new OneDrive integration to work after you make the switch, you have to grant the app permission to the SharePoint API in Azure portal. You can do this step before or after you switch to the new OneDrive setup. Learn more in the section [Register an app in Microsoft Entra ID for OneDrive integration](#registerapp).

- If the app in **Set up your Microsoft Entra accounts** is the same as the app in **SharePoint Connection Setup**, the OneDrive integration uses the same app as before, except from the configuration in the **Set up your Microsoft Entra accounts** setup.

   In **OneDrive Setup** while making the switch, you get a message similar to the following text:

   **The Microsoft Entra application used for authentication will be configured for all Business Central integrations. This has already been configured with the same client id (aaaabbbb-0000-cccc-1111-dddd2222eeee).**

- If there's no app configured in the **Set up your Microsoft Entra accounts** setup, the OneDrive integration uses the same app as before.

   The **OneDrive Setup** assisted setup copies app configuration to the **Set up your Microsoft Entra accounts** setup, so it's used for other integrations in that might set up later.

   In **OneDrive Setup** while making the switch, you get a message similar to the following text:

   **The Microsoft Entra application used for authentication will be configured for all Business Central integrations.**

### Run OneDrive setup to switch to the new OneDrive integration

1. Open either the **OneDrive Setup** page or the **SharePoint Connection Setup** page.
2. If you're using the **SharePoint Connection Setup** page, choose **Go to new OneDrive setup** in the notification at the top of the page.
3. Follow the **OneDrive Setup** assisted setup guide.
4. When you get to the **Configure file handling** page, choose one of the following options for turning on features:

   [!INCLUDE[onedrive-feature-options](includes/onedrive-feature-options.md)]

5. The **Configure Business Central** page shows the same URL that's used by the existing OneDrive integration. You can change the URL as needed.
6. Select **Test Connection** and follow the instructions.

   If the test succeeds, select **done**, and you're ready to go. Otherwise, use the messages on the page to help you fix the problem.

# Setting up user accounts for integrating with Microsoft Dataverse via data sync

This article provides an overview of how to set up the user accounts that are required to integrate [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## Set up the administrator user account

To set up the connection between [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)], you must sign in to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with a user account that is assigned to the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Essential or [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Premium license. We'll use this account one time to install and configure some required components.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> During set-up, you'll be asked to provide credentials for the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] environment. Provide the credentials of an account that is a licensed user and assigned to the **System Administrator** security role on the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] environment and [User Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#user-administrator) role on the tenant to which the environment belongs. This account doesn't need a license to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] because it will be used only to do set-up tasks in the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] environment.
>
> After the connection setup is done, you can remove this [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] user. The integration will continue using the user account that is automatically created specifically for the integration.

## Permissions and security roles for user accounts in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)]

The Base Integration Solution creates the following role in [!INCLUDE [cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] for the integration:

* **Business Central Dataverse Integration** - Allows you to manage the connection between [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and [!INCLUDE [cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)]. Typically, this is assigned only to the automatically created user account for synchronization.

> [!NOTE]
> Only the application user who runs the integration should have the **Business Central Dataverse Integration** role. The application user doesn't need the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] or [!INCLUDE [cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] licenses.

When you install the Base Integration Solution, it configures the permissions for the integration user account. If those permissions are changed manually, you can reset them. Choose **Redeploy Integration Solution** on the **Dataverse Connection Setup** page to reinstall the Base Integration Solution. This step will deploy the  Business Central Integration security role.

<!--
The following tables list the minimum permissions for the user accounts in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)].

# Sales by Item (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Sales by Item** report gives a clear picture of your organization's item sales. It showcases key metrics for each item or item category. For example, the sales amount, quantities, and the cost amounts. You can break down the information further by the specific customers that buy the items.

:::image type="content" source="media/powerbi/sales/sales-by-item.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Sales by Item Power BI report" lightbox="media/powerbi/sales/sales-by-item.png":::

## Use the report

Leadership and management teams use the report to track item sales. Sales teams can use it to better identify key items.  

CEOs might want a list of the top-selling items by revenue, and be able to compare the list with how much each item contributed to the company's overall revenue. You can use this information to make strategic decisions about which items to focus on and how to allocate resources.  

Sales managers can identify which items aren't performing and implement sales promotions for them. You can also use this information to adjust inventory levels of different items, procure extra stock to assist with demand, or reduce stock levels for slower periods.  

Salespeople can tailor their pitch based on the sales performance for specific items. The report lets you identify high-performing items. You can also use this report to gain insights on lower-performing items so salespeople can spot opportunities to up-sell or cross-sell.

## Key performance indicators

The report includes the following key performance indicators (KPIs) and measures:

- [**Sales Amount**](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#sales-amount)
- [**Sales Quantity**](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#sales-quantity)
- [**Cost Amount**](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#cost-amount)
- [**Cost Amount Non-Inv**](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#cost-amount-non-inv)
- [**Gross Profit**](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#gross-profit)
- [**Gross Profit Margin**](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#gross-profit-margin)

[!INCLUDE[click-on-a-kpi-link](includes/click-on-a-kpi-link.md)] 

[!INCLUDE[powerbi-tip-track-kpis](includes/powerbi-tip-track-kpis.md)]

# Sales by Customer (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Sales by Customer** report gives a clear picture of your organization's customers and their sales activities. It highlights key metrics for each customer, such as sales amount and quantities along with the costs associated. You can break down the metrics by the specific items that are sold per customer to identify key trends.

:::image type="content" source="media/powerbi/sales/sales-by-customer.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Sales by Customer Power BI report" lightbox="media/powerbi/sales/sales-by-customer.png":::

## Use the report

This report is meant for all users to identify key customers and other customers that buy less than expected.

A COO can quickly identify a list of the top customers generating revenue for the company. You can easily identify which customers are generating the most revenue and how much each customer is contributing to your company's overall revenue. This information helps you make informed decisions and can provide valuable insights to the CFO regarding where the revenue is coming from.

A business development manager can quickly identify how you're attracting new customers to purchase from your organization. You can break down the metrics to find out how salespeople are performing. This information can then translate into what a sales manager would want to see, and enable them to track how sales are going for different salespeople.

For salespeople, the report you help can tailor your onsite visits to your customers based on their recent purchases. This report can also show you insights into specific period trends for this customer, and identify opportunities to up-sell or cross-sell.

## Key performance indicators

The report includes the following key performance indicators (KPIs) and measures:

- [**Sales Amount**](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#sales-amount)
- [**Sales Quantity**](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#sales-quantity)
- [**Cost Amount**](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#cost-amount)
- [**Cost Amount Non-Inv**](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#cost-amount-non-inv)
- [**Gross Profit**](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#gross-profit)
- [**Gross Profit Margin**](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#gross-profit-margin)

[!INCLUDE[click-on-a-kpi-link](includes/click-on-a-kpi-link.md)] 

[!INCLUDE[powerbi-tip-track-kpis](includes/powerbi-tip-track-kpis.md)]

# Schedule jobs to adjust and reconcile inventory cost

Schedule Jobs for automatic cost adjustment with the general ledger, posting to the general ledger are turned on by default.
However, as data accumulates over time that might impact performance. To reduce the load on the application, it's often helpful to use job queue entries to move tasks to run in the background.

## Move the task of adjusting item costs to the background with the help of assisted setup

Creating the job queue entries can be tricky, even for an experienced consultant, so we have an assisted setup guide to make the process easier for adjusting item costs.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Inventory Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Inventory Setup** page, toggle the **Automatic Cost Posting** field, or specify **Never** in the **Automatic Cost Adjustment** field.  
3. In the notification that now displays at the top of the page, choose the **Schedule Job Queue Entry** link. This opens the **Schedule Cost Adjustment and Posting** assisted setup guide.  
4. Specify the task that you want to schedule.  

  > [!NOTE]
  > You cannot create a new job queue entry if a job queue entry for the specified task already exists.

5. Select the **View job queue entries when finished** field to review and adjust settings. For more information, see [Use Job Queues to Schedule Tasks](admin-job-queues-schedule-tasks.md).  

## To create a job queue entry for adjusting and reconciling inventory cost manually

Alternatively, you can create job queue entries manually. The following procedure shows how to set the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job to automatically run daily, but the same steps apply to the **Post Inventory Cost to G/L** batch job.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Job Queue Entries**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. In the **Object Type to Run** field, choose *Report*.  
4. In the **Object ID to Run** field, choose *795*, **Adjust Cost - Item Entries**.  
5. In the **Next Run Date Formula** field, enter *1D*.
6. In the **Starting Time** field, enter *2 AM*.
7. Choose the **Set Status to Ready** action.

Now, inventory cost will be updated every night.  

To schedule a task for reconciling inventory with the general ledger, choose Codeunit 2846 **Post Inventory Cost to G/L**.

> [!TIP]
> To avoid locking, do not schedule tasks for the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job, the **Post Inventory Cost to G/L** codeunit, and tasks for posting sales or purchasing transactions at the same time. Also, make sure that they use same job queue category.

# Sustainability value chain setup

To use the sustainability value chain features effectively, you need to set up some basic controls and instructions. This article explains how to do that.

## Sustainability setup  

You need to specify some settings for the sustainability value chain functionality, such as enabling the value chain features to work with sustainability features, and the areas you'll use and track.  

To configure these settings, follow these steps:  

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sustainability Setup**, and then select the related link.
2. Check whether the basic setup already exists. If it doesn't, follow [these instructions](finance-sustainability-setup.md) to set it up.  
3. On the **Procurement** FastTab, configure the fields related to the sustainability value chain. The following table describes the fields.

    | Field | Description |
    |-------|-------------|
    | **Enable Value Chain tracking** | Enable sustainability value entries posting through the value chain operations, and the availability of these fields in operational documents and journals. If you don't enable this field, sustainability features aren't available on operational documents, orders, or journals. |
    | **G/L Account Emissions** | Enable a default sustainability account on the **G/L Account Card** page. |
    | **Item Emissions** | Enable a default sustainability account and emissions on the **Item Card** page. |
    | **Item Charge Emissions** | Enable a default sustainability account on the **Item Charge** page.</br></br> **Important:** This field isn't currently supported. |
    | **Resource Emissions** | Enable a default sustainability account and emissions on the **Resource Card** page. |
    | **Work Machine Center Emissions** | Enable a default sustainability account and emissions on the **Work Center** and **Machine Center** pages. |

> [!NOTE]
> Keep in mind that selecting the **Use Emissions In Purchase Documents** field doesn't activate the sustainability value chain features. The field only enables you to record emissions in purchase documents. If you want to use purchase documents in value chain operations, you must also select the **Enable Value Chain tracking** field.  

> [!NOTE]
> The **Item Charge** functionality currently isn't supported in the sustainability value chain process. We plan to add this feature in 2025 release wave 2.  

## Emission fees  

To use the sustainability value chain features, you must configure carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e). The value chain works only for CO2e, and not each type of greenhouse gas (GHG). You set up CO2e on the **Emission Fees** page.

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Emission Fees**, and then select the related link.
2. In the **Emission Type** field, choose the GHG emission you want to configure. This field is mandatory.
3. The **Carbon Equivalent Factor** field specifies the coefficient that converts the effect of various GHGs into the equivalent amount of carbon dioxide based on their global warming potential (GWP). If the **Emission Type** is **CO2**, the **Carbon Equivalent Factor** is always **1**. You can't change this value because CO2 is the reference gas used to calculate the GWP of other greenhouse gases. Because CO2 is the baseline, its GWP is set to **1**. For other GHGs, you must configure the values manually.  

> [!NOTE]
> The following example shows how to calculate the carbon equivalent factor. If we assume that 1 kilogram of N2O is equivalent to 298 kilograms of CO2, divide 1 by 298. The result you need to enter is 0.00336.  

To learn how track internal carbon fees or use other features related to carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e), go to [Set up sustainability in Business Central](finance-sustainability-setup.md).

# Couple and synchronize records between Dataverse and Business Central

This article describes how to couple one or more records in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with records in Dataverse or [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]. Coupling records lets you view Dataverse information from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], and vice versa. The coupling also enables you to synchronize data between the records. You can couple existing records, or create and couple new records.

> [!NOTE]
> Coupling and synchronizing data is available only if your system administrator creates a connection between [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and Dataverse or [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]. A quick way to check is to open the **Customer** card and look for the **Set Up Coupling** action. If the action is available, the apps are connected.

<!--## Video Example

This video shows coupling and synchronizing data in the context of an integration with [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)].

> [!VIDEO https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2098376] -->

## To couple a record  

1. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], open the card for the record you want to couple. For example, the Customer Card or Contact Card pages.  

    You can also just open the list page and select the record that you want to couple.  

2. Choose the **Set Up Coupling** action.  
3. Fill in the fields, and then choose **OK**.  

## To synchronize a single record  

1. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], open the card for the record you want to couple. For example, the Customer Card or Contact Card pages.  
2. Choose the **Synchronize Now** action.  
3. If a record can synchronize in one direction, select the option that specifies the direction of data update, and then choose **OK**.  

## To synchronize a single record from [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]  

1. In [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)], open the form for the record you want to couple. For example, the Account or Contact pages.  
2. Choose the **[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]** action in the ribbon to open and couple records automatically.

    > [!Note]
    > You can synchronize a single record from [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] automatically only when **Sync. Only Coupled Records** is disabled and the synchronization direction is set to **Bidirectional** or **From Integration Table** on the **Integration Table Mapping** page for the record. To learn more, go to [Mapping the Tables and Fields to Synchronize](admin-how-to-modify-table-mappings-for-synchronization.md#create-new-records).

## To couple multiple records using match-based coupling

Specify the data to synchronize for an entity, such as a customer or contact, by coupling records based on matches. Refine the matches by making the search case sensitive, and assigning a priority for each match. If no match is found, you can also specify that you want to create the entity in Dataverse. To learn more, go to [Customize the match-based coupling](admin-how-to-set-up-a-dynamics-crm-connection.md#customize-the-match-based-coupling).  

> [!NOTE]
> The match-based coupling process skips records that are already matched. To include those records when you run match-based coupling, uncouple the records and then try again. To learn more about uncoupling records, go to [Uncoupling Records](#uncoupling-records).

1. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], open the list page for the record, such as the Customers or Contacts list pages.
2. Choose the **Match-Based Coupling** action.
3. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

## To synchronize multiple records  

1. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], open the list page for the record, such as the Customers or Contacts pages.  
2. Select the records that you want to synchronize, and then choose the **Synchronize Now** action.  
3. If records can synchronize in one direction, select the option that specifies the direction, and then choose **OK**.  

## Bulk-insert and couple records

If you have many Dataverse entities that correspond to records in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can insert and couple them in-bulk. For example, you might want to bulk-insert and couple records when you're setting up synchronization for the first time.

Use the **Data import wizard** in the **Microsoft Power Platform admin center**.

The following example describes how to bulk-insert and couple customers with accounts in Dataverse. Use the same process for other types of entities, such as vendors, items, and resources.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customers**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **Open in Excel** action to open customer data in Excel.
3. To map and import data to the **Account** entity in Dataverse, follow the steps described in [Import data (all record types) from multiple sources](/power-platform/admin/import-data-all-record-types).  

    If the Account entity has a **bcbi_companyid** column, when you map the data columns make sure that the import assigns the appropriate company ID in the column for every imported record. To find the company ID in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], follow these steps:

    1. Open the **Integration Table Mappings** page.
    2. Choose the **CUSTOMER** mapping, and then choose **Edit List**.
    3. Choose the assist edit :::image type="icon" source="media/assist-edit-icon.png" border="false"::: button in the **Integration Table Filter** field. This shows the default filter for customer mapping, and it contains the company ID. The company ID is the first part of the value. Copy only that part, and disregard the 0s. The following example highlights the part to copy.

    :::image type="content" source="media/dataverse-company-id-guid.png" alt-text="Shows the part of the company ID to copy.":::

    > [!NOTE]
    > Not all of the names of Dataverse entities and [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] records match. Depending on what you're importing, double-check that the following columns have the following values after you import:
    >
    >* For customers, the **CustomerTypeCode** column should contain **Customer**.
    >* For vendors, the **CustomerTypeCode** column should contain **Vendors**. 
    >* For items, **ProductTypeCode** column should contain **Sales Inventory**.
    >* For resources, the **ProductTypeCode** column should contain **Service**.
 
4. After you import data to the Dataverse environment, in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], follow the steps [To couple multiple records using match-based coupling](#to-couple-multiple-records-using-match-based-coupling) to couple the Dataverse entities with [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] records.

## Uncoupling Records

You can uncouple one or more records from list pages or the **Coupled Data Synchronization Errors** page by choosing one or more lines and choosing **Delete Coupling**. You can also remove all couplings for one or more table mappings on the **Integration Table Mappings** page.

description: Learn about the different factors that affect item availability in your warehouse.

# Design Details: Availability in the Warehouse

Stay on top of item availability to ensure that outbound orders flow efficiently, and that your delivery times are optimal.  

Availability can vary, depending on several factors. Fr example:

* Allocations at the bin level when warehouse activities such as picks and movements happen.
* When the inventory reservation system imposes restrictions to comply with.

Before allocating quantities to picks for outbound flows, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] verifies that all conditions are met.

When conditions aren't met, error messages are shown. One typical message is the generic "Nothing to handle." message. The message can be shown for many different reasons in outbound and inbound flows where a document line contains the **Qty. to Handle** field.

## Bin content and reservations  

Item quantities exist both as warehouse entries and as item ledger entries in inventory. These two types of entries contain different information about where items are and whether they're available. Warehouse entries define an item’s availability by bin and bin type, which is called bin content. Item ledger entries define an item’s availability by its reservation for outbound documents.  

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates the quantity that's available to pick when bin content is coupled with reservations.  

## Quantity available to pick  

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] reserves items for pending sales order shipments so that they aren't picked for other sales orders that ship earlier. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] subtracts quantities of items that are already being processed, as follows:

* Quantities reserved for other outbound documents.
* Quantities on existing pick documents.
* Quantities picked but not yet shipped or consumed.  

The result is calculated dynamically and displayed in the **Available Qty. to Pick** field on the **Pick Worksheet** page. The value is also calculated when users create warehouse picks directly for outbound documents. The following are examples of outbound documents:

* Sales orders
* Production consumption
* Outbound transfers

The result is available in these documents in the quantity fields, such as the **Qty. to Handle** field.  

> [!NOTE]  
> For the priority of reservations, the quantity to reserve is subtracted from the quantity available to pick. For example, if the quantity available in pick bins is 5 units, but 100 units are in put-away bins, when you reserve more than 5 units for another order, an error message is displayed because the additional quantity must be available in pick bins.  

### Calculating the quantity available to pick  

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates the quantity available to pick as follows:  

quantity available to pick = quantity in pick bins - quantity on picks and movements – (reserved quantity in pick bins + reserved quantity on picks and movements)  

The following diagram shows the different elements of the calculation.  

![Available to pick with reservation overlap.](media/design_details_warehouse_management_availability_2.png "Available to pick with reservation overlap")  

## Quantity available to reserve

Because the concepts of bin content and reservation coexist, the quantity of items that are available to reserve must align with allocations to outbound warehouse documents.  

You can reserve all inventory items, except items for which outbound processing has started. The quantity that's available to reserve is defined as the quantity on all documents and bin types. The following outbound quantities are exceptions:  

* Quantity on unregistered pick documents  
* Quantity in shipment bins  
* Quantity in to-production bins  
* Quantity in open shop floor bins  
* Quantity in to-assembly bins  
* Quantity in adjustment bins  

The result is displayed in the **Total Available Quantity** field on the **Reservation** page.  

On a reservation line, the quantity that can't be reserved because it's allocated in the warehouse is displayed in the **Qty. Allocated in Warehouse** field on the **Reservation** page.  

## Check whether items are available for picking

[!INCLUDE [inventory-availability-overview](includes/inventory-availability-overview.md)]

### Calculating the quantity available to reserve

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates the quantity available to reserve as follows:  

quantity available to reserve = total quantity in inventory - quantity on picks and movements for source documents - reserved quantity - quantity in outbound bins  

The following diagram shows the different elements of the calculation.

# Accountant experiences in Business Central

[!INCLUDE[azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id](~/../shared-content/shared/azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id.md)]

Any business must do its books and sign off on the accounting. Some businesses employ an external accountant, and others have an accountant on staff. No matter what type of accountant you are, you can use the **Accountant** Role Center as your Home in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. From here, you can access all pages that you need in your work.  

## Accountant Role Center

The Role Center is a dashboard with activity tiles that show you real-time key figures and give you quick access to data. The ribbon at the top of the page gives you access to more actions. For example, to open financial reports and statements in Excel. In the navigation bar at the top, you can quickly switch between the lists you use most often. Here, there are other areas, such as **Posted Documents** with the various types of documents that the company posted.  

If you're new to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], select **Product Videos** to watch videos or **Get Started** for a tour of key areas in the Role Center.

## Company Hub

If you work in multiple [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] companies, use the **Company Hub** page to keep track of work. For more information, see [Manage Work across Multiple Companies in the Company Hub](company-hub.md).  

## <a name="inviteaccountant"></a>Inviting a third-party accountant to your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]

If a third-party accountant manages your books and financial reporting, your administrator can invite them to your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] so they can work with you on your fiscal data. Both the Premium and Essentials [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] licenses let you procure up to three **External Accountant** licenses per customer tenant. The licenses are free, but you do need to procure them like you would other licenses. To learn more about licensing, download the [Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central Licensing Guide](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=866544).

After your accountant can access your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], they can use the **Accountant** Role Center for easy access to the pages for their work. They can also use the company hub in their own [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to manage their work. Learn more in [Manage Work across Multiple Companies in the Company Hub](company-hub.md).  

> [!Video https://learn-video.azurefd.net/vod/player?id=7ba6427f-cdf0-480d-8c98-b51f65437146]

It's easy to invite your external accountant. In [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], open the **Users** page, and then select the **Invite external accountant** action. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] prepares an email for you. Just add your accountant's work email, and send the invitation.  

> [!Note]  
> This action requires that you set up email in your [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to use SMTP. Learn more in [Set Up Email](admin-how-setup-email.md).  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The accountant's email address must be a work address based on Microsoft Entra ID. If the accountant uses another type of email, the invitation can't be sent.
>
> This task requires access to managing users and licenses in Microsoft Entra ID. The user who sends this invitation must be assigned at least the [User Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#user-administrator) role in the Microsoft 365 admin center. Learn more in [About admin roles](/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/about-admin-roles) in the Microsoft 365 admin content.  

### Add your accountant to your Microsoft 365 tenant

If your admin or reselling partner prefers not to use the **Invite External Accountant** guide, you can add an external user to the Microsoft Entra tenant used by [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and assign them the *External Accountant* license. You can add a user using the Microsoft 365 admin center, Microsoft Entra admin center, or Azure portal. The following procedure uses the Microsoft admin center. Learn about using the Microsoft Entra admin center at [Quickstart: Add a guest user and send an invitation](/azure/active-directory/b2b/b2b-quickstart-add-guest-users-portal).

#### Add your accountant as a guest user

1. Sign in to [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com) as at least a [User Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#user-administrator).
1. In the navigation pane, select **Users**.
1. On the **Users** page, select **New user**, and then **Invite external user**.
1. On the **Invite external user** page, add the accountant's email address and other information about them.  

   Optionally, include a personal welcome message to let the accountant know that you're adding them to your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

1. When you're finished, select **Review + Invite**.
1. Review the information, and then choose **Invite**.

After you send the invitation, the external user receives an email invitation to join your organization. After they accept the invitation, the user account is added as a guest.

Next, assign the guest user a license to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

#### Give your accountant access to your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]

1. In the [Microsoft admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com), **Users** > **Guest users**.
1. Select the accountant's guest user account in the list, then select **Manage product licenses** to open the guest user profile pane.
1. Under **Licenses and apps**, select **Dynamics 365 Business Central External Accountant** license.  

   If this license isn't available, contact your reselling partner to add the license to your subscription.

   Specifically for evaluation purposes in a trial tenant, you can use an available **Dynamics 365 Business Central for IWs** license instead. However, you can't use this type of license if you already purchased [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].
1. Select **Save changes**.

If successful, the license is assigned to the guest user, and the guest account is created.

### Import the new user into [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]

The accountant receives an email notifying them that they have access to your Microsoft Entra ID. Next, give them access to the correct company in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

#### Add the accountant to the correct company

1. Sign in to [Business Central](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com).
1. Open company that you want to give the accountant access to. Learn more in [Switching to Another Company or Environment](ui-organization-switch.md).
1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Users**, and then select the related link.  
1. Select the **Get New Users from Microsoft 365** action.

This action imports the user account that you created in the Azure portal to the company. Learn more in [To add a user in Business Central](ui-how-users-permissions.md#adduser).  

If you want to give access to multiple companies, then you must sign in to each company and repeat this process. Alternatively, you can update the permission groups for the accountant's user profile in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], such as assigning them the *D365 Bus Premium* user group. Learn more in [Assign Permissions to Users and Groups](ui-define-granular-permissions.md).  

### Inform your external accountant how to sign in to Business Central

Unlike internal users who access Business Central using the common URL `https://businesscentral.dynamics.com`, guest users must use the fully qualified domain name. The fully qualified domain name has the format `https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/<tenant ID or domain name>`, such as `https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/aaaabbbb-0000-cccc-1111-dddd2222eeee` or `https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/contoso.com`.

Guest users can sign in using two methods. They can open their browser, enter the fully qualified domain name in the address bar, and sign in using their username and password. Alternatively, they can:

1. Enter `https://businesscentral.dynamics.com` in the browser address bar.
1. Select **Sign in options**.
1. Select **Sign in to an organization**.
1. Enter the domain name of your organization, for example `contoso.com`, and then select **Next**.
1. Sign in using their username and password.

# Sales tax in the default version of Business Central

A **sales tax** is a tax that applies to the purchase of goods and services for consumers and to the sale of goods and services for businesses. Sales tax, ideally, should apply to all final consumption with few exemptions. Exemptions in final consumptions depend on local authorities but, generally speaking, business-to-business transactions are exempted from sales tax.  

Typically, sales taxes apply to the retail sale of goods and services and are a percentage of the total purchase amount. Retailers are responsible for calculating and collecting sales tax at the time of purchase.  

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is available in countries/regions that use value-added tax (VAT) or that use sales tax. The default version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] has basic support for sales tax and richer support in the versions of the application used in the United States and Canada.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Although sales tax is available in the default version, Microsoft supports the use of sales tax in the United States and Canada only.

# Receive and convert electronic documents

> [!NOTE]
> The content in this article is only applicable for versions of Dynamics 365 Business Central that were released before 2023 release wave 2. In 2023 release wave 2, new functionality for E-Documents is included. To learn more, see [Set up e-documents](finance-how-setup-edocuments.md). 


The generic version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports receiving electronic invoices and credit memos in the PEPPOL format, which is supported by the largest providers of document exchange services. To receive an invoice from a vendor as an electronic PEPPOL document, you process the document in the Incoming Documents page to convert it to a purchase invoice or general journal line in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

In addition to receiving electronic documents directly from trading partners, you can receive electronic documents from an OCR service that has turned your PDF or image files into electronic documents.  

Before you can receive electronic documents through the document exchange service, you must set up various master data, such as company information, vendors, items, and units of measure. These are used to identify the business partners and items when converting data in elements in the incoming document file to fields in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For more information, see [Set Up a Document Exchange Service](across-how-to-set-up-a-document-exchange-service.md).  

Before you can receive electronic documents through the OCR service, you must set up and enable the preconfigured service connection. For more information, see [Set Up Incoming Documents](across-how-setup-income-documents.md).  

The traffic of electronic documents in and out of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is managed by the Job Queue feature. Before you can receive electronic documents, the relevant job queue must be started.  

You can either start the conversion of electronic documents manually, as described in this procedure, or you can enable a workflow to convert electronic documents automatically when they're received. The generic version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes a workflow template, *From Incoming Electronic through OCR to Open Purchase Invoice Workflow*, which is ready to be copied to a workflow and enabled. For more information, see [Workflow](across-workflow.md).  

> [!NOTE]  
> When you convert electronic documents received from the OCR service to documents or journal lines in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], multiple lines on the source document will be summed on one line. The single line will be of type G/L Account and the **Description** and (G/L account) **No.** fields will be empty. The value in the **Amount** field will equal the total amount excluding VAT of all lines in the source document.  
>
> To make sure that the **Description** and **No.** fields are filled, you can choose the **Map Text to Account** button on the **Incoming Documents** page to define that a certain invoice text is always mapped to a certain debit or credit account in the general ledger. Going forward, the **Description** field on document or journal lines created from an electronic document for that vendor or customer will be filled with the text in question and the (G/L account) **No.** field with the account in question.  
>
> Instead of mapping to a G/L account, you can also map to a bank account. This is practical, for example, for electronic documents for expenses that are already paid where you want to create a general journal line that is ready to post to a bank account.  

The following procedure describes how to receive a vendor invoice and convert it to a purchase invoice in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The procedure is the same when you convert a vendor invoice to a general journal line.  

### To receive and convert an electronic invoice to a purchase invoice

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Incoming Documents**, and then choose the related link.  

2. Select the line for the incoming document record that represents a new incoming electronic invoice, and then choose the **Edit** action.  

    On the **Incoming Document Card** page, the related XML file is attached, and most of the fields are prefilled with information from the electronic invoice. For more information, see [Create Incoming Document Records](across-how-create-income-document-records.md).  

3. In the **Data Exchange Type** field, choose **PEPPOL - Invoice** or **OCR – Invoice** depending on the source of the electronic document.  

4. To map text on the vendor invoice to a specific debit account, on the **Actions** tab, in the **General** group, choose **Map Text to Account**, and then fill the **Text-to-Account Mapping Worksheet** page.  

5. Choose the **Create Document** action.  

    A purchase invoice will be created in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] based on the information in the electronic document.  

    Any validation errors, typically related to wrong or missing master data in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will be shown on the **Error Messages** FastTab.

# Update currency exchange rates

If you trade in different currencies, you need to keep track of the changes in currency exchange rates. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] helps you manage and update the exchange rates manually or automatically and set up a currency exchange rate service.

## Currencies

> [!TIP]  
> In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can find real-time information about foreign exchange (FX) rates or historical rates under the term currency. To learn more, go to [Set Up an Additional Reporting Currency](finance-how-setup-additional-currencies.md).

[!INCLUDE [finance-currencies-def](includes/finance-currencies-def.md)]

You can specify the currency codes in the **Currencies** list, including extra information and settings that are necessary for each currency code. To learn more, go to [Currencies](finance-set-up-currencies.md#curr)

### Example of a receivable currency transaction

[!INCLUDE [finance-currencies-example](includes/finance-currencies-example.md)]

## Exchange rates

The exchange rates are the tool to calculate the local currency value (LCY) of each currency transaction. The **Currency Exchange Rates** page includes the following fields:

|Field|Description|  
|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
|**Starting Date**|The date when the currency rate was effective.|  
|**Currency Code**|The currency code related to this exchange rate.|  
|**Relational Currency Code**|If this currency is part of a triangular currency calculation, then you can set up the related currency code here.|  
|**Exchange Rate Amount**|The exchange rate amount is the rate for the currency code selected on the line. Normally 1 or 100.|  
|**Relational Exch. Rate Amount**|The relational exchange rate amount relates to the rate to use for the relational currency code.|  
|**Adjustment Exch. Rate Amount**|The rate for the currency code selected on the line for the use of the **Adjust Exchange Rates** batch job.|  
|**Relational Adjmt Exch. Rate Amt**|The rate for the currency code selected on the line for the use of the **Adjust Exchange Rates** batch job.|  
|**Fix Exchange Rate Amount**|Specifies if the currency's exchange rate can be changed on invoices and journal lines.|  

In general, the values of the **Exchange Rate Amount** and **Relational Exchange Rate Amount** fields are used as the default currency rate on all new receivables and payables documents that are created going forward. The currency rate is assigned to the document according to the current working date.  

> [!Note]
> The actual currency rate is calculated using this formula:
>
> `Currency Amount = Amount / Exchange Rate Amount * Relational Exch. Rate Amount`

The adjustment exchange rate amount, or the relational adjustment exchange rate amount, updates all open bank, receivables, or payables transactions.  

> [!Note]
> The actual currency rate is calculated using this formula:
>
> `Currency Amount = Amount / Adjustment Exch. Rate Amount * Relational Adjmt Exch. Rate Amt`

## Adjust exchange rates

Because exchange rates fluctuate constantly, you need to adjust other currency equivalents periodically. If you don't, amounts you converted from foreign (or other) currencies and posted to the general ledger in local currency can be incorrect. Also, you need to update daily entries posted before you enter a daily exchange rate.

You can use the **Adjust Exchange Rates** batch job to manually adjust the exchange rates for posted customer, vendor, and bank account entries. The batch job can also update other reporting currency amounts on G/L entries.  

> [!TIP]
> You can use a service to update exchange rates automatically. To learn more, go to [To set up a currency exchange rate service](finance-how-update-currencies.md#set-up-a-currency-exchange-rate-service). However, this doesn't adjust exchange rates on already posted transactions. To update exchange rates on posted entries, use the **Exchange Rates Adjustment** batch job.

You can also specify how the adjustment handles dimensions for unrealized gains and losses postings by choosing one of the following options in the **Dimension Posting** field:  

* **Source Entry Dimensions**: Transfer dimension values for G/L entries for unrealized gains and losses from the entry you're adjusting.  
* **No Dimensions**: Don't transfer dimension values for unrealized gains and losses to G/L entries. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] still uses default dimension settings, for example, **Code Mandatory**, **Same Code**, or **No Code**. If the source transaction entries have dimension values, the adjustment creates entries without dimension values.  
* **G/L Account Dimensions**: Transfer dimension values from the unrealized gains and losses G/L account's dimension settings source entry to G/L entries.

> [!NOTE]
> This capability isn't available in the Swiss version right now, but it's coming soon. We're working on it.

> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't consider dimensions for individual entries when you adjust exchange rates for additional reporting currencies. Dimensions aren't copied to the G/L entries if you set up the **Exchange Rate Adjustment** batch job with:
>
> * The **Adjust G/L Accounts for Add.-Reporting Currency** toggle turned on.
> * **Source Entry Dimensions** selected in the **Dimension Posting** field.

## Preview the effect of an adjustment

You can preview the effect that an exchange rate adjustment has on posting before you actually post by choosing the **Preview Posting** action on the **Exch. Rates Adjustment** report (Report 596) request page. On the request page, you can specify what to include in the preview:

* Get a detailed posting to the general ledger by entry.
* Get a summarized posting by currency. Just pick the **Adjust per entry** field on the **Exch. Rates Adjustment** report.

### Effect on customers and vendors

For customer and vendor accounts, the batch job uses the exchange rate that was valid on the posting date specified for the batch job to adjust the currency. The batch job calculates the differences for the individual currency balances and posts the amounts to the general ledger account that is specified in the **Unrealized Gains Acc.** field or the **Unrealized Losses Acc.** field on the **Currencies** page. Balancing entries are automatically posted to the receivables/payables account in the general ledger.

The batch job processes all open customer ledger entries and vendor ledger entries. If there's an exchange rate difference for an entry, the batch job creates a new detailed customer or vendor ledger entry. The new entry reflects the adjusted amount on the customer or vendor ledger entry.

#### Dimensions on customer and vendor ledger entries

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] assigns the dimensions from the customer or vendor ledger entries to the adjustment entries, and posts adjustments for each combination of dimension values.

### Effect on bank accounts

For bank accounts, the batch job adjusts the currency by using the exchange rate that is valid on the posting date specified in the batch job. The batch job calculates the differences for each bank account that has a currency code and posts the amounts to the general ledger account that is specified in the **Realized Gains Acc.** field or the **Realized Losses Acc.** field on the **Currencies** page. Balancing entries are automatically posted to the general ledger bank accounts that are specified in the bank account posting groups. The batch job calculates one entry per currency per posting group.

#### Dimensions on bank account entries

The bank account's default dimensions are assigned to the adjustment entries for the bank account's general ledger account and the gain/loss account.

### Effect on G/L accounts

If you post in another reporting currency, the batch job can create new general ledger entries for currency adjustments between the local currency and the other reporting currency. The batch job calculates the differences for each general ledger entry. It adjusts the general ledger entry depending on the contents of the **Exchange Rate Adjustment** field for each general ledger account.

#### Dimensions on G/L account entries

Adjustment entries are assigned the default dimensions from the accounts they posted to.

> [!Important]
> Before you can use the batch job, enter the adjustment exchange rates that are used to adjust the foreign currency balances. You do so on the **Currency Exchange Rates** page.<br><br>  

> [!Video https://learn-video.azurefd.net/vod/player?id=e871f958-fe42-4cf3-bb8a-e97f4c7658de]

## Set up a currency exchange rate service

You can use an external service to keep your currency exchange rates up to date.

> [!NOTE]
> Most exchange rate services provide data that is compatible with the import process in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. However, sometimes the data is formatted differently and you need to customize your import process. You can use the data exchange framework to do that by adding your own codeunit. You might need some help from a developer to do that. To learn more, go to [Set Up Data Exchange Definitions](across-how-to-set-up-data-exchange-definitions.md).

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Currency Exchange Rate Services**, and then select the related link.
2. Select the **New** action.
3. On the **Currency Exchange Rate Service** page, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
4. Map the fields from the XML file to the currency exchange rates table in the source field.
5. Apply any necessary transformation rules.
6. Turn on the **Enabled** toggle to enable the service.

> [!NOTE]
> The following video shows how you can connect to a currency exchange rate service, using the European Central Bank as an example. In the segment that describes how to set up field mappings, the setting in the **Source** column for the **Parent Node for Currency Code**  only returns the first currency found. The setting should be `/gesmes:Envelope/Code/Code/Code`.

<br><br>  
  
> [!Video https://learn-video.azurefd.net/vod/player?id=76914b80-c36a-4d74-95fa-0cdf5c5c0bfa]

## Update currency exchange rates through a service

Follow the steps given to update the currency exchange rates through a service:

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Currencies**, and then select the related link.
2. Select the **Update Exchange Rates** action.

## Correct mistakes

Every now and then, you might need to correct a mistake in a payment transaction for adjustments to foreign currency gains and losses. You can use the **Reverse transaction** action on the **Bank Account Ledger Entries**, **Customer Ledger Entries**, and **Vendor Ledger Entries** pages to unapply and reverse the payment transaction.

> [!NOTE]
> When you unapply and reverse a payment for an entry that had exchange rate adjustments, the reversal posts reversal entries for the adjustments. You might have to run the currency exchange rate adjustment again to get the correct current balance.

description: Learn how to receive and ship items without putting them in storage.

# Cross-Dock Items

Cross-dock items are items you receive and ship without putting them away. The put-away and pick processes require limited handling of items. You can cross-dock items for shipments and for production orders.

## Cross-dock bins and zones

If you're using bins, set up at least one cross-dock bin, and then specify the bin in the **Cross-Dock Bin Code** field on your locations. If you're using directed put-away and picks, set up a cross-dock zone.

When you prepare a shipment or pick items for production and you're using bins, the item is automatically picked from a cross-dock bin before any other bin. You must look in the cross-dock area to see whether the items you need are available there before you get the items in their usual storage area.  

If you've calculated cross-dock quantities, put-away lines to the cross-dock bin for cross-dock calculations are created when you post the receipt. Other put-away lines are created as usual.  

## Cross-dock select lines for a receipt

If you want to post the cross-dock items right away to make them available for picking, you must also register a put-away for the other items originating from the receipt line, namely those that need to be stored. If only some items on a receipt line are being cross-docked, you must therefore make an effort to put away the remaining items as quickly as possible. Alternatively, your warehouse policy could be to encourage cross-docking of entire receipt lines whenever possible.

In the put-away instruction, delete the Take and Place instruction lines for each receipt line for the items to put away. You can recreate the instruction lines later as put-away lines from the put-away worksheet or the posted receipt. After you delete the instruction lines you can put away and register the lines for cross-dock items.  

## About the Put-away Worksheet page

If you turn on the **Use Put-away Worksheet** toggle on the **Location Card** page, and post your receipt with calculated cross-docks, all receipt lines become available in the worksheet. The cross-dock information is lost and can't be recreated. Therefore, to use cross-dock functionality, you should relay lines to the put-away worksheet by deleting put-away instructions rather than using the automatic relay function provided in the **Use Put-away Worksheet** field.  

If you post the warehouse receipt and the **Use Put-away Worksheet** toggle is turned off, the cross-dock items become separate lines on the put-away instructions. The **Cross-Dock Information** field on each put-away line shows whether the line contains the following:

* Cross-dock items.
* All of the items from a receipt must be stored.
* Some items from a receipt must be stored, and some are to be cross-docked.

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't keep separate records for cross-docked items. It registers them as ordinary put-away instructions.  

## To set up the warehouse for cross-docking  

1. If you're using bins, set up at least one cross-dock bin. If you're using directed put-away and picks, set up a cross-dock zone.  

    A cross-dock bin has the **Cross-Dock Bin** field selected. To learn more about bins, go to [Create Bins](warehouse-how-to-create-individual-bins.md).  

    If you are using zones, create a zone for your cross-dock bins, and select the **Cross-Dock Bin Zone** field. If you are using directed put-away and picks, select bin type with **Pick** selected, for example you can use *PICK* or *PUTPICK*. To learn more about zones and bin types, go to [Set Up Locations to Use Bins](warehouse-how-to-set-up-locations-to-use-bins.md) and [Set Up Bin Types](warehouse-how-to-set-up-bin-types.md).  

2. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Location**, and then choose the related link.  
3. On the **Location** page, select the location that you want to set up the warehouse for cross-docking, and then choose the **Edit** action.  
4. On the **Warehouse** FastTab, turn on the **Use Cross-Docking** toggle and fill in the **Cross-Dock Due Date Calc.** field with the time to search for cross-dock opportunities.

    The **Use Cross-Docking** option is only available if the **Require Receipt**, **Require Shipment**, **Require Pick**, and **Require Put-away** fields are selected.  

5. If you're using bins, on the **Bins** FastTab, fill in the **Cross-Dock Bin Code** field with the code of the bin you would like to use as the default cross-dock bin.  
6. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Stockkeeping Unit**, and select the related link.  
7. For each item or stockkeeping unit that you want to be able to cross-dock, select the item, and then choose the **Edit** action.
8. On the **Stockkeeping Unit Card** page, select the **Use Cross-Docking** check box.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  Cross-docking is only possible if your location is set up to require warehouse receive and put-away processing.  

## To cross-dock items without viewing the opportunities  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Warehouse Receipts**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Create a warehouse receipt for an item that's arrived and can be cross-docked. To learn more about receiving, go to [Receive Items](warehouse-how-receive-items.md).  
3. Fill in the **Qty. to Receive** field, and then choose the **Calculate Cross-Dock** action.  

    Outbound source documents requesting the items that are scheduled to leave the warehouse within the date formula time period are identified. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates quantities so that you can cross-dock as much as possible and avoid having to put items away, without piling up too many items in the cross-dock area. The value in the **Qty. to Cross-Dock** field is the sum of all the outbound lines for the item within the look-ahead period minus the quantity that is already placed in the cross-dock area, or it is the value in the **Qty. to Receive** field on the receipt line, whichever is smaller. You can't cross-dock more than you have received.  

4. To cross-dock the quantity as suggested, post the receipt. You can also decide to change the quantity to cross-dock to a higher or lower value and then post the receipt.  

    The amounts to be cross-docked now appear as lines in the put-away instruction, assuming the **Use Put-away Worksheet** field is cleared. The quantities not cross-docked also become lines in the put-away instruction.  

    If you have bins, the cross-docked items have been assigned to the default cross-dock bin defined on the location card.  

5. Delete the **Take** and **Place** lines for items that you won't cross-dock.  
6. Print the put-away instruction for the remaining lines, and place the quantities of the receipt that need to be stored in the appropriate bins or in the appropriate area of the warehouse. Place the cross-dock items in the area or bin designated for them by warehouse policy. Sometimes, warehouse policy might require that you to just leave them in the receiving area.  
7. To register the cross-docked items as being put-away and available for picking, choose the **Register** action.  

## To cross-dock items after viewing the opportunities  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Warehouse Receipts**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Create a warehouse receipt for an item that has arrived and can be cross-docked.  

    You want to view the source document lines that are requesting the item before you post the receipt.  
3. Choose the **Calculate Cross-Dock** action.  

   On the **Cross-Dock Opportunities** page you can see the most important details about the lines requesting the item, such as type of document, quantity requested, and due date. This information might help you to decide how much to cross-dock, where to place the items in the cross-dock area, or how to group them.  

4. Choose **Autofill Qty. to Cross-Dock** action to show how the quantities on the receipt lines are calculated. When you change the number of items in the **Qty. to Cross-Dock** field on each line, the calculation updates. The update doesn't mean that the shipment or production order will actually receive the items being suggested for cross-docking. It's for testing purposes only. The process can be informative, however, if more than one unit of measure is involved.  
5. To reserve a quantity of the item for an order line, choose the line, and then choose the **Reserve** action. On the **Reservation** page, reserve available quantity of the item. The reservation is like any other reservation and doesn't have higher priority because it was created in connection with cross-docking. To learn more about reservations, go to [Reserve Items](inventory-how-to-reserve-items.md).   
6. When you're finished recalculating or reserving, choose the **OK** button to bring the calculation to the **Qty. to Cross-Dock** field on the receipt line, or choose the **Cancel** button to return to the warehouse receipt and calculate the cross-dock again.  
7. Post the receipt. You can continue in the put-away instruction as described in steps 3 through 7 in [To cross-dock items without viewing the opportunities](#to-cross-dock-items-without-viewing-the-opportunities).  

    [!INCLUDE [preview-posting-inventory](includes/preview-posting-inventory.md)]

    > [!NOTE]  
    > In the warehouse put-away, you can continue to change the quantities that are being put away in storage or cross-docked, as necessary. For example, you might decide to cross-dock an extra quantity to expedite the cross-dock registration.  

## To view cross-docked items in a shipment or pick worksheet  

If you're using bins, when you open a shipment or the pick worksheet the quantity of each item in the cross-dock bins updates. When the item is available in the cross-dock bin, you can create a pick for the items on the shipment. In the pick worksheet, you can edit the lines as needed.  

When a production order is released, the lines are available in the pick worksheet and the **Qty. on Cross-Dock Bin** field shows whether the items have arrived and are in the cross-dock bins. When you create a pick instruction, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] suggests that you pick the cross-docked items first. Items in storage bins are suggested afterward.  

If you aren't using bins, remember to check the cross-dock area from time to time, or rely on notifications from receipts that items for production have arrived.

# Set Up Shipping Agents
You can set up a code for each of your shipping agents and enter information about them.  

If you enter an Internet address for the shipping agent, and the agent provides package tracking services on the Internet, you can use the automatic package tracking feature. For more information, see [Track Packages](sales-how-track-packages.md).

When you set up shipping agents on your sales orders, you can also specify the services that each shipping agent offers.  
For each shipping agent, you can set up an unlimited number of services, and you can specify a shipping time for each service.  

When you have assigned a shipping agent service to a sales order line, the shipping time of the service will be included in the order promising calculation, for that line. For more information, see [Calculate Order Promising Dates](sales-how-to-calculate-order-promising-dates.md).

## To set up a shipping agent  
1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Shipping Agents**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)].  
3.  Choose the **Shipping Agent Services** action.
4. In the **Shipping Agent Services**, fill in the fields as necessary.

> [!NOTE]  
>  If you delete the shipping agent on the order line, the shipping agent service code is also deleted. The contents of fields that were based in part on the shipping agent service are recalculated.

# Create users according to licenses

[!INCLUDE[azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id](~/../shared-content/shared/azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id.md)]

This article describes how administrators create users and define who can sign in to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. This article also describes how to assign permissions to different users according to your product licenses.

## Basics

- When you create users in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you grant permissions to them through permission sets. 
- You can also organize users in security groups. Security groups make it easier to manage permissions and other settings for multiple users at the same time.
  [!INCLUDE [2023rw1-sec-group-short](includes/2023rw1-sec-group-short.md)]
- There are several license types. Learn about the different types of licenses and how licensing works in the [Dynamics 365 Licensing Guide](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=866544).

- The process of managing users and licenses varies depending on whether [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is deployed online or on-premises. For [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, you must add users from Microsoft 365. In on-premises deployments, you can create, edit, and delete users directly.  

## Manage users and licenses in online tenants

User accounts in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online must be first created in the Microsoft 365 admin center. These user accounts aren't exclusive to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. If you subscribe to other plans, they can be used to sign in to other applications, such as Power BI. For information about creating users in the Microsoft 365 admin center, go to [Add users in Microsoft admin center](/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/add-users).

Your subscription to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online defines how many [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] user licenses you're allowed. Users are added to your tenant in the Microsoft Partner Center, typically by your Microsoft partner. For more information, see [Administration of Business Central Online](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/tenant-administration).

You assign licenses to users according to the work each user does in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. You can assign licenses in several ways:

- Your company's Microsoft 365 administrator can do it in the [Microsoft 365 Admin Center](https://admin.microsoft.com). For more information, see [Add users individually or in bulk to Microsoft 365](/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/add-users).  
- A Microsoft partner can assign licenses in the Microsoft 365 Admin Center or in the Microsoft Partner Center. For more information, see [User management tasks for customer accounts](/partner-center/assign-licenses-to-users) in the Microsoft Partner Center Help.

For more information, see [Administration of Business Central Online](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/tenant-administration) in the administration Help.

After user accounts are created in the Microsoft 365 admin center, there are two ways to import them to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]:

- A user account is imported automatically when the user signs in to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] the first time.

   > [!NOTE]
   > After a user signs in to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, you can't delete the user.

- The administrator can import users by choosing the **Update Users from Microsoft 365** action on the **Users* page.

Both approaches have their own advantages, and you can use them simultaneously. Each approach allows administrators to proactively configure [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to assign the starting permissions, user groups, and user profiles. Using the **Update Users from Microsoft 365** action gives administrators more control to adjust permissions, user groups, and profiles. It's an ideal approach when you're setting up [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] the first time, before any users sign in, or when adding a new team of users.

> [!NOTE]
> After you add users in the Microsoft 365 Admin Center, we recommend that you update the user information in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] as soon as possible. Keeping user information current is easy to do, and helps ensure that people can always sign in. For more information, see [To add users or update user information and license assignments in Business Central](#adduser).<br>
>
> Updating user information is especially important if you've customized permission sets for the license. If a new user tries to sign in to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] before you've added them, they might not be able to. For more information, see [Configure permissions based on licenses](#licensespermissions).
>
> However, users who experience this problem aren't actually blocked. They can either use the **Go back home** action, or simply sign in again to resolve the issue.

### Delegated admin users

[!INCLUDE [admin-gdap-users](includes/admin-gdap-users.md)]

### <a name="licensespermissions"></a>Configure permissions based on licenses

[!INCLUDE [2022_releasewave1](includes/2022_releasewave1.md)]

Admins can configure permissions sets and user groups for each license.<!--Note to translators: The names in *italics* or capitalized in this section must not be translated.-->  

For example, the commonly used license, *Dynamics 365 Business Central Team Member*, has the following permissions sets by default:

- D365 READ
- D365 TEAM MEMBER
- EDIT IN EXCEL - VIEW
- EXPORT REPORT EXCEL
- LOCAL

Other permission sets are added automatically based on the user groups assigned to the license. When you create a new user based on this license, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] assigns the permission sets originating from the user groups and the permission sets from the license. The same starting permissions are assigned to the user if their user account was created automatically in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] or if the administrator used the **Update Users from Microsoft 365** action in the **Users** page.

If this default configuration isn't the right setup for a particular environment, the admin can change that configuration. However, customized permissions affect only new users who are assigned that license. Permissions for existing users who are assigned the license aren't affected.  

1. Sign in to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] using an administrator account.  
2. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **License Configuration**, and then choose the related link.  

    <!--Alternatively, if you're already in the **Users** page, you can run the **Update Users from Microsoft 365** guide, and then, on the first page of the guide, choose the **Configure permissions per license** link.-->  
3. In the **License Configuration** page, choose the license that you want to customize, and then choose the **Configure** action.  
4. Choose the **Customize permissions** field to switch on customization, and then make the changes.  

    In our example, the admin wants to remove the permission to edit in Excel, so they remove the *Excel Export Action* user group from the Team Member license. Afterward, new users who are assigned the Team Member license can't export data to Excel. If the organization changes their minds on the subject, they can just go back to the **License Configuration** page and switch off the customization for that license type.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This customization of permissions only takes effect for new users that you assign the relevant license. Existing users are not updated. We recommend that you customize permissions before you start assigning users licenses in the Microsoft 365 admin center.

### <a name="adduser"></a>To add users or update user information and license assignments in Business Central

After you add users or change user information in the Microsoft 365 Admin Center, you can quickly import the user information to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The import includes license assignments.  

> [!TIP]
> If you need to update user information and you have a lot of users, you can use the filter pane to narrow down the list. You can filter on basic information such as the user name, or set more technical filters, such as the user's security ID.

1. Sign in to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] using an administrator account.
2. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Users**, and then choose the related link.  
3. Choose **Update Users from Microsoft 365**.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Running the synchronization of users from Microsoft 365 using the **Update Users from Microsoft 365** guide, requires the SUPER permission set.

> [!NOTE]
> The **Update Users from Microsoft 365** guide doesn't update users that are not assigned a license, such as someone who is a [Dynamics 365 administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#dynamics-365-administrator). Those users will update the next time they sign in to the environment.

The next step for newly created users is to assign user groups and permissions. Go to [Assign Permissions to Users and Groups](ui-define-granular-permissions.md) for information. If you update a user with a license change, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] assigns users to the appropriate user group and updates their permission sets. For more information, see [To manage permissions through user groups](ui-define-granular-permissions.md).  

> [!NOTE]
> With 2024 release wave 1, a Premium license user can sign in to a company where the **User Experience** field is set to **Essentials** on the **Company Information** page. However, the Premium user can't use any of the features that the Premium license provides. This doesn't work in the opposite direction. Users who have an Essentials license can't sign in to a company where the **User Experience** is set to **Premium** on the **Company Information** page. For more information about licensing, go to [Business Central](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/business-central/overview/) website.

If you use an external accountant to manage your books and financial reporting, you can invite them to your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] so they can work with you on your fiscal data. For more information, see [Inviting Your External Accountant to Your Business Central](finance-accounting.md#inviteaccountant).

For more information about synchronizing user information with Microsoft 365, go to the [Synchronization with Microsoft 365](#m365) section.

> [!NOTE]
> If you use an external accountant to manage your books and financial reporting, you can invite them to your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] so they can work with you on your fiscal data. For more information, see [Inviting Your External Accountant to Your Business Central](finance-accounting.md#inviteaccountant).

### To remove a user's access to the system

You can remove a user's access to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online. All references to the user are kept. However, the user can't sign in and active sessions for the user are stopped.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Users**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the **User Card** page for the relevant user, and then, in the **Status** field, select **Disabled**.
3. To give the user access again, set the **Status** field to **Enabled**.

You can also remove the license from a user in the Microsoft 365 Admin Center. The user is then unable to sign in. For more information, see [Remove licenses from users](/microsoft-365/admin/manage/remove-licenses-from-users).

### <a name="m365"></a>Synchronization with Microsoft 365

When you assign a license for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to a user in Microsoft 365, there are two ways to create the user in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

- The administrator can add the user by choosing the **Update Users from Microsoft 365** action on the **Users** page as described in the [To add a user or update user information in Business Central](#adduser) section.
- The license information updates automatically when the user signs in for the first time.

In both cases, several settings are applied automatically. These settings are listed in the second and third columns in the following table.

If you change user information in Microsoft 365, you can update [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to reflect the change. Depending on what you want to update, use one of the actions on the **Users** page. The actions are described in the last two columns in the following table.

|What happens when:|First user, first sign-in|Update Users from Microsoft 365|Restore User Default User Groups|
|-|-|-|-|
|Scope:|Current user|Multiple selected users|Single selected user (except current)|
|Create the new user and assign SUPER permission set.<br /><br /><!--Platform-->|**X**|**X** | | 
|Update the user based on information in Microsoft 365: Status, Full Name, Contact Email, Authentication Email.<!--<br /><br />Codeunit "Azure AD   Graph User".UpdateUserFromAzureGraph-->|**X**|**X**|**X**|
|Synchronize user plans (licenses) with licenses and roles assigned in Microsoft 365.<!--<br /><br />Codeunit "Azure AD   Graph User".UpdateUserPlans-->|**X**|**X**|**X**|
|Add the user to user groups according to the current user plans. Remove the SUPER permission set for all users other than the first user to sign in and [administrators](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/tenant-administration). At least one SUPER is required.<!--<br /><br />Codeunit "Permission Manager". AddUserToDefaultUserGroups-->|**X**|**X**|**X**<br /><br />Removes manually assigned user groups and permissions.|

Users can access [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] records in Teams using only their Microsoft 365 license. When access is enabled for an environment, synchronizing using the **Update users from Microsoft 365** action skips users that only have a Microsoft 365 license. To include these users in synchronization, you must first update environment settings by assigning a security group that contains users with a [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] license and users with only a Microsoft 365 license.

Learn about securing access to environments using security groups at [Manage access using Microsoft Entra groups](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/tenant-admin-center-manage-access#manage-access-using-azure-active-directory-groups).

Get an overview of accessing [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in Teams with Microsoft 365 licenses at [admin-access-with-m365-license](admin-access-with-m365-license.md).

## Manage users and licenses in on-premises deployments

For on-premises deployments, the number of user licenses is specified in the license file (.bclicense or .flf). When an administrator or Microsoft partner uploads the license file, they can specify which users can sign in to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

For on-premises deployments, the administrator creates, edits, and deletes users directly from the **Users** page.

> [!NOTE]
> In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, delegated admin access isn't available like it is in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online. Microsoft partners need standard user licenses to use [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Learn more about licenses in the [Business Central on-premises licensing guide](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2009643).

### To edit or delete a user in an on-premises deployment

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Users**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the user that you want to edit, and then choose the **Edit** action.
3. On the **User Card** page, change the information as necessary.  
4. To delete a user, select the user that you want to delete, and then choose the **Delete** action.

> [!NOTE]
> For on-premises deployments an administrator can specify how to authenticate user credentials in the [!INCLUDE[server](includes/server.md)] instance. When you create a user, you provide the credential type that you are using.
>
> For more information, see the [Authentication and Credential Types](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/users-credential-types) in the administration Help for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## Analyze user status by license type

You can use the **Data Analysis** feature to analyze data on the [Users](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=9800&layout=analysis) page. You don't have to run a report or open another application, such as Excel. The feature provides an interactive and versatile way to calculate, summarize, and examine data. Instead of running reports using options and filters, you can add multiple tabs that represent different tasks or views on the data. Some examples are "Users by status" or "Users by license type," or any other view you can imagine. To learn more about how to use the **Data Analysis** feature, go to [Analyze list and query data with analysis mode](analysis-mode.md).

### User analysis scenarios

The following sections provide examples of scenarios where analyzing the user list can help you monitor the status of your users.

| Area | To... | Open this page in analysis mode | Using these fields |
| ---- | ----- | ------------------------------- |------------------- |
| [Users by status](#example-users-by-status) | See a list of users based on their status (enabled/disabled). | [Users](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=9800&layout=analysis) | **Status**, **User Name**, **Full Name**, **Authorization email**, and **License Type**. |
| [Users by license type](#example-users-by-license-type) | See a list of users based on their license type. | [Users](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=9800&layout=analysis) | **License Type**, **Status**,  **User Name**, **Full Name**, and **Authorization email**. |

### Example: Users by status

To analyze users by status, follow these steps:

1. Open the [Users](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=9800&layout=analysis) list, and choose the :::image type="content" source="media/analysis-mode-icon.png" alt-text="Enter analysis mode."::: icon to turn on analysis mode.
1. On the **Columns** menu, remove all columns (select the box next to the **Search** field on the right).

# Manage Interactions for Segments
The **Segment** page is a type of worksheet where you can:

* Create segments.
* Save the segmentation criteria you have used to select contacts.
* Log the segment and record interactions involving the contacts within the segment.

## Segmenting
There are several ways to create segments:

* You can manually enter the contacts you want to include in the segment in the segment lines.
* You can select contacts.
* You can reuse a logged segment as the basis to create a new one.
* You can reuse saved segmentation criteria.

## Interactions
On the **Segment** page, you can create interactions for several contacts simultaneously. For example, you can merge a segment with a Microsoft Word document, so that you can send a letter to all the contacts in the segment.

You can specify information about the interaction for the segment on the **Segment** header. For example, you can decide which interaction template you want to use for all the contacts, specify a description, a correspondence type, and so on. However, you can modify this information in the segment line for each particular contact, for example, by specifying another description for one contact. If you are merging a segment with a Microsoft Word document, you can personalize the document to be sent for one or several of the contacts within the segment, for example, by adding individualized comments to the document.

## Logging
On the **Segment** page, when you choose **Log**, the application records the interactions on the **Interaction Log Entry** page, and logs the segment. After you have logged the segment, you can only find it on the **Logged Segments** page.

On the **Logged Segments** page, you can decide to create a follow-up segment containing the same contacts as the segment you have logged.

# Daily Purchases (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Daily Purchases** report provides a comprehensive overview of your purchase activities on specific days. By highlighting days with a higher volume of purchases, you can identify trends and patterns in your purchasing behavior. You can also use this report to analyze purchase data across different years, quarters, or months, and get valuable insights into purchasing trends over time.

:::image type="content" source="media/purchases/daily-purchases.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Daily Purchases Power BI report" lightbox="media/purchases/daily-purchases.png":::

## Use the report

This report helps purchasing managers and purchasing teams to optimize purchasing schedules and track daily purchase activities.

Purchasing managers can analyze data to allocate budgets and staff, ensuring that your team can handle the purchasing volume. Use this report to identify the busiest days of the week and make sure that your team is adequately staffed on those days. For example, the report might show that Wednesdays are your busiest days. You can allocate more staff and budget to ensure that your team can handle the workload.

Purchasers track daily purchases and ensure they stay within budget. Use this report to monitor daily purchase activities and identify purchases or days that might exceed the budget.


## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The *Daily Purchases* report includes the following KPIs and measures:

# Design details: planning parameters

This article describes the planning parameters that you can use in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

How the planning system controls item supply is determined by various settings on the **Item Card**, **SKU**, and **Manufacturing Setup** pages. The following table explains how planning uses these settings.  

|Purpose|Settings|
|-------------|---------------|
|Define whether the item is planned|Reordering Policy = Blank|
|Define when to reorder|Time Bucket<br /><br /> Reorder Point<br /><br /> Safety Lead Time|
|Define how much to reorder|Safety Stock Quantity<br /><br /> Reordering Policy:<br /><br /> - Fixed Reorder Qty. plus Reorder Quantity<br />-   Maximum Qty. plus Maximum Inventory<br />- Order<br />- Lot-for-Lot|
|Optimize when and how much to reorder|Rescheduling Period<br /><br /> Lot Accumulation Period<br /><br /> Dampener Period|
|Modify the supply orders|Minimum Order Quantity<br /><br /> Maximum Order Quantity<br /><br /> Order Multiple|
|Delimit the planned item|Manufacturing Policy:<br /><br /> - Make-to-Stock<br />- Make-to-Order|

## Define whether the item is planned  

To include an item or SKU in the planning process, you must assign it a reordering policy. Otherwise, it must be planned manually, for example, by using the **Order Planning** page.  

## Define when to reorder  

Reorder proposals are typically released only when the projected available quantity is equal to or below a given quantity. The reorder point defines the quantity. Otherwise, it's zero. Zero can be adjusted by entering a safety stock quantity. If you define a safety lead time, the proposal is delivered in the period before the required due date.  

The **Time Bucket** field is used by reorder point policies (**Fixed Reorder Qty.** and **Maximum Qty.**). The inventory level is checked after each time bucket. The first time bucket begins on the planning start date.  

> [!NOTE]  
> When planning calculates time buckets, it ignores working calendars that are defined in the **Base Calendar Code** field on the **Company Information** and **Location Card** pages.  

On the **Manufacturing Setup** page, you should set the default safety lead time to at least one day. The due date of the demand might be known, but not the due time. The planning schedules backward to meet gross demand. If you don't define a safety lead time, the goods might arrive too late to meet the demand.  

The **Rescheduling Period**, **Lot Accumulation Period**, and **Dampener Period** fields also play a role in defining when to reorder. To learn more, go to [Optimize When and How Much to Reorder](design-details-planning-parameters.md#optimize-when-and-how-much-to-reorder).  

## Define how much to reorder

If the planning system detects the need to reorder, the reordering policy determines when, and how much, to order.  

Independent of the reordering policy, the planning system usually follows this logic:  

1. Calculate the quantity of the order proposal to meet the minimum inventory level of the item, usually the safety stock quantity. If nothing is specified, the minimum inventory level is zero.  
2. If the projected available inventory is below the safety stock quantity, a backward-scheduled supply order is suggested. The order quantity refills the safety stock quantity. Gross demand can increase it within the time bucket according to the reordering policy and the order modifiers.  
3. If the projected inventory is on or below the reorder point (calculated from aggregated changes within the time bucket) and above the safety stock quantity, a forward-scheduled exception order is suggested. Both the gross demand to be met and the reordering policy determine the order quantity. At a minimum, the order quantity meets the reorder point.  
4. If more gross demand is due before the ending date of the forward-scheduled order proposal, and this demand brings the currently projected available inventory below the safety stock quantity, the order quantity is increased to make up the deficit. The suggested supply order is then scheduled backward from the due date of the gross demand that exceeded the safety stock quantity.  
5. If the **Time Bucket** field isn't filled in, only the gross demand on the same due date is added.  

### Reordering policies  

The reordering policies in the following table affect the reorder quantity. To learn more about reordering policies, go to [Design Details: Handling Reordering Policies](design-details-handling-reordering-policies.md).  

|Reordering policy|Description|  
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------|  
|**Fixed Reorder Qty.**|At a minimum, the order quantity is equal to the reorder quantity. You can increase the quantity to meet the demand or the desired inventory level. This reordering policy is often used with a reorder point.|  
|**Maximum Qty.**|The order quantity is calculated to meet the maximum inventory. If quantity modifiers are used, then maximum inventory can be violated. We don't recommend that you use the time bucket together with maximum quantity. The time bucket is often overruled. This reordering policy is often used with a reorder point.|  
|**Order**|The order quantity is calculated to meet each single demand event, and the demand-supply set remains linked until execution. No planning parameters are considered.|  
|**Lot-for-Lot**|The quantity is calculated to meet the sum of the demand that becomes due in the time bucket.|  

## Optimize when and how much to reorder  

A planner can fine-tune planning parameters to limit rescheduling suggestions, accumulate demand (dynamic reorder quantity), or to avoid insignificant planning actions. The following fields help optimize when and how much to reorder.  

|Field|Description|  
|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
|**Rescheduling Period**|This field determines whether the action message should reschedule an existing order or cancel it and create a new order. The existing order will be rescheduled within one rescheduling period before the current supply and until one rescheduling period after the current supply.<br><br>**Note:** This parameter only works with the **Lot-for-Lot** reordering policy.|  
|**Lot Accumulation Period**|With the reordering policy Lot-for-Lot, this field is used to accumulate multiple supply needs into one supply order. From the first planned supply, the system accumulates all supply needs in the following lot accumulation period into one supply, which is placed on the date of the first supply. Demand outside the lot accumulation period isn't covered by this supply.|  
|**Dampener Period**|This field is used to avoid minor rescheduling of existing supply out in time. Changes from the supply date until one dampener period from the supply date don't generate action messages.<br /><br /> The dampener period specifies a period of time during which you don't want the planning system to propose to reschedule existing supply orders forward. This setting limits the number of insignificant rescheduling of existing supply to a later date if the rescheduled date is within the dampener period.<br /><br /> As a result, a positive delta between the suggested new supply date and the original supply date is always larger than the dampener period.|  

> [!NOTE]
> With the reordering policy Lot-for-Lot, the value of the **Lot Accumulation Period** field must be equal to or larger than the value of the **Dampener Period** field. Otherwise, the dampener period is reduced during the planning routine to match the lot accumulation period.  

The timing of rescheduling period, dampener period, and lot accumulation period is based on a supply date. The time bucket is based on the planning start date, as shown in the following illustration.  

:::image type="content" source="media/supply_planning_5_time_bucket_elements.png" alt-text="Time bucket elements.":::

In the following examples, the black arrows represent existing supply (up) and demand (down). Red, green, and orange arrows are planning suggestions.  

**Example 1**: The changed date is outside the rescheduling period, which causes the existing supply to be canceled. A new supply is suggested to cover the demand in the lot accumulation period.  

:::image type="content" source="media/supply_planning_5_recheduling_period_lot_accumulation_period.png" alt-text="Rescheduling and lot accumulation periods.":::

**Example 2**: The changed date is in the rescheduling period, which causes the existing supply to be rescheduled. A new supply is suggested to cover the demand outside the lot accumulation period.  

:::image type="content" source="media/supply_planning_5_recheduling_period_lot_accum_period_reschedule.png" alt-text="Rescheduling period, lot accumulation period, and reschedule.":::

**Example 3**: There's a demand in the dampener period and the supply quantity in the lot accumulation period matches the supply quantity. The next demand is uncovered and a new supply is suggested.  

:::image type="content" source="media/supply_planning_5_dampener_period_lot_accumulation_period.png" alt-text="Dampener period and lot accumulation period.":::

**Example 4**: There's a demand in the dampener period and the supply remains on the same date. However, the current supply quantity doesn't cover the demand in the lot accumulation period. A change quantity action for the existing supply order is suggested.  

:::image type="content" source="media/supply_planning_5_dampener_period_lot_accum_period_change_qty.png" alt-text="Dampener period, lot accumulation period, and change quantity.":::

**Default values:** The default value of the **Time Bucket** field and the three reorder period fields is blank. For all fields, except the **Dampener Period** field, this means 0D (zero days). If the **Dampener Period** field is blank, the global value in the **Default Dampener Period** field on the **Manufacturing Setup** page is used.  

## Modify the supply orders  

When the quantity of the order proposal is calculated, one or more of the order modifiers can adjust it. For example, the maximum order quantity is larger than or equal to the minimum order quantity, which is larger than or equal to the order multiple.  

The quantity is decreased if it exceeds the maximum order quantity. Then, it increases if it's below the minimum order quantity. Finally, it rounds up so that it matches a specified order multiple. Any remaining quantity uses the same adjustments until the total demand is converted to order proposals.  

## Delimit the item  

The **Manufacturing Policy** field on the **Item Card** page defines which other orders the MRP calculation proposes.  

If the **Make-to-Stock** option is used, the orders concern only the item.  

If the **Make-to-Order** option is used, the planning system analyzes the production BOM of the item and creates linked order proposals for those lower-level items that are also defined as make-to-order. This pattern continues as long as there are make-to-order items in the descending BOM structures.

## Use low-level codes to manage derived demand

Use low-level codes to make derived demand for components progress through to the lower levels of the BOM. To learn more about low-level codes, go to [Item Priority / Low-Level Code](design-details-central-concepts-of-the-planning-system.md#item-priority--low-level-code).

You can assign a low-level code to each part in the product structure or the indented BOM. The top final assembly level is denoted as level 0 - the end item. The higher the low-level code number, the lower the item is in the hierarchy. For example, end items have low-level code 0, and the item parts that go into the assembly of the end item have low-level codes 1, 2, 3, and so on. The result is the planning of component parts coordinated with the requirements of all higher-level part numbers. When you calculate a plan, the BOM is exploded in the planning worksheet, and the gross requirements for level 0 are passed down the planning levels as gross requirements for the next planning level.

On the **Manufacturing Setup** page, use the **Dynamic Low-Level Code** toggle to specify whether to immediately assign and calculate low-level codes for each component in the product structure. If you have large amounts of data, this function can have negative effects on the program's performance, for example during automatic cost adjustment. This function isn't retroactive, so it's a good idea to consider the use of this feature beforehand.

As an alternative to the automatic calculation that occurs dynamically if the field is selected, you can run the **Calculate Low-Level Code** batch job from the **Manufacturing** menu by clicking **Product Design**, **Calculate Low-Level Code**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you don't turn on the **Dynamic Low-Level Code** toggle, you must run the **Calculate Low-Level Code** batch job before you calculate a supply plan (the **Calculate Plan** batch job).  

> [!NOTE]
> Although you turn on the **Dynamic Low-Level Code** field selected, the low-level codes of component items aren't changed dynamically if a parent BOM is deleted or set to noncertified. This case might make it difficult to add new items to the end of the product structure because it might exceed the maximum number of low-level codes. Therefore, for large product structures that reach the low-level code limit, you can run the **Calculate Low Level Code** batch job frequently to maintain the structure.

# Set up time sheets

Time sheets in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] handle time registration in weekly increments of seven days. You can use them to track the time used on projects, and you can use them to record simple resource time registration. Before you use time sheets, you must specify which users will submit time sheets and how you want to configure time sheets.  

> [!TIP]
> The people who use time sheets are *resources*. For example, that lets you use time sheets to track the work of non-employees. To track the work of employees, or to use time sheets to track employee absence, you must associate employees with resources. There's an assisted setup guide that can help you do that. To learn about the guide, go to [Set up time sheets with the assisted setup guide](#set-up-time-sheets-with-the-assisted-setup-guide).  

Optionally, specify whether and how time sheets are approved. Depending on the needs of your organization, you can designate:

* One or more users as the time sheet administrator and approver for all time sheets.
* A time sheet approver for each resource.

When you have set up time sheets, you can create time sheets for resources, and the resources can post time sheet lines. Optionally, assign time sheets to project planning lines. To learn more, go to [Use Time Sheets](projects-how-use-time-sheets.md).  

## Set up time sheets with the assisted setup guide

An assisted setup guide can help you set up time sheets.  

> [!TIP]
> If you're a version earlier than 2023 release wave 1 (v22), you must enable the **Feature Update: New time sheet experience** feature in the [Feature Management](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=2610) page to use this capability.
>
> This setting also lets you use time sheets on mobile devices.

Open the **Set Up Time Sheets** assisted setup guide from the [Assisted Setup](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=1801) page.

The assisted setup guide takes you through the following steps:

1. Set up the participants in the time sheet processes.

    The first page in the guide shows you the number of users in your [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. It also shows other required and optional information.  
2. Specify the first day of a work week in this organization.

    The first day of a work week is the default first day for all time sheets.
3. Specify the person who administers time sheets.

    This person can edit and delete all time sheets. Optionally, add the same role to other people in the **User Setup** page.
4. Set up the resources who will use time sheets, and the people who will approve time sheets.

At the end of the setup guide, you can choose to let [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] create time sheets based on your configuration. View the new time sheets in the **Time Sheets** page, which you can open [here](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=951). Alternatively, run the assisted setup guide again, or complete the setup manually.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you're using 2023 release wave 1 (v22) or later, to ensure that you can manage time sheets on mobile devices, you must manually turn on the **Use New Time Sheet Experience** option for the time sheet setup, as described in the next procedure.

## Set up time sheets manually

The following sections describe how to set up time sheets if you don't use the **Set Up Time Sheets** assisted setup guide.  

### Set up general information for time sheets manually

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Resources Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
1. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > If you're using 2023 release wave 1 (v22) or later, to ensure that you can manage time sheets on mobile devices, turn on the **Use New Time Sheet Experience** option.
1. For the **Time Sheet by Job Approval** field, select one of the following options.

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Never** |The user in the **Time Sheet Approver User ID** field on the resource card approves the time sheet. |
| **Always** |The user in the **Person Responsible** field on the Project Card approves the time sheet. |
| **Machine Only** |If the machine time sheet is linked with a job, then the user in the **Person Responsible** field on the Project Card approves the time sheet. If the machine time sheet is linked with a resource, then the user in the **Time Sheet Approver User ID** field on the resource card approves the time sheet. |

### Assign a time sheet administrator manually

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **User Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the user who will be the time sheet administrator, and then select the **Time Sheet Admin.** checkbox.  

> [!TIP]  
> We recommend that you designate only one user as the time sheet administrator for a company. In the following procedure, you set up a time sheet owner and approver where the time sheet approver is assigned for each resource.  

### Assign a time sheets owner and approver manually

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Resources**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the resource for which you want to set up the ability to use time sheets, and then select the **Use Time Sheet** checkbox.  
3. In the **Time Sheet Owner User ID** field, enter the ID of the owner of the time sheet. The owner can enter time usage on a time sheet and submit it for approval. Typically, when the resource is a person, that person is also the owner.  
4. In the **Time Sheet Approver User ID** field, enter the ID of the approver of the time sheet. The approver can approve, reject, or reopen a time sheet.  

> [!NOTE]  
> You can't change the ID of the time sheet approver if there are time sheets that haven't been processed and have the status of **Submitted** or **Open**.

# Create incoming document records

On the **Incoming Documents** page, you can use different functions to review expense receipts, manage OCR tasks, and convert incoming document files, manually or automatically, to the relevant documents or journal lines. The external files can be attached at any process stage, including to posted documents and to the resulting vendor, customer, and general ledger entries.

To record an external document in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], first create or complete an incoming document record. You can do those tasks manually, or you can take a photo of the external document to create the incoming document record with the image file attached.

Before you can use the **Incoming Documents** feature, you must perform the required setup. For more information, see [Set Up Incoming Documents](across-how-setup-income-documents.md).

## Approve or reject an incoming document

# Work with catalog items

Catalog items are items that you don't manage in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] until you sell them. When you use the **Select Catalog Item** action to add a catalog item to a line on a sales order, quote, or blanket sales order, the catalog item is converted to a regular item.

> [!NOTE]  
> You can't select a catalog item from the **Sales Invoice** page.

A catalog item typically has the item number of the vendor who supplies it. Before you can convert a catalog item to a normal item, you must specify how to convert vendor item numbers to your item numbering. To learn more about item numbering, go to [Specify how catalog item numbers are converted to your own numbering](#specify-how-catalog-item-numbers-are-converted-to-your-own-numbering).  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Catalog items are not to be mistaken with non-inventory items, which are regular items that are given the type **Non-Inventory** to keep them out of availability and costing calculations, for example, because they are only used internally and have a low cost. To learn move about non-inventory items, go to [About Item Types](inventory-about-item-types.md).

## Create a catalog item

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Catalog Items**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Catalog Items** page, choose the **New** action.
3. On the **Catalog Item Card** page, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

## Specify how catalog item numbers are converted to your own numbering

Before you can convert a catalog item to a regular item, you must specify how to convert vendor item numbers to the structure you use for item numbers.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Catalog Item Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. In the **No. Format** field, choose the option you prefer.

## Convert a catalog item to a normal item

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Catalog Items**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the card for a catalog item that you want to convert to a normal item.
3. On the **Catalog Item Card** page, choose the **Create Item** action.

A new item card prefilled with information from the catalog item and an item template is created. You can edit the information about the new item if needed. To learn more about creating items, go to [Register New Items](inventory-how-register-new-items.md).

> [!NOTE]  
> An item reference is automatically created between the vendor's item number and your new item number. To learn more about item references, go to [Use Item References](inventory-how-use-item-cross-refs.md).

## To sell a catalog item and convert it to a normal item

The following process uses a sales order, but the steps are the same for blanket sales orders and quotes.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Orders**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action. Fill in the fields on the **General** FastTab as for any sales order. For more information, see [Sell Products](sales-how-sell-products.md).
3. On a new sales line, in the **Type** field, select **Item**, but leave the **No.** field empty.
4. Choose the **Line** action, and then choose the **Select Catalog Items** action.
5. On the **Catalog Items** page, select the catalog item that you want to sell, and then choose the **OK** button.
   The catalog item automatically converts to a normal item, and the new normal item is selected on the sales line.
6. When the sales order is complete, choose the **Post** action.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you change you mind and delete the sales line, the automatically created item is also deleted. Deleting the item helps reduce clutter in you list of items.
>
> The item is also deleted if you convert the item manually, or make changes such as adding new units of measure or updating prices or cost. However, the item won't be deleted if it's already used in sales or purchase lines, assembly BOMs, or has ledger entries.

# Calculate Dates for purchases

If you want to have items in inventory on a certain date, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can automatically calculate the date on which you must order them. 

The result is the date on which you can pick the items that you ordered.  

If you specify a requested receipt date on a purchase order line, the calculated order date is the date on which you must place the order. The date on which the items will be available for picking displays in the **Expected Receipt Date** field.  

If you don't specify a requested receipt date, the date you expect to receive the items is based on order date on the line. 

The receipt date is also the date when the items will be available for picking.  

> [!TIP]
> By default, many of the date fields this article mentions are hidden on purchase order lines. If a field isn't available, you can add it by personalizing the page. For more information, see [Personalize Your Workspace](ui-personalization-user.md).

## Calculating with a requested receipt date

If there's a requested receipt date on the purchase order line, that date is the basis for the following calculations:  

- requested receipt date - lead time calculation = order date  
- requested receipt date + inbound whse. handling time + safety lead time = expected receipt date  

If you specify a requested receipt date on a purchase order line, that date is assigned to new lines as you create them. You can change or remove the date on the lines.  

> [!NOTE]
> If your process is based on backward calculation, for example, if you use the requested receipt date to get the order date, we recommend that you use date formulas that have fixed durations, such as "5D" for five days or "1W" for one week. Date formulas without fixed durations, such as "CW" for current week or CM for current month, can result in incorrect date calculations. For more information about date formulas, see [Work with Calendar Dates and Times](ui-enter-date-ranges.md).

## Calculating without a requested receipt date

If you enter a purchase order line without a requested receipt date, the **Order Date** field on the line shows the date in the **Order Date** field on the purchase order header. This date is either the date you entered or the work date. The dates are then calculated for the purchase order line, with the order date as the starting point, as follows:  

- order date + lead time calculation = planned receipt date  
- planned receipt date + inbound whse. handling time + safety lead time = expected receipt date  

If you change the order date on the line, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] recalculates the other dates.  

## Default values for lead time calculation

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses the date formula in the **Lead Time Calculation** field on the purchase order line to calculate the order and expected receipt dates.  

You can manually specify the date formula on lines. Otherwise, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will use the formulas that are defined on the following pages in this order of priority:

1. Item/Vendor Catalog
2. Item Card
3. Stockkeeping Unit Card
4. Vendor Card

# Ad-hoc analyses in purchasing

This article explains how to analyze purchasing data from list pages and queries using the **Data Analysis** feature. The feature lets you analyze data directly from the page, without having to run a report or open another application, such as Excel. Data Analysis provides an interactive and versatile way to calculate, summarize, and examine data. Instead of running reports using options and filters, you can add multiple tabs that represent different tasks or views on the data. Some examples are "My vendors," or "Purchasing statistics," or any other view you can imagine. To learn more about how to use the **Data Analysis** feature, go to [Analyze list and query data with analysis mode](analysis-mode.md).

Use the following list pages for ad-hoc analysis of purchase processes:

- [Purchase Orders](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=9307&layout=analysis)
- [Purchase lines](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=518&layout=analysis)
- [Posted Purchase Invoices](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=146&layout=analysis)
- [Vendor Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=29&layout=analysis)
- [General Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=20&layout=analysis)

## Ad-hoc analysis scenarios for purchasing

Use the **Data Analysis** feature for quick fact checking and ad-hoc analysis:

- If you don't want to run a report
- If there isn't a report for your specific needs
- If you want to quickly iterate to get a good overview on a part of your business.

The following sections provide examples of purchasing scenarios in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

| Area | To... | Open this page in analysis mode | Using these fields |
| ---- | ----- | ------------------------------- |------------------- |
| [GRNI overview](#example-goods-received-not-invoiced-grni-overview) | Get a Goods Received, Not Invoiced (GRNI) overview across vendors. | [Purchase lines](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=518&layout=analysis) | **Type**, **Amt. Rec. Not Invoiced (LCY)** (filter on these fields), **Vendor No.**, **Document No.**, **No.**, and **Amt. Rec. Not Invoiced (LCY)** <br><br> **NOTE:** You must personalize the page to add these fields. To learn more, go to [Personalize your workspace](ui-personalization-user.md). | 
| [Finance (Accounts Payable)](#example-finance-accounts-payable) | See what you owe your vendors, maybe broken down into time intervals for when amounts are due. | [Vendor Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=29&layout=analysis) | **Vendor Name**, **Document Type**, **Document No.**, **Due Date Year**, **Due Date Month**, and **Remaining Amount**. |
| [Finance (Accounts Payable)](#example-finance-accounts-payable---vendor-ledger-entries-on-hold) | Get an overview of vendor ledger entries that have been marked On Hold | [Vendor Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=29&layout=analysis) | **Vendor Name**, **Document Type**, **Document No.**, **On Hold**, and **Remaining Amount**. |


## Example: goods received, not invoiced (GRNI) overview

To create a goods received, not invoiced (GRNI) overview across vendors, follow these steps:

1. Open the [Purchase lines](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=518) list page.
1. Personalize the page to add the **Amount Received Not Invoiced** field. To personalize the page, choose **Settings**, and then **Personalize**.
1. Choose :::image type="content" source="media/analysis-mode-icon.png" alt-text="Enter analysis mode."::: to turn on analysis mode.
1. Go to the **Columns** menu and remove all columns (select the box next to the **Search** field on the right).
1. In the **Additional Filters** menu (located below the **Columns** menu on the right), set the following filters:
    - **Type = Item**
    - **Amt. Rec. Not Invoiced (LCY) > 0**. 
1. Drag the **Vendor No.**, **Document No.**, and **No.** fields to the **Row Groups** area. Drag the fields in that order.
1. Add the **Amt. Rec. Not Invoiced (LCY)** field to include it on the overview.
1. To do the analysis for a given year or quarter, apply a filter in the **Analysis Filters** menu. The menu is on the right of the page, just below the **Columns** menu.
1. Rename your analysis tab to **Goods Received, Not Invoiced (GRNI)**, or something that describes this analysis.

## Example: finance (accounts payable)

To see what you owe your vendors, maybe broken down into time intervals for when amounts are due, follow these steps:

1. Open the [Vendor Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=29&layout=analysis) list page, and turn on analysis mode.
1. Go to the **Columns** menu and remove all columns (select the box next to the **Search** field on the right).
1. Turn on the **Pivot Mode** toggle (located above the **Search** field on the right).
1. Drag the **Vendor Name**, **Document Type**, and **Document No.** fields to the **Row Groups** area, and then drag the **Remaining Amount** field to the **Values** area.
1. Drag the **Due Date Year** and **Due Date Month** fields to the **Column Labels** area. Drag the fields in that order.
1. To do the analysis for a given year or quarter, apply a filter in the **Analysis Filters** menu (located below the **Columns** menu on the right).
1. Rename your analysis tab to **Aged Payable Accounts by Month**, or something that describes this analysis.

The following image shows the result of these steps.

:::image type="content" source="media/data-analysis-vendor-ledger-entries.png" alt-text="Example of how to do data analysis on the Customer Ledger Entries page." lightbox="media/data-analysis-vendor-ledger-entries.png":::

## Example: finance (accounts payable) - vendor ledger entries on hold

To see vendor ledger entries on hold, follow these steps:

1. Open the [Vendor Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=29&layout=analysis) list page, and turn on analysis mode.
1. Go to the **Columns** menu and remove all columns (select the box next to the **Search** field on the right).
1. Turn on the **Pivot Mode** toggle (located above the **Search** field on the right).
1. Drag the **Vendor Name**, **Document Type**, and **Document No.** fields to the **Row Groups** area, and then drag the **Remaining Amount** field to the **Values** area.
1. Drag the **On Hold** field to the **Column Labels** area.
1. Rename your analysis tab to **Payments On Hold**, or something that describes this analysis.

The following image shows the result of these steps.

## Data foundation for ad-hoc analysis on purchasing

When you post a purchase document, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] updates the vendor's account, general ledger (G/L), item ledger entries, and resource ledger entries:

- For each purchase document, a purchase entry is created in the **G/L Entry** table. An entry is also created in the vendor's account in the **Supplier Ledger Entry** table, and a G/L entry is created in the relevant payables account. In addition, posting the purchase might result in a value-added tax (VAT) entry and a G/L entry for the discount amount.

- For each purchase line, as applicable, entries are created in the:
  - **Item Ledger Entry** table, if the purchase line is of the Item type.
  - **G/L Entry** table, if the purchase line is of the G/L Account type.
  - **Resource Ledger Entry** table, if the purchase line is of the Resource type.
- In addition, purchase documents are always recorded in the **Purch. Recpt. Header** and **Purch. Inv. Header** tables.

# Frequently asked questions about the Power BI apps in Business Central

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

This article provides answers to frequently asked questions (FAQs) about the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] apps for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## What [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] licenses do I need?

To use the Power BI apps, you need [!INCLUDE [powerbi-pro-license-name](includes/powerbi-pro-license-name.md)] licenses for the following users:

- Users who install the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] template apps.
- Users who refresh the report data.
- Users who access the reports.

Alternatively, you can use [!INCLUDE [powerbi-premium-capacity-name](includes/powerbi-premium-capacity-name.md)].

To learn more, go to [Installing Power BI apps for Business Central (prerequisites)](across-powerbi-install-business-central-apps.md#prerequisites).

## Why do I need [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] licenses?

You must have [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] licenses for the following reasons:

1. You must install [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] template apps from Microsoft AppSource.
2. You must share a [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] workspace.

The use of free license alternative for [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] allows you to embed your own reports. Anything in the free [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] license must be present in your personal [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] workspace. So, the free license alternative does not work with the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] apps.

## What Business Central licenses do I need?

[!INCLUDE[about_bc_licensing_for_powerbi](includes/about_bc_licensing_for_powerbi.md)]

[!INCLUDE[about_licensing](includes/about_licensing.md)]

## Can I install the same app multiple times for different companies or environments?

Yes. Just choose **Install another copy of the app into a new workspace** when you install the app again. Consider including the company name in the workspace name for easier discoverability.

:::image type="content" source="media/powerbi/power-bi-install-app.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Power BI app installer." lightbox="media/powerbi/power-bi-install-app.png":::

## Can I use the same app to do reporting across multiple companies or environments?

No. [!INCLUDE [powerbi-apps-per-company-include](includes/powerbi-apps-per-company-include.md)]

## How do I refresh the data in an app?

To learn more, go to [Get the latest data (refresh the semantic model)](./across-powerbi-install-business-central-apps.md#get-the-latest-data-refresh-the-semantic-model).

## My semantic model does not refresh. How do I see what is wrong?

[!INCLUDE [powerbi-refresh-tsg-include](includes/powerbi-refresh-tsg-include.md)]

# Finding pages and information with Tell Me

This article describes how the in-product search, *Tell me what you want to do*, can help you: 

* Quickly go to things like actions, pages, or reports.
* Search for specific data, either on a list page or in all of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].
* Find [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] documentation about a subject you're interested in.

<!-- ![!VIDEO https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2086048] -->

When you need help with finding something, use the ![Tell me what you want to do.](media/ui-search/search.png "Search for Page or Report") **Search** icon to search for it. You can also use <kbd>ALT</kbd>+<kbd>Q</kbd> to start a search.

When you start typing characters on the **Tell me what you want to do** page, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] immediately displays matches. Results in the list change as you type more characters. If you notice that when you enter the word *product* and the results include *items*, that's because search uses synonyms and alternate search terms to make it easier to find actions, pages, and reports.

The column to the right indicates the general category of the result. For example, whether it opens a list page or is an administrative task.  

At the bottom of the **Tell me what you want to do** page, the **exploring pages and reports** action opens a feature overview that shows you all available features for your role or for all roles. Learn more at [Finding Pages with the Role Explorer](ui-role-explorer.md).

> [!TIP]  
> If you prefer to use your keyboard, use the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key and <kbd>Arrow</kbd> keys to choose an item in the results. If you select the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key on your keyboard without choosing a result, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] opens the result that is listed first.

The **Tell me what you want to do** page categorizes results based on the data that you enter and the page you're working on. The following sections describe the categories.

## Find an action on the current page

The **On current page** section lets you find actions on the page you have open. For example, if the **Sales Quote** page is open and you type "customer," the section includes an action that opens the Customer Card page for the customer chosen on the sales quote.

> [!NOTE]  
> The list includes only actions that are available on the navigation bar at the top of the page. Actions on FastTabs aren't included.  

## Find a page or a task

The results in the **Go to Pages and Tasks** section provide access to other pages and let you perform tasks or look up information. If you use these pages often, you can choose the bookmark icon to add a link to any page onto your Role Center. Learn more in [Add a Page Action to Your Role Center](ui-bookmarks.md).

The pages and tasks that are listed depend on the user experience you chose for your company. The **Essentials** experience gives access to fewer pages and tasks than the **Premium** experience does. The first time you sign in, you use the **Essentials** experience. Learn more about user experiences in [Customizing Your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Experience](ui-experiences.md).

## Find a report or archived information

The **Go to Reports and Analysis** section offers access to reporting tools. For example, you can open the **Balance Sheet** report from the list, or access archived documents and other information.  

## Find a record or search the documentation

The **Search for \<keyword\>** section [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers a couple of ways to search:

* Use the **Search company data** action to search all pages in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Learn more about how the company data search works in [Search for a record in company data](ui-search-data.md).
* Use the **Search Help** action to find an article in the Business Central documentation that contains your keyword.

  > [!NOTE]  
  > Your search results won't include documentation for third-party extensions.

### Use Tell me what you want to do

Use the ![Tell me what you want to do.](media/ui-search/search.png "Search for Page or Report") **Search** icon to search for data across [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For example, you can find a customer by entering their name or address, or even find a specific record, such as a sales order. You can also use it to find information in our documentation.

Just enter at least three characters of a keyword, and then choose either **Search company data** or **Search Help**.

* If you search for data, results display on the **Search in company data** page, where they're sorted by type.  
* If you search in our Help, the **Help** pane offers links to articles that contain your keywords. You'll also get a snippet from the article that can help you decide whether it's what you're interested in.

> [!NOTE]
> For data, searching everything in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] might take time. To speed up results, use the **Show tables to search** action to choose the tables and fields that you want to include in your searches. The tables and fields that you can choose from vary, depending on your Role Center. By default, all tables and fields are chosen, which can slow down the search. We recommend that you exclude as many tables and fields as you can.

[!INCLUDE [ui-how-search-works](includes/ui-how-search-works.md)]

## Get more functionality from apps

Our partner community is busily developing apps that add capabilities to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The **Get from Microsoft AppSource** section lists apps for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] that are available on Microsoft AppSource and are related to the keyword you searched for.

## Use search on list pages

It isn't related to Tell me what you want to do, but there's another way to search for specific data. When you're using a list page, you can use the ![Search list](media/ui-search/search-list.png "Search list icon") **Search** field in the left corner of list page headers to search for data on the page. The search applies only to the list you're viewing. Learn more about working with data on list pages in [Sorting, Searching, and Filtering Lists](ui-enter-criteria-filters.md#searching).  

> [!TIP]
> You can search for posted document lines, such as invoice lines, credit memo lines, shipment lines, and receipt lines. Search for the type of document lines that you want to find, and then bookmark the links to the documents on your home page for easy access to the original or a filtered view. Learn more in [Add a Page Action to Your Role Center](ui-bookmarks.md).

## Questions?

We've shown search to a range of stakeholders, noted the questions that they had in common, and turned our notes into a list of frequently asked questions. If you're interested, go to [Tell Me FAQ](ui-search-faq.md).

title: Overview of tasks to manage receivables
description: This article outlines tasks to manage receivables and apply payments to customer or vendor ledger entries.

# Managing receivables

A regular step in any financial rhythm is to reconcile bank accounts. To close sales invoices and purchase credit memos as paid, you apply incoming payments to customer or vendor ledger entries.

While most customers in B2B environments pay some time after delivery, leaving the posted sales invoices open for the Accounts Receivable department to close (apply) when payment is received, some sales invoices can be paid immediately, for example with PayPal. Such invoices are immediately applied as paid when they're posted and, therefore, don't appear as payments to be processes in AR. For more information, see, for example, [Invoice Sales](sales-how-invoice-sales.md).  

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], one of the fastest ways to register payments is with the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page by importing a bank statement file or feed. The payments are applied to open customer or vendor ledger entries based on data matches between payment text and entry information. You can review and change the matches before you post the journal, and close bank account ledger entries for ledger entries when you post the journal. The bank account is reconciled when all payments are applied.

Other pages exist where you can either apply payments or reconcile bank accounts:

* The **Bank Account Reconciliations** page, where you reconcile bank accounts by matching imported bank statement lines with your system bank account ledger entries. Here, you can also reconcile check payments. For more information, see [Reconcile Bank Accounts](bank-how-reconcile-bank-accounts-separately.md). Here, you can't apply payments.
* The **Payment Registration** page, where you can manually apply payments received as cash, check, or bank transaction against a generated list of unpaid sales documents. This functionality is available only for sales documents. Here, you can't apply outgoing payments, and you can't reconcile bank accounts.
* The **Cash Receipt Journal** page, where you manually post receipts to the relevant general ledger, customer, or other account by entering a payment line. You can either apply the receipt or refund to one or more open entries before you post the cash receipt journal, or from the customer ledger entries. Here, you can't reconcile bank accounts.

The **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page uses automatic matching logic that you can set up on the **Payment Application Rules** page. For more information, see [Set Up Rules for Automatic Application of Payments](receivables-how-set-up-payment-application-rules.md).  

Other aspects of managing receivables include to collect outstanding balances, including finance charges and reminders, and to set bank accounts up to allow customers' payments to be withdrawn from their account automatically.

title: Status Field on Documents
description: Learn about the 'Open' and 'Released' status on quote, order, or credit memo documents.

# Status Field on Documents

When you create a quote, order, or credit memo, the **Status** field on the document header contains the status **Open** by default.

After you've filled in the document, you can release it, and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] changes the value in the **Status** field to **Released**. This status indicates that the order is ready for the next stage of processing before it's posted.

| Status | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| Open   | You can make changes to the document. |
| Released | The document has been released to the next stage of processing, and you can't make changes to lines of type *Item* and *Fixed Asset*.<br /><br />You can reopen a released document if you want to make changes to its contents. To move the adjusted document to the next stage of processing, you must once again release the document. |
| Pending Approval   | The document is waiting to be approved. |
| Pending Prepayment | A prepayment invoice has been posted for the document. |

## Release process

You can use the release process in different ways to ease your normal workflow, for example, to follow company procedures about approvals or to start warehouse activities.

### Approval procedures

Your company can use the release procedure to indicate that another user has approved the document or that an external contact can meet the specifications of the document, as shown in these examples:

* You can only release a purchase order when your vendor has indicated that they're prepared to fulfill the order.
* You create an order and a second user must approve it, perhaps for security reasons, before you're allowed to release it.
* The manager responsible for approving all refunds must release a credit memo that you've created.

Learn more about approval workflows at [Use Workflows](across-use-workflows.md).

### Warehouse activities

If the order status is **Open**, the warehouse won't begin to prepare the shipment, and doesn't expect to receive the items on a purchase order. When you release the order, you indicate that the order is complete, and that the warehouse can include it in its activities.

## Reopen a released order

You can make changes to a released order by reopening it. However, you can only increase the quantity of the lines already processed by the warehouse.

When you make the changes and release the order again, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] recalculates the value-added tax (VAT) and the invoice discount.

If you make changes to a released order, you must notify the warehouse about the changes.

> [!NOTE]
> If you want to post a single open order or credit memo without releasing it first, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will automatically release the document when you post it. If you post your orders or credit memos by using the **Post Batch** function, you can choose to post only the orders or credit memos that you've released.

# Set up Email Printers

This article explains how to set up email-enabled printers in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. With these printers, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] sends print jobs to the printer using the printer's email address.

> [!TIP]
> To learn about other printer possibilities, go to [Printer Management Overview](admin-printer-setup-overview.md). 

## Prerequisites

- [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] 2020 release wave 1 or later
- **Send to Email Printer** extension is installed

    This extension is installed by default. Learn more about installing extensions at [Installing and Uninstalling Extensions in Business Central](ui-extensions-install-uninstall.md).
- Email functionality is set up.

   Learn more at [Set Up Email](admin-how-setup-email.md).

## Add an email printer

The **Printer Management** page shows you the printers currently set up. The page also enables you to access the **Settings** page for each printer to edit an existing setup or set up a new printer.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Printer Management**, then select the related link.
2. Select **Email Print**, then choose **Add an email printer**.
3. On the **Email Printer Settings** page, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

    > [!NOTE]
    > You must manually select the appropriate paper size for a printer as no local printer or user settings can be stored.
    >
    > Be aware that the Email Printer extension is set to **A4** paper size by default, which isn't suited in North America, for example.

## Privacy Notice

If you use the Email Printer extension, all or some print jobs are sent to the email address configured for the printer. We strongly recommend that a unique email ID is tied to a printer device using only the official services provided by the hardware manufacturer, such as HP ePrint, KonicaMinolta EveryonePrint, or Epson Email Print.

Take all necessary privacy precautions, including ensuring that the email printing solution has properly configured permissions, privacy settings, and retention policies. It is your responsibility to provide a correct, verified, and operational email address. Learn more at [Microsoft Privacy Statement](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=521839)<!--(https://privacy.microsoft.com/privacystatement)-->.

# Record special sales prices and discounts

> [!NOTE]
> 2020 release wave 2 introduced new, streamlined processes for setting up and managing prices and discounts. If you're a new customer using the latest version, you're using the new experience. If you're an existing customer, whether you are using the new experience depends on whether your administrator has enabled the **New sales pricing experience** feature update in **Feature Management**. Learn more at [Enabling Upcoming Features Ahead of Time](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/feature-management) in the administration content.

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports various pricing strategies, such as:

* One-price-fits-all models where an item is always sold at the same price.
* Special price agreements with specific customers, or groups of customers.
* Campaigns when a sale meets the criteria for a special offer. For example, you might have the following criteria for an order:

  * It meets a minimum quantity
  * It's before a certain date
  * It includes a certain type of item  

To use a basic pricing model, you only need to specify a unit price when you set up an item or resource. That price will always be used on sales documents. For more advanced models, for example, when you want to offer special prices for a sales campaign, you can specify criteria on the **Sales Prices** page. You can offer special prices based on a combination of the following information:  

* Customer
* Item
* Unit of measure
* Minimum quantity
* Dates that define the period for which the prices are valid.

After you set up special prices, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can calculate best prices on sales and purchase documents, and on lines on projects and item journals. Learn more at [Best Price Calculation](sales-how-record-sales-price-discount-payment-agreements.md#best-price-calculation).

For sales discounts, you can set up two types:

| Discount Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Sales Line Discount** |Add an amount on sales lines that have a certain combination of customer, item, minimum quantity, unit of measure, or starting and ending date. This type works in the same way as for sales prices. |
| **Invoice Discount** |A discount percentage that is subtracted from the sales document total if the sum of all lines on the document exceeds a certain minimum. |

> [!TIP]  
> If an item should never be sold with a discount, leave the discount fields on the item page empty, and do not include the item in any line discount setups.

## To set up a sales price for a customer

These steps differ, depending on whether your administrator has turned on the **New sales pricing experience** feature update. If the feature update isn't turned on, follow the steps on the Current Experience tab. 

#### [Current experience](#tab/current-experience/)

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customers**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the customer, and then choose the **Prices** action.
3. Fill in the fields on the line as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)] Fill a line for each combination that will grant a special sales price to the customer.

#### [New experience](#tab/new-experience/)  

By default, the status of new price lists is **Draft**. Draft price lists aren't included in price calculations. When you're done adding lines and want to start using the prices, change the status to **Active**.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customers**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the customer, and then choose the **Sales Price Lists** action. 
3. Choose **New** to create a new sales price list.
4. On the **General** and **Tax** FastTabs, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
5. To add items to the list, do one of the following steps:
   * To add many items, choose **Suggest Lines**, and then enter filter criteria to specify the types of items to add. Optionally, you can enter other settings for the items that are specific to the price list. You can change these settings later if needed.
   * To copy items from another price list, choose **Copy Lines**, and then choose the price list to copy.
   * To add items manually, in the grid, in the **Product Type** field, choose the type of product that the price list is for. Depending on your selection, fill in the remaining fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
6. To start using the price list, in the **Status** field, choose **Active**.  

---

## Using sales and purchase price lists

> [!NOTE]
> Using price lists requires that your administrator has enabled the **New sales pricing experience** feature update in **Feature Management**. Learn more at [Enabling Upcoming Features Ahead of Time](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/feature-management) in the administration content.

Most of the new sales pricing experience is similar to the current experience, but there are a few differences. Those differences are described in the following sections.

The **Applies-to Type** and **Applies-to No.** fields let you choose what a price list will apply to, such as customer or customer price group. Using **View Columns for**, you can show or hide columns relevant for setting prices, discounts, or prices and discounts.

### Converting existing prices when you turn on the pricing feature update

When you enable the **New sales pricing experience** feature update on the **Feature Management** page, the **Feature Data Update** guide opens. Use the **Use default prices** toggle as follows:

* If you want to work with all prices on a single page, turn it on. Existing prices will be converted to one default price list for each of the following documents:

  * Sales
  * Purchases
  * Job sales
  * Job purchases

  You can edit all prices for these areas on the **Prices Worksheet** page. The default price lists will be set on the **Sales & Receivables Setup**, **Purchases & Payables Setup,** and **Projects Setup** pages.

> [!NOTE]
> If prices are set only on item or resource cards, default price lists will not be filled in with those prices during the data update. However, you can open any of the default price lists or the **Price Worksheet** page and use the **Suggest Lines** action to add the prices set on item or resource cards.

* To use sales price lists, turn it off. Existing prices will be converted to a new price list for each combination of the following things:

  * Customer
  * Customer group or campaign
  * Starting and ending dates
  * Currencies

If you have many combinations, you'll have many price lists.

If you've already enabled the New Pricing Experience, you can create default price lists manually or specify an existing price list as the default. To set an existing price list as default, turn on the **Allow Updating Defaults** toggle on the price list. Then, on the **Sales & Receivables Setup**, **Purchase & Payables**, or **Projects Setup** pages, set the price list as the default.

### Editing active price lists

To allow people to edit prices on active price lists for items, resources, customers, vendors, or other entities that use pricing, turn on the **Allow Editing Active Price** toggle on the **Sales & Receivables Setup** and **Purchase & Payables Setup** pages.

When the **Allow Editing Active Price** toggle is turned off, to update prices in a price list you must change the status of the price list to **Draft**, make your change, and then reactivate the price list.

The **Prices Overview** page provides an overview of all prices across price lists. You can set filters to narrow down the list of prices you may want to modify or add to. After you modify prices, you must use the **Verify Lines** action to verify the prices against other price list lines. Verifying prices helps avoid duplicates and ambiguity during price calculation.

> [!NOTE]
> When you edit a line in an active price list the status of the line becomes **Draft**, and the line will not be considered during price calculation until you use the **Verify Lines** action. After you verify the price the line's status becomes **Active** and it will be considered in price calculations.

To add new prices, on the **Prices Overview** page, use the **Add New Lines** action. The **Prices Worksheet** page opens, and you can add price lines either by suggesting them based on criteria, copying them from other price lists, or manually entering them. Afterward, you can use the **Implement Price Change** action to compare the new prices with other price lists to avoid duplicates and ambiguity during price calculation.

#### Create sales price lines based on the unit price

1. On the **Prices Worksheet** page, choose the **Suggest Lines** action.
2. On the **Price Lines - Create new** page, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

4. Choose the **Defaults** field to specify settings such as:
   * Which entities the price list will be assigned to.
   * Dates when the price is valid.
   * The currency code.
   * The amount type filter that defines the columns shown on the price list lines.
5. Choose **OK**. New lines will be added to the **Price Worksheet** page with the selected settings and the unit prices from the item cards.
6. Edit the created lines with the new unit prices or discounts. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

#### Create sales price lines based on existing price lists

1. On the **Prices Worksheet** page, choose the **Copy Lines** action.
2. On the **Price Lines - Copy existing** page, select an existing price list on the **From Price List** field.
3. On the **Price Line filter** field, define filters for the products on the selected price list.

5. Fill in the other fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
6. Choose **OK**. New lines will be added to the **Price Worksheet** page with the selected settings.
7. Edit the created lines with the new unit prices or discounts. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

## To copy sales prices

These steps differ, depending on whether your administrator has turned on the **New sales pricing experience** feature update. If the feature update isn't turned on, follow the steps on the Current Experience tab.

#### [Current experience](#tab/current-experience/)  

If you want to copy sales prices, such as an individual customer's sales prices to use for a customer price group, you must run the **Suggest Sales Price on Wksh.** batch job on the **Sales Price Worksheet** page.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Price Worksheet**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **Suggest Sales Price on Wksh.** action.  
3. On the **Sales Prices** FastTab, fill in the **Sales Type** and **Sales Code** fields with the original sales prices you want to copy.  
4. In the top section of the request page, fill in the **Sales Type** and **Sales Code** fields with the type and name you want the sales prices copied to.  
5. If you want the batch job to create new prices, select the **Create New Prices** checkbox.  
6. Choose the **OK** button to fill in the lines on the **Sales Price Worksheet** page with the suggested new prices, indicating that they're valid for the selected sales type.  

   > [!NOTE]  
   > This batch job only creates suggestions and it does not implement the suggested changes. If you are satisfied with the suggestions and want to implement them, that is insert them on the **Sales Prices** page, choose the **Implement Price Changes** action on the **Sales Price Worksheet** page.

#### [New experience](#tab/new-experience/)  

You can specify the settings that the price list will use:

* Use the settings from the header on the list you're copying.
* Use the settings from the list you're copying to. To use the settings from the price list you're copying prices to, turn on the **Use defaults from target** toggle.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Price Lists**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the price list to copy, and then choose **Copy Lines**.
3. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

   > [!NOTE]
   > You can't have two items that have the same settings but different prices. If that happens, a message will display when you activate the price list. You can choose the price to use by opening the list and deleting the incorrect price.

## To bulk update item prices

These steps differ, depending on whether your administrator has turned on the **New sales pricing experience** feature update. If the feature update isn't turned on, follow the steps on the Current Experience tab.

#### [Current experience](#tab/current-experience/)

To bulk update item prices, such as increase all prices by a percentage, you can fill in the Sales Price Worksheet page by using the following batch jobs:

* **Suggest Sales Price on Wksh.** suggests changes in one of two ways:

  * By applying an adjustment factor to existing sales prices.
  * By copying existing sales price agreements to other customers, customer price groups, or sales campaigns.

* **Suggest Item Price on Wksh.** suggests changes in one of two ways:

  * By applying an adjustment factor to existing unit prices on item cards.
  * By suggesting prices for new combinations of currency, units of measure, and so on.

  This batch job doesn't change the unit prices on items.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Price Worksheet**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **Suggest Item Price on Wksh.** action.  
3. On the **Item** FastTab, fill in the **No.** or **Inventory Posting Group** or other fields with the original item prices you want to update.  
4. In the top section of the request page, fill in the **Sales Type** and **Sales Code** with the type and name you want the sales prices copied to.
5. If you want the batch job to automatically adjust suggested item prices, enter the adjustment in the **Adjustment Factor** field. For example, you would enter 1.15 in **Adjustment Factor** for a 15% increase in item price.  
6. If you want the batch job to create new prices, turn on the **Create New Prices** toggle.  
7. Choose the **OK** button to fill in the lines on the **Sales Price Worksheet** page with the suggested new prices.
8. To implement the suggestions, use the **Implement Price Changes** action. The batch job creates suggestions but doesn't implement them. 

#### [New experience](#tab/new-experience/)

To update prices for multiple items, you must create a new price list, and then copy the lines from an existing price list. When you copy the lines you can use filters to specify what to copy, and you can specify an integer or decimal number in the **Adjustment Factor** field to increase or decrease prices. The price list must be in the **Draft** status. If needed, you can then deactivate the old price list.

> [!NOTE]
> You can't have two lines that have the same settings but different prices. If that happens, a message will display when you activate a price list. You can choose the price to use by opening the list and deleting the incorrect price.  

---

## Best price calculation

After you record special prices and line discounts for sales and purchases, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates the best price on sales and purchase documents, and on project and item journal lines.

The best price is the lowest price with the highest line discount allowed on a given date. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates best prices when it adds unit prices and the line discount percentages on document and journal lines.

> [!NOTE]  
> The following describes how the best price is calculated for sales. For purchases, the calculation is similar but is based on the available parameters. For example, item discount groups are not supported for purchasing.

1. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] checks the combination of the bill-to customer and the item and then calculates the applicable unit price and line discount percentage, using the following criteria:

    * Does the customer have a price/discount agreement, or does the customer belong to a group that does?
    * Is the item or the item discount group on the line included in any of these price/discount agreements?
    * Is the date within the starting and ending date of the price/discount agreement? For invoices and credit memos, this is the date in the **Posting Date** field on the document header. For all other documents, it's the date in the **Order Date** field on their headers.
    * Is a unit of measure code specified? If so, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] checks for prices/discounts with the same unit of measure code, and prices/discounts with no unit of measure code.

2. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] checks whether any price/discount agreements apply to information on the document or journal line. It then inserts the applicable unit price and line discount percentage using the following criteria:

    * Is there a minimum quantity requirement in the price/discount agreement that is fulfilled?
    * Is there a currency requirement in the price/discount agreement that is fulfilled? If so, the lowest price and the highest line discount for that currency are inserted, even if local currency would provide a better price. If there's no price/discount agreement for the specified currency code, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] inserts the lowest price and the highest line discount in your local currency.

If no special price can be calculated for the item on the line, then either the last direct cost or the unit price from the item card is inserted.

## Sales invoice discounts and service charges

When you use invoice discounts, the total amount on the invoice determines the size of the discount that is granted. On the **Cust. Invoice Discounts** page, you can also add a service charge to invoices over a certain amount.  

Before you can use invoice discounts with sales, you must specify certain information. You must make the following decisions:  

* Which customers will be granted this type of discount?  
* Which discount percentages you'll use?  

If you want invoice discounts to be calculated automatically, on the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page, turn on the **Calc Inv. Discount** toggle.  

You can specify whether you'll grant invoice discounts when an invoice meets certain criteria for each customer. For example, when the invoice amount is large enough. Invoice discounts can be in local currency for domestic customers, or in foreign currency for foreign customers.  

You link discount percentages to specific invoice amounts on the **Cust. Invoice Discounts** page for each customer. You can enter any number of percentages. Each customer can have their own page, or you can link several customers to the same page.  

In addition to, or instead of, a discount percentage, you can link a service charge amount to a specific invoice amount.  

> [!TIP]  
> Before you enter this information, it's a good idea to prepare an outline of the discount structure that you want to use. The structure makes it easier to determine which customers can be linked to the same invoice discount page. The fewer pages you have to set up, the faster you can enter the basic information.

For training in discounts in sales, see [Set up discounts for your customers](/training/modules/customer-discounts-dynamics-365-business-central/index).

### Calculating invoice discounts on sales

[!INCLUDE [sales-invoice-discounts](includes/sales-invoice-discounts.md)]

## To set up a sales line discount for a customer

6. In the **Line Discount %** field, specify the discount percentage.

    > [!TIP]
    > If you're editing an existing line, you can filter the lines by choosing the appropriate option in the **View Columns for** field.

    > [!NOTE]  
    > Invoice discount codes are represented by existing customer cards.

# Put items away with warehouse put-aways

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you receive items and put them away using one of four methods, as described in the following table.

|Method|Inbound Process|Require Receipts|Require Put-aways|Complexity Level (Learn more at [Warehouse Management Overview](design-details-warehouse-management.md))|  
|------------|---------------------|--------------|----------------|------------|  
|A|Post receipt and put-away from the order line|||No dedicated warehouse activity.|  
|B|Post receipt and put-away from an inventory put-away document||Turned on|Basic: Order-by-order.|  
|C|Post receipt and put-away from a warehouse receipt document|Turned on||Basic: Consolidated receive/ship posting for multiple orders.|  
|D|Post receipt from a warehouse receipt document and post put-away from a warehouse put-away document|Turned on|Turned on|Advanced|  

Learn more at [Inbound Warehouse Flow](design-details-inbound-warehouse-flow.md).

This article refers to method D in the table, and assumes that receiving has already happened. Learn more at [Receive Items](warehouse-how-receive-items.md).

When a location is set up to require warehouse put-away processing and warehouse receive processing, use warehouse put-away documents to control how items are put away. When you post a warehouse receipt, source documents such as purchase, inbound transfer, or sales return orders, are updated. The quantity received is posted to the item ledger, and the lines for the received items are sent to the put-away function in the warehouse.

Depending on the value in the **Use Put-away Worksheet** field on the **Location card**, the lines are either made available to the put-away worksheet or used to generate put-away documents immediately. Learn more at [Setting Up Warehouse Management](warehouse-setup-warehouse.md).  

In addition to the standard ways to create warehouse put-aways that this article describes, you can create put-aways from the related posted warehouse receipt. This is useful if you have deleted put-away lines, or if you decide not to use the put-away worksheet, because you can create or recreate put-away instructions from the posted receipt lines.

## Zone and bin codes

At locations that are set up to use directed put-away and pick, the following settings are required to determine the best place to put the items:  

* A put-away template is set up. Learn more at [Set Up Put-away Templates](warehouse-how-to-set-up-put-away-templates.md).  
* The weight, cubage, and special storage requirements of the item or stock-keeping unit are defined.
* The capacity, bin type, and bin ranking are defined for the bins.  

The bin ranking is used when more than one bin matches the criteria on the put-away template. If both the put-away template criteria and the bin ranking are the same for more than one bin, the bin with the highest number is selected.

## To create put-away documents in bulk with the put-away worksheet  

[!INCLUDE [edit-in-excel](includes/edit-in-excel.md)]

You can create put-away documents for multiple receipts at the same time on the **Put-away Worksheet** page.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Put-away Worksheets**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **Get Warehouse Documents** action. The **Put-away Selection** page opens.  

    The list contains all posted receipts that are ready to be put away, including those for which put-away instructions have already been created. Documents with put-away lines that have been completely put away and registered are not shown on this list.  
3. Select the documents that you want to work on. You can work on lines from several documents at the same time.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > If you select a receipt or internal put-away document for which you've already created instructions for all lines, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]] informs you that there's nothing to handle.  

4. Fill in the **Sorting Method** field to sort the lines.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > The way the lines are sorted in the worksheet doesn't automatically carry through to the put-away instruction. However, the same opportunities for sorting and bin ranking exist. You can recreate the line order you plan in the worksheet when you create the put-away instructions or sort in the put-away instructions.

5. Fill in the **Qty. to Handle** field. Choose the **Autofill Qty.to Handle** action, or fill in the fields manually.  
6. If needed, edit the lines manually. You can delete lines, for example, if some items need to be put away in a bin that's far away from the bins for the other items.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > When you delete lines they're only deleted from this worksheet. They aren't deleted from the put-away selection.  

7. Choose the **Create Put-away** action. The **Create Document** page opens, where you can add more information to the put-away you're creating.  

    * You can assign the put-away to a specific employee.  
    * You can sort the put-away instruction lines as you did in the worksheet or by bin ranking. When you sort according to bin ranking, the *Take* lines appear first, because most receipt bins have a 0 bin ranking. The *Place* lines appear last, starting with the bins with the lowest bin ranking. If you have structured your warehouse so bins of similar bin ranking are side by side, sorting lines in this way will save steps for warehouse employees.  
    * You can choose not to include the lines that [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] created when it converted a large unit of measure to smaller units of measure by selecting the **Set Breakbulk Filter** field. Learn more about breakbulk at [Enable Automatic Breaking Bulk with Directed Put-away and Pick](warehouse-enable-automatic-breaking-bulk-with-directed-put-away-and-pick.md).  
    * You can choose not to have the **Qty. to Handle** field automatically filled in on the put-away instructions.  
    * You can choose to print the document immediately.  

8. Choose **OK** to create the put-away.  

## To create a put-away from a posted receipt

If a location uses both put-away processing and receive processing and you have deleted put-away lines, or if you use directed put-away and pick and have decided not to use the put-away worksheet, you can create or recreate put-away instructions for the posted receipt lines.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Posted Warehouse Receipts**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select a posted receipt to put away.  
3. Choose the **Card** action.  

    If the **Document Status** field is blank, the receipt has not been put away at all. Otherwise, the field indicates whether the receipt is partially or completely put-away.  

4. If the receipt is partially put away or not put away at all, choose the **Create Put-away** action.  
5. Fill in the fields as necessary, and then choose **OK**.  

## To put items away

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Warehouse Put-aways**, and then choose the related link.

2. Open the warehouse put-away that's ready to handle.  
3. If your warehouse requires, enter your user ID when you start work on a put-away.  

    You can sort the put-away lines by various criteria, for example, by item, shelf number, or due date. Sorting can help optimize the put-away process, for example:

    * If the Take and Place lines for each receipt line don't immediately follow one another, and you want them to, sort the lines by selecting **Item** in the **Sorting Method** field.  
    * If bin rankings reflect the physical layout of the warehouse, use the **Bin Ranking** sorting method to organize the work by bin locations.

  > [!NOTE]  
  > Lines are sorted in ascending order by the selected criteria. If you sort by document, sorting is done first by document type based on the **Warehouse Activity Source Document** field. If you sort by ship-to, sorting is done first by destination type based on the **Warehouse Destination Type** field.

4. Perform the actions.

    If a bin code is mandatory for the locations, each receipt line becomes at least two lines in the warehouse put-away, as follows.  

    * The first line, with **Take** in the **Action Type** field, indicates where the items are located in the receiving area. You can't change the zone and bin on this line.  
    * The next line, with **Place** in the **Action Type** field, shows where you must place the items in the warehouse. If you receive a large number of items on one receipt line, you might have to put the items away in several bins, so there's a Place line for each bin. 

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you must place the items for one line in more than one bin, for example because the designated bin is full, use the **Split Line** action on the **Lines** FastTab. The action creates a line for the remaining quantity to handle.

5. When you have placed all the items in bins as instructed, choose the **Register Put-away** action.

# Design Details: Inventory Posting

Each inventory transaction, such as a purchase receipt or a sales shipment, posts two entries of different types.  

|Entry type|Description|  
|----------|-----------|  
|Quantity|Reflects the change of quantity in inventory. This information is stored in item ledger entries.<br /><br /> Accompanied by item application entries.|  
|Value|Reflects the change of inventory value. This information is stored in value entries.<br /><br /> One or more value entries can exist for each item ledger entry or capacity ledger entry.<br /><br /> For information about capacity value entries related to the use of production or assembly resources, see [Design Details: Production Order Posting](design-details-production-order-posting.md).|  

 In relation to quantity postings, item application entries exist to link inventory increase with inventory decrease. This enables the costing engine to forward costs from increases to the related decreases and vice versa. For more information, see [Design Details: Item Application](design-details-item-application.md).  

 Item ledger entries, value entries, and item application entries are created as a result of posting an item journal line, either indirectly by posting an order line or directly in the Item Journal page.  

 At regular intervals, value entries that are created in the inventory ledger are posted to the general ledger to reconcile the two ledgers for financial control reasons. For more information, see [Design Details: Reconciliation with the General Ledger](design-details-reconciliation-with-the-general-ledger.md).  

 ![Entry flow when reconciling inventory with G/L.](media/design_details_inventory_costing_1_entry_flow.png "Entry flow when reconciling inventory with G/L")  

## Example

The following example shows how item ledger entries, value entries, and item application entries result in general ledger entries.  

 You post a purchase order as received and invoiced for 10 items with a direct unit cost of LCY 7 and an overhead rate of LCY 1. The posting date is 01-01-20. The following entries are created.  

### Item Ledger Entries (1)

|Posting Date|Entry Type|Cost Amount (Actual)|Quantity|Entry No.|  
|------------|----------|--------------------|--------|---------|  
|01-01-20|Purchase|80.00|10|1|  

### Value Entries (1)

|Posting Date|Entry Type|Cost Amount (Actual)|Item Ledger Entry No.|Entry No.|  
|------------|----------|--------------------|---------------------|---------|  
|01-01-20|Direct Cost|70.00|1|1|  
|01-01-20|Indirect Cost|10.00|1|2|  

### Item Application Entries (1)

|Entry No.|Item Ledger Entry No.|Inbound Item Entry No.|Outbound Item Entry No.|Quantity|  
|---------|---------------------|----------------------|-----------------------|--------|  
|1|1|1|0|10|  

 Next, you post a sale of 10 units of the item with a posting date of 01-15-20.  

### Item Ledger Entries (2)

|Posting Date|Entry Type|Cost Amount (Actual)|Quantity|Entry No.|  
|------------|----------|--------------------|--------|---------|

# Planning With or Without Locations

Before you start utilizing planning engine, we recommend deciding about whether or not to use locations. There are two main straightforward ways:

* demand lines always carry location codes and the system fully uses stockkeeping units, including the relevant location setup. Learn more at [Demand at location](#demand-at-location).  
* demand lines never carry location codes and the system uses the item card. See the [Demand at a "blank location"](#demand-at-blank-location) scenario below.

## Demand at location  

When the planning system detects demand at a location (a line with a location code), it will behave in different ways depending on 2 critical setup values.  

During a planning run, the system checks for the 2 setup values in sequence and plans accordingly:  

1. Does a SKU exist for the item on the demanded location?  

    If yes, then:  

    The item is planned according to planning parameters on the SKU card.  

    If no, then:  

2. Does the **Components at Location** field in the **Manufacturing Setup** page contain the demanded location code?  

    If yes, then:  

    The item is planned according to planning parameters on the item card.  

    If no, then:  

    The item is planned according to the "minimal alternative" which covers the exact demand. The planning parameters are set as: Reordering Policy = *Lot-for-Lot*, Include Inventory = *Yes*, all other planning parameters = Empty. (Items using reordering policy *Order* remain using *Order* as well as the other settings.)

> [!TIP]
> If you often plan for demand at different locations, then we recommend that you use the stockkeeping units capability and avoid demand on blank location. Learn more at [Set Up Stockkeeping Units](inventory-how-to-set-up-stockkeeping-units.md)

See variations in the [scenarios below](#scenarios).

> [!NOTE]
> The **Components at Location** field in the **Manufacturing Setup** page are very important in governing how the planning system handles production demand lines.
>
> For production demand, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will use the same location for subassembly and components as the one stated on the production order. However, by filling in this field, you can redirect the subassembly and components to another location.
>
> You can also define this for a specific SKU by selecting a different location code in the **Components at Location** field on the SKU card. Note, however, that this rarely makes sense as the planning logic may be distorted when planning for the SKU component.

## Demand at "blank location"

In general, when the planning system detects demand at a blank location (a line without a location code), the item is planned according to planning parameters on the item card.

The **Locations Mandatory** field in the **Inventory Setup** page, the **Components at Location** field in the **Manufacturing Setup** page, or stockkeeping units will affect how the planning system handles demand lines with/without location codes. If one of following statements is true, the demand on blank location is also considered a deviation and the planning system will react by outputting the "minimal alternative": The item is planned according to: Reordering Policy = *Lot-for-Lot* (*Order* remains *Order*), Include Inventory = *Yes*, all other planning parameters = Empty.

* The **Components at Location** field in the **Manufacturing Setup** page has a value.
* A stockkeeping unit exists for the planned item.
* The **Location Mandatory** field is selected.

## Scenarios

See variations in the setup scenarios below.

### Setup 1

* Location Mandatory = *Yes*  
* SKU is set up for *WEST*  
* Component at Location = *EAST*  

#### Case 1.1: Demand is at *WEST* location

The item is planned according to planning parameters on the SKU card (including possible transfer).

#### Case 1.2: Demand is at *EAST* location

The item is planned according to planning parameters on the item card.

#### Case 1.3: Demand is at *MAIN* location

The item is planned according to: Reordering Policy = *Lot-for-Lot* (*Order* remains *Order*), Include Inventory = *Yes*, all other planning parameters = Empty.

#### Case 1.4: Demand is at *BLANK* location

The item is planned according to: Reordering Policy = *Lot-for-Lot* (*Order* remains *Order*), Include Inventory = *Yes*, all other planning parameters = Empty.

### Setup 2

* Location Mandatory = *Yes*  
* No SKU exists  
* Component at Location = *EAST*  

#### Case 2.1: Demand is at *WEST* location

The item is planned according to: Reordering Policy = *Lot-for-Lot* (*Order* remains *Order*), Include Inventory = *Yes*, all other planning parameters = Empty.

#### Case 2.2: Demand is at *EAST* location

The item is planned according to planning parameters on the item card.  

### Setup 3

* Location Mandatory = *No*  
* No SKU exists  
* Component at Location = *EAST*  

#### Case 3.1: Demand is at *WEST* location

The item is planned according to: Reordering Policy = *Lot-for-Lot* (*Order* remains *Order*), Include Inventory = *Yes*, all other planning parameters = Empty.

#### Case 3.2: Demand is at *EAST* location

The item is planned according to planning parameters on the item card.  

#### Case 3.3: Demand is at *BLANK* location

The item is planned according to: Reordering Policy = *Lot-for-Lot* (*Order* remains *Order*), Include Inventory = *Yes*, all other planning parameters = Empty.

### Setup 4

* Location Mandatory = *No*  
* No SKU exists  
* Component at Location = *BLANK*  

#### Case 4.1: Demand is at *EAST* location

The item is planned according to: Reordering Policy = *Lot-for-Lot* (*Order* remains *Order*), Include Inventory = *Yes*, all other planning parameters = Empty.

#### Case 4.2: Demand is at *BLANK* location

The item is planned according to planning parameters on the item card.

As you can see from the last scenario, the only way to get a correct result for a demand line without a location code is to disable all setup values relating to locations. Similarly, the only way to get stable planning results for demand at locations is to use stockkeeping units.  

Therefore, if you often plan for demand at locations, then we recommend that you use the Stockkeeping Units capability.

# Allocated Time (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Allocated Time** report gives an overview of the allocated time, in hours, for each work center. The view of allocated hours can help you identify over and underused work centers. Additionally, the report includes indicators such as the load percentage, allocated time (hours), and capacity available (hours) for a quick summary of resource use.

:::image type="content" source="media/manufacturing/allocated-hours-v26.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Allocated Hours Power BI Report" lightbox="media/manufacturing/allocated-hours-v26.png":::

## Use the report

Manufacturing managers use the report to plan and allocate resources effectively. The data shows which work centers are over or underutilized, so you can make informed decisions about how to allocate resources.

For example, if you notice that a work center is underused, you can assign more work orders to that center to optimize the use of its resources. Conversely, if a work center is over utilized, you can reallocate work orders or consider adding more resources to that work center.

Manufacturing workers use this report to optimize the use of resources. You can analyze the allocated time in hours of each work center, and then plan your work accordingly.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The *Allocated Hours* report includes the following KPIs and measures:

# FAQ for bank account reconciliation assist with Copilot

These frequently asked questions (FAQ) describe the AI impact of Microsoft Copilot assistance with bank account reconciliation in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## What is bank reconciliation assist?

Bank reconciliation is a common accounting task where organizations review their bank account statements to identify transactions that should be registered in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For example, this task is used to identify periodic bank fees or small employee expenses.

Bank reconciliation is typically a multi-step process. First, bank statements are imported into [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Next, transactions are matched with ledger entries. Finally, new ledger entries are posted to reflect any residual transactions that weren't previously known to your ledgers.

Copilot in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] reduces the manual effort by matching more transactions and suggesting general ledger (G/L) accounts that you can post to.

## What are the capabilities of bank reconciliation assist?

Copilot provides AI-powered assistance with two distinct tasks:

- Improved matching of transactions with ledger entries

    [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers automated rules that automatically match many bank transactions with ledger entries. However, these rules are inflexible and often result in many unmatched transactions, each of which requires manual inspection and comparison. Copilot uses AI technology to inspect those unmatched transactions and identify more matches, based on the dates, amounts, and descriptions. For example, if a customer paid multiple invoices in one lump sum, Copilot reconciles the single bank statement line with the multiple invoice ledger entries.

- Suggested G/L accounts

    For residual bank transactions that can't be matched to any ledger entries, Copilot uses AI technology to compare the transaction description with G/L account names and then suggest the most likely G/L account to post to. For example, if unmatched transactions have the narrative *Fuel Stop 24*, Copilot might suggest that you post them to the *Transportation* account.

Copilot doesn't connect to your bank to retrieve or send transactions. This task remains fully within your control. It's a prerequisite for using Copilot's assistance, regardless of whether the transactions are added to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] by using a digital bank connection, imported from a bank statement file, or manually entered.

## What is the intended use of bank reconciliation assist?

Bank account reconciliation assist is designed to improve the accuracy of ledgers by helping customers identify new transactions that they should account for in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. It isn't intended for fraud detection or to identify whether customers paid on time.

## How was bank reconciliation assist evaluated? What metrics are used to measure performance?

Bank account reconciliation assist was tested by using combinations of synthetic bank transaction data and similar G/L accounts and ledger entries that cover the typical variations and data limits for each field and in different languages. Test data represents both typical usage and usage by bad actors. Performance was measured in comparison to manual reconciliation of the same data.

## What are the limitations of bank reconciliation assist? How can users minimize the impact of these limitations when they use the system?

Bank account reconciliation assist performs best when G/L account names, ledger entry descriptions, and bank transaction descriptions are all in the same language. Mixed languages or mixed languages for transaction descriptions often result in fewer matches and suggestions.

Suggested ledger accounts performs best in one of the supported languages (see the next section for a list of languages). Users might experience fewer transaction matches and fewer suggested ledger accounts in other languages.

## In which geographies and languages is bank reconciliation assist available? 

[!INCLUDE[copilot-geo-and-language-availability](includes/copilot-geo-and-language-availability.md)]

## What is expected of system users when they operate bank account reconciliation assist?

### During bank account reconciliation

AI-powered matches and suggestions might sometimes be incorrect or incomplete. Users of bank account reconciliation assist must review the accuracy of the matches and suggestions that Copilot provides before they choose to keep them. Copilot's matches and suggestions aren't saved to the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] database until you select the **Keep it** button and close the Copilot window. You can edit and correct any matches or suggestions before you choose to keep them.

### After bank account reconciliation is completed

We recommend that users also verify accuracy and correct any discrepancies after they close the Copilot window. This process should include the following activities:

- Review the reconciliation test report.
- Ensure that your organization has the appropriate review and audit processes in place.
- Reopen any posted reconciliations by using the **Undo** function.
- Correct any erroneous ledger entries through reverse posting of entries.

## What is expected of administrators and system users when they operate bank account reconciliation assist?

System users, such as accountants, treasurers, or other people who work on business accounting, should always review the accuracy of matches and suggestions that Copilot provides before they choose to keep them. After reconciliation with Copilot, we recommend that these users review the reconciliation test report to verify accuracy and identify any discrepancies.

Administrators should ensure that the appropriate accounting users are granted access to this capability.

## Is Copilot the only means of completing bank account reconciliation?

No. Use of Copilot is optional. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers traditional, non-AI-powered means of importing bank statements, running predefined matching rules, and manually applying matches and posting to appropriate ledger accounts. Both the traditional approach and Copilot can be used simultaneously in an organization.

## How do I give feedback about AI-generated content?

Each time that Copilot provides matches or suggestions, you can provide feedback to Microsoft directly from the Copilot window by using the like (thumbs up) and dislike (thumbs down) controls. Your feedback remains anonymous, and we use this data to improve the quality of the service.

# The Payments and Reconciliations (DK) Extension

Make fast, error-free payments by exporting files that are formatted specifically for exchanges with your vendor or bank. These files speed up the payment and reconciliation processes, and eliminate errors that can happen when you manually enter the information on a bank website.  

This extension supports file formats for several Danish banks. When you export payment information to a file, the extension packages the data into the format that your bank requires. For example, the formats include Bankdata-V3, BEC, SDC, and FIK, which many different banks use, and some that are more specialized for certain banks, for example, Danske Bank and Nordea. The extension also includes some formats for importing and reconciling bank statements.  

> [!Note]
> To use the extension, you must know the format that your bank or vendor requires. Some banks or vendors provide this information on their websites; however, you might need to contact their customer service to get the information.  

## Supported Bank Formats
This extension can apply the following file formats for payment files:  

* BANKDATA-V3  
* BEC-INDLAND  
* BEC-CSV  
* DANSKEBANK-CMKV  
* DANSKEBANK-CMKXKSX  
* DANSKEBANK  
* FIK71  
* NORDEA-ERHVERV-CSV  
* NORDEA  
* NORDEA-UNITEL-V3  
* SDC  
* SDC-CSV  

## To set up the extension

There are a few steps to get started.  

* Allow payment data exports. To help protect your data, this is not readily available.  
* Set up purchase and payables so that you do not require external document numbers on invoices. If needed, you can use the reference number to refer to a specific invoice.  
* Specify the payment method for each vendor. Payment methods define how you pay invoices from the vendor. For example, Bank, Cash, Check, or Account.  
* Specify the type of format to use for each of your bank accounts. For example, NORDEA, DANSKEBANK, SDC, and so on.  

Additionally, you must assign vendors to a domestic **Gen. Bus. Posting Group** and a **Vendor Posting Group**. The Country/Region setting for the vendor must be Denmark (DK). For more information, see [Setting Up Posting Groups](finance-posting-groups.md).  

### To allow [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to export payment data

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Payment Journal**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Edit Payment Journal** page, choose the **Bank** batch.  
3. Choose the **Allow Payment Export** check box.

# About item types

In the **Type** field on the **Item Card** page, you can select what the item is used for in your business, which affects the degree to which you can manage the item in inventory. The following table lists and describes the three types of items that are available.

|Option|Typical Purpose|
|------|-----------|
|Inventory|Physical things, such as bicycles, telephones, and desks, for which you want to be able to use all inventory processes. Inventory items can also include nonphysical items, such as software licenses and subscriptions, if the items have identification numbers, such as serial numbers. You can fully track item values and availability in inventory.|
|Non-Inventory|Typically, noninventory items are physical things, such as bolts or pens, that your business consumes but doesn't fully track in inventory. For example, because they're low-cost items and only used internally.|
|Service|A labor time unit, such as a consultancy hour, for limited business support.|

> [!NOTE]
> The **Service** and **Non-Inventory** types don't let you track inventory quantities and values. Only selected item transaction types and features are supported. The following table lists the features that the three item types support.

|Item Type|Sales|Purchasing|Job Consumption|Service Consumption|Assembly Consumption|Production Consumption|Assembly Output|Production Output|Location Transfer|Physical Counting|Inventory Revaluation|Inventory Costing|Item Tracking|Reservation|Warehousing|Planning|Order Planning|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|Inventory|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|
|Non-Inventory|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|No|No|No|No|No|No|No|No|No|No|Yes|
|Service|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|No|No|No|No|No|No|No|No|No|No|No|No|Yes|

## Costing methods for types of items

When you post inventory transactions, the quantity and value changes to the inventory are recorded in the item ledger entries and the value entries, respectively.

You record the cost of inventory items in the **Cost Amount (Actual)** field on the **Value Entries** page. When you reconcile the entry to the general ledger, the cost shows in the **Cost Posted to G/L** field. To learn more about inventory costing, go to [Design Details: Inventory Costing](design-details-inventory-costing.md).

For noninventory and service items, cost is recorded in the **Cost Amount (Non-Invtbl.)** field on the **Value Entries** page. For noninventory and service items, specify cost on sales, assembly, and production documents and journals. Specify the default cost in the **Unit Cost** field on the **Item Card** and **Stockkeeping Unit** pages. Costs for these types of items aren't reconciled to the general ledger.

## Catalog and service items

You can set up items that you offer to your customers but you don't manage in until you sell them as catalog items. Although catalog items are similar to regular items of the type **Non-Inventory** in this respect, don't confuse the two because there are differences. To learn more, go to [Work with Catalog Items](inventory-how-work-nonstock-items.md).

Customer items that you service, such as a printer, are called service items. Service items have nothing to do with regular or catalog items. However, service components can be regular items. To learn more, go to [Set Up Service Items and Service Item Components](service-how-setup-service-items.md).

## Resources

In addition to the item type *Item*, sales and purchase documents also allow you to use the item type *Resource*. Like items, resources support dimensions, price lists, and units of measure. <!--With introduction of types *Service* and *Non-Inventory* we do not have any intention to add any extra capabilities for type Resource in purchase and sales processes. We recommend using items of applicable type instead. Resources will continue get new functionality to track the time and effort that is involved with performing and providing services and will stay important part of project and service management. Because many partner solutions use resources, we do not plan to deprecate them in the sales or purchase documents.-->

# Purchases by Location (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Purchases by Location** report provides an overview of purchasing activities for each warehouse location. It helps you find out which item categories and items are most frequently purchased in each location, and how much money you're spending on the purchases.

:::image type="content" source="media/purchases/purchases-by-location.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Purchases by Location Power BI report" lightbox="media/purchases/purchases-by-location.png":::

## Use the report

The report is especially useful for purchasing managers and purchasers.

Purchasing managers can use the report to analyze purchasing trends across different warehouse locations. For example, you can use the report to find the most frequently bought items and item categories in each warehouse. You and the warehousing team can gain insights into warehouses with consistently high or low purchasing activities.

Purchasers can use this report to monitor purchasing activities across warehouse locations. For example, you can find item categories and items with low quantities that require attention to prevent stock-outs or disruptions in production. Use this information to plan ahead and work with your team to ensure that you meet purchase demand across locations.

# Administration Tasks

Central administration tasks are usually performed by one role in the company. The scope of these tasks can depend on the company's size and the administrator's job responsibilities. These tasks can include managing database synchronization of job and email queues, setting up users, and customizing the user interface.  

Entering the correct setup values from the start is important to the success of any new business software. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes a number of setup guides that help you set up core data. For more information, see [Setting Up Business Central](setup.md).

> [!NOTE]
> You can use the data migration tools to migrate existing data to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online. Alternatively, you can set up a new company in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with configuration packages to shorten deployment times, improve quality of implementation, introduce a repeatable approach to implementations, and enhance productivity by automating and simplifying recurring tasks. For more information, see [Migrate On-Premises Data to Business Central Online](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/migrate-data).

You can support your setup decisions with some general recommendations for selected setup fields that are known to potentially cause the solution to be inefficient if defined incorrectly.  

A super user or an administrator can set up the Data Exchange Framework to enable users to export and import data in bank and payroll files, for example for various cash management processes. For more information, see [Exchanging Data Electronically](across-data-exchange.md).

The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the articles that describe them.

# Manage the Intercompany Inbox and Outbox

The intercompany transactions that you receive from your partners are listed on the **Intercompany Inbox** page. To learn how to process incoming intercompany transactions, go to [Process incoming intercompany transactions](#process-incoming-intercompany-transactions). The intercompany transactions that you send to partners are listed on the **Intercompany Outbox** page. To learn how to process outgoing intercompany transactions, go to [To process outgoing intercompany transactions](#to-process-outgoing-intercompany-transactions).

However, depending on your intercompany setup, some transactions are automatically handled. You can set up the source company and partner companies to automatically create documents and journals that correspond to transactions that partners post through the intercompany general journal. To learn about using intercompany journals, go to [Fill in and post an intercompany journal](intercompany-how-work-documents-journals.md#fill-in-and-post-an-intercompany-journal).  

## Organizing the Inbox  

You can use the filter fields at the top of the Inbox page to determine which transactions are shown on the page. For example, if you only want to explore transactions that a particular partner created, use the **Transaction Source** and **Intercompany Partner Code** filters.  

### Transaction source  

What you can do with a transaction depends whether it was:  

* Created by your intercompany partner  
* Rejected by your intercompany partner and returned to you  

Use the **Show Transaction Source** field to filter the **Intercompany Inbox Transactions** page so that it displays only one of these types of transactions. You can also filter by intercompany partner, or by the contents of the **Line Action** field.  

#### Created by intercompany partner  

 When you receive a new transaction that was created by your partner, you can choose to either:

* Accept the transaction  
* Reject the transaction (return to partner)  
* Cancel the transaction (delete the transaction and don't return it to your partner)  

#### Returned from intercompany partner  

If your intercompany partner rejects a transaction, you must cancel the transaction in the inbox and then create correction lines or reverse the journal or document.  

## Recreating inbox entries  

If you accepted a transaction in your inbox but then deleted the document or journal instead of posting it, you can re-create the inbox entry and accept it again.  

## Get an overview of intercompany transactions for a period  

You can get an overview of all of the intercompany transactions that you have sent and received in a period. The **Intercompany Transactions** report lists all intercompany G/L entries, customer ledger entries, and vendor ledger entries.

> [!NOTE]  
> If the intercompany partners are in the same database, the partners can automatically accept transactions. The go directly to the **Handled Intercompany Inbox Transactions** and **Handled Intercompany Outbox Transactions** pages. To learn more about auto-accepting transactions, go to [Auto-accept transactions from intercompany partners](intercompany-how-setup.md#autoaccept-transactions-from-intercompany-partners).  
>
> * For the synchronization partner, on the **Intercompany Setup** page, turn on the **Auto. Send Transactions** toggle.
> * For partner companies, on the **Intercompany Partner** page, turn on the **Auto. Accept Transactions** toggle.  

## Import intercompany transactions from a file

[!INCLUDE [onprem_only_md](includes/onprem_only_md.md)]

If you have an intercompany partner that is not in the same database as your company, you can receive intercompany transactions from that partner in an .xml file. Then you must import the transactions into your inbox.  

1. Save the file to the location that you specified in the **Intercompany Inbox Details** field when you set up intercompany.  
2. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Intercompany Inbox Transactions**, and then choose the related link.
3. On the **Intercompany Inbox Transactions** page, choose the **Import Transaction File** action.  
4. on the page that appears, select the .xml file that contains the transactions, and then choose the **Open** button.  

The transactions are imported into the inbox and you can now process them.

## Process incoming intercompany transactions (using the inbox) 

When your intercompany partners send you intercompany transactions, the transactions end up in your intercompany inbox. You must evaluate each transaction in your inbox and act on it.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Intercompany Inbox Transactions**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Intercompany Inbox Transactions** page, select a line, and then choose an action, such as **Accept**, to process the line.
3. On the **Complete IC Inbox Action** page, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
4. Choose the **OK** button.  

For lines that you accept, document or journal lines are created in your company. Open each document or journal, make any necessary changes, and then post them.  

Lines that you reject and return to your partner go to your intercompany outbox, where you can send them to your partner.

For lines that a partner rejected and returned to you, you must post a correction to the original transaction that you posted in your company.

## To process outgoing intercompany transactions (using the outbox) 

When you post an intercompany journal or document, or send an intercompany order confirmation, the transactions go to your intercompany outbox. To send them to your intercompany partners, open the outbox and process them.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Intercompany Outbox Transactions**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Intercompany Outbox Transactions** page, select a line, and then choose an action, such as **Return to Inbox**, to process the line.

Use the **Send to Intercompany Partner** action to send lines to the relevant partner's inbox.

Use the **Return to Inbox** action to move lines to your inbox, where you can then accept them to create documents or journal lines in your company.  

If you use the **Cancel** action, you must post a correction to the transaction that you originally posted in your company.  

## Recreate intercompany inbox or outbox transactions  

You might want to re-create a transaction in the inbox or outbox. For example, if you accepted a transaction in your inbox but then deleted the document or journal instead of posting it, you can re-create the inbox entry and accept it again.  

The following procedure describes to re-create inbox transactions, but the same steps also apply to the outbox.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Handled IC Inbox Transactions**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Handled IC Inbox Transactions** page, select the line with the transaction that you want to re-create in the inbox, and then choose the **Re-create Inbox Transaction** action.

# Finding pages and reports with the role explorer

You can get an overview of the pages and reports that make up the features that people your business role often use. You can also explore what's available for other roles. This article refers to the overview of pages and reports as the *role explorer*.

In addition to the overview, the role explorer provides actions that open pages or reports, for example, so you can explore the information that the page or report includes. You can also use the role explorer as a way to get around in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

[!INCLUDE [about-ui-learn](includes/about-ui-learn.md)]

## Open the role explorer

You can open the role explorer from role centers, list pages, and the **Tell Me** window.

- On your role center or any list page, choose the ![Menu button.](media/ui_menu_button.png "Menu button") button, or select <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>F12</kbd>.
- In the **Tell Me** window, choose the **exploring pages** action.

## Open the role explorer filtered to show reports

You can open the role explorer in a filtered view that only shows reports:

- On your role center or any list page, choose the **All Reports** action.
- In the **Tell Me** window, choose the **exploring reports** action.

## Open pages and reports

The actions that open pages or reports are organized under nodes that are named after application areas. You can collapse or expand each node individually, or all nodes together.

> [!NOTE]
> You can only access roles that are set up to show in the role explorer. If a role isn't available, it probably isn't set up to show. To learn more, go to [Manage Profiles](admin-users-profiles-roles.md).

When you explore other roles, you can also narrow down your exploration by using the **Report & Analysis** and **Administration** actions.

- **Report & Analysis** filters the role explorer to show only reports and analysis features.
- **Administration** filters the role explorer to show only pages for administrative tasks, such as pages related to how you set up your [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

> [!TIP]
> For developers, you categorize pages and reports by setting the [UsageCategory property](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/properties/devenv-usagecategory-property) in the object's AL code.

# Understand the general ledger and Chart of Accounts

The general ledger (G/L) stores your financial data, and the chart of accounts (COA) shows the accounts that you post general ledger entries to. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes a standard chart of accounts that's ready to support your business.

## General ledger setup and general posting setup

The setup of the general ledger is at the core of financial processes because it defines how you post data. Two pages in particular play an important part in configuring your finance processes:  

* **General Ledger Setup**
* **General Posting Setup**

### The **General Ledger Setup** page

Use the **General Ledger Setup** page to specify how to handle certain accounting issues in your company, such as:  

* Invoice rounding details  
* Address formats  
* Financial reporting

> [!TIP]
> The **General Ledger Setup** page includes generic fields, and fields that are particular to your country or region. If you're unsure of the meaning of a field, we suggest you work with your accountant to determine whether it's relevant to your organization. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  

To open the page now, use the following link [General Ledger Setup](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=118).

### The **General Posting Setup** page

Use the **General Posting Setup** page to set up combinations of general business and general product posting groups. Posting groups map entities such as customers, vendors, items, resources, and sales and purchase documents to general ledger accounts. You fill in a line for each combination of business posting group and product posting group. But you can also open each line in its own posting setup card. Learn more at [Posting Group Setups](finance-posting-groups.md).  

> [!TIP]
> If you can't see the fields you're looking for in the **General Posting Setup** page, use the horizontal scroll bar at the bottom of the page to scroll to the right.  

To open the page now, use the following link [General Posting Setup](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=314).

## The chart of accounts

The **Chart of Accounts** page shows all general ledger accounts. From the chart of accounts, you can do things like:  

* View reports that show general ledger entries and balances.  
* Close your income statement.  
* Open the general ledger (G/L) account card to add or change settings.  
* See a list of posting groups for that account.
* View separate debit and credit balances for a single account.

To learn more, go to [Understanding the Chart of Accounts](finance-chart-of-accounts.md).

## Account categories

You can personalize the structure of your financial statements by mapping general ledger accounts to account categories.  

The **G/L Account Categories** page shows your categories and subcategories, and the general ledger accounts assigned to them. You can create new subcategories and assign those categories to existing accounts.  

You can create a category group by indenting other subcategories under a line on the **G/L Account Categories** page. Category groups make it easy to get an overview because each grouping shows a total balance. For example, you can create subcategories for different types of assets, then create category groups for fixed assets versus current assets.  

You can define whether specific types of reports must include the accounts in each subcategory. The account categories help define the layout of your financial statements.  

### Example

For example, the default balance statement has a subcategory for *Cash* under *Current Assets*. If you want the balance statement to consider petty cash and checking, take the following steps:

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **G/L Account Categories**, then choose the related link.
   1. Alternatively, [open the page here](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=790).
2. Choose the **Edit List** action.
3. Add two new subcategories: One for petty cash, and one for your checking account:
   1. Select the **Current Assets** category.
   2. Choose the **New** action.
   3. Enter the subcategory name on the **Description** field.
   4. On the **G/L Accounts in Category** field, select the appropriate G/L account.
   5. On the **Additional Report Definition** field, select the **Cash Accounts** option.
4. Indent them under the **Cash** subcategory.
   1. Select the subcategory created in step 3.
   2. Choose the **Indent** action.
   3. Choose the **Move Down** action.
   4. Choose the **Indent** action to indent under the **Cash** subcategory.

When you choose the **Generate Financial Reports** action, or the next time the report is generated, your balance statement shows the following lines:

* Total balance for cash.
* Lines with balances for petty cash and the checking account.  

> [!NOTE]
> If you create a G/L account without assigning an account category, when you assign the account to a posting group [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically assigns the account category from the G/L account immediately above the account in your chart of accounts. However, to include the new account in your financial reports, you must choose the **Generate Financial Reports** action on the **G/L Account Categories** page. Alternatively, open the G/L Account Card page, specify the account category, and then regenerate your financial report.

## Access to create and edit G/L accounts and account categories

In a small organization, such as the CRONUS demonstration company, most users can edit financial entities such as G/L accounts, account categories, and the chart of accounts, except those users with a TEAM MEMBER license. However, larger organizations typically use roles and permissions to limit access to editing these entities. If you're an administrator, or have the *Business Manager* or *Accountant* role, you can control user permissions to give the right people access to the relevant tables. To learn more, go to [Get an overview of a user's permissions](ui-define-granular-permissions.md#get-an-overview-of-a-users-permissions).  

## Use dimensions to simplify your chart of accounts

Dimensions are values that categorize entries so you can track and analyze them on documents, such as sales orders. Dimensions can, for example, indicate the project or department an entry came from. So, instead of setting up separate general ledger accounts for each department and project, you can use dimensions as a basis for analysis and avoid having to create a complicated chart of accounts.

To learn more about dimensions, go to [Set up default dimensions for customers, vendors, and other accounts](finance-dimensions.md#to-set-up-default-dimensions-for-customers-vendors-and-other-accounts).

# Moving Averages (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Moving Averages** report provides a comprehensive overview of your average purchases over a 30-day period. This report focuses on the purchase amount and compares the current purchase amount to a 30-day average. The comparison lets you quickly identify deviations from the norm. Use this information to address issues and ensure that purchasing activities align with business operations and profitability.

:::image type="content" source="media/purchases/purchases-moving-averages.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Moving Averages Power BI report" lightbox="media/purchases/purchases-moving-averages.png":::

## Use the report

The report helps management teams find key trends and make changes based on average purchase metrics.

CEOs need to track the moving average of purchase amounts over a specific period. Use this report to see performance trends and get help to make short term strategic decisions based on the trends.

Purchasing managers want to know which periods have a higher demand than others to plan purchasing schedules and budget accordingly. Use the report to analyze historical data and forecast upcoming trends so you can optimize inventory levels and reduce stock-outs.

For example, you might notice that purchasing demands are often higher towards the end of the year. You can work with your team to plan ahead and allocate staff to handle workload spikes.


## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The *Moving Averages* report includes the following KPIs and measures: 

- [**Purchase Amount**](purchases-powerbi-kpis.md#purchase-amount)
- [**Purchase Amount Average 30D**](purchases-powerbi-kpis.md#purchase-amount-avg-30d-fiscal)

[!INCLUDE[click-on-a-kpi-link](includes/click-on-a-kpi-link.md)] 

[!INCLUDE[powerbi-tip-track-kpis](includes/powerbi-tip-track-kpis.md)]

## Data used in the report

The report uses data from the following tables in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]:

- Value Entry
- Purchase Line

# Walkthrough: Selling, Assembling, and Shipping Kits

To support just-in-time inventory and the ability to customize products to customer requests, assembly orders can be automatically created and linked as soon as the sales order line is created. The link between the sales demand and the assembly supply enables sales order processors to customize the assembly item and promise delivery dates according to component availability. In addition, assembly consumption and output are posted automatically with the shipment of the linked sales order.  

Special functionality exists to govern the shipping of assemble-to-order quantities, both in basic and in advanced warehouse configurations. When workers in charge of assembly finish assembling parts or all of the assemble-to-order quantity, they record it in the **Qty. to Ship** field on the warehouse shipment line, in advanced configurations, and then choose **Post Shipment**. The result is that the corresponding assembly output is posted, including the related component consumption, and a sales shipment for the quantity is posted for the linked sales order. This walkthrough illustrates the advanced warehouse process.  

In basic warehouse configurations, when an assemble-to-order quantity is ready to be shipped, the warehouse worker in charge posts an inventory pick for the sales order lines. This creates an inventory movement for the components, posts the assembly output, and the sales order shipment. For more information, see [Handling Assemble-to-Order Items in Inventory Picks](warehouse-how-to-pick-items-with-inventory-picks.md#handling-assemble-to-order-items-with-inventory-picks).  

## About This Walkthrough

This walkthrough demonstrates the following tasks:  

### Setting up Assembly Items

Assembly items are characterized by their replenishment system and the assembly BOM. The item's assembly policy can be either assemble-to-order (ATO) or assemble-to-stock (ATS). This section covers the following tasks:  

-   Setting the appropriate replenishment system and assembly policy on a new assembly item card.  
-   Creating an assembly BOM that lists the assembly components and the resource that go into the assembly item.  

### Selling Customized Assembly Items

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides the flexibility to enter both an inventory quantity and an assemble-to-order quantity on one sales order line. This section covers the following tasks:  

-   Creating a pure ATO sales order line where the full quantity is unavailable and must be assembled before shipment.  
-   Customizing ATO items.  
-   Recalculating the unit price of a customized assembly item.  
-   Creating a mixed sales order line where parts of the sales quantity is provided from inventory and the remaining part must be assembled before shipment.  
-   Understanding ATO availability warnings.  

### Planning for Assembly Items

Assembly demand and supply are handled by the planning system, just like for purchase, transfer, and production. This section covers the following tasks:  

-   Running a regenerative plan for items with sales demand for assembled supply.  
-   Generating an assembly order to fulfill a sales line quantity by the demanded shipment date.  

### Assembling Items

Assembly orders function in a similar way as production orders, expect the consumption and output is recorded and posted directly from the order. When the items are assembled to inventory, the assembly worker has full access to all header and line fields. When the items are assembled to an order where the quantity and date are promised to the customer, then certain fields on the assembly order are not editable. In that case, the assembly posting is performed from the warehouse shipment for the linked sales order. This section covers the following tasks.  

-   Recording and posting assembly consumption and output to inventory.  
-   Accessing a warehouse shipment line from an ATO assembly order to record assembly work.  
-   Accessing an ATO assembly order from a warehouse shipment line to review the automatically entered data.  

### Shipping Assembly Items, from Stock and Assembled to Order

Special functionality exists to govern the shipping of assemble-to-order quantities. This section covers the following tasks:  

-   Creating a warehouse pick for inventory assembly items and for assembly components to be assembled before shipment.  
-   Registering warehouse picks for assembly components and then for assembly items.  
-   Accessing an assembly order from a warehouse shipment to review picked or consumed components.  
-   Shipping assemble-to-order quantities.  
-   Shipping inventory assembly items.

## Story

On January 23, Susan, the sales order processor takes an order from The Device Shop for three units of Kit B, which is an ATO item. All three units are customized and must contain the strong graphics card and an extra RAM block. The disc drives are upgraded to DWD because the CD drives are unavailable. Susan knows that the units can be assembled immediately, and leaves the suggested shipment date of January 23.  

At the same time, the customer orders fifteen units of Kit A with a special request that five units be customized to contain the strong graphics card. Although Kit A is typically an assemble-to-stock item, the order processor combines the sales line quantities to sell ten units from stock and assemble five customized units to the order. The ten units of Kit A are unavailable and must first be supplied to inventory by an assembly order according to the item's assembly policy. Susan learns from the assembly department that Kit A units cannot be completed in the current week. Susan sets the shipment date of the second sales order line, for the mixed ATO and inventory quantity, to January 27 and informs the customer that the 15 units of Kit A will be shipped four days later than the three units of Kit B. To signal to the shipping department that this sales order requires assembly processing, Susan creates the warehouse shipment document from the sales order.  

Eduardo, the planner, runs the planning worksheet and generates an assembly order for ten standard units of Kit A with an internal due date of January 27.  

Sammy, who is responsible for shipping, gets three warehouse shipment lines for the sales order: One line for the three pure ATO units, one line for the five ATO units on the mixed sales order line, and one line for the ten ATS units on the mixed sale order line. Sammy creates a warehouse pick document for all the assembly components that are needed to assemble the total of eight ATO units on the warehouse shipment document.  

John, the picker, retrieves components for all the ATO quantities on the warehouse shipment document and brings them to the assembly area. John enters the quantity to handle and registers the warehouse pick.  

Linda assembles the three ATO units of Kit B. The components are already picked, and Linda does not record output and consumption quantities or post the order, because both of these actions are performed automatically through the related warehouse shipment lines.  

Sammy records the assembled quantity on the warehouse shipment line and posts the shipment of the three units of Kit B. The first line on the sales order is updated as shipped. The linked assembly order remains open until the sales order is fully invoiced. The two warehouse shipment lines, one ATO and one ATS, for Kit A with due dates on January 27 remain open.  

On January 27, Linda processes two assembly orders for Kit A. The first order is the ATO order for five units, which Linda processes differently than the ATO order for Kit B processed on January 23. On this order, Linda is authorized to access the warehouse shipment line herself to record the completed assembly work. The needed components are ready in the assembly department, as they were picked together with components for Kit B.  

The second assembly order is the ATS order for ten units that were created by the planning system. On this ATS order, Linda performs all involved actions from the assembly order. Linda creates a warehouse pick document for the assembly components that are needed to assemble the ten units. When the PCs are assembled, Linda posts the assembly order and thereby signals that the items are available in inventory and can be picked for shipment.  

Sammy creates a warehouse pick document for any quantities that remain before the warehouse shipment can be posted. A pick document is created for the ten units of Kit A that have just finished. The components needed to assemble the five units of Kit A to order where picked on January 23.  

John brings the ten units of Kit A from the warehouse to the specified shipping area, records the quantity to handle, and then registers the pick.  

Sammy packs the ten ATS units with the five ATO units that Linda assembled earlier in the day. Sammy fills in the quantity to ship on both lines and then posts the last shipment for The Device Shop. The related assembly order for five units of Kit A is automatically posted. The second line on the sales order is updated as shipped. Two linked assembly order remains open until the sales order is invoiced and closed.  

When the sales order is later posted as fully invoiced, the sales order and the linked assembly orders are removed.

# Acquire fixed assets

Use the **Fixed Asset Card** page to enter information about an asset. You can set up buildings or production equipment as a main asset with a component list, and you can group them in various ways, such as by class, department, or location. You must set up and assign a depreciation book to each fixed asset before you can acquire it.

After you set up a fixed asset and assign a depreciation book, you must acquire the fixed asset. To acquire a fixed asset, you record its acquisition cost in the relevant G/L account, bank account, or vendor by posting an acquisition transaction from the **Fixed Asset G/L Journal** page. You can use the **Assisted Fixed Asset Acquisition** page to create and post the required general journal lines automatically.

Use indexation to adjust values for general price-level changes. Use the **Index Fixed Assets** batch job to calculate the acquisition costs and replacement costs.

## Add a fixed asset to your list of fixed assets

Before you can acquire a fixed asset, you must add it to your list of assets. There are several ways to add fixed assets to your list:

* Enter information about the assets on the **Fixed Asset Card** page.
* Use the **Edit in Excel** action to download your list of assets to a worksheet, add new assets to the list, and then publish the update to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].
* Use a purchase order to add assets.
* Use the **Copy fixed asset** action.

After you add fixed assets to your list, the next step is to acquire them so you can use them in transactions. Learn more at [Acquire a fixed asset](#acquire-fixed-assets).

### Add a fixed asset on the Fixed Asset Card page

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Fixed Assets**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action, and then fill in the fields on the **General** FastTab as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
3. On the **Depreciation Book** FastTab, fill in the fields as necessary. This step assigns a depreciation book to the fixed asset.  
4. If you need to assign more than one depreciation book to the fixed asset, choose the **Add More Depreciation Books** action. To learn more, go to [To assign a depreciation book to a fixed asset](fa-how-setup-depreciation.md#to-assign-a-depreciation-book-to-a-fixed-asset).

    After you fill in the required fields, the **You are ready to acquire the fixed asset.** notification appears at the top of the page. If you're ready to acquire the asset now, choose the **Acquire** action. Follow the steps on the **Assisted Fixed Asset Acquisition** page to complete the acquisition. If you aren't ready, you can always acquire the asset later.

### Use Edit in Excel to add assets

If you want to add numerous fixed assets, Edit in Excel is a great tool to use. The tool downloads your current list of assets in a worksheet that includes most of the fields available on the Fixed Asset Card page. You can fill in some or all of fields on a row for each asset, and publish your changes to add them to your list in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. If you can't fill in all required field, that's ok. You can update them in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] when you're ready.

> [!NOTE]
> To use the Edit in Excel action, you must have the Microsoft Dynamics Office Add-in installed. The add-in creates the connection between Excel and [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. To learn more, go to [Get the Business Central Add-in for Excel](admin-deploy-excel-addin.md).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Fixed Assets**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the :::image type="content" source="media/share-icon.png" alt-text="Share this page with other users or apps icon."::: icon, and then choose **Edit in Excel**.
3. Open the downloaded file, and enter information about the new fixed assets.

   > [!TIP]
   > You don't need to enter an identifier in the **No.** column. When you publish your update, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] assigns an identifier based on the number series you use for fixed assets.

4. To update [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], on the **Microsoft Dynamics** pane, choose **Publish**.

### Add a fixed asset from a purchase order or invoice

The following steps describe how to add a fixed asset from a purchase order. The steps are similar for a purchase invoice.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Orders**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose **New** to create a new purchase order.
3. On the **General** FastTab, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](../archive/SetupAndAdministration/includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
4. On the **Lines** FastTab, in the **Type** field, choose **Fixed Asset**.
5. In the **No.** field, either choose an existing fixed asset to add an expense, or choose **New** to add a new asset.
6. After you enter the information for the new asset and the purchase order, choose **Post**.

## Acquire a fixed asset by using a fixed asset G/L journal

The following procedure describes how to acquire by creating and posting the required fixed asset G/L journal lines. You can also create and post the journal lines manually. To learn more, go to [Acquire a fixed asset by using a fixed asset G/L journal](#acquire-a-fixed-asset-by-using-a-fixed-asset-gl-journal).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Fixed Assets**, and then choose the related link.
1. Choose the asset you want to acquire, and then choose the **Acquire** action.
1. Follow the steps on the **Assisted Fixed Asset Acquisition** page to complete the acquisition.

> [!NOTE]  
> You can also post acquisition cost as credits. In that case, remember that the value in the **Acquisition Cost Incl. VAT** field must be with a minus sign to indicate a credit.

When you choose **Finish**, the **Book Value** field on the **Fixed Asset Card** page is filled in, which indicates that the fixed asset was acquired at the specified acquisition cost.  

## To post a fixed asset acquisition manually with a fixed asset G/L journal

The following procedure describes how to acquire a fixed asset manually by creating and posting lines on the **Fixed Asset G/L Journal** page. You can also acquire a fixed asset automatically on the **Fixed Asset Card** page by choosing the **Acquire fixed asset** action. To learn more, go to [Acquire a fixed asset](#acquire-fixed-assets).

> [!NOTE]  
> You can also post acquisition cost as credits. In that case, remember that the value in the **Amount** field must be with a minus sign to indicate a credit.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Fixed Asset G/L Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Fixed Asset G/L Journal** page, in the **FA Posting Type** field, select **Acquisition Cost**.
3. Fill in the remaining fields as necessary.
4. Choose the **Post** action.  

> [!TIP]  
> If you fill in the **Insurance No.** field, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] also posts the acquisition cost of the fixed asset to the insurance coverage ledger. To learn more, go to [Insure Fixed Assets](fa-how-insure.md).

## To set up a component list for a main asset

You can group your fixed assets into main assets and their components. For example, you might have a production machine that consists of several parts that you want to group in this manner.  

You must set up the main asset and all its components as individual fixed asset. After you set up a component list, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically fills in the **Main Assets/Component** and **Components of Main Asset** fields on the fixed assets.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Fixed Assets**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the fixed asset that is the main asset, and then choose the **Main Asset Components** action.
3. On the **Main Asset Components** page, choose the **FA No**. field, and then select the fixed asset that you want to add as a component of the main asset.
4. Close the page.
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 for each component asset that you want to add.
6. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Fixed Asset Setup**, and then choose the related link.
7. Turn on the **Allow Posting to Main Assets** toggle.

## To cancel an acquisition cost posting for one fixed asset

If you make an error when posting an acquisition cost, you can remove the entry with the **Cancel FA Entries** batch job and then post the correct acquisition entry. The erroneous entries are transferred to the **FA Error Ledger Entries** page.

For example, if you post an acquisition with the wrong date, you must correct it as soon as possible because the fixed asset posting date is used for many calculations.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> You can't use the **Reverse Transactions** action for fixed asset entries.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **FA Ledger Entries**, and then choose the related link.  
2. In the **FA Ledger Entries** page, select the entry or entries that you want to cancel.  
3. Choose the **Actions** menu, and then choose the **Cancel Entries** action.
4. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
5. Choose the **OK** button to run the batch job.
6. When the incorrect entry or entries are canceled, proceed to post the correct acquisition cost.

## To post the salvage value together with the acquisition cost

The salvage value is the residual value of a fixed asset when it can no longer be used. You can post the salvage value at the same time as you post the acquisition cost. To learn more, go to [Depreciate or Amortize Fixed Assets](fa-how-depreciate-amortize.md).

You can post the salvage value together with the acquisition cost from a fixed asset journal.

> [!NOTE]
> This process might require that you personalize the Fixed Asset Journals page by adding the Salvage Value field. By default, the field is not displayed on the page. To learn more, go to [Personalize Your Workspace](ui-personalization-user.md).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Fixed Asset Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Fixed Asset Journals** page, create the acquisition line. To learn more, go to [To post a fixed asset acquisition manually with a fixed asset G/L journal](#to-post-a-fixed-asset-acquisition-manually-with-a-fixed-asset-gl-journal).
3. In the **Salvage Value** field on the journal line, enter the salvage value amount as a credit (prefix the amount with a minus sign, for example, **-**100).
4. Choose the **Post** action.

> [!NOTE]
> If a salvage value exists for a fixed asset, that value is used in depreciation posting instead of the value in the **Ending Book Value** field on the **FA Depreciation Books** page. To learn more, go to [To manage the ending book value](fa-how-depreciate-amortize.md#to-manage-the-ending-book-value).

# Set up Intrastat reporting

All companies in the European Union (EU) must report their trade with other EU countries/regions. Companies must report the movement of goods to the statistics authorities in their country/region every month, and the report must be delivered to the tax authorities. Intrastat is the system that's used to collect trade statistics about goods within these countries/regions. Use the Intrastat report to complete periodic Intrastat reporting by collecting, recording, and reporting the trade of goods according to local legislation.

Intrastat reporting is based on basic EU regulations that apply to all countries/regions. However, there are differences within the individual countries/regions. Each country/region has its rules about what and how to report.

> [!NOTE]  
> Intrastat information doesn't apply to the movement of services between countries/regions, but only goods (Items and Fixed Assets). If the local government requires registering the movement of services between countries/regions, it can be done using the **Service Declaration** feature.
>
> This feature is available as an app on [AppSource](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2081646). To use this feature, you must first install it on the **Extension Management** page. To learn more about this feature, go to [The Service Declaration Extension](finance-how-setup-use-service-declaration.md).  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This article describes the new Intrastat experience available in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] starting in the 2022 release wave 2, which includes extended features. If you haven't upgraded your solution, read the previous version's Intrastat setup and usage article at [Set Up and Report Intrastat](finance-how-setup-report-intrastat-v20.md).

## Assisted setup

To use assisted setup for the Intrastat, follow these steps:  

1. Select the :::image type="icon" source="media/ui-search/search_small.png" border="false"::: icon, enter **Assisted Setup**, and then select the related link. 
2. On the **Assisted Setup** page, select the line for **Set up Intrastat reporting** in the **Report on financial health** group.  
3. Follow the instructions for the basic setup for Intrastat. To read more about the Intrastat setup, see the [Intrastat configuration](#intrastat-configuration) section later in this article.
4. After the setup is completed, select **Finish** to start to use the new Intrastat experience.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You can install the Intrastat Reporting Core app on any base app country version, regardless of whether it's in the EU. However, this feature is intended for regulatory reporting in EU countries. Microsoft provides full regulatory and localization support only in EU countries. If you're in an EU country where Microsoft doesn't provide localization support, you must find partner-based localization support. You might have to install a country/region-specific Intrastat app in addition to the core extension to meet local requirements. The country-specific apps can only be installed on base apps because they're intended for localization purposes. Intrastat Core has one core app and country-specific local apps.  

## Intrastat configuration

Before you can use Intrastat reports, there are several configurations that must be set up.  

### Intrastat reporting setup

Use the **Intrastat Reporting Setup** page to enable and set the default behavior for Intrastat reporting. You can specify whether you need to report Intrastat from shipments (dispatches), receipts (arrivals), or both, depending on thresholds set by your local authorities. You can also set default transaction types for the regular and return documents that are used for transaction reporting.

Follow these steps to set up Intrastat reporting.

   | **Data Exch. Def. Code – Shipment** | Specifies the data exchange definition code to generate the Intrastat file for shipped goods. This field is available only if the **Split Receipts/Shipments Files** field is set to **Yes**. |

6. On the **Numbering** FastTab, enter a value in the **Intrastat Nos** field.
7. On the **Mandatory Fields** FastTab, turn on any of the following toggles to require people to fill in important fields on sales, purchase, and transfer documents. Making these fields mandatory helps ensure that your Intrastat reports are complete and accurate. Verification happens when you post the documents.

   |Toggle  |Field made mandatory  |Documents  |

### Set up a reporting file

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Data Exchange Definitions**, and then select the related link.
2. Select **New**, and then, on the **General** FastTab, enter information about the data exchange definition, data file type, column separator, related codeunits, XMLport, and other fields as needed.
3. On the **Line Definitions** FastTab, enter a value in the **Line Type** field to describe the formatting of lines in the data file and where you need to define the number of columns for this line.
4. On the **Column Definitions** FastTab, fill in the line for each planned column. 
5. On the **Line Definitions** FastTab, select **Field Mapping**.
6. On the **Field Mapping** page, create a new entry.
7. On the **General** FastTab, select the **Table ID** value (for **Intrastat Report Line**, choose **4812**), and enter the following field information:

   1. In the **Key Index** field, specify the key index to sort the source records before export.
   2. In the **Mapping Codeunit** field, select a value.

8. On the **Field Mapping** FastTab, add the columns that you previously configured on the **Column Definitions** FastTab, and then add the following field information:

   1. Specify the **Field ID** value for each of the columns.
   2. Specify the **Transformation Rule** value for each column as needed. The value specifies the rule that transforms imported text to a supported value before it can be mapped to a specified field in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. When you choose a value in this field, the exact value is entered in the **Transformation Rule** field in the **Data Exch. Field Mapping Buf.** table. (Conversely, when an exact value is entered in the **Transformation Rule** field in the **Data Exch. Field Mapping Buf.** table, a value is chosen in this field.)

9. If you need to group entries based on some columns, on the **Field Grouping** FastTab, select the fields that you want to use for grouping.

> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE[prod_long](includes/prod_long.md)] comes with the preconfigured data exchange definition for Intrastat for all localized countries/regions. To learn more about how to create a new data exchange definition, see [Set Up Data Exchange Definitions](across-how-to-set-up-data-exchange-definitions.md).

### Set mandatory fields with the Intrastat report checklist

In some countries/regions, the authorities require that Intrastat reports include, for example, the shipment method for purchases or other values when sales are over a certain threshold.

To set mandatory fields or values on the **Intrastat Report** page, follow the steps.

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Intrastat Report Setup**, and then select the related link.
2. Select **Intrastat Report Checklist**.
3. Follow the steps to add the necessary lines for checking:
   1. Set the **Field No.** field to a field that must be checked for a nonempty value.
   2. Enter a value in the **Filter Expression** field if needed, based on the following rules:

        1. When you open the **Filter Page**, select the filter that you need to use for checking.
        2. Select a value related to the selected filter.
        3. If you must fill more filters for the chosen field, repeat the previous two steps to add another filter.
        4. When you finish entering the filters for the chosen field, select **OK**.

   3. Select the **Reversed Filter Expression** checkbox to specify that the check for fields is run only on those lines that don't match the filter expression. If the line isn't filtered, this field is ignored.

> [!NOTE]
> When you open the **Filter Page** from the **Filter Expression** line, you can use all standard filter expressions related to the specific field you want to filter.
>
> Be careful when you set up validation rules, because they can differ between countries/regions.

## Use custom codeunits in Intrastat reporting

If you want to change how Intrastat works, and the default configuration isn't enough, you can customize the system by extending the standard features. If you need to further change the Intrastat behavior, you can develop your own codeunits. When you create codeunits, you need to make extra changes to use them. To configure [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to use your own objects, follow these steps.

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Reports Configuration**, and then select the related link.
2. On the **VAT Reports Configuration** page, add a new line.
3. In the **VAT Report Type** field, select **Intrastat Report**.
4. In the **VAT Report Version** field, specify the version of the report.
5. Add your codeunits for the following options:
   1. In the **Suggest Lines Codeunit ID** field, specify the new codeunit for suggesting lines in the Intrastat report lines.
   2. In the **Content Codeunit ID** field, specify the new codeunit for exporting data as a file using a Data Exchange Definition.
   3. In the **Validate Codeunit ID** field, specify the new codeunits for validating results inside Intrastat report lines.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This line must be empty if you use the standard codeunits. You should only create a line and configure it if you have custom codeunits.

## Other Intrastat configurations

Customer and vendor cards include the **Intrastat Partner Type** field, which has the same option values as the **Partner Type** field: 

- (blank)
- Company
- Person

The **Intrastat Partner Type** field replaced the **Partner Type** field in Intrastat reporting. The **Partner Type** field is used in the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) to define the SEPA Direct Debit Scheme (Core or B2B). The **Intrastat Partner Type** field is used for Intrastat reporting only. Therefore, you can specify different values for the two fields if necessary.

If the **Intrastat Partner Type** field is left blank, the value from the **Partner Type** field is used for Intrastat reporting.

In addition to **Intrastat Report Setup**, **Data Exchange Definitions**, and **Intrastat Report Checklist**, the following settings must also be configured.

| Page | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| **Countries/Regions** | On the **Countries/Regions** page, add **EU Country/Region Code** and **Intrastat Code** information to specify a code for the country/region that you're trading with. This information is used in Intrastat reporting. |
| **Tariff Numbers** | In many countries/regions, the customs and tax authorities establish eight-digit codes for various items. To enable item entries to contain the necessary information when the program imports them to the Intrastat journal line, enter the item code on the **Tariff Numbers** page. Find the codes for the items that your company deals with, and enter them on the **Tariff Numbers** page. |
| **Transport Methods** | There are seven, one-digit codes for Intrastat transport methods: **1** for sea, **2** for rail, **3** for road, **4** for air, **5** for the post, **7** for fixed installations, and **9** for own propulsion (for example, transporting a car by driving it). [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't require these specific codes. However, we recommend that the descriptions provide a similar meaning. |
| **Transaction Types** | Countries and regions have different codes for types of Intrastat transactions. For example, for ordinary purchases and sales, exchange of returned goods, and exchange of nonreturned goods. Set up all the codes that apply to your country/region. These codes are then used on the **Foreign Trade** FastTab on sales and purchase documents and when you process returns. |
| **Transaction Specifications** | Set up codes to supplement the transaction type descriptions. |
  
> [!NOTE]
> Starting in January 2022, Intrastat requires different transaction nature codes for dispatches to private individuals or non-VAT registered businesses and VAT-registered businesses. To comply with this requirement, we recommend that you review or add new transaction nature codes on the **Transaction Types** page, according to the requirements in your country. You should also check and update the **Intrastat Partner Type** field to *Person* for a private individual or non-VAT registered business customers on the relevant **Customer** page. If you're unsure about the correct Intrastat partner type or transaction type to use, we recommend that you ask an expert in your country or region.

|   Field   |   Description   |
| --------- | --------------- |
| **Net Weight** | Weight is one of the basic configurations  that are related to Intrastat reporting, because the total weight is mandatory for reporting. To be ready for this requirement, enter a value in the **Net Weight** field on the item or fixed asset card. |
| **Country of Origin Code** | Use the two-letter ISO Alpha Codes on the item or fixed asset card for the country/region where the good was obtained or produced. If the good was produced in more than one country/region, the country/region of origin is the last country/region where it was processed. |
| **VAT identification number of the partner operator in the Member State of import** | This number is the VAT-ID of the partner operator in the member state of import. The VAT-ID is also used in the exchange of intra-EU-export data among the member states and allows the member states to allocate the received data to the importing company in their own country/region. Reporting units must report on the VAT-ID of the company that declared the intra-Union acquisition of goods in the member state of import. |

Optionally, you can also set up:

- **Commodity codes**: Customs and tax authorities have numerical codes that classify items and services. You can specify these codes on items.
- **Areas**: Supplementary information about countries and regions.
- **Entry/exit points**: Specify the locations where you ship or receive items to or from other countries/regions. An airport is an example of an entry or exit point. You enter entry or exit points on sales and purchase documents on the **Foreign Trade** FastTab. This information is copied from the item entries when you create the Intrastat journal.
- **Supplementary unit of measure**: The quantity of goods for Intrastat reporting can be either net weight (in kilograms) or a supplementary unit. If supplementary units are required, you must configure them for items and fixed assets.

> [!NOTE]
> If you add a supplementary unit of measure, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] asks whether you want to update related items. If you choose to update related items, the **Unit of Measure** value on the **Item Units of Measure** page is updated for all items that have the same tariff number.
>
> When you add a tariff number that has a defined **Unit of Measure** value to the item, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically adds a new unit of measure to the **Item Units of Measure** value for the item. The **Qty. per Unit of Measure** value is based on the **Quantity Rounding Precision** field.

## Automate the process of inheriting the country of origin for items

> [!NOTE]
> If you want to transfer the country of origin from the purchase document to the sales invoice, you must use item tracking lines. Otherwise, the system won't use the default value.

### Use the item in purchase documents

After you select an item that has item tracking enabled on the purchase line, follow these steps.  

1. On the **Lines** FastTab, choose **Line**, and run the **Item Tracking Lines** action.
2. On the **Item Tracking Lines** page after adding **Serial No.** or **Lot No.**, and entering value in **Quantity (Base)** field, choose one of the following options:  
   1. The **Lot No. Information Card** action if you're using lots.
   2. The **Serial No. Information Card** action if you're using serial numbers.  
3. You can choose **New** (**+**) to create new lot or serial numbers on the **Lot No. Information Card** or **Serial No. Information Card** pages. 
4. The **Country/Region Code** is populated with the **Country/Region Code** from the purchase document. You can change it if you want.
5. Close the page.
6. Repeat this process for each line on the **Item Tracking Lines** page where you configured item tracking.
7. Close the **Item Tracking Lines** page.

When you work with sales invoices, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically collects the **Country/Region Code** for any lot or serial number you choose. You can always check the code using the **Item Tracking Lines** action from the sales lines.  

These **Country/Region Codes** are automatically populated in the **Country/Region of Origin Code** field in the **Intrastat Report Lines**.  

## Enter country/region Intrastat settings

Intrastat requirements are similar in all member states of the EU, though there are important exceptions. In theory, the rules should be uniformly applied in all member states. However, there are differences in implementations, because some member states provide guidelines about how to apply the principles in specific situations (for example, commercial samples and returns of goods). These guidelines can produce different results for various situations. Therefore, the information that countries/regions must enter can differ, as can the file format that they must use for reporting.

> [!NOTE]
> If you don't fill in the **Lot No. Information Card** or **Serial No. Information Card** pages for a lot or serial number, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] won't use the **Country/Region Code** from the purchase document. Instead, the information comes from the **Item** card.  

### Austria

Intrastat reporting in Austria requires two different files for receipts and shipments. To verify that your setup is correct, follow the steps.

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Intrastat Report Setup**, and then select the related link.

# Depreciate or amortize fixed assets

Depreciation is used to allocate the cost of fixed assets, such as machinery and equipment, over their depreciable life. For each fixed asset, you must define how to depreciate it.  

 There are two ways to post depreciation:  

* Automatically, by running the **Calculate Depreciation** batch job.  
* Manually, by using the fixed asset G/L journal.  

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can calculate daily depreciation, which allows you to calculate depreciation for any period. You can therefore analyze current operating results on, for example, a monthly, quarterly, or annual basis. The calculation uses a standard year of 360 days and a standard month of 30 days. For more information, see [Depreciation Methods](fa-depreciation-methods.md).  

If several departments use a fixed asset, periodic depreciation can be automatically allocated to these departments according to a user-defined allocation table.  

You can cancel incorrect depreciation entries by using the **Cancel FA Ledger Entries** batch job. Afterward, you can post the correct amount by running the **Calculate Depreciation** batch job again. The errors you correct are posted as fixed asset error ledger entries.  

Indexation is used to adjust values for general price-level changes. You can use the **Index Fixed Assets** batch job to recalculate the depreciation amounts.  

## To calculate depreciation automatically

Once a month, or whenever you choose, you can run the **Calculate Depreciation** batch job. The batch job ignores fixed assets that were sold, are blocked or inactive, or use the manual depreciation method.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Calculate Depreciation**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  
3. Choose the **OK** button.  

    The batch job calculates the depreciation and creates lines in the fixed asset G/L journal.

4. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **FA G/L Journals**, and then choose the related link.  

    On the **Fixed Asset G/L Journal** page, in the **No. of Depreciation Days** field, you can see how many days of depreciation were calculated.  
5. Choose the **Post** action.  

> [!NOTE]
> Known limitation: If you set the **Use Force No. of Days** field to Yes, and the **Force No. of Days** field is set to a value where **Posting Date** minus **Number of Days** results in a date in the previous calendar year, the system will not let you post the depreciation.
> You can avoid it by reducing the **Force No. of Days** field to no more than than the calculated days until posting date using 30days/month OR set the flag **Fiscal Year 365 Days** in the Depreciation Book.
> We recommend the first option as you may not want to change the use of 30days/months for depreciation. For more information, see [Fiscal Year 365 Days Field Depreciation](fa-how-setup-depreciation.md#fiscal-year-365-days-field-depreciation).


## To post depreciation manually from the fixed asset G/L journal

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Fixed Asset G/L Journal**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Create an initial journal line and fill in the fields as necessary.  
3. In the **FA Posting Type** field, select **Depreciation**.  
4. Choose the **Insert FA Bal. Account** action. A second journal line is created for the balancing account that is set up for depreciation posting. For more information, see [To set up fixed asset posting groups](fa-how-setup-general.md#to-set-up-fixed-asset-posting-groups).
5. Choose the **Post** action to post the journal.  

The **Book Value** field on the **Fixed Asset Card** page is updated accordingly.

If you set up fixed asset allocation keys to allocate amounts to different departments or projects, the amounts are allocated during posting. For more information, see [Set Up General Fixed Assets Information](fa-how-setup-general.md).  

## To manage the ending book value

In the **Ending Book Value** field on the **FA Depreciation Books** page, you can specify the book value that you want your fixed asset to have in the current depreciation book after you fully depreciate it. You can enter the value manually, or you can fill in the **Default Ending Book Value** field on the related **Depreciation Book** page. The value automatically fills in the field.

> [!NOTE]
> If the last depreciation means that the **Book Value** field on the **Fixed Asset Card** page is zero, the last depreciation is automatically reduced by this amount.<br /><br />
> If the value in the **Book Value** field is greater than zero after the last depreciation,  for example because of a rounding problem or because a salvage value exists, the value in the **Ending Book Value** field on the **FA Depreciation Books** page is ignored. For more information, see [To post the salvage value together with the acquisition cost](fa-how-acquire.md#to-post-the-salvage-value-together-with-the-acquisition-cost).

## To calculate allocations for a Fixed Asset


1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **FA Posting Groups**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose **Related**, **Posting Group**, **Allocations** and then select **Depreciation**.
3. Fill in the G/L accounts and the corresponding allocation percentages for each posting group and then close the page.
4. Next, choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Fixed Asset G/L Journals**, and then choose the related link.
5. Enter the Fixed Asset and the corresponding FA Posting Group and Depreciation book will determine the allocation lines.
6. Choose the **Post** action to post the journal.

> [!NOTE]  
> If a fixed asset is used by several departments, you can select the dimension on the Fixed Asset G/L Journal line.

## Use duplication lists to prepare to post to multiple depreciation books

When you fill in journal lines to post to a depreciation book, you can duplicate the lines in a separate journal so you can post to a different depreciation book. For more information, see To [post entries to different depreciation books](fa-how-depreciate-amortize.md#to-post-entries-to-different-depreciation-books).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Depreciation Books**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the depreciation book, and then select the **Part of Duplication List** check box.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>   If you have selected the **Use Duplication List** field, do not use number series on the journal. The reason is that the number series for the fixed asset G/L journal does not the number series for the fixed asset journal.  

## To post entries to different depreciation books

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Fixed Asset G/L Journal**, and then choose the related link.  
2. In the journal that you want to post depreciation with, select the **Use Duplication List** check box.  
3. Fill in the remaining fields as necessary.  
4. Choose the **Post** action.  
5. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **FA Journals**, and then choose the related link.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > The **Fixed Asset Journal** page contains new lines for different depreciation books according to the duplication list.  
6. Review or edit the lines, and then choose the **Post** action.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > Another way to duplicate an entry in a separate book is to enter a depreciation book code in the **Duplicate in Depreciation Book** field when you fill in a journal line.  

You can copy entries from one depreciation book to another by using the **Copy Depreciation Book** batch job. The batch job creates journal lines in the journal batch that you specified on the **FA Journal Setup** page for the depreciation book that you want to copy to. To learn more, go to [To copy fixed asset ledger entries between depreciation books](#to-copy-fixed-asset-ledger-entries-between-depreciation-books).  

## To copy fixed asset ledger entries between depreciation books

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Depreciation Books**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the relevant depreciation book card, and then choose the **Copy Depreciation Book** action.  
3. On the **Copy Depreciation Book** page, fill in the fields as necessary.  
4. Choose the **OK** button.  

The copied lines are created in either the fixed asset G/L journal or the fixed asset journal, depending on whether the depreciation book that you're copying has integration to the general ledger.

2. Select the location where you want to use directed put-away and pick, and then choose the **Edit** action.  
3. On the **Warehouse** FastTab, select the **Directed Put-away and Pick** checkbox.  

You do not need to fill in any other fields on the location card until later in the setup process.  

> [!NOTE]  
> You can't set up the warehouse to use bins when the location has open item ledger entries.  

The next step is to define the type of bins you want to operate. For more information, see [Set Up Bin Types](warehouse-how-to-set-up-bin-types.md). The bin type defines how to use a given bin when processing the flow of items through the warehouse. You can assign a bin type to both a zone and to a bin.  

You can also define warehouse class codes, if the warehouse carries items that need specific storage conditions. Warehouse class codes are used when suggesting item placement in bins. You assign the warehouse class codes to product groups, which are then assigned to items and SKUs, or to zones and bins that can accommodate the storage conditions required by the warehouse class codes.  

You're now ready to set up zones, if you want. Using zones reduces the number of fields you need to fill in when you set up your bins, because bins created within zones inherit several properties from the zone. Zones can also make it easier for new or temporary employees to orient themselves in your warehouse. Note that flow is controlled by bins, therefore it is possible to operate with bins and only one zone.  

## To set up a zone in your warehouse  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Locations**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the location where you want to set up zone and open the location card, and then choose the **Zones** action.  
3. On the **Zones** page, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  

When you change a zone parameter, all bins created thereafter in that zone will have the new characteristics, but the original bins will not be changed.  

> [!NOTE]  
> If you want to operate without zones, you must still create one zone code that is undefined except for the code.  

The next step is to define bins. Learn more at [Set Up Locations to Use Bins](warehouse-how-to-set-up-locations-to-use-bins.md).  

In addition, you must create put-away templates and counting periods. Learn more at [Set Up Put-away Templates](warehouse-how-to-set-up-put-away-templates.md).

# About unit cost calculation

Each item has a unit cost that is calculated based on the company's costing method and other factors. As a rule, with the *Standard* costing method, the **Unit Cost** field value is based on the standard cost for the item. For all other costing methods (*FIFO*, *LIFO*, *Specific*, and *Average*), the unit cost is calculated based on the average unit cost across a period of time.  

## When is the unit cost field updated for item

The chosen costing method influences when the **Unit Cost** field is updated.

When the costing method is set as *Standard*, the **Unit Cost** field is updated whenever the standard cost is changed, and users can't edit the **Unit Cost** field. For more information, see [About Calculating Standard Cost](finance-about-calculating-standard-cost.md).

If the costing method is *FIFO*, *LIFO*, *Specific*, or *Average*, then the **Unit Cost** is updated in the following cases:

* When the item is cost-adjusted, automatically or by an [Adjust Cost](inventory-how-adjust-item-costs.md#to-adjust-item-costs-manually) task.
* During the posting of purchase invoices, output, or positive adjustment if one of the following conditions is true:
  * The net invoiced quantity of the item changes from negative or zero to positive.
  * The current unit cost is zero.

If one of these conditions is true, then the **Unit Cost** field is updated with the value in the **Last Direct Cost** field on the item card.

> [!NOTE]
> The **Unit Cost** field is not updated if the current unit cost is higher than zero and the new unit cost is zero. A unit cost of zero is considered an exception from regular business. Therefore, the current unit cost is retained to provide the last known, relevant value. This exception applies even if the existing inventory has been revalued to zero.

In the **Unit Cost** field on the item card, you can drill down to view the history of transactions that the average cost of units on hand is calculated from in the **Average Cost Calc. Overview** window.

## Impact of unit cost field on purchases and sales
How the contents of the **Costing Method** field influence the unit cost calculation for purchases and sales is described in more detail in the following sections.

### Unit cost calculation for purchases

When you purchase items, the value in the **Last Direct Cost** field on the item card is copied to the **Direct Unit Cost** field on a purchase line or to the **Unit Amount** line on an item journal line.

What you select in the **Costing Method** field influences how [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates the contents of the **Unit Cost** field on the lines.

#### Costing method FIFO, LIFO, Specific, or Average

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates the contents of the **Unit Cost (LCY)** field on the purchase line or the contents of the **Unit Cost** field on the item journal line according to the following formula:

*Unit Cost (LCY) = (Direct Unit Cost – (Discount Amount / Quantity)) x (1 + Indirect Cost % / 100) + Overhead Rate*

#### Costing method Standard

The **Unit Cost (LCY)** field on the purchase line or the **Unit Cost** field is filled on the item journal line by copying the value in the **Unit Cost** field on the item card. By using costing method set as *Standard*, this value is always based on the standard cost.

When you post the purchase, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses the unit cost from the purchase line or item journal line to the purchase item invoice entry. You can see it on the entry list for the item.

#### All costing methods

The unit cost from the source document line is used to calculate the contents of the **Cost Amount (Actual)** field, or if applicable, the **Cost Amount (Expected)** field that relates to this item entry, regardless of the costing method of the item.

### Unit cost calculation for sales

When you sell items, the unit cost is copied from the **Unit Cost** field on the item card to the sales line or the item journal line.

When you post, the unit cost is copied to the sales invoice item entry, and it can be seen on the entry list for the item. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses the unit cost from the source document line to calculate the contents of the **Cost Amount (Actual)** field, or if applicable, the **Cost Amount (Expected)** field in the value entry related to this item entry.

<!--
## To make general changes in the last direct unit cost

If you need to change the direct unit cost for several items, you can use the **Adjust Item Costs/Prices** batch job.  

The batch job changes the contents in the **Unit Price** field on the item card. The batch job changes the content of the field in the same way for all items or selected items. The batch job multiplies the value in the field by an adjustment factor that you specify.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Adjust Item Costs/Prices**, and then choose the related link.  
2. In the **Adjust Field** field, specify which item or SKU card field you want to adjust.  
3. In the **Adjustment Factor** field, specify the factor by which to adjust the value. For example, enter **1.5** to increase the value by 50%.  
4. On the **Item** FastTab, set filters to specify, for example, which items to process with the batch job.  
5. Choose the **OK** button.

# Work on Service Tasks
After you have created a service order or service quote, registered service item lines, and allocated resources to the service items in the order or quote, you can start repairing and maintaining the service items.  

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] features a **Service Tasks** page that gives an overview of all the service items that need attention. Think of it as your service dashboard where you can see what orders are pending, look for and register spare parts, and keep your inventory up-to-date.  

To track changes and get a graphical view of your service business, use [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] statistics tools for quick, automatically generated charting and analysis.  

## To work on a service task  
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Tasks**, and then choose the related link.
2. If you want a list of service tasks a certain resource or resource group is allocated to, fill in the **Resource Filter** or **Resource Group Filter** field and select <kbd>Enter</kbd>.  
3. If you want a list of service tasks with a certain response date or response dates within a certain time period, fill in the **Response Date Filter** field and select <kbd>Enter</kbd>.  
4. If you want a list of service tasks with a certain allocation status or repair status, fill in the **Allocation Status Filter** or **Repair Status Code Filter** field and select <kbd>Enter</kbd>.  
5. Select the service task you want to work on. Choose the **Item Worksheet** action. The **Service Item Worksheet** page opens.  
6. Register standard texts, spare parts, resource hours, and costs as appropriate using the corresponding options in the **Type** field:  \<Blank\>, **Item**, **Resource**, and **Cost**.  
7. In the **Repair Status** field, select the appropriate status.  

   > [!NOTE]  
   >  Fill in the **Repair Status** field with the **Finished** or **Partly Serviced** status if the service item has been completely serviced or another resource will continue servicing. The **Finished** or **Reallocation Needed** status is specified automatically for the allocation entry corresponding to the service item.  

## To register service operations  
When performing a service on a service order, you can register the details specifying the items used, costs incurred, and the time spent. The data you specify is stored on the **Service Item Worksheet** page. You can update the data when necessary.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 2.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the service order to register the service for, and choose the item line.  
3. Choose the **Service Item Worksheet** action  
4. On the lines, specify the items used, costs incurred, and the time spent on the service.  

   > [!NOTE]  
   >  You can also register service directly on the service lines linked to the service order.  

## To register spare parts  
When working on service items in service orders, you may need to use spare parts for the service. The following procedure shows how to register the spare parts you use on the **Service Item Worksheet** page.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 3.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Tasks**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the line that includes the relevant service item, and then choose the **Item Worksheet** action.  
3. Enter a new service line.  
4. In the **Type** field, choose **Item**.  
5. In the **No.** field, choose the relevant spare part.  
6. In the **Quantity** field, enter the quantity of items you want to use.  

 You can use a similar procedure to register the spare parts on the **Service Lines** page, which you can open from the **Service Order** page.  

## To register spare parts from a service order  
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 4.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the service order you want to register spare parts for.  
3. Choose the line that includes the relevant service item. Choose **Actions**, choose **Order**, and then choose **Service Lines**.  
4. enter a new service line.  

## To replace a service item or a service item component  
When you service a service item that is composed of components, you may need to replace a faulty component with a new one. Every time that you enter a spare part for a service item with components, you have the option of replacing a component or creating a new one. The new item is not registered as a component of the service item until you post this service line or the service order.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 5.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Tasks**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the line that includes the service item, and then choose the **Item Worksheet** action.  
3. Enter a new service line.  
4. In the **Type** field, choose **Item**.  
5. In the **No.** field, choose the component to replace.  
6. Select <kbd>Enter</kbd>. A dialog box opens with three options: **Replace Component**, **New Component**, and **Ignore**. The following table describes the options.  

    |Option | Description|  
    |----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Replace Component**|Changes the status of the component you are replacing to not active, and it will appear on the replaced component list for the service item.|  
    |**New Component**|Enters the new component in the component list of the service item.|  
    |**Ignore**|Does nothing to the component list of the service item.|  

7. Choose **Replace Component**.  
8. Choose the component to replace, and then choose **OK**.  

## To change the response time for a service item line  
When you register a service item line in a service order or quote, depending on whether the service item is on a service contract the response time in hours is automatically entered and the response date and time are calculated accordingly. You can change the response time in hours and the response date and time if you need to.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 6.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Orders** or **Service Quotes**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the service order or quote to open the card.  
3. On the service item line you want to change the response time for, either in the **Response Time (Hours)** field or in the **Response Date** and **Response Time** fields, enter the new response hours or response date and time.  

## To register fault/resolution codes  
After repairing a service item, you can register both the fault code and the resolution code for the item by selecting a combination from the existing fault/resolution codes relationships. The fault and resolution codes will appear in the corresponding fields on the **Service Item Worksheet** page. You can also register the codes directly in this page.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 7.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Tasks**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the line that includes the relevant service item, and then choose the **Item Worksheet** action.  
3. On the **Service Item Worksheet** page, choose **Fault/Resol. Codes Relationships**. The **Fault/Resolution Codes Relationships** page opens.  

  >  [!NOTE]
  >  Filters are set on the relationships that are shown on the page by copying the service item group and the fault codes from the **Service Item Worksheet** page.  

4. Fill out the line. Choose the combination of fault and resolution codes, and then choose **OK** to copy it to the service item. If an appropriate combination cannot be found, you can create a new combination on the page.

# Database Wait Statistics in [!INCLUDE[prod_long](includes/prod_long.md)]

The administrators and developers can have insights into the database performance by looking at **Database Wait Statistics** in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The information presented by **Database Wait Statistics** can help to check the kind of resources that are being used and the kind of delays that are being faced by the database processes. By analyzing these wait statistics, you can find the root cause of the slow performance by your database and can eventually make better decisions for the application performance.

For more information about the database wait statistics, see [Database Wait Statistics in Dynamics 365 Business Central](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/database-wait-statistics).

# Analyzing sustainability entries with financial reports

The *financial reports* feature gives you insights into the financial data shown on your chart of accounts (COA). You can set up financial reports to analyze figures in general ledger (G/L) accounts, and compare general ledger entries with budget entries. But you can also analyze statistical and sustainability data with the same feature, and even combine all three types of data.  

## Prerequisites for financial reporting  

Setting up financial reports requires an understanding of the structure of the data you want to analyze. There are some key concepts that you likely need to pay attention to before you design your financial reports:

1. Related to the chart of accounts:

   1. Map G/L posting accounts to G/L account categories.
   2. Design how you use dimensions.
   3. Set up G/L budgets.  

2. Related to sustainability:

   1. Set up your sustainability accounts.
   2. Set up your carbon fees and CO2e in the **Emission Fees**.
   3. Design how you use dimensions.  

3. Related to the statistical accounts:

   1. Set up your statistical accounts.
   2. Design how you use dimensions.  

> [!NOTE]
> Financial reports doesn't work directly with CO2, CH4, or N2O emissions. Instead, it uses the CO2 equivalent model and that means you must first configure **CO2e** (carbon-dioxide equivalent) on the **Emission Fees** page.  

> [!NOTE]
> More details about using financial reports with financial data and chart of accounts can be found at [Prepare financial reporting with financial data and account categories](bi-how-work-account-schedule.md).

## Create a new financial report  

To quickly create your own financial reports, start by copying an existing one, as described in step 3 here:

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Financial Reports**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Financial Reports** page, choose the **New** action to create a new financial report name.  
3. Fill in the report short name in **Name** field (you can't change the name later) and enter a **Description**.  
4. Choose a row definition and a column definition.
5. Choose the **Edit Report Definition** action to access more properties on the financial report.  
6. On the **Options** FastTab, you can edit the report description, change the row and column definitions, and define how to show dates. Dates can be a Day/Week/Month/Quarter/Year hierarchy, or use accounting periods. To learn more, go to [Comparing accounting periods using period formulas](bi-column-definitions.md#comparing-accounting-periods-using-period-formulas).
7. On the **Dimensions** FastTab, you can define dimension filters for the report.  
8. You can preview the report in the area below the **Dimensions** FastTab.

If you want to analyze your sustainability or statistical data, you can achieve this by setting up the **Row Definition**.  

To create or edit a row definition, follow these steps:

1. On the **Financial Reports** page, select the relevant financial report, and then choose the **Edit Row Definition** action.
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  

> [!NOTE]
> The **Row No.** field shows the first 10 characters of an identifier, such as an account number. If you add elements with identifiers that start with the same 10 characters, you'll have duplicates in the **Row No.** field. If needed, you can manually edit the identifiers after you insert the elements. The full identifiers are displayed in the **Totaling** field.

> [!NOTE]
> You can combine all **Totaling Types**, that is, Posting accounts, Sust. Accounts, and Statistical Account.

> [!NOTE]
> Row definitions aren't versioned. When you change a row definition, the old version is replaced and your changes will be saved to the database.

### Analyzing sustainability data  

1. Enter the **Row No.** to identify your row and add **Description** as a text that will appear on the financial report line.
2. In the **Totaling Type** column, choose the **Sust. Accounts** option.
3. In the **Totaling** field, choose one or more sustainability accounts using all applicable filters.
4. In the **Amount Type** choose one of the options:
   1. Choose **CO2e** if you want to report CO2 equivalent value from the **CO2e Emission** field in the **Sustainability Ledger Entries**.
   2. Choose **Carbon Fee** if you want to report financial equivalent (carbon fee) from the **Carbon Fee** field on the **Sustainability Ledger Entries**.

5. If you choose **Formula** as a **Totaling Type**, you can use mathematical formulas in the **Totaling** column.  

### Analyzing statistical data

1. Enter the **Row No.** to identify your row and add **Description** as a text that will appear on the financial report line.
2. In the **Totaling Type** column, choose the **Statistical Accounts** option.
3. In the **Totaling** field, choose one or more sustainability accounts using all applicable filters.
4. If you choose **Formula** as a **Totaling Type**, you can use mathematical formulas in the **Totaling** column.

# Record interactions with contacts

Recording interactions with business contacts consists of these tasks:

* Setting up interaction templates  
* Creating interactions on contacts or segments  
* View and manage recorded interactions  

## Set up interaction templates

Before you can record interactions, you must set up interaction templates. An interaction template is a model that defines the basic characteristics of an interaction. When you record an interaction, you specify the interaction templates it's based on. Settings such as the mode of communication that was used, who initiated the interaction, and its cost, transfer to the interaction.

You set up an interaction template on the **Interaction Templates** page.

When you set up an interaction template, you can add an attachment. For example, you might attach a Microsoft Word document that contains notes from a meeting. To learn more about attachments, go to [Attachments for interactions](marketing-interaction-attachments.md). Repeat the steps to set up as many interaction templates as you want.  

## Create interactions

There are two ways to record interactions:

* You can manually create interactions that are linked to a single contact or to a segment. For more information, see [Create Interactions on Contacts and Segments](marketing-how-create-interactions.md).  
* You can automatically record interactions when you perform actions in the application—for example, when you print an invoice or quote. For more information, see [Automatically Record Interactions with Contacts](marketing-auto-record-interactions.md).

## View and manage recorded interactions

You can view all the recorded interactions that have not been deleted on the **Interaction Log Entries** page. You can open this page by:

* Using the **Search for Page or Report** icon to search on **Interaction Log Entries**.
* Choosing the **Interaction Log Entries** action on a contact or segment.

  The **Interaction Log Entry** page contains the interactions you create manually and the interactions that [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] records automatically.

Use the Interaction Log Entries page to view the status of interactions and cancel interactions.

You can delete interaction log entries that have been canceled. To delete interaction log entries, choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Delete Canceled Interaction Log Entries**, choose the related link, and then fill in the information.

# Opening and Sharing Business Central Files in Microsoft OneDrive

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] makes it easy to store, manage, and share files with other people through Microsoft OneDrive for Business. On most pages with available files, such as the Report Inbox or when files are attached to records, you'll find **Open in OneDrive** and **Share** actions.


:::image type="content" source="media/onedrive-overview-report-inbox-w-outline.png" alt-text="The Open in OneDrive and Share actions for reports":::


:::image type="content" source="media/one-drive-attachments-w-outline.png" alt-text="The Open in OneDrive and Share actions for attachments":::


## Open in OneDrive

The **Open in OneDrive** action copies the file to your OneDrive and then opens the file in an application such as Microsoft Excel online, Microsoft Word online, or Microsoft PowerPoint online. 

<!--## Working with different types of files-->

When you choose **Open in OneDrive**, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] identifies Excel, Word, and PowerPoint files and opens them in their online applications, that is, Excel online, Word online and PowerPoint online. 

Using the online versions of these applications, you can annotate, edit, and collaborate with others without leaving the browser.

For other popular file types, such as PDFs, text files, and images, OneDrive provides file viewers that offer features for printing, sharing, and more. If a file can't be viewed in OneDrive, you might be prompted to download it.

## Share

The **Share** action copies the file to your OneDrive so you can see with whom you've already shared it as well as share the file with other people. When you select the **Share** action, the following page opens.

:::image type="content" source="media/share-to-onedrive-dialog-v2.PNG" alt-text="Share file in OneDrive":::

If you're familiar with OneDrive, you may recognize the above-referenced page. You'll see you have two options for sharing the file: **Send link** and **Copy link**.

- **Send link** let's you share the files with specific people. The people you share the file will get an email with a link to the file. The file will also appear in the **Shared** section of their OneDrive. Start by typing the email addresses or contact names in the **Name, group or email field**. Include a message below the  **Name, group or email field**, if you want.

  > [!TIP]
  > If you want to compose your message in Outlook, select the **Outlook** button. The link will be inserted into a draft email and everyone you entered to share with will be in the **To** list. With this option, you can author emails using all of Outlook's features, including formatting text, adding other attachments, inserting pictures or tables, and adding CC or BCC recipients.

- **Copy link** copies a file link you can use to share the file through applications such as Facebook, Twitter, or email. 

Before you send or copy a file link, set the permission level you want people to have. You can see the current setting under **Send link** or **Copy link**. In most cases, it will be **Anyone with the link can edit**, depending on your administrator's settings. To change the permissions, select the link and make changes on the **Link Settings** page.

The sharing feature in Business Central is based on OneDrive. Learn more about OneDrive sharing and permissions at [Share OneDrive files and folders](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/share-onedrive-files-and-folders-9fcc2f7d-de0c-4cec-93b0-a82024800c07).

> [!NOTE]
> The **Share** action isn't available in the Business Central app for mobile devices.

## First-time sign in from Business Central

When you use the **Open in OneDrive** or **Share** action for the first time, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] does the following things:

1. Opens the **Please review terms and conditions** page. Read the page, and if you agree with the terms and conditions, select **Agree** to continue.
2. Creates a folder named [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in OneDrive. 
3. Within the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] folder, it creates a folder with the same name as the company you're working in. If you work in more than one company, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates a folder for each company you're working in when you use the **Open in OneDrive** or **Share** action. 
4. Puts a copy of the file you selected in the company name folder, and then opens the file. 

Then, the next time you use the **Open in OneDrive** or **Share** action, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] only copies and opens the file. 

## Managing multiple copies of a file

When you choose **Open in OneDrive** or **Share**, the file is copied from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to your folder in OneDrive. If you edit the file in OneDrive, that file will be different from the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] file. To update [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with the latest file version, remove the existing file from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and upload the latest copy.

If a file with the same name already exists in OneDrive, you'll be given the following choices:

- **Use existing**

  This option opens or shares the file that's already stored in OneDrive, instead of copying the file from Business Central.
  
- **Replace**
  
  This option replaces the existing file in OneDrive with the file you selected from Business Central. The original file isn't lost&mdash;you can see and restore it using the version history in OneDrive. Learn more at [Restore a previous version of a file stored in OneDrive](https://support.microsoft.com/office/restore-a-previous-version-of-a-file-stored-in-onedrive-159cad6d-d76e-4981-88ef-de6e96c93893).

- **Keep both**

  This option keeps the existing file as-is and saves the file you selected from Business Central under a different name. The new name is similar to the existing name, except with a suffix number such  “Items (2).xlsx”.

## About your Business Central folder on OneDrive

The folder and its content are private until you decide to share them with others. So you might decide to share content with one or more of your coworkers, or even people outside of your organization. 

You can access your OneDrive from the **My Settings** page by choosing the link in the **Cloud Storage** field. Learn more at [Share OneDrive files and folders](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/share-onedrive-files-and-folders-9fcc2f7d-de0c-4cec-93b0-a82024800c07).

# Export your business data to Excel

Excel is a powerful tool to work with data. From inside [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can open any list in Excel. You can even modify data in Excel and then submit it back to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The same capability makes it easy for you to take your data with you if you decide to cancel your subscription.

## Opening and exporting lists in Excel

You can open data in Excel from any journal, list, or worksheet. You just open the page that you want, and then choose **Open in Excel**. For example, open the list of customers (search for **Customers**), and then choose **Open in Excel**. Your browser prompts you to open or save the generated Excel workbook.  

> [!NOTE]
> Use this option when you don't want to publish your changes back to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

Each list includes some columns. The export to Excel includes any columns that are in your current view. Change the columns by opening the shortcut menu for any column, and then specifying which columns that you want to see. The list of columns is different for most lists. The columns reflect the structure in the database that stores your data. If you aren't sure what type of data a certain column contains, add it to your view. You can always remove it again.  

Learn more in [View and edit in Excel from Business Central](across-work-with-excel.md).

### Edit data in Excel

Your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] experience includes an add-in for Excel so you can edit data in Excel. Learn more in [Analyzing Financial Statements in Microsoft Excel](finance-analyze-excel.md).  

## Exporting data to other finance systems

If you decide to cancel your subscription for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can export your data to Excel and take it with you to your next finance system.  

You can export all pages, but that might be more than you really need. Consider exporting the following essential pages, and remember to add all columns:  

* Chart of Accounts  
* Customers  
* Vendors  
* Banks  
* Items  

If you want to export all your financial transactions, it's a large amount of data, so the export often takes more than a few minutes. The financial transactions are shown on the **General Ledger Entries** page.  

We recommend that you also consider exporting data from the following pages:  

* Customer Ledger Entries  
* Vendor Ledger Entries  
* Bank Account Ledger Entries  
* Item Ledger Entries  
* General Posting Setup  
* Customer Posting Groups  
* Vendor Posting Groups  
* Item Posting Groups  
* Bank Posting Group  
* G/L Budgets  
* G/L Budget Entries  
* Sales Quotes  
* Sales Invoices  
* Purchase Invoices  
* Contacts  
* Salespeople  

> [!NOTE]  
> If you have set up more than one company in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you must export the relevant data from each company.

> [!NOTE]
> You must have at least one of the following permissions to open or edit data in Excel:
>
> * Permission set *D365 Excel Export Action*  
> * System permission 6110 *Allow Action Export To Excel*.  

For more information, see [Get an overview of a user's permissions](ui-define-granular-permissions.md#get-an-overview-of-a-users-permissions).

# Ad-hoc analysis of sales data

This article explains how to use the **Data Analysis** feature to analyze sales data directly from list pages and queries. You don't have to run a report or switch to another application, such as Excel. The feature provides an interactive and versatile way to calculate, summarize, and examine data. Instead of running reports using options and filters, you can add multiple tabs that represent different tasks or views on the data. Some examples are "My customers" or "Sales statistics," or any other view you can imagine. To learn more about how to use the **Data Analysis** feature, go to [Analyze list and query data with analysis mode](analysis-mode.md).

Use the following list pages for ad-hoc analysis of sales processes:

- [Sales Orders](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=9305&layout=analysis)
- General Ledger Entries
- [Customer Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=25&layout=analysis)
- Item Ledger Entries
- Posted Sales Invoices
- Sales Return Orders

## Sales ad-hoc analysis scenarios

Use the **Data Analysis** feature for quick fact checking and ad-hoc analysis:

- If you don't want to run a report.
- If a report for your specific need doesn't exist.
- If you want to quickly iterate to get a good overview on a part of your business.

The following sections provide examples of sales scenarios in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

| Area | To... | Open this page in analysis mode | Using these fields |
| ---- | ----- | ------------------------------- |------------------- |
| [Sales (expected sales volume)](#example-sales-expected-sales-volume) | Analyze your expected sales volume. | [Sales Orders](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=9305&layout=analysis) | **Sell-to Customer Name**, **Sell-to Customer No.**, **No.** , **Amount**, **Document Date Year**, and **Document Date Month**. |
| [Sales (Customer sales by volume)](#example-sales-customer-sales-by-volume) | Get an overview of the customers that purchase the most, or that owe the most. | [Customer Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=25&layout=analysis) | **Customer Name**, **Document No.**, **Amount**, and **Remaining Amount**. |
| [Finance (Accounts Receivables)](#example-finance-accounts-receivables) | See what your customers owe you, for example, broken down into time intervals for when amounts are due. | [Customer Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=25&layout=analysis) | **Customer Name**, **Due Date**, and **Remaining Amount**. |

## Example: Sales (expected sales volume)

To analyze your expected sales volume and sales amounts for unshipped orders for each customer by year or month, follow these steps:

1. Open the [Sales Orders](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=9305&layout=analysis) list and turn on analysis mode.
1. Go to the **Columns** menu and remove all columns (select the box next to the **Search** field).
1. Turn on **Pivot** mode (located directly above the **Search** field).
1. Drag the **Sell-to Customer Name**, **Sell-to Customer No.**, and **No.** fields to the **Row Groups** area. Drag the fields in that order.
1. Drag the field **Amount** field to the **Values** area.
1. Drag the **Document Date Year** and **Document Date Month** fields to the **Column Labels** area. Drag the fields in that order.
1. To do the analysis for a given year or quarter, apply a filter in the **Additional Filters** menu. The menu is on the right of the page, just below the **Columns** menu.
1. Rename your analysis tab to **Expected sales volume** or something that describes this analysis for you.

## Example: Sales (Customer sales by volume)

To produce an overview of the customers that purchase the most or that owe the most, follow these steps:

1. Open the [Customer Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=25&layout=analysis) list, and switch on analysis mode.
1. Go to the **Columns** menu and remove all columns (select the box next to the **Search** field).
1. Drag the **Customer Name** field to the **Row Groups** area, and the **Document No.** field below it.
1. Choose the **Amount** and **Remaining Amount** fields.
1. To do the analysis for a given year or quarter, apply a filter in the **Additional Filters** menu. The menu is on the right of the page, just below the **Columns** menu.
1. Rename your analysis tab to **Customer by sales volume**, or something that describes this analysis for you.

The following image shows the result of these steps.

## Example: Finance (Accounts Receivables)

To see what your customers owe you, maybe broken down into time intervals for when amounts are due, follow these steps:

1. Open the [Customer Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=25&layout=analysis) list and turn on analysis mode.
1. On the **Columns** menu, remove all columns (select the box next to the **Search** field).
1. Turn on **Pivot** mode (located directly above the **Search** field).
1. Drag the **Customer Name** field to the **Row Groups** area, and drag the **Remaining Amount** field to the **Values** area.
1. Drag the **Due Date Month** field to the **Column Labels** area.
1. To do the analysis for a given year or quarter, apply a filter in the **Additional Filters** menu. The menu is on the right of the page, just below the **Columns** menu.
1. Rename your analysis tab to **Aged Accounts by Month**, or something that describes this analysis for you.

## Data foundation for ad-hoc analysis on sales

After you enter information on a sales order and add all the sales order lines, you can post the order. Posting creates a shipment and an invoice. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] updates the customer's account, general ledger, and item ledger entries:

- For each sales order, a sales entry is created on the **G/L Entry** table. An entry is also created in the customer's account in the **Cust. Ledger Entry** table and a general ledger entry is created in the relevant receivables account. In addition, posting the order might result in a VAT entry and a general ledger entry for the discount amount.
- For each sales order line, an item ledger entry is created in the **Item Ledger Entry** table (if the sales lines contain item numbers) or a general ledger entry is created in the **G/L Entry** table (if the sales lines contain a general ledger account). In addition, sales orders are always recorded in the **Sales Shipment Header** and **Sales Invoice Header** tables.

To learn more about posting sales, go to [Posting sales](ui-post-sales.md).

# Audit changes to financial reporting

Financial reporting helps you gather insights into the financial data in your chart of accounts (COA). This article explains ways to monitor changes to your financial report definitions, and how to control access to financial reports.

## Set up the Change Log for financial report definitions

You can use the Change Log feature to capture changes users make to the definitions for financial reports. [!INCLUDE [include-audit-what-who-when](includes/include-audit-what-who-when.md)] 

The following table lists the table for financial report definitions and their IDs.

| Table | Table ID |
|------ | -------- |
| Report Definition       | 88  |
| Row Definition          | 84  |
| Column Definition       | 333 |

[!INCLUDE [include-audit-changes-to-setup-learn-more-link](includes/include-audit-changes-to-setup-learn-more-link.md)]

## Get notified when financial report definitions change

To add an extra layer of security around your financial report definitions, you can monitor changes to their fields and get an email when someone changes a value. 

To learn more, go to [Get notified when system setup change](across-setup-auditing.md#get-notified-when-system-setup-change)

## Analyze changes to financial report definitions

You can use the Data Analysis feature to answer questions such as:

- Which definition changed?
- Who changed it, and when?

To learn more, go to [Analyze changes to your setup](across-setup-auditing.md#analyze-changes-to-your-setup).

## Permissions to view or edit financial reports

The following table lists the permission sets that control whether you can view or edit financial reports and their report definitions.

| Access   | Permission set |
|------------------------| ---------------------- |
| View financial reports. | **Account Schedules - View** |
| Edit financial report definitions, including row and column definitions. | **Account Schedules - Edit** |

# The Late Payment Prediction extension

Effectively managing receivables is important to the overall financial health of a business. To reduce outstanding receivables and help you fine-tune your collections strategy, the extension predicts whether to expect late payments. For example, if a payment is predicted to be late, you might decide to adjust the terms of payment or the payment method for the customer.

## Get started

When you open a posted sales document, a notification displays at the top of the page. To use the Late Payment Prediction Extension, opt in by choosing **Enable** in the notification. Alternatively, you can set up the extension manually. For example, if you regret dismissing the notification.

To enable the extension manually, follow these steps:

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Late Payment Prediction Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary.

> [!NOTE]
> If you decide to enable the extension manually, be aware that [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will not allow you to do so if the quality of the model is low. The quality of the model indicates how accurate the model's predictions are likely to be. Several factors can impact the quality of a model. For example, there might not have been enough data, or there wasn't enough variation in the data. You can view the quality of the model you're currently using on the **Late Payment Prediction Setup** page. You can also specify a minimum threshold for the model quality.

## View all payment predictions

If you enable the extension, a **Payments Predicted to be Late** tile is available in the **Business Manager** Role Center. The tile displays the number of payments that are predicted to be late, and lets you open the **Customer Ledger Entries** page where you can dig deeper into the posted invoices. There are three columns to pay attention to:  

* **Late Payment** - Indicates whether the payment for the invoice is predicted to be late.
* **Prediction Confidence** - Indicates how reliable you should consider the prediction to be. **High** means that the prediction is at least 90% sure, **Medium** is between 80% and 90%, and **Low** is below 80%.
* **Prediction Confidence %** - Shows the actual percentage behind the confidence rating. By default, this column is hidden, but you can add it if you want. For more information, see [Personalize Your Workspace](ui-personalization-user.md).

> [!TIP]
> The Customer Ledger Entries page shows a FactBox. While you're reviewing predictions, the information in the **Customer Details** section can be helpful. When you choose the invoice in the list, the section shows information about the customer. It also lets you take immediate action. For example, if a customer frequently misplaces their wallet, you can open the Customer card from the FactBox and block the customer for future sales.  

## Design details

Microsoft deploys and operates predictive web services in all regions where [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is available. Access to these web services is included in your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] subscription. For more information, see the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central Licensing Guide. The guide is available for download on the [Business Central](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/business-central/overview/) website.

The web services work in three modes:

* Train model. The web service trains the model based on the provided dataset.
* Evaluate model. The web service checks whether the model returns reliable data for the provided dataset.
* Predict. Web-service applies the model to the provided dataset to make a prediction.

These web services are stateless, meaning they use data only to calculate predictions on demand. They don't store data.

> [!NOTE]  
> You can use your own predictive web service instead of ours. For more information, see [Create and use your own predictive web service late payment prediction](#AnchorText).

### Data required to train and evaluate the model

For each **Customer ledger entry** that has a related **Posted Sales Invoice**:

* Amount in local currency, including tax
* Payment terms in days are calculated as **Due Date** minus **Posting Date**
* Whether there's an applied credit memo

Additionally, the record has aggregated data from other invoices that are related to the same customer.

- Total number and amounts on paid invoices
- Total number and amounts on invoices that were paid late
- Total number and amounts on outstanding invoices
- Total number and amounts on outstanding invoices that are already late
- Average days late
- Ratio: Number of paid late/paid invoices
- Ratio: Amount paid late/paid invoices
- Ratio: Number of outstanding late/outstanding invoices
- Ratio: Amounts on outstanding late/outstanding invoices

> [!NOTE]
> The information about the customer isn't included in the dataset.

### Standard model and My model

The Late Payment Prediction extension's predictive model is trained on data that represents a range of small to medium-sized businesses. When you start posting invoices and receiving payments, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] evaluates whether the standard model fits your business flow.

If your processes don't match the standard model, you can use the extension but you need to get more data. Just continue to use [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

> [!NOTE]
> We use a bit of your compute time each week when we evaluate and re-train the model.

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] runs training and evaluation automatically when enough paid and late invoices are available. However, you can run it manually whenever you want.

#### To train and use your model

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Late Payment Prediction Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. In the **Selected Model** field, choose **My Model**.
3. Choose the **Create My Model** action, to train model on your data.  

## <a name="AnchorText"> </a>Create and use your own predictive web service for late payment prediction

For [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, the model is published by Microsoft and connected to the Microsoft subscription. For other deployment options, you have to create Machine Learning resources in your own Azure subscription. You can find sample steps in the [sample repo](https://github.com/microsoft/BCTech/tree/master/samples/MachineLearning). The purpose of this task is to get the API URI and API key.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Late Payment Prediction Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **Use My Azure Subscription** check box.
3. On the **Use My Azure Subscription** FastTab, enter the API URL and API key for your model.

# Set Up Units of Measure

As part of setting up your [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you set up general units of measure on the **Units of Measure** page. Then, when you register new items, you specify the base unit of measure on the **Item Card** page. You can also add units of measure later.  

You can set up multiple units of measure for an item:

- Assign a base unit of measure to the item on the Item Card page. The base unit of measure defines how you store it in inventory and is the basis for conversion to alternate units of measure.
- Assign alternate units of measure to purchase, production, or sales documents to specify how many units of the base unit of measure you handle at a time in those processes. For example, you might buy the item on pallets and only use single pieces in your production.

If an item is stocked in one unit of measure but produced in another, a production order is created that uses a manufacturing batch unit of measure to calculate the correct quantity of the components during the **Refresh Production Order** batch job. An example of a manufacturing batch unit of measure calculation is when a manufactured item is stocked in pieces but produced in tons. To learn more, go to [Work with Manufacturing Batch Units of Measure](production-how-to-use-the-manufacturing-batch-unit-of-measure.md).  

Another tool that makes it easier to work with multiple units of measure for items is the ability to specify a rounding precision for base units of measure. Specifying a rounding precision provides guidance on what someone should enter for a given business process, and helps reduce rounding issues. When you use alternate units of measure, the value in the **Qty. per Unit of Measure** field helps calculate the quantity in the base unit of measure, which can lead to rounding issues. For example, imagine you're receiving one box that contains six items. When the box arrives at your warehouse, you discover that one of the six items is missing. You decide not to post the receipt of one box, but instead change the quantity received to five of six pieces. That decision would lead to a receipt of 4.99998 pieces, rather than five. On the **Item Units of Measure** page, the **Quantity Rounding Precision** field lets you specify a value that converts the quantity to a number that's easier to understand. Continuing with the example, we would enter **1** in the field to round up to an even five pieces.

## To set up units of measure

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Units of Measure**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action. A new empty line is inserted.  
3. Fill in the fields. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  
4. If you know that your organization sells items with this unit of measure to customers in other countries/regions, you can add translations.  
    1. Select the code for which you want to set up translations, and then choose the **Translations** action.
    2. In the **Language Code** field, select the drop-down arrow to see a list of available language codes. Select the language code for which you want to enter a translation, and then choose the OK button to copy the code to the field.
    3. In the **Description** field, enter the appropriate text.
5. Repeat the previous steps for any other units of measure that you want to add.  

When you register a new item, you can choose the base unit of measure from the list of units of measure that you set up. You can also set up multiple units of measure for an item.  

## To set up multiple item units of measure

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the card of the item for which you want to set up alternate units of measure.
3. Choose the **Units of Measure** action. The **Item Units of Measure** page opens.
4. If the **Base Unit of Measure** field on the item card is filled, then that unit of measure is already set up.
5. Choose the **New** action. A new empty line is inserted.
6. In the **Code** field, enter the name of the unit of measure. Alternatively, choose the field to select from the unit of measure codes that are in the database.
7. In the **Qty. per Unit of Measure** field, enter how many units of the base unit of measure the new unit of measure contains.
8. Optionally, in the **Height**, **Width**, **Length**, and **Weight** fields, specify precise information about the size of one unit of measure so that the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can calculate how many of each item unit can be placed in any given bin. The **Cubage** field is calculated automatically based on **Height**, **Width**, and **Length**.

    If any of these fields contain a value other than 0, then that measure is used during all processes that involve placing items in a bin: put-away, movements, receipts, shipments, picks, and adjustments. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] checks the sum of each physical measure of the items being put away. It also checks the items already in the bin against the maximum size or other measure that can fit into a bin. This information comes from the bin capacity policy on the location card where you store this item. In other words, you must use the same unit measure for each dimension across all item units of measure - use kilograms or pounds for weight, for example, but be consistent.
9. Repeat steps 5 through 7 to set up all the alternate units of measure that you want to use in different processes for this item.

    In the **Base Unit of Measure** field at the bottom of the window, you can view or change the item's base unit of measure. You can also change the base unit of measure in the **Base Unit of Measure** field on the item card. In the **Item Units of Measure** page, the base unit of measure must have the value **1** in the **Qty. per Unit of Measure** field.

You can now use the alternate units of measure on purchase, production, and sales documents. To learn more, go to [To enter a default unit of measure code for sales and purchasing transactions](#to-enter-a-default-unit-of-measure-code-for-sales-and-purchasing-transactions).  

## To set up unit of measure translations

When you sell items to foreign customers, you might want to specify the unit of measure in the customer's language. You can do that by specifying translations for units of measure.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Units of Measure**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the code for which you want to set up translations, and then choose the **Translations** action.
3. In the **Language Code** field, select the drop-down arrow to see a list of available language codes. Select the language code for which you want to enter a translation, and then choose the OK button to copy the code to the field.
4. In the **Description** field, enter the appropriate text.
5. Repeat steps 2 through 4 for the unit of measure codes and the languages for which you want to enter translations.

## To enter a default unit of measure code for sales and purchasing transactions

If you usually buy or sell in units different from the base unit of measure, you can specify separate units of measure for purchases and sales. To use separate units of measure, set up the units of measure on the **Item Units of Measure** page.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the relevant item card for which you want to specify a default sales or purchase unit of measure code.
3. For sales, on the **Invoicing** FastTab, in the **Sales Unit of Measure** field, open the **Item Units of Measure** page.
4. For purchasing, on the **Replenishment** FastTab, in the **Purch. Unit of Measure** field, open the **Item Units of Measure** page.
5. Select the code you want to set up as the default unit of measure for sales or purchasing respectively, and then choose the **OK** button.

# The tax file formats (DK) extension
If you engage in trade with companies, or internal branches or subsidiaries, in other EU countries/regions you must report information about the activities to SKAT and to Statistics Denmark. If you use the VAT and Intrastat reporting features in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], this extension can ensure that the file you export is compatible with requirements from these organizations. The extension adds the MS-ECSL Report Export File and Intrastat Export Lines submission codeunits to your VAT Report configuration, so you can export data in the new format right away.

The extension is free, you just need to install it.

# Save and personalize list views

When you set a filter on a list and you want to keep the filter for later, you can save it as a view. To learn more about filtering lists, go to [Set filters on lists](ui-enter-criteria-filters.md#set-filters-on-lists).

If views exist, the **Views** group appears at the top of the filter pane. Views are variations of the list that is preconfigured with filters. You can define and save as many views as you want per list. The views will be available the next time you open the list, from any device or browser.

[!INCLUDE [about-ui-learn](includes/about-ui-learn.md)]

## To save a view

1. Open any list page.
2. Select ![Filter pane icon.](media/open-filter-pane-icon.png "Filter pane icon") at the top of the list or select <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>F3</kbd>.
3. Set one or more new filters. To learn more, go to [Set filters on lists](ui-enter-criteria-filters.md#set-filters-on-lists).
4. When you set  the filters, choose the ![Save View.](media/save_view_icon.png "Save View") icon.

    If you set a filter for a list view that was already saved as a view, the existing view updates when you save.
5. If you're saving a new view, enter a name for the view in the **All (Copy)** box, such as "Items I own".
6. To accept the name, select the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key or move the cursor from the text box.

If you don't give it a name, the default name is **All (Copy)**.

> [!TIP]
> Not seeing the ![Save View](media/save_view_icon.png "Save View") icon? To learn more, go to [Why don't I have a Save icon](/dynamics365/business-central/ui-views-faq#save).

## To rename or remove a view

1. For the view that currently displays the list, choose the ![Show more options.](media/show-more-options-icon.png "Show more options") icon to see which options are available.
2. Choose either the **Rename** or the **Remove** action.

## Managing Many Views

As the number of views on a page grows, you might need more control over how views are presented in the filter pane. With the **Personalizing** banner, you can hide unwanted views or reorder your views to get the perfect sequence. To learn more, go to [Personalize Your Workspace](ui-personalization-user.md).

# General Ledger Entries (Power BI report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **General Ledger Entries** report provides a detailed view of individual entries from the general ledger, so you can quickly filter and locate specific entries. This report is a valuable tool for tracking financial transactions, reconciliation, and facilitating efficient audits by giving easy access to detailed entry information.

:::image type="content" source="media/finance/general-ledger-entries-report.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the General Ledger Entries report" lightbox="media/finance/general-ledger-entries-report.png":::

## Use the report

The audiences for the report are:

- Finance managers
- Finance staff

Finance managers use the report to reconcile transactions for a specific fiscal period. By filtering the report to display only entries from that period, you can systematically review all recorded transactions. This process helps you find discrepancies, such as missing entries or erroneous amounts, and ensure that the general ledger accurately reflects the company's activities. Once reconciled, you can confidently prepare financial statements and provide insights into the organization's financial health for that period.

<!-- ## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The *General Ledger Entries* report includes the following KPIs and measures: 

- [**Amount**](####) -->

## Data used in the report

The report uses data from the following table in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]:

- General Ledger Entries

# Reconcile payments that can't be applied automatically
You might sometimes have to handle payments to your bank account that can't be applied to a related open customer, vendor, or bank account ledger entry. Reasons might be that no document exists in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] that the payment can be applied to, or the related document in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] has a different amount than the transaction amount, for example, because of currency exchange. On the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page, all transaction amounts for payments that aren't yet applied appear in the **Difference** field, including amounts that can't be applied because of reasons such as the above.

The methods for resolving these types of unapplied payments:
* Apply manually
* Use text-to-account mapping
* Transfer an excess amount to a journal line to create and post the required entry, such as a refund of an overpayment.

Payments that can't be applied can appear on payment reconciliation journal lines in the following different ways:

* The value in the **Difference** field is equal to the value in the **Transaction Amount** field, which indicates that no part of the payment can be applied to a related open customer, vendor, or bank account ledger entry.
* The value in the **Difference** field is lower than the value in the **Transaction Amount** field, which indicates that a part of the payment can be applied to a related open customer, vendor, or bank account ledger entry. The remaining part of the payment can't be applied and must be reconciled manually or by posting it directly to an account.

To reconcile such payments, you can choose the **Transfer Difference to Account** action and then specify to which account the amount in the **Difference** field will be posted when you post the payment reconciliation journal. You can do this either from the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page or from the **Payment Application Review** page that you open by choosing the value in the **Match Confidence** field or by choosing the **Difference** field.

> [!TIP]  
>   Similar functionality exists to set up automatic reconciliation of recurring payments that cannot be applied to related open customer, vendor, or bank account ledger entries. For more information, see [Map Text on Recurring Payments to Accounts for Automatic Reconciliation](receivables-how-map-text-recurring-payments-accounts-auto-reconcilliation.md).

## To reconcile payments that can't be applied automatically
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Payment Reconciliation Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open a payment reconciliation journal. For more information, see [Reconcile Payments Using Automatic Application](receivables-how-reconcile-payments-auto-application.md).
3. Choose the **Transfer Difference to Account**. The **Transfer Difference to Account** page opens.
4. In the **Account Type** field, specify if the type of account that the payment amount will be posted to.
5. In the **Account No.** field, specify the account that the payment amount will be posted to.
6. In the **Description** field, specify text that describes this direct payment posting. By default, the text in the **Transaction Text** field on the payment reconciliation journal line is inserted.
7. Choose the **OK** button.

If the value in the **Difference** field was equal to the value in the **Transaction Amount** field when you post the payment reconciliation journal, the whole payment on the journal line will be posted directly to the specified balancing account.

If the value in the **Difference** field was lower than the value in the **Transaction Amount** field, then an additional journal line will be created with the same text and date and with the difference inserted in the **Transaction Amount** field. On the original journal line, the difference will be deducted from the value in the **Transaction Amount** field, and the payment will remain applied to its related customer, vendor, or bank account ledger entry. When you post the payment reconciliation journal, one part of the payment will be posted as an applied payment. The other part of the payment will be posted directly to the specified account.

# Moving Items

You can move items in your warehouse in different ways, depending on how you've configured your warehouse. The complexity can vary:

* Small warehouses might use basic warehouse configurations to handle orders individually, in a single or multiple steps.
* Large warehouses might use advanced configurations where all warehouse activities are coordinated by a directed workflow. Learn more at [Setting Up Warehouse Management](warehouse-setup-warehouse.md).

Items may need to be moved between bins, for example, due to internal operations:

* A production order needs components delivered, or its finished items put away.
* A warehouse manager wants to optimize space.
* Unplanned movements to and from operations.
* Replenish picking bins or shop floor bins.
* Update bin contents.

Counting, adjusting, and reclassifying items can involve warehouse tasks that must be performed on warehouse entries before they can be synchronized with item ledger entries. Learn more at [Count, Adjust, and Reclassify Inventory](inventory-how-count-adjust-reclassify.md).

# FAQ for Sales Order Agent (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]

These frequently asked questions (FAQ) describe the AI impact of the Sales Order Agent feature in Business Central.

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/production-ready-preview-dynamics365.md)]
<!--[!INCLUDE [limited-public-preview](includes/limited-public-preview.md)]-->

## What is Sales Order Agent?

Sales Order Agent is an integrated AI agent that automates the task of handling requests for sales quotes and sales orders from customers. The agent can manage the entire sales order capturing process, from receiving a customer's order by email, locating the customer among the registered customers in Business Central, checking item availability, preparing a quote with the requested items, following up with the customer on any changes needed to finalize the quote, receiving quote approval, and converting it to a sales order.

Learn more in [Process sales quotes and orders with Sales Order Agent](sales-order-agent-process.md).

## What are the capabilities of Sales Order Agent?

The agent supports handling requests for sales quotes and sales orders from customers with the following capabilities:

- Agent configuration

  The agent is available directly within Business Central. You can configure and activate the agent to help your team or organization improve the sales process. For example, you can specify the users who can participate in the process of reviewing and approving the sales documents created by the agent. You can also specify the mailbox for receiving the customer requests and settings for searching your items and involving the users to review the agent's work.

  Learn more in [Set up Sales Order Agent](sales-order-agent-setup.md).

- Task execution and interaction

  The agent operates based on its instructions and user configuration. The instructions describe its purpose, tasks, and high-level considerations for how to perform the flow. These instructions are defined in the agent code and aren't visible to users. The agent uses AI to identify and carry out the steps needed to complete its task within the Business Central environment. Learn more in [Sales Order Agent overview](sales-order-agent.md).

  The agent is invoked by a built-in email dispatcher that runs as a scheduled task and monitors the company mailbox specified in the agent's configuration. The dispatcher hands over emails received from the customers to Sales Order Agent and sends results of the agent's work, such as prepared sales quote with requested items, in response.
  
- Access and permissions

  The agent runs as its own user in Business Central and is granted access only to the necessary parts of the product. It comes with a predefined permission set and UI role (profile) that limits the parts of the product and UI elements (such as pages, fields, and actions) it can access.

- Transparency and change control

  The agent seeks user intervention in specific situations, such as preparing outbound communications or providing business review and approval for key operations.

  Business Central maintains full transparency and provides control over changes made by the agent. The agent brings humans in the loop when their attention is required by issuing in-product notifications that are displayed on the role center. For example, a notification occurs before any outbound email communications to a customer, when the agent needs more details to get unblocked, or when approval is needed for important changes.  

  For each task performed by the agent, users get a detailed timeline that shows the key steps taken by the agent and human users, including the email conversation. Users can review this information and update the values and actions the agent suggested if needed. Business Central can also display the reasoning used by the agent and citations that led to a suggested value.

## What is the intended use of Sales Order Agent?

Sales Order Agent is intended to handle the end-to-end sales order capturing process. This process includes:

- Taking the customer’s order by email.
- Iterating on the details with the customer via email.
- Checking the availability of the items.
- Preparing the sales quote with the requested items.
- Sending the quote to the customer for approval.
- Converting the quote to a sales order upon receiving customer confirmation.

## How was Sales Order Agent evaluated? What metrics are used to measure performance?

We defined a set of categories and scenarios and created test cases for each as described in the following table. In total, we have a suite of 50 test cases.

|Category|Scenario|
|-|-|
|Quotes<br><br>Precise request for a quote with variations (delivery dates or not, terse/verbose request, complete or incomplete email signature) |<ul><li>Single/multi-turn with approval by customer. Up to three items.</li><li>Quote request for four or more items.</li><li>Request for quote by item reference. Up to three lines.</li><li>Quote sent but not approved by customer.</li><li>Quote request from unknown customer.</li><li>Quote request for unknown item.</li></ul>|
|Information<br><br>Requests for information about items followed by a quote request|<ul><li>Single and multi-turn with quote based on information.</li><li>Request for information about unknown items.</li></ul>|

## What are the limitations of Sales Order Agent? How can users minimize the impact of the Sales Order Agent limitations when using the system?

- Languages

  - [!INCLUDE[soa-language-support](includes/soa-language-support.md)]
  - Mixed language input might result in lower-quality output because the system relies on pure string similarity, and the semantic part of the matching might not work properly.

- Emailing

  - The agent reads inbound emails via a shared inbox on Microsoft Exchange. Learn more in [Set up email](admin-how-setup-email.md). Other ways to receive email aren't supported.
  - The agent only uses the email body to get the details of the request; it doesn't process files attached to emails.  
  - Large emails might exceed the number of tokens that can be processed in one request. This condition leads the agent to trigger a request for a human to investigate (similar to how a human is requested to approve whether the agent approves an email). 
  - Email messages generated by the agent might contain incorrect information. The agent is designed to ask a human to review and edit every outbound message if necessary.  

- Entities and data the agent can work with

  - The agent is designed to work with sales quotes and sales orders. It can't create or work with other sales documents (such as blank orders, invoices, or credit memos) or documents in other areas of the product (such as purchase or service orders).
  - The agent doesn't create new items, contacts, or customers. It only works with the entities that are already registered in Business Central. The agent is designed to ask a human user to provide additional information or perform the task manually, when it can't find this data in Business Central.
  - The agent doesn't post documents.
  - Based on more customer requests, the agent can make changes to the sales quotes, but not to the sales orders.
  - The agent is designed to work with sales lines of type "Item"; other sales line types, such as Resource, Charge (Item), Allocation Account, and Fixed Asset, aren't supported.
  - At this stage, the agent supports the creation of up to 15 item lines per sales document. Increasing the number of lines might result in lower-quality output.
  - How you name your products can affect agent output. For example, using cryptic abbreviations versus friendly names can reduce output quality.

- When adding items to a sales document, the use of the item's **Variant Code** isn't currently supported. It leaves the **Variant Code** field empty.

- Pricing and discount requests

   Business Central has an advanced price/discount calculation logic, often extended by ISV solutions. Therefore, the most reliable way to get the item price is to create a sales document—for example, a quote. For this reason, the agent is designed *not* to provide or update any pricing and discount information by email. Prices and default discounts are calculated by Business Central's own business logic and included with a sales quote document. Requests for changing discounts and pricing aren't accepted by the agent. Instead, they're surfaced to the users for applying them manually. 

- Other considerations

  - Delegated administrators can't activate the agent.  
  - It's only possible to configure and use one Sales Order Agent per Business Central company.
  - The agent uses the regional settings specified by its user account.
  - While the agent can recognize and interact with the custom fields and actions introduced by customizations and ISV solutions, which are added to the agent's profile and permissions, the results might vary in quality and should be thoroughly tested. Improving reliability of working with the custom elements might require adjustments to the agent's instructions, which is currently not supported. 
  
## What operational factors and settings allow for effective and responsible use of the feature?

- Access control and permissions

  Sales Order Agent can be granted access exclusively to specific parts of the product required to perform its designated tasks. The agent comes with predefined permissions and a user interface (UI) role, also known as a profile, that an administrator or configuring user can assign to the agent. This assignment restricts the agent's access to certain areas of the product. It defines the type of access (for example, whether the agent is only allowed to read specific data or also update or delete it) and determines which UI elements—such as pages, fields, actions, and FactBoxes—it can interact with.  

  We strongly encourage using the permission sets and the profile included with the Sales Order Agent, which can be assigned on the Agent card. This practice ensures that the agent only has access to the functionalities necessary for its role, enhancing both security and efficiency within the system.

  Learn more in [Set up Sales Order Agent](sales-order-agent-setup.md).

- Transparency and notifications

  Business Central users can maintain full transparency and control over the changes made by Sales Order Agent by using other experiences that enable them to:

  - Receive notifications on the role center that come from the agent when it requires help or when the process demands human review. For example, review is required for all inbound and outbound messages, approvals, adding missing data, and similar reasons.
  - Get a better understanding of the specific task context and history (“timeline” view), including key steps involved in it.
  - Get a detailed review of each entity created by the agent (for example, a sales quote or sales order that surfaces all changes and suggestions made by the agent within a specific task. This behavior allows humans to review and adjust changes, and then sign out on proceeding with the task.
  - Get an overview of the agent's key performance indicators (KPIs) that summarize the impact of the agent's work. For example, you can get an overview of the number of sales quotes or orders created by the agent and the total number of these orders.

    Make sure you attend to the notifications raised by the agent to review and approve its work.  
- All actions done by the agent, including creating and modifying records and calling actions, carry the agent's user ID. This user ID appears in the same places and in the same way as it does with other users, such as in list views, history, posted documents, notifications, and more.  
- Approval workflows can be used to add an extra layer of control to the tasks done by the agent, as they do with other users. You can set up approval workflows to make the agent create a request for approval for a specific change—for example, to mark the quote as released. The change isn't allowed until another user approves the request. Learn more in [Use Approval Workflows](across-how-use-approval-workflows.md).

## Is this capability extensible?

Currently, this capability isn't extensible by partners.

# Create production orders

Typically, businesses use the planning engine to create production orders automatically to fulfill a known demand. To learn more, go to [Planning](production-planning.md). However, you can create a production order manually. This article describes how to create a firm planned production order. You can also create production orders with a different status.  

## To create a production order header

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Firm Planned Prod. Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. In the **No.** field, add the next number in the number series you use for production orders.  
4. In the **Source Type** field, select the source of the production order:

   - **Item**: Standard items that you produce for inventory.
   - **Family**: A predefined family of items that you produce for inventory. To learn more, go to [Work With Production Families](production-how-work-family.md).
   - Sales header: Items are produced for the sales order that you specify in the **Source No.** field.
5. In the **Source No.** field, select the item number, family, or sales header for which to create the production order.  
6. Fill in the **Quantity** and **Due Date** fields according to your specifications.  
7. On the **Lines** FastTab, in the **Item No.** field, specify the item to produce.
8. In the **Due Date** field, specify when the item is needed. For example, for a sales order.

> [!NOTE]
> The **Starting Date-Time** and **Ending Date-Time** fields are automatically filled in based on the item's routing and the value that you enter in the **Due Date** field.

9. In the **Quantity** field, specify how many units to produce on the line.

When production requirements change, such as components or operations, you can quickly replan the production order. To learn more, go to [Replan or Refresh Production Orders Directly](production-how-to-replan-refresh-production-orders.md).

# Analyzing financial statements in Microsoft Excel (obsolete)

> [!NOTE]
> This feature is deprecated and will be removed in a later [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] release. Learn more in [Deprecated features in the base app](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/upgrade/deprecated-features-w1). Learn more about alternative finance reporting in [Financial analytics overview](bi.md).

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides KPIs and get overviews of your company's finances. The following are examples of ways to analyze KPIs and overviews in Excel:

* Open lists in Excel and analyze the data.
* Export heavy financial statements such as your balance sheet or income statement to Excel, analyze the data, and print the reports.  

> [!TIP]
> By default, the reports you can view in Excel are designed to help you analyze the current year. The Income Statement report is an exception, however. That report lets you filter the data to include previous years in your analyses.

## Get the overview and the details in Excel

In the Business Manager and Accountant Role Centers, the **Reports** action lets you choose the financial statements to view in Excel. When you choose a statement, it will be opened in Excel or Excel Online. An add-in connects the data to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. However, you have to sign in with the same account that you use with [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The following table lists the reports and where they're available.  

|Report  |Role Center  |
|---------|---------|
|Balance Sheet                 | Business Manager, Accountant |
|Income Statement              | Business Manager, Accountant |
|Statement of Cash Flows       | Business Manager, Accountant |
|Statement of Retained Earnings| Business Manager, Accountant |
|Sales Taxes Collected         | Business Manager, Accountant |
|Customer Statements           | Business Manager, Accountant |
|Aged Accounts Payable         | Accountant |
|Aged Accounts Receivable      | Accountant |

Let's say you want to dig deeper into your cash flow. From the Business Manager or Accountant Role Center, you can open the **Statement of Cash Flows** report in Excel, but what actually happens is that we export the relevant data for you and create an Excel workbook based on a predefined template. Depending on your browser, you might be prompted to open or save the workbook.  

In Excel, you see a tab where the data is laid out for you on the first worksheet. All the data that was exported is also present in other worksheets in case you need it. You can print the report right away, or you can modify it until you have the overview and the details that you want. Use the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Excel Add-in to further filter and analyze data.  

### Understand the Excel templates

The predefined Excel reports are based on the data in the current company. For example, the demonstration company has set up the chart of accounts to list three cash accounts under *Current Assets*: 10100 **Checking account**, 10200 **Saving account**, and 10300 **Petty Cash**. The accounts have the **Account Subcategory** field set to *Cash*, and it's their combined amount that shows up as *Cash* in the **Balance Sheet** Excel report.  

Other sheets in the Excel workbook show the data behind the report. To find out what's behind the groupings in the Excel reports, you might have to filter the lists in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

## The [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Excel add-in

Your [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] experience includes an add-in for Excel. Depending on your subscription, you're signed in automatically, or you must provide your sign-in details for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. To learn more, go to [Viewing and Editing in Excel From Business Central](across-work-with-excel.md).  

The add-in lets you get fresh data from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], and you can push changes back to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. However, the ability to push data back to the database is not available for the financial reports you can view in Excel.

# Define an invoice posting policy for users

Companies often have unique processes for posting sales and purchase invoices and shipments. For example, processes can vary from one person posting everything on a purchase order, to multiple employees. You can restrict users from posting invoices, or require that invoices are posted together with shipments or receipts.

## To specify a posting policy

On the **User Setup** page, in the **Sales Invoice Posting Policy** and **Purch. Invoice Posting Policy** fields, choose one of the following options:

* **Allowed** (Default) - Keep the current behavior, where a user can choose the posting option to use, such as **Ship**, **Invoice**, and **Ship and Invoice**. 
* **Prohibited** - Prevent the user from posting invoices. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] shows a confirmation dialog that provides only the **Ship** or **Receive** options.
* **Mandatory** - Allow the user to post invoices together with receipts or shipments. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] shows a confirmation dialog with the **Ship and Invoice** or **Receive and Invoice** options.

## Effect on documents

The following table describes how invoice posting policies affect documents.

> [!NOTE]
> When you post sales and purchase invoices and credit memos, you don't have any posting options. The documents always post the physical and financial transactions together. You can't partially post invoices and credit memos.

|Document | Option 1: Allow <br>Displays a series of options| Option 2: Prohibited <br>Confirmation dialog | Option 3: Mandatory <br>Confirmation dialog|
|--|--|--|--|
|Sales order |- Ship <br>- Invoice <br>- Ship and Invoice |Do you want to post the shipment? |Do you want to post the shipment and invoice?|
|Sales invoice|No options| Posting is prohibited per User Setup|Do you want to post the invoice?|
|Sales credit memo|No options|Posting is prohibited per User Setup|Do you want to post the credit memo?|
|Sales return order |- Receive <br>- Invoice <br>- Receive and Invoice |Do you want to post the receipt? |Do you want to post the receipt and invoice?|
|Inventory pick |- Ship <br>- Ship and Invoice |Do you want to post the shipment? |Do you want to post the shipment and invoice?|
|Purchase order |- Receive <br>- Invoice <br>- Receive and Invoice |Do you want to post the receipt? |Do you want to post the receipt and invoice?|
|Purchase invoice|No options|Posting is prohibited per User Setup|Do you want to post the invoice?|
|Purchase credit memo|No options|Posting is prohibited per User Setup|Do you want to post the credit memo?|
|Purchase Return Order |- Ship <br>- Invoice <br>- Ship and Invoice |Do you want to post the shipment? |Do you want to post the shipment and invoice?|
|Inventory Put-away |- Receive <br>- Receive and Invoice |Do you want to post the receipt? |Do you want to post the receipt and invoice?|
|Warehouse Shipment |- Ship <br>- Ship and Invoice | Do you want to post the shipment? |Do you want to post the shipment and invoice?|

   > [!Note]
   > The setting doesn't affect posting of general journal lines where you can select **Invoice** in the **Document Type** field.

# Restructure Warehouses
You may want to restructure your warehouse with new bin codes and new bin characteristics. You will not undertake this kind of activity very often, but situations can occur where a reclassification is necessary to achieve or maintain a more efficient operation. For example:  

- You might want to switch to bin codes that support the use of automatic data capture, for example, with hand-held devices.  
- The warehouse may have purchased a new rack system that gives new possibilities in item storage.  
- The company may have altered its item assortment and moved the warehouse to a new physical location to accommodate this change.  

If your warehouse is set up to use bins but not directed put-away and pick, restructure your warehouse by creating the new bins that you want to use in the future.  

## To restructure a basic warehouse that uses bins only  
1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Locations**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  On the **Warehouse** FastTab, set the **Default Bin Selection** field to **Last-Used Bin**.  
3.  Move all the contents of your current bins to the new bins that you have just created.  

    1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Item Reclassification Journal**, and then choose the related link.  
    2.  Select a journal line, and then choose the **Get Bin Content** action.  
    3.  On the **Bin Content** FastTab, set filters in the **Location Code**, **Bin Code**, and **Item No.** fields to specify the content that you want to move.  
    4.  Choose the **OK** button to fill a journal line.  
    5.  In the **New Bin Code** field, select the bin to which the items should be moved.  
    6.  Repeat steps b through e for all bin content that you want to move.  
    7.  Choose the **Post** action.  

You have now emptied the bins where the items used to be. The default bins for your items have now been changed to the new bins.  

## To restructure an advanced warehouse that uses directed put-away and pick  

1.  Create the new bins that you want to use in the future. For more information, see [Create Bins](warehouse-how-to-create-individual-bins.md).  
2.  Move all the contents of your current bins to the new bins that you just created.  

    1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Warehouse Reclassification Journal**, and then choose the related link.  
    2.  For the bins where no real movement of items is involved, create a line for each of your current bins in the **Warehouse Reclassification Journal** with the old bin code, **From Bin Code**, and the new bin code, **To Bin Code**.  
    3.  If some of the movements involve actual physical movements that you want employees to perform, use **Movement Worksheets** to prepare movement instructions instead of using the warehouse reclassification journal. For more information, see [Move Items in Advanced Warehouse Configurations](warehouse-how-to-move-items-in-advanced-warehousing.md).  

3.  When the old bins are emptied, reclassify them as **QC** type bins to ensure that they are not included in item flows.  

    1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Locations**, and then choose the related link.  
    2.  Select the line with the location, and then choose the **Bins** action.  
    3.  On the **Bins** page, in the **Bin Type Code** field, enter **QC** for each of the old bins that you emptied in step 3 in the previous procedure.  

You have now removed the bins from the warehouse flow, and reclassified them as QC bins. QC bins have none of the activity fields on the **Bin Types** page selected and are therefore not considered by the item flow. For more information, see [Set Up Bin Types](warehouse-how-to-set-up-bin-types.md).  

## To delete a bin  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Locations**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Select the location where you want to delete bins. Choose the **Bins** action.  
3.  Select the lines for the bins that you want to delete.  
4.  Choose the **Delete** action.  

If you choose the **Yes** button, the bin is deleted for use in the future, but the bin code in all warehouse entries remains the same.  

If you want to rename a bin so that all records associated with the bin are also renamed, including bin contents, warehouse activity lines, registered warehouse activity lines, warehouse worksheet lines, warehouse receipt lines, posted warehouse receipt lines, warehouse shipment lines, posted warehouse shipment lines, and warehouse entries, you can do so on the **Bins** page.  

## To rename a bin and change the bin code in all records  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Locations**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Select the location where you want to rename a bin or change the bin code, and then choose the **Bins** action.  
3.  Select the bin that you want to change and enter a new bin code in the **Code** field.  
4.  Choose the **Yes** button.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  If you choose **Yes** and there are many entries concerning this bin, for example, because you have not deleted warehouse documents for some time, it may take some time to rename all the records. Therefore, if you use this method, consider running the batch job **Delete Registered Whse. Documents** before you start the renaming process. Also note that the only documents that are deleted in this batch job are put-aways, picks, and movements.  
>   
>  If you are renaming a receiving bin or a shipping bin, all the posted receipts or shipments that refer to the bin in question are renamed.

# Convert Existing Locations to Warehouse Locations
You can enable an existing inventory location to use zones and bins and to operate as a warehouse location.  

The batch job to enable a location for warehouse operation creates initial warehouse entries for the warehouse adjustment bin for all items that have inventory in the location. These initial entries will be balanced when warehouse physical inventory entries are entered after the batch job is run.  

You can create zones and bins either before or after the conversion. The only bin that you must create before the conversion is the one that is to be used as the future adjustment bin.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  To clear all negative inventory and any open warehouse documents before you convert the location for warehouse handling, run a report to identify the items with negative inventory and open warehouse documents for the location. For more information, see Check on Negative Inventory.  

## To enable an existing location to operate as a warehouse location  
1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Create Warehouse Location**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  In the **Location Code** field, specify the location that you want to enable for warehouse processing.  
3.  In the **Adjustment Bin Code** field, specify the bin at the location where unsynchronized warehouse entries are stored. For more information, see the [To synchronize the adjusted warehouse entries with the related item ledger entries](inventory-how-count-adjust-reclassify.md#to-synchronize-the-adjusted-warehouse-entries-with-the-related-item-ledger-entries).  

    Using the open item ledger entries for the specified location, warehouse journal lines are created that sum up every combination of Item No., Variant Code, Unit of Measure Code, and, if necessary, Lot No. and Serial No. in the item ledger entries. The warehouse journal lines are then posted. This posting creates warehouse entries that place the inventory in the warehouse adjustment bin. The **Adjustment Bin Code** on the location card is also set.  

4.  To see which items were added to the adjustment bin during the batch job, run the **Warehouse Adjustment Bin** report.  
5.  When the **Create Warehouse Location** batch job has completed, perform and post a warehouse physical inventory. For more information, see [Count, Adjust, and Reclassify Inventory Using Journals](inventory-how-count-adjust-reclassify.md).  

> [!NOTE]  
>  It is recommended that you run the **Create Warehouse Location** batch job at a time when it will not impact the daily work in the system. This job processes each entry in the **Item Ledger Entry** table, and if there are a large number of item ledger entries, the job can last several hours.  

 For those locations that did not use warehouse management documents before the conversion, you must re-open and release any source documents that were partially received or partially shipped before the conversion.

# Restrict and allow usage of a record

If you want to restrict a record from being used in certain activities, for example, until the record has been approved, you can add two workflow responses in the workflow that controls the use of the record. One workflow response restricts usage of the record as defined by the workflow event and conditions. The other workflow response allows the use of the record as defined by the workflow event and conditions. Two responses exist in the default version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] for this purpose: **Add record restriction** and **Remove record restriction**.

> [!NOTE]  
> The default version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers support for restricting a record from being posted, from being exported as a payment, and from being printed as a check. To support other restrictions, a Microsoft partner must customize the application code.  

> [!NOTE]  
> The workflow functionality to restrict and allow records from being used is not related to the functionality to block item, customer, and vendor records from being posted.

The following procedure describes how to restrict purchase orders from being posted until they've been approved. The new workflow is based on the *Purchase Invoice Approval Workflow* template.  

## Create a workflow step that restricts posting of unapproved purchase orders

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Workflows**, then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Workflows** page, choose the **New Workflow from Template** action. Learn more at [Create Workflows from Workflow Templates](across-how-to-create-workflows-from-workflow-templates.md).
3. On the **Workflow Templates** page, choose the *Purchase Invoice Approval Workflow* template.  

   Note that the first two workflow steps are about restricting and then allowing usage of purchase invoices. Change the event condition on the first step of the new workflow to specify that it applies to purchase orders.  
4. On the **Workflow Steps** FastTab, choose the **On Condition** field for the first step, then, for the **Document Type** filter, select **Order**.  
5. Proceed to edit, delete, or add other workflow steps to reflect a business process that begins by restricting unapproved purchase orders from being posted.

> Effective February 8 2020, changes in the Microsoft Pay service will affect the Microsoft Pay extension in Microsoft [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_long.md)]. Due to the changes, after February 8, the **Pay now** payment links that the Microsoft Pay extension generates for invoices in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will not open Microsoft Pay. Customers who are using the extension should change their Payment Services setup to start using the PayPal extension instead.<br /></br>
>
> From January 8, we will display a notification in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The notification will contain a link to the settings that you need to change and to more information. After February 8, the Microsoft Pay extension will no longer be available in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].<br /></br>
>
> The changes impact the following versions of Business Central:
> - Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central October 2018
> - Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central April 2019
> - Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central 2019 Release Wave 2

Customers continuously require higher customer service, both in terms of the quality of product but also in terms of delivery and payment services. The Microsoft Pay service helps you increase your customer service.

The Microsoft Pay extension adds a Microsoft Pay link to your sales documents so customers can easily pay using Microsoft Pay. Then you can send the documents by email to provide higher customer service and shorten the time it takes for customers' payments to arrive on your bank account.

The Microsoft Pay extension provides the following benefits:
- Customer payments appear faster on your bank account.
- Customers have more ways to pay invoices.
- Microsoft Pay offers a trustworthy payment service, which customers prefer to entering credit card information on unknown web sites.
- Microsoft Pay offers multiple ways of handling payments, including credit card processing, such as PayPal and Stripe.
- The Microsoft Pay link can be embedded automatically on every invoice document or by the user.
- Because this functionality is built as an extension, it gives you full control to enable it when and if your business processes require it.

Enabling payment service extensions is free in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], however, you'll need to contact the payment service to get an account. For more information, see [Enable Customer Payment Through Payment Services](sales-how-enable-payment-service-extensions.md).

# Liabilities (Power BI report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Liabilities** report provides an overview of your company's financial obligations, highlighting total liabilities, current liabilities, payroll liabilities, and long-term liabilities. It also shows key performance indicators such as debt ratio and dept-to-equity ratio, along with total assets.

These key performance indicators can help you understand the balance between debt and equity while monitoring liabilities that affect future cash flow and operational flexibility.

Drill through into the **Liabilities Drill-Through** page to explore the underlying ledger entries that make up the balance.

:::image type="content" source="media/finance/liabilities-report.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Liabilities report" lightbox="media/finance/liabilities-report.png":::

## Use the report

The audiences for the report are:

- Executives
- Directors
- Other high-level decision makers

Executives can use the report to evaluate your company's financial position before engaging in a new expansive initiative. By first analyzing current liabilities, you can gauge your immediate debt burden. This analysis helps you determine whether there are enough liquid assets to meet short term obligations, and ensure you have cash-flow to support existing operations and new development.

Next, you could assess the debt ratio and debt-to-equity ratios. These key performance indicators provide insight into the company's leverage and risk profile. For example, a high debt-to-equity ratio could indicate that the company has a high reliance on borrowed funds. This type of data can help inform how you decide to finance the expansion project.  

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The *Liabilities* report includes the following KPIs and measures: 

- [**Liabilities**](finance-powerbi-kpis.md#liabilities)
- [**Current Liabilities**](finance-powerbi-kpis.md#current-liabilities)
- [**Payroll Liabilities**](finance-powerbi-kpis.md#payroll-liabilities)
- [**Longterm Liabilities**](finance-powerbi-kpis.md#longterm-liabilities)
- [**Debt Ratio**](finance-powerbi-kpis.md#debt-ratio)
- [**Debt/Equity Ratio**](finance-powerbi-kpis.md#debtequity-ratio)
- [**Assets**](finance-powerbi-kpis.md#assets)
- [**Balance at Date (Neg)**](finance-powerbi-kpis.md#balance-at-date-neg)

[!INCLUDE[click-on-a-kpi-link](includes/click-on-a-kpi-link.md)] 

[!INCLUDE[powerbi-tip-track-kpis](includes/powerbi-tip-track-kpis.md)]

## Data used in the report

The report uses data from the following tables in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]:

- G/L Entry
- G/L Accounts
- G/L Account Categories

title: Allocate Costs to Intercompany Partners| Microsoft Docs
description: Learn how VAT settings for customers and vendors control whether, and how, VAT is calculated.

# Allocate Costs to Intercompany Partners
When you use intercompany postings to transfer documents between partner companies, the VAT-related settings (primarily the VAT business posting group) assigned to the customer or vendor accounts (associated with the intercompany Partner) control whether, and how, VAT is calculated and registered. 
You can also do cost distributions directly from a purchase order to partner companies. For example, if you register a purchase invoice from an external vendor and you want to distribute some or all of the costs to one or more intercompany partners.

You can allocate costs can be to one or more intercompany partners using the following:

* **Intercompany General Journals** - These journals are useful when a service is purchased. For example, when a parent company hires a service to set up computer systems in two subsidiaries. The invoice is sent to the parent company, but the costs are allocate to the intercompany partners. For more information, see [Work with Intercompany Documents and Journals](intercompany-how-work-documents-journals.md).
* Purchase orders and invoices - Using purchase documents is useful when the purchasing functions of, for example, operating expenses, are centralized in one company and then allocated to the intercompany partners.

## To allocate costs using an intercompany general journal
To enter a  line in an intercompany general journal, follow these steps. 

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Intercompany General Journal** , and then choose the related link.
2. If required, in the **External Document No.** field, enter the document number on the invoice from the vendor.
3. In the **Document Type** field, choose **Invoice**.
4. In the **Account Type** field, choose **Vendor**.
5. In the **Account No.** field, choose the vendor.
6. In the **Amount** field, enter a negative amount equal to the amount on the invoice.
7. In the **Bal. Account Type** field, choose **G/L Account**.
8. In the **Bal. Account No.** field, choose the balancing account to use.
9. To allocate costs to intercompany partners, follow these steps:
   1. Create a new line.
   2. Leave the **Document Type** field, choose the option that leaves the field blank.
   3. In the **Document No.** field, enter a number that is different than the number in the **External Document No.** field. The cost allocation is considered a different transaction.
   4. In the **Account Type** field, choose **IC Partner**.
   5. In the **Account No.** field, choose the intercompany partner to allocate the cost to.
   6. In the **Balance Account Type** field, choose **G/L Account**.
   7. In the **Balance Account No.** field, choose the G/L account to which to post the amount you receive from the intercompany partner.
   1. In the **Amount** field, enter the amount of the invoice to allocate to the intercompany partner.
   1. In the **IC Partner G/L Acc. No.** field, choose the G/L account that you want to post the amount to for the intercompany partner. 
   1. Fill in the remaining fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)] Repeat these steps for each intercompany partner who should share in the cost.
1. To post the document and allocate the costs, choose **Post**.  

## To allocate costs using a purchase document
The following procedure describes how to allocate costs using a purchase invoice. The steps are the same for purchase orders.

> [!NOTE]
> To complete these steps you must personalize the **Purchase Invoice** page by adding the **IC Partner Code**, **IC Partner Ref. Type**, and **IC Partner** fields. For more information, see [To start personalizing a page through the Personalizing banner](ui-personalization-user.md#start-personalizing-by-using-the-personalization-mode).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Invoice** , and then choose the related link.
2. In the **Type** field, choose **G/L Account**.
   
   G/L Account is the only option you can use to allocate costs.  
1. In the **No.** field, choose the G/L account to post to.
1. In the **IC Partner Code** field, choose the intercompany partner to allocate the cost to.
1. In the **IC Partner Ref. Type** choose the G/L account to use for the allocation. This account will map the expense to an account in the intercomany partner's chart of accounts.
1. In the **Quantity** field, specify the number of units to charge to the intercompany partner.
1. In the **Direct Unit Cost Excl. VAT (or Incl. VAT)** field, enter the cost per item to charge to the intercompany partner.
1. Fill in the remaining fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)] 
1. To post the purchase order, choose **Post**.

## To send the allocated costs to intercompany partners
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **IC Outbox Transactions**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose lines to send, and then choose the **Send to IC Partner** action. 
3. To allocate the costs, choose the **Complete Line Actions** action.

## Calculating VAT for Cost Distributions
When you use a document to distribute costs to intercompany partners, there are two VAT settings to be aware of: 
* The settings on the G/L account for expenses:
   * If the general business or VAT business posting groups are set up on the G/L account, then the calculation depends on the groups and the product groups from the document line.
   * If the general business or VAT business posting groups are not specified on the G/L account, the calculation depends on the following:
* The posting group settings on the intercompany partner
   * Whether the intercompany partner is assigned to a customer number that does not have a general business or VAT business posting groups specified.
   * There is no customer number associated with the intercompany partner. Then the general business or VAT business posting groups are blank, and the line in the VAT posting setup is used, which is usually a group where 0% VAT is specified.

> [!NOTE]
> It is important to validate both the intercompany partner setup and the G/L account setup (for the expense account used for the cost distribution) before you allocate costs to intercompany partners.

# Integrating with Dynamics 365 Sales

[!INCLUDE[azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id](~/../shared-content/shared/azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id.md)]

The sales person role is often considered as one the most outward-facing jobs in a business. However, it can be helpful for sales people to be able to look inward in the business and know what's happening on the back end. By integrating [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)], you can give your sales people that insight. The integration lets people view information in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] while they're working in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]. For example, when preparing a sales quote it could be useful to know whether you have enough inventory to fulfill the order. To learn more, go to [Use Dynamics 365 Sales from Business Central](marketing-integrate-dynamicscrm.md).

> [!NOTE]
> This article describes the process of integrating the online versions of [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] through [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)]. To learn more about on-premises configuration, go to [Preparing Dynamics 365 Sales for Integration on-premises](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/prepare-dynamics-365-for-sales-for-integration).

## Integrate through Dataverse

To make it easy to connect and synchronize data with other Dynamics 365 applications, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] also integrates with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)]. For example, you can connect to [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)], or even apps that you build yourself. If you're integrating for the first time, you must do so through [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)]. To learn more, go to [Integration with Dataverse](admin-common-data-service.md).

If you already integrated [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can continue to synchronize data using your setup. However, if you upgrade or turn off your [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] integration, to turn it on again you must connect through [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)]. To learn more, go to [Upgrading an Integration with Dynamics 365 Sales](admin-upgrade-sales-to-cds.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Reconnecting through [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] applies default synchronization settings, and overwrites any configurations you have. For example, the default table mappings are applied.

## Integration settings that are specific to a [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] integration

Integration with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] happens through [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)], and many standard settings and tables are provided. In addition to the standard settings, there are some that are specific to [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]. The following sections list those settings.

## Permissions and security roles for user accounts in Sales

When you install the Integration Solution, permissions for the integration user account are configured. If those permissions are changed, you might need to reset them. You can do that by reinstalling the Integration Solution by choosing **Redeploy Integration Solution** on the **Dynamics 365 Connection Setup** page. The following security roles are deployed:

* Dynamics 365 Business Central Integration Administrator
* Dynamics 365 Business Central Integration User

> [!NOTE]
> To use the **Open in Business Central** action in Sales, you must have the following privileges for the following tables:
>
> * You must have Read permissions for the Dynamics 365 Business Central Connection (nav_connection) table.
> * You must have Read, Write, and Delete permissions for the Default Dynamics 365 Business Central Connection (nav_defaultconnection) table.

### Connection settings in the setup guide

You can use an assisted setup guide to quickly set up the connection and specify advanced features, such as coupling between records.

1. Choose **Setup and Extensions**, and then choose **Assisted Setup**.
2. Choose **Set up the Dynamics 365 Sales Connection** to start the assisted setup guide.
3. Fill in the fields as necessary.
4. Optionally, there are advanced settings that can enhance security and enable more capabilities. The following table describes the advanced settings.

<!--
### User Account Settings
Integration with Business Central through [!INCLUDE [cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] requires an administrator user account and an account that is used only for the connection between the apps. This account is called the "integration user." When you install the CDS Base Integration Solution, permissions for the integration user account are configured in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]. If those permissions are changed you might need to reset them. You can do that by reinstalling the Integration Solution or by manually resetting them. The following tables list the minimum permissions for the user accounts in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)].  -->
### Single and bi-directional synchronization of sales orders

When you set up your integration, there are options that control the direction in which you synchronize sales orders, and how you submit them.

The **Bidirectional Synch of Sales Orders** option lets you synchronize sales orders from Sales to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], and vice versa. For example, if a customer changes their mind about the product or quantity in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)], you can archive the sales document and create a new document in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The same is true for changes in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For example, when prices, tax amounts, or expected shipment dates change, the changes synchronize to [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]. Bidirectional synchronization helps keep your sellers up to date with the latest changes and the status of sales orders.

For bidirectional synchronization, you make sales orders available for synchronization when you change their status to **Submitted** in Sales. When you set that status, you can no longer change information on the order's lines. When you synchronize, the order is transferred to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with the status **Released**. If there's a mistake, you can revert the order to **Open** (in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]) or **Active** (in Sales), and then add or delete lines to correct the mistake, and submit the order again.

> [!TIP]
> When you enable the **Bidirectional Synch of Sales Orders** option, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates a record on the **Sales Order Archives** page when you post or change information on an order. For example, the archived versions can be useful for exploring an order's history.

The **Enable Legacy Sales Order Integration** option synchronizes only from Sales to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For this option, you use the **Submit** action in Sales to make orders available for synchronization. When you do, you can no longer change any information on the order. When you synchronize, the order is transferred to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with the status **Released**.

To use this option, you must provide credentials for an administrator user account in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]. To learn more, go to [Handle Sales Order Data](marketing-integrate-dynamicscrm.md#handle-sales-order-data).

> The **Bidirectional Synch of Sales Orders** and **Enable Legacy Sales Order Integration** options are mutually exclusive. You can't use both options at the same time.

For both options, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] shows all sales orders with the **Submitted** status on the **Orders - Microsoft Dynamics 365 Sales** page.

### Standard Sales entity mapping for synchronization

Entities in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)], such as orders, are integrated with equivalent types of tables in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], such as sales orders. To work with [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] data you set up links, called couplings, between tables in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)].

The following table lists the standard mapping between tables in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] that [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides.

| [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] | [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] | Synchronization Direction | Default Filter |

> [!NOTE]
> The mappings for the **Item Unit of Measure**, **Resource Unit of Measure**, and **Unit Group** tables are available only if your administrator turns on the **Unit Group Mapping** toggle on the **Microsoft Dynamics 365 Connection Setup** page. To learn more, go to [Synchronizing Items and Resources with Products in Different Units of Measure](admin-prepare-dynamics-365-for-sales-for-integration.md#synchronize-items-and-resources-with-products-with-different-units-of-measure).

## Synchronize items and resources with products with different units of measure

Businesses often produce or purchase the items in one unit of measure, and then sell them in another. To synchronize items that use multiple units of measure, you must turn on the **Unit Group Mapping** toggle on the **Microsoft Dynamics 365 Connection Setup** page.

When you turn on the feature update, a new Unit Group table is created and assigned to each item and resource in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The tables let you map the Unit Group, Item Unit of Measure, and Resource Unit of Measure tables in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to the Dynamics 365 Sales Unit Group in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]. The following image shows the mappings.

:::image type="content" source="media/unit group 1.png" alt-text="Table mappings for unit groups":::

You can create multiple units of measure for each unit group, and assign the groups to products in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]. Afterward, you can synchronize the products with items and resources in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. You can manually couple item units of measure or resource units of measure with a unit group. When you do, if the unit group for the item or resource isn't coupled to a unit group in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)], [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically creates the unit group in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)].

### Map items and resources to products

When you turn on the **Unit Group Mapping** toggle on the **Microsoft Dynamics 365 Connection Setup** page, the following happens:

* New mappings are created for items and resources.
* Existing mappings are deleted.
* A data upgrade creates unit groups for items and resources.

To use the new mappings, you must synchronize unit groups, item unit of measure, and resource unit of measures. You must also resynchronize items and resources.

> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] doesn't allow you to change a unit group for a product. Therefore, you must retire your products and uncouple the items and resources, and then synchronize by creating new products in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]. 

The following steps describe the steps to start mapping unit groups:

1. Be sure that products in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] aren't coupled with items or resources in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. If they are, go to the **Items** and/or **Resources** pages and use the filter options to select the coupled records. Then choose the **Dynamics 365 Sales** action, and select **Uncouple**. This action schedules a background job to uncouple the records. While the job is running, you can check its status by using the **Synchronization Log** action. To learn more, go to [Coupling and Synchronizing](admin-how-to-couple-and-synchronize-records-manually.md).
2. Because new products are created in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] with new unit groups, to avoid duplicate names, do one of the following steps:

  * Rename your products, and then retire them in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]. To learn more, go to [Retire products (Sales Hub)](/dynamics365/sales-enterprise/retire-product). To bulk edit your products in Microsoft Excel, sign in to Power Apps, choose your environment, go to the **Product** table, and then choose the **Data** tab. Clear any filters that are applied. In the **Data** group, choose the **Edit Data in Excel** action. Add a prefix or suffix to the coupled products, and then retire them.
    * Retire your products and delete them. 

3. Follow these steps to synchronize **Unit Groups**, **Unit of Measures**, **Items**, and **Resources**:
    1. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], open the **Dynamics 365 Sales Connection Setup** page.
    2. Use the **Run Full Synchronization** action to open the **Dataverse Full Synch. Review** page.
    3. For the **ITEM UOM**, **RESOURCE UOM**, AND **UNIT GROUP** mappings, choose the **Recommend Full Synchronization** action.
    4. Choose the **Sync All** action.

    > [!NOTE]
    > This action fully synchronizes all mappings. To prevent mappings from synchronizing, delete the mappings from the page. Deleting the mappings only removes them from the current full synchronization, and doesn't delete the mappings.
4. Choose the **ITEM-PRODUCT** mapping, and then choose the **Restart** action. Restarting creates new products from the items in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)], and assigns a new unit group that is specific to the item.
5. Choose the **RESOURCE-PRODUCT** mapping, and then choose the **Restart** action. Restarting creates new products from the resources in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)], and assigns a new unit group that is specific to the resources.

### Synchronization rules

The following table lists the rules that control the synchronization between [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. These rules are in addition to rules defined for [!INCLUDE [cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)], which also apply. To learn more, go to [Standard Entity Mapping](admin-synchronizing-business-central-and-sales.md#standard-table-mapping-for-synchronization).

> [!NOTE]  
> Changes to data that were made by the integration user account aren't synchronized. Therefore, we recommended that you don't change data while using that account. To learn more, go to [Setting Up User Accounts for Integrating with Dynamics 365 Sales](admin-setting-up-integration-with-dynamics-sales.md).

|Table|Rule|
|-----|----|
|Units of Measure|Units of measure are synchronized with unit groups in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]. There can only be one unit of measure defined in the unit group.|
|Items|When it synchronizes items with [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] products, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically creates a price list in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]. To avoid synchronization errors, you shouldn't modify this price list manually.|
|Resources|Resources are synchronized with [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] products that have product type Service.|
|Customer Price Groups|Customer price groups are synchronized with Sales price lists.|
|Sales Prices|Sales prices that have sales type Customer Price Group and have a sales code defined are synchronized with [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] price list lines|
|Opportunities|Opportunities are synchronized with [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] opportunities. The Salesperson Code value defines the owner of the coupled table in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)].|
|Posted Sales Invoices|Posted sales invoices are synchronized with sales invoices. Before an invoice can be synchronized, it's better to synchronize all other tables that can participate in the invoice, from salespersons to price lists. The Salesperson Code value in the invoice header defines the owner of the coupled table in Sales.|
|Sales Orders|When you enable sales order integration, when you release sales orders in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] that were created from submitted sales orders in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)], they synchronize with sales orders in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]. Before you synchronize orders, we recommend that you first synchronize all tables involved with the order. For example, sales persons and price lists. The Salesperson Code field in the order header defines the owner of the coupled table in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)].|

### Synchronization jobs for a Sales integration

The jobs are run in the following order to avoid coupling dependencies between tables. There are more jobs available from [!INCLUDE [cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)]. To learn more, go to [Use Job Queues to Schedule Tasks](./admin-job-queues-schedule-tasks.md).

1. UNITOFMEASURE - Dynamics 365 Sales synchronization job  
2. RESOURCE-PRODUCT - Dynamics 365 Sales synchronization job

# Design Details: Revaluation

You can revalue the inventory based on the valuation base that most accurately reflects the inventory value. You can also backdate a revaluation to correctly update the cost of goods sold (COGS) for items you've already sold. Items that use the Standard costing method and aren't completely invoiced can also be revalued.  

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the following flexibility is supported regarding revaluation:  

- The revaluable quantity can be calculated for any date, also back in time.  
- For items using Standard costing method, expected cost entries are included in revaluation.  
- Inventory decreases affected by revaluation are detected.  

## Calculate the revaluable quantity

The quantity you can revalue is the remaining inventory that's available on a given date. The quantity is the total of completely invoiced item ledger entries that you post on or before the revaluation date.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  Items using the Standard costing method are treated differently when calculating the revaluable quantity per item, location, and variant. The quantities and values of item ledger entries that are not completely invoiced are included in the revaluable quantity.  

After a revaluation has been posted, you can post an inventory increase or decrease with a posting date that comes before the revaluation posting date. However, this quantity will not be affected by the revaluation. To balance the inventory, only the original revaluable quantity is considered.  

Because you can revaluate on any date, you must have conventions for when you consider an item as part of inventory. For example, when the item is on inventory and when the item is work in process (WIP).  

### Example  

The following example illustrates when a WIP item transitions to become part of inventory. The example is based on the production of a chain with 150 links.  

![WIP inventory and revaluation.](media/design_details_inventory_costing_10_revaluation_wip.png "WIP inventory and revaluation")  

**1Q**: The user posts the purchased links as received. The following table shows the resulting item ledger entry.  

|Posting Date|Item|Entry Type|Quantity|Entry No.|  
|------------------|----------|----------------|--------------|---------------|  
|01-01-20|LINK|Purchase|150|1|  

> [!NOTE]  
>  Now an item using the Standard costing method is available for revaluation.  

**1V**: The user posts the purchased links as invoiced and the links become part of inventory, from a financial point of view. The following table shows the resulting value entries.  

|Posting Date|Entry Type|Valuation Date|Cost Amount (Actual)|Item Ledger Entry No.|Entry No.|  
|------------------|----------------|--------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------|---------------|  
|01-15-20|Direct Cost|01-01-20|150.00|1|1|  

 **2Q + 2V**: The user posts the purchased links as consumed for the production of the iron chain. From a financial point of view, the links become part of WIP inventory.  The following table shows the resulting item ledger entry.  

|Posting Date|Item|Entry Type|Quantity|Entry No.|  
|------------------|----------|----------------|--------------|---------------|  
|02-01-20|LINK|Consumption|-150|1|  

The following table shows the resulting value entry.  

|Posting Date|Entry Type|Valuation Date|Cost Amount (Actual)|Item Ledger Entry No.|Entry No.|  
|------------------|----------------|--------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------|---------------|  
|02-01-20|Direct Cost|02-01-20|-150.00|2|2|  

The valuation date is set to the date of the consumption posting (02-01-20), as a regular inventory decrease.  

**3Q**: The user posts the chain as output and finishes the production order. The following table shows the resulting item ledger entry.  

|Posting Date|Item|Entry Type|Quantity|Entry No.|  
|------------------|----------|----------------|--------------|---------------|  
|02-15-20|CHAIN|Output|1|3|  

**3V**: The user runs the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job, which posts the chain as invoiced to indicate that all material consumption has been completely invoiced. From a financial point of view, the links are no longer part of WIP inventory when the output is completely invoiced and adjusted. The following table shows the resulting value entries.  

|Posting Date|Entry Type|Valuation Date|Cost Amount (Actual)|Item Ledger Entry No.|Entry No.|  
|------------------|----------------|--------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------|---------------|  
|01-15-20|Direct Cost|01-01-20|150.00|2|2|  
|02-01-20|Direct Cost|02-01-20|-150.00|2|2|  
|02-15-20|Direct Cost|02-15-20|150.00|3|3|  

## Expected cost in revaluation

The quantity you can revalue is the sum of the quantity for completely invoiced item ledger entries that you posted on or before the revaluation date. When some items are received or shipped but not invoiced, you can't calculate their inventory value. Items that use the Standard costing method are not limited in this way.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  Another type of expected cost that can be revalued is WIP inventory, within certain rules. For more information, see [WIP Inventory Revaluation](design-details-revaluation.md#wip-inventory-revaluation).  

When you calculate the revaluable quantity for items that use the Standard costing method, the calculation includes item ledger entries that aren't completely invoiced. These entries are revalued when you post the revaluation. When you invoice the revalued entry, you create the following value entries:  

- The usual invoiced value entry with an entry type of **Direct Cost**. The cost amount on this entry is the direct cost from the source line.  
- A value entry with an entry type of **Variance**. This entry records the difference between the invoiced cost and the revalued standard cost.  
- A value entry with an entry type of **Revaluation**. This entry records the reversal of the revaluation of the expected cost.

### Example  

The following example is based on the production of the chain in the previous example. This example illustrates how the three types of entries are created, based on the following scenario:  

1.  You post the purchased links as received with a unit cost of LCY 2.00.  
2.  You post a revaluation of the links with a new unit cost of LCY 3.00, updating the standard cost to LCY 3.00.  
3.  You post the original purchase of the chain links as invoiced, which creates the following value entries:  

    1.  An invoiced value entry with an entry type of **Direct Cost**.  
    2.  A value entry with an entry type of **Revaluation** to record the reversal of the revaluation of the expected cost.  
    3.  A value entry with an entry type of Variance, recording the difference between the invoiced cost and the revalued standard cost.  

The following table shows the results.  

|Step|Posting Date|Entry Type|Valuation Date|Cost Amount (Expected)|Cost Amount (Actual)|Item Ledger Entry No.|Entry No.|  
|----------|------------------|----------------|--------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------|---------------|  
|1.|01-15-20|Direct Cost|01-15-20|300.00|0.00|1|1|  
|2.|01-20-20|Revaluation|01-20-20|150.00|0.00|1|2|  
|3.a.|01-15-20|Direct Cost|01-15-20|-300.00|0.00|1|3|  
|3.b.|01-15-20|Revaluation|01-20-20|-150.00|0.00|1|4|  
|3.c.|01-15-20|Variance|01-15-20|0.00|450.00|1|5|  

## Determine whether revaluation affects an inventory decrease  

Use the date of the posting or the revaluation to determine whether an inventory decrease is affected by a revaluation.  

The following table shows the criteria that's used for an item that doesn't use the Average costing method.  

|Scenario|Entry No.|Timing|Affected by revaluation|  
|--------------|---------------|------------|-----------------------------|  
|A|Earlier than revaluation entry number|Earlier than revaluation posting date|No|  
|B|Earlier than revaluation entry no.|Equal to revaluation posting date|No|  
|C|Earlier than revaluation entry no.|Later than revaluation posting date|Yes|  
|D|Later than revaluation entry no.|Earlier than revaluation posting date|Yes|  
|E|Later than revaluation entry no.|Equal to revaluation posting date|Yes|  
|F|Later than revaluation entry no.|Later than revaluation posting date|Yes|  

### Example  

The following example illustrates revaluation of an item that uses the FIFO costing method. The example is based on the following scenario:  

1.  On 01-01-20, you post a purchase of 6 units.  
2.  On 02-01-20, you post a sale of 1 unit.  
3.  On 03-01-20, you post a sale of 1 unit.  
4.  On 04-01-20, you post a sale of 1 unit.  
5.  On 03-01-20, you calculate the inventory value for the item, and post a revaluation of the item’s unit cost from LCY 10.00 to LCY 8.00.  
6.  On 02-01-20, you post a sale of 1 unit.  
7.  On 03-01-20, you post a sale of 1 unit.  
8.  On 04-01-20, you post a sale of 1 unit.  
9. You run the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job.  

The following table shows the resulting value entries.  

|Scenario|Posting Date|Entry Type|Valuation Date|Valued Quantity|Cost Amount (Actual)|Item Ledger Entry No.|Entry No.|  
|--------------|------------------|----------------|--------------------|---------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------|---------------|  
||01-01-20|Purchase|01-01-20|6|60.00|1|1|  
||03-01-20|Revaluation|03-01-20|4|-8.00|1|5|  
|A|02-01-20|Sale|02-01-20|-1|-10.00|2|2|  
|B|03-01-20|Sale|03-01-20|-1|-10.00|3|3|  
|C|04-01-20|Sale|04-01-20|-1|-10.00|4|4|  
||04-01-20|Sale|04-01-20|-1|2.00|4|9|  
|D|02-01-20|Sale|03-01-20|-1|-10.00|5|6|  
||02-01-20|Sale|03-01-20|-1|2.00|5|10|  
|E|03-01-20|Sale|03-01-20|-1|-10.00|6|7|  
||03-01-20|Sale|03-01-20|-1|2.00|6|11|

## WIP inventory revaluation  

Revaluating WIP inventory implies that you revalue components that are registered as WIP inventory.  

It's important to have conventions that control when an item is WIP inventory from a financial point of view. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the following conventions exist:  

- A purchased component becomes part of the raw material inventory when you post a purchase as invoiced.  
- A purchased/sub-assembled component becomes part of the WIP inventory when you post its consumption with a production order.  
- A purchased/sub-assembled component remains part of the WIP inventory until you invoice a production order (manufactured item).  

The way the valuation date for the value entry of consumption is set follows the same rules as for non-WIP inventory. To learn more, go to [Determine whether revaluation affects an inventory decrease](#determine-whether-revaluation-affects-an-inventory-decrease).  

You can revalue WIP inventory under the following conditions:

- The revaluation date is before the posting dates of the corresponding item ledger entries of type Consumption.
- You haven't invoiced the production order.  

> [!CAUTION]  
> The **Inventory Valuation - WIP** report shows the value of posted production order entries, and might be a little confusing for revalued WIP items.  

## Revaluate items with the Average costing method

You can only revaluate items that use the Average costing method if **Calculate Per** is *Item*.

You can only do revaluation at the end of the period selected in the **Average Cost Period** field on the **Inventory Setup** page.

Revaluation won't affect negative transactions in the current month, which is why fully applied inbound entries aren't included either.

### Example

This example shows what happens when you calculate the inventory value on the **Item Revaluation Journal** page. On the **Inventory Setup** page, **Item** is chosen in the **Average Cost Calc. Type** field, and **Month** is chosen in the **Average Cost Period** field.

The following table shows item ledger entries for the sample average-cost item, ITEM1.

|Posting Date|Item Ledger Entry Type|Quantity|Cost Amount (Actual)|Entry No.|
|----|----|----|----|----|
25-04-23|Purchase|5|5.00|1
26-04-23|Purchase|3|3.00|2
27-04-23|Sale|-5|-5.00|3
28-04-23|Sale|-1|-1.00|4
13-05-23|Purchase|2|20.00|5
17-06-23|Sale|-6|-22.00|6

The following table shows the result of running the **Calculate Inventory Value** report with different posing dates.

|Posting Date|Quantity|Comment|
|---|---|-------------|
30-04-23|2|Includes only the remaining quantity from entry 2. Entry 1 is completely applied before the posting date, and entry 5 is after posting date.
31-05-23|4|Includes the remaining quantities from entries 2 and 13.
30-06-23|0|No remaining quantity at posting date.

The result of the following entries will be 0, regardless of the posting date.

|Posting Date|Item Ledger Entry Type|Quantity|Cost Amount (Actual)|Entry No.|
|----|----|----|----|----|
13-05-23|Purchase|5|5.00|1
26-04-23|Sale|-5|5.00|2

# Year-Over-Year (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Year-Over-Year** report helps business leaders analyze purchasing performance and track spending trends over time. By comparing purchase amounts in the current year with amounts from the previous year, this report provides valuable insights into the efficiency and effectiveness of purchasing activities.

In addition to identifying trends and changes, the report helps leaders make informed decisions about future purchasing strategies. It's an important indicator of growth and spending patterns, providing an overview of the money you spend to make products and generate revenues.

Together with year-over-year financial figures, the report gives a comprehensive view of an organization's financial health. Tracking these figures helps leaders make informed decisions about resource allocation, budgeting, and forecasting.

## Use the report

The report is intended for business leaders and managers.

COOs ensure that the purchasing department operates efficiently and effectively. One of the key metrics you monitor is the year-over-year growth in purchases. This report lets you quickly explore purchase trends over time, and identify areas of concern. For example, you might notice that purchases are increasing rapidly in a particular item category. You can use this information to discuss how to manage costs with the head of purchasing.

Purchasing managers ensure that the company sources goods at the best price without compromising quality. Use this report to track purchasing trends across different categories and identify areas where you can save. For example, you might notice a rapid increase in purchases of a category of products. With this information in mind, you can work with the manufacturing team to identify whether to change item planning or supplier selection to optimize product cost and quality.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The *Year-Over-Year* report includes the following KPIs and measures: 

- [**Current Year**](purchases-powerbi-kpis.md#purchase-amount)
- [**Previous Year (Fiscal)**](purchases-powerbi-kpis.md#purchase-amount-py-fiscal)
- [**Current Year YOY (Fiscal)**](purchases-powerbi-kpis.md#purchase-amount-yoy-fiscal)

# Design details: costing methods

The costing method determines whether an actual or a budgeted value is capitalized and used in the cost calculation. Together with the posting date and sequence, the costing method also influences how the cost flow is recorded.

> [!NOTE]
> You can't change an item's costing method if item ledger entries exist for the item. Learn more at [Design Details: Change the Costing Method for Items](design-details-changing-costing-methods.md).

The following methods are supported in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]:  

| Costing method | Description | When to use |
|--|--|--|
| FIFO | An item's unit cost is the actual value of any receipt of the item, selected by the FIFO rule.<br /><br /> Inventory valuation assumes that the first items placed in inventory are sold first. | In business environments where product cost is stable.<br /><br /> (When prices are rising, the balance sheet shows greater value. This means that tax liabilities increase, but credit scores and the ability to borrow cash improve.)<br /><br /> For items with a limited shelf life, because the oldest goods need to be sold before they pass their sell-by date. |
| LIFO | An item's unit cost is the actual value of any receipt of the item, selected by the LIFO rule.<br /><br /> Inventory valuation assumes that the last items placed in inventory are sold first. | Disallowed in many countries/regions, as it can be used to depress profit.<br /><br /> (When prices are rising, the value on the income statement decreases. This means that tax liabilities decrease, but the ability to borrow cash deteriorates.) |
| Average | An item's unit cost is calculated as the average unit cost at each point in time after a purchase.<br /><br /> Inventory valuation assumes that all inventories are sold simultaneously. | In business environments where product cost is unstable.<br /><br /> When inventories are piled or mixed together and can't be differentiated, such as chemicals. |
| Specific | An item's unit cost is the exact cost at which the particular unit was received. | In production or trade of easily identifiable items with fairly high unit costs.<br /><br /> For items that are subject to regulation.<br /><br /> For items with serial numbers. |
| Standard | An item's unit cost is preset based on estimated.<br /><br /> When the actual cost is realized later, the standard cost must be adjusted to the actual cost through variance values. | Where cost control is critical.<br /><br /> In repetitive manufacturing, to value the costs of direct material, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead.<br /><br /> Where there's discipline and staff to maintain standards. |

The following image shows how costs flow through the inventory for each costing method.  

![Costing methods visualized.](media/design_details_inventory_costing_7_costing_methods.png "Costing methods visualized")  

Costing methods differ in the way that they value inventory decreases and if they use actual cost or standard cost as the valuation base. The following table explains the different characteristics. (The LIFO method is excluded, as it's similar to the FIFO method.)

## Example

This section gives examples of how different costing methods affect inventory value.  

The following table shows the inventory increases and decreases that the examples are based on.  

|Posting Date|Quantity|Entry No.|  
|------------------|--------------|---------------|  
|01-01-20|1|1|  
|01-01-20|1|2|  
|01-01-20|1|3|  
|02-01-20|-1|4|  
|03-01-20|-1|5|  
|04-01-20|-1|6|  

> [!NOTE]  
> The resulting quantity in inventory is zero. Consequently, the inventory value must also be zero, regardless of the costing method.  

### Effect of Costing Methods on Valuing Inventory Increases  

For items with costing methods that use actual cost as the valuation base (**FIFO**, **LIFO**, **Average**, or **Specific**), inventory increases are valued at the item's acquisition cost.  

- **Standard**  

    For items using the **Standard** costing method, inventory increases are valued at the item's current standard cost.  

#### Standard  

For items using the **Standard** costing method, inventory increases are valued at the item's current standard cost.  

### Effect of Costing Methods on Valuing Inventory Decreases

- **FIFO**  

    For items using the **FIFO** costing method, items that were purchased first are always sold first (entry numbers 3, 2, and 1 in this example). Accordingly, inventory decreases are valued by taking the value of the first inventory increase.  

     COGS is calculated using the value of the first inventory acquisitions.  

     The following table shows how inventory decreases are valued for the **FIFO** costing method.  

    |Posting Date|Quantity|Cost Amount (Actual)|Entry No.|  
    |------------------|--------------|----------------------------|---------------|  
    |02-01-20|-1|-10.00|4|  
    |03-01-20|-1|-20.00|5|  
    |04-01-20|-1|-30.00|6|  

- **LIFO**  

    For items using the **LIFO** costing method, items that were purchased most recently are always sold first (entry numbers 3, 2, and 1 in this example). Accordingly, inventory decreases are valued by taking the value of the last inventory increase.  

     COGS is calculated using the value of the most recent inventory acquisitions.  

     The following table shows how inventory decreases are valued for the **LIFO** costing method.  

    |Posting Date|Quantity|Cost Amount (Actual)|Entry No.|  
    |------------|--------|--------------------|---------|  
    |02-01-20|-1|-30.00|4|  
    |03-01-20|-1|-20.00|5|  
    |04-01-20|-1|-10.00|6|  

- **Average**  

    For items using the **Average** costing method, inventory decreases are valued by calculating a weighted average of the remaining inventory on the last day of the average cost period in which the inventory decrease was posted. Learn more at [Design Details: Average Cost](design-details-average-cost.md).  

     The following table shows how inventory decreases are valued for the **Average** costing method.  

    | Posting Date | Quantity | Cost Amount (Actual) | Entry No. |
    |--|--|--|--|
    | 02-01-20 | -1 | -20.00 | 4 |
    | 03-01-20 | -1 | -20.00 | 5 |
    | 04-01-20 | -1 | -20.00 | 6 |

- **Standard**  

    For items using the **Standard** costing method, inventory decreases are valued similar to the **FIFO** costing method, except valuation is based on a standard cost, not on the actual cost.  

    The following table shows how inventory decreases are valued for the **Standard** costing method.  

    |Posting Date|Quantity|Cost Amount (Actual)|Entry No.|  
    |------------------|--------------|----------------------------|---------------|  
    |02-01-20|-1|-15.00|4|  
    |03-01-20|-1|-15.00|5|  
    |04-01-20|-1|-15.00|6|  

- **Specific**  

    Costing methods make an assumption about how cost flows from an inventory increase to an inventory decrease. However, if more accurate information about the cost flow exists, then you can override this assumption by creating a fixed application between entries. A fixed application creates a link between an inventory decrease and a specific inventory increase and directs the cost flow accordingly.  

    For items that use the **Specific** costing method, inventory decreases are valued according to the inventory increase that the fixed application links it to.  

    The following table shows how inventory decreases are valued for the **Specific** costing method.  

    |Posting Date|Quantity|Cost Amount (Actual)|Applies-to Entry|Entry No.|
    |------------|--------|--------------------|----------------|---------|  
    |02-01-20|-1|-20.00|**2**|4|  
    |03-01-20|-1|-10.00|**1**|5|  
    |04-01-20|-1|-30.00|**3**|6|

# Handling missing option values

This article is intended for a technical audience. The processes it describes require the help of a developer.

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] contains three option set fields that contain values that you can map to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] fields of the Option type for automated synchronization. During synchronization, nonmapped options are ignored and the missing options are appended to the related [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] table and added to the **Dataverse Option Mapping** system table to handle manually later. For example, by adding the missing options in either product and then updating the mapping.

The **Integration Table Mapping** page contains three fields that contain one or more mapped option values. After a full synchronization, the **Dataverse Option Mapping** page contains the nonmapped options in the three fields.

|         Record             | Option Value | Option Value Caption |
|----------------------------|--------------|----------------------|
| Payment Terms: NET30	     | 1            | Net 30	           |
| Payment Terms: 2%10NET30   | 2            | 2% 10; Net 30        |
| Payment Terms: NET45	     | 3            | Net 45               |
| Payment Terms: NET60	     | 4            | Net 60               |
| Shipment Method: FOB	     | 1            | FOB                  |
| Shipment Method: NOCHARGE  | 2            | No Charge            |
| Shipping Agent: AIRBORNE   | 1            | Airborne             |
| Shipping Agent: DHL        | 2            | DHL                  |
| Shipping Agent: FEDEX      | 3            | FedEx                |
| Shipping Agent: UPS        | 4            | UPS                  |
| Shipping Agent: POSTALMAIL | 5            | Postal Mail          |
| Shipping Agent: FULLLOAD   | 6            | Full Load            |
| Shipping Agent: WILLCALL   | 7            | Will Call            |

The content of the **Dataverse Option Mapping** page is based on enum values in the **CRM Account** table. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)], the following fields on the account table are mapped to fields on the customer and vendor records:

- **Address 1: Freight Terms** of data type Enum, where values are defined as follows:

```
enum 5335 "CDS Shipment Method Code"
{
    Extensible = true;
    value(0; " ") { Caption = ' '; }
    value(1; "FOB") { Caption = 'FOB'; }
    value(2; "NoCharge") { Caption = 'No Charge'; }
}
```

- **Address 1: Shipping Method** of data type Enum, where values are defined as follows:

```
enum 5336 "CDS Shipping Agent Code"
{
    Extensible = true;
    value(0; " ") { Caption = ' '; }
    value(1; "Airborne") { Caption = 'Airborne'; }
    value(2; "DHL") { Caption = 'DHL'; }
    value(3; "FedEx") { Caption = 'FedEx'; }
    value(4; "UPS") { Caption = 'UPS'; }
    value(5; "PostalMail") { Caption = 'Postal Mail'; }
    value(6; "FullLoad") { Caption = 'Full Load'; }
    value(7; "WillCall") { Caption = 'Will Call'; }
}
```

- **Payment Terms** of data type Enum, where values are defined as follows:

```
enum 5334 "CDS Payment Terms Code"
{
    Extensible = true;
    value(0; " ") { Caption = ' '; }
    value(1; "Net30") { Caption = 'Net 30'; }
    value(2; "2%10Net30") { Caption = '2% 10; Net 30'; }
    value(3; "Net45") { Caption = 'Net 45'; }
    value(4; "Net60") { Caption = 'Net 60'; }
}
```

All of the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] enums are mapped to option sets in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)].

## Extending option sets in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]
1. Create a new AL extension.

2. Add an Enum extension for the options that you want to extend. Be sure that you use the same value. 

```
enumextension 50100 "CDS Payment Terms Code Extension" extends "CDS Payment Terms Code"
{
    value(779800001; "Cash Payment") { Caption = 'Cash Payment'; }
    value(779800002; "Transfer") { Caption = 'Transfer'; }
}
```

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> You must use the same option ID values from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] when you extend the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] enum. Otherwise synchronization will fail.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Do not use the ","  character in the enum values and captions. This is currently not supported by the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] runtime.

> [!NOTE]
> The first ten characters of the new option value names and captions must be unique. For example, two options named "Transfer 20 working days" and "Transfer 20 calendar days" will cause an error because both have the same first 10 characters, "Transfer 2". Name them, for example, "TRF20 WD" and "TRF20 CD."

## Update [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] option mapping
Now you can recreate the mapping between [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] options and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] records.

On the **Integration Table Mapping** page, choose the line for the **Payment Terms** map, and then choose the **Synchronize Modified Records** action. The **Dataverse Option Mapping** page is updated with the following records.

|         Record                 | Option Value   | Option Value Caption |
|--------------------------------|----------------|----------------------|
| Payment Terms: NET30	         | 1              | Net 30	             |
| Payment Terms: 2%10NET30       | 2              | 2% 10; Net 30        |
| Payment Terms: NET45 	         | 3              | Net 45               |
| Payment Terms: NET60	         | 4              | Net 60               | 
| **Payment Terms: CASH PAYME**  | **779800001**  | **Cash Payment**     |
| **Payment Terms: TRANSFER**    | **779800002**  | **Transfer**         |

The **Payment Terms** table in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] has new records for the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] options. In the following table, new options are in bold font. Italic rows represent all options that can now be synchronized. Remaining rows represent options aren't in use and are ignored during synchronization. You can remove them or extend Dataverse options with the same names.

# Set Up Opportunity Sales Cycles and Cycle Stages

Before you start using sales opportunities, you must set up sales cycles and sales cycle stages. A sales cycle is made up of a series of stages that go from the initial contact to the closing of a sale. For each stage, you define any requirements that must be met, such as requiring a sales quote, before an opportunity can go to the next stage. You can also specify whether a stage can be skipped. You can set up as many sales cycles as you need. You can set up as many sales cycle stages as necessary within a sales cycle.

To use opportunity sales cycles, you must set up the sales cycle, define the different stages of the cycle, and then assign the cycle to opportunities. Assigning the relevant activity or tasks to the opportunity may also be part of setting up a sales cycle.

This article also describes how to set up tasks and activities, and how to assign tasks to activities. For more information, see [To set up activities with tasks](marketing-how-setup-opportunity-sales-cycles-stages.md#to-set-up-activities-with-tasks).

## To set up opportunity sales cycle codes

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Cycles**, and then choose the related link. The **Sales Cycles** page opens, and lists all the existing sales cycles.
2. Choose the **New** action, and fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

Repeat these steps to set up as many sales cycles as you want. After you have set up opportunity sales cycles, you may want to set up the different stages within each cycle.

## To define opportunity sales cycle stages

1. On the **Sales Cycles** page, select the opportunity sales cycle for which you want to set up stages, and then choose the **Stages** action. The **Sales Cycle Stages** page opens.
2. Choose the **New** action to enter a new stage in the sales cycle.

Repeat these steps to set up as many stages as you want within the sales cycle.

## To assign stage cycles to opportunities

After you add the opportunities stage cycle, you can start to add sales opportunities, and then assign the stage cycle to opportunities by setting the **Sales Cycle Code** field. For more information, see [Create Sales Opportunities](marketing-how-create-opportunities.md).

## To set up activities with tasks

You can combine multiple tasks, such as tasks that each represent a step, in activities. Activity tasks are related to each other by a date formula. You can assign activities to opportunities, salespeople, or contacts.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Activities**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action, and fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
3. On the **Lines** FastTab, fill in the fields as necessary to define one or more tasks in the activity.

## To assign tasks or activities of tasks to opportunities

When you have set up a task, you can assign it to a sales opportunity and thereby assign the activity that the task belongs to.

> [!NOTE]
> You cannot create tasks of type *Meeting* in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online. The capability requires access to an on-premises deployment.

The following procedure describes how to assign activity tasks to opportunities. The steps are similar when you assign tasks to salespeople and contacts.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Opportunities**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select an opportunity, and then choose the **Tasks** action.
3. On the **Task List** page, choose the **Create Task** action.
4. The **Create Task** page, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

    > [!TIP]
    > As you can see in the **Opportunity** field, the task is automatically assigned to the relevant opportunity.
5. Choose the **OK** button.
6. On the **Task List** page, select the new task, and then choose the **Assign Activities** action.
7. On the **Assign Activity** page, fill in the fields as necessary, and then choose the **OK** button.

# Manage storage by deleting documents or compressing data

A central role, such as the application administrator, must regularly deal with accumulating historic documents by deleting or compressing them.  

> [!TIP]
> Learn more about other ways to reduce the amount of data stored in a database by reading [Reducing Data Stored in Business Central Databases](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/database-reduce-data) in our Developer and IT pro documentation.

## Delete documents

In certain situations, you might need to delete invoiced purchase orders. However, you can't delete them unless you fully invoice and received the items in the purchase orders. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] helps you out by checking for that.

Businesses usually delete return orders after they're invoiced. When you post an invoice, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] transfers it to the **Posted Purchase Credit Memo** page. If you selected the **Return Shipment on Credit Memo** check box on the **Purchases & Payable Setup** page, the invoice is transferred to the **Posted Return Shipment** page. You can delete the documents using the **Delete Invd Purch. Ret. Orders** batch job. Before it deletes documents, the batch job checks whether the purchase return orders are fully shipped and invoiced.  

Blanket purchase orders aren't automatically deleted after you process and invoice all the related purchase orders. Instead, you can delete them with the **Delete Invoiced Blanket Purchase Orders** batch job.  

Businesses typically delete invoiced service orders automatically after they're fully invoiced. When an invoice is posted, a corresponding entry is created and can then be viewed on the **Posted Service Invoices** page.  

Service orders aren't deleted automatically, however, if the total quantity on the order was posted from the **Service Invoice** page rather than from service order itself. You might need to manually delete such invoiced orders by running the **Delete Invoiced Service Orders** batch job.  

## Compress data with date compression

You can compress data in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to save space in the database&mdash;which in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online can even save you money. The compression, based on dates and functions, combines several old entries into one new entry.

You can compress entries that meet all of the following conditions:

* They're from closed fiscal years.
* The **Open** field is set to **No**.
* They're at least five years old. If you want to compress data less than five years old, contact your Microsoft partner.

So, for example, vendor ledger entries from previous fiscal years can be compressed so there's only one credit and one debit entry per account per month. The amount in the new entry is the sum of all the compressed entries. The date assigned is the starting date for the compressed period, such as the first day of the month (if you compress entries by month). After compression, you can still see the net change for each account in the previous fiscal year.

The number of entries that result from a date compression depends on how many filters you set, which fields are combined, and which period length you choose. There's always at least one entry. When the batch job is finished, you can see the result on the **Date Compr. Registers** page.

You can compress the following data types using batch jobs.

* Finance entries - general ledger (G/L) entries, value added tax (VAT) entries, bank account ledger entries, G/L budget entries, customer ledger entries, and vendor ledger entries.
* Warehouse entries
* Resource entries
* Item budget entries
* Fixed asset (FA) ledger entries, FA maintenance ledger entries, and FA insurance ledger entries.

When you're defining criteria for the compression, you can keep the contents of certain fields using the options under **Retain Field Contents**. The available fields depend on the data you're compressing.

> [!NOTE]
> Before you can run date compression, your analysis views must be current. Learn more in the [Update an analysis view](bi-how-analyze-data-dimension.md#update-an-analysis-view) section.

After the compression, the contents of the following fields are always retained: **Posting Date**, **Vendor No.**, **Document Type**, **Currency Code**, **Posting Group**, **Amount**, **Remaining Amount**, **Original Amt. (LCY)**, **Remaining Amt. (LCY)**, **Amount (LCY)**, **Purchase (LCY)**, **Inv. Discount (LCY)**, **Pmt. Disc. Given (LCY)**, and **Pmt. Disc. Possible**.

## Posting compressed entries

Compressed entries are posted a little differently than standard posting. This difference is to reduce the number of new general ledger entries created by date compression, and is especially important when you keep information such as dimensions and document numbers. Date compression creates new entries as follows:

* On the **General Ledger Entries** page, new entries are created for the compressed entries. The **Description** field contains **Date Compressed** so the compressed entries are easy to identify. 
* On ledger pages, such as the **Customer Ledger Entries** page, one or more new entries are created. 

The posting process creates gaps in the number series for entries on the **General Ledger Entries** page. Those numbers are assigned to the entries on the ledger pages only. The number range assigned to the entries is available on the **G/L Register** page in the **From Entry No.** and **To Entry No.** fields. 

> [!NOTE]
> After you run date compression, you can't reverse vendor or bank ledger entries for any transactions that are affected by the compression.

The number of entries that result from a date compression depends on how many filters you set, which fields are combined, and the length of the time period you choose. There's always at least one entry.

> [!WARNING]
> Date compression deletes entries, so you should always make a backup copy of the database before you run the batch job.

### To run a date compression

1. Choose the ![Search for Page or Report](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Data Administration**, then choose the related link.
2. Do one of the following, depending on your needs:
    * To use an assisted guide to set up date compression for one or more types of data, choose **Data Administration Guide**.
    * To set up compression for an individual type of data, choose **Data Compression**, **Compress Entries**, then choose the data to compress.

   > [!NOTE]
   > You can only compress data more than five years old. If you want to compress data less than five years old, contact your Microsoft partner. They need to use the `OnSetMinimumNumberOfYearsToKeep` event in the "Date Compression" codeunit to set the threshold.

# Set up unrealized VAT for cash-based accounting

If you're using cash-based accounting methods, you can set up [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to handle unrealized VAT.

## To use general ledger accounts for unrealized VAT

You can choose to have VAT amounts calculated and posted to a temporary general ledger account when an invoice is posted, and then posted to the correct general ledger account and included in VAT statements when the actual payment of the invoice is posted. Before you can do this, you must complete the [VAT posting setup](finance-setup-vat.md).

To use accounts for unrealized VAT, follow these steps:

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, and enter **General Ledger Setup**.
2. On the **General Ledger Setup** page, select the **Unrealized VAT** check box.
3. Choose the **Search for Page or Report** icon ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do"), and enter **VAT Posting Setup**.
4. On the **VAT Posting Setup** page, choose the VAT posting group, and then choose the **Edit** action.
5. In the **Unrealized VAT Type** field, choose an option to specify how to allocate payments to the invoice amount (excluding VAT) and the VAT amount itself, and how to transfer VAT amounts from the unrealized VAT account to the realized account. The following table describes the options.

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Blank | Choose this option if you don't want to use the unrealized VAT feature. |
| Percentage | Payments cover both VAT and the invoice amount in proportion to the payment's percentage of the remaining invoice amount. The paid VAT amount is transferred from the unrealized VAT account to the realized VAT account. |
| First | Payments cover VAT first and then invoice amounts. In this case, the amount transferred from the unrealized VAT account to the VAT account will equal the amount of the payment until the total VAT has been paid. |
| Last | Payments cover the invoice amount first and then VAT. In this case, no amount will be transferred from the unrealized VAT account to the VAT account until the total amount of the invoice, excluding VAT, has been paid. |
| First (Fully Paid) | Payments will cover VAT first (like the _First_ option), but no amount will be transferred to the VAT account until the full amount of VAT has been paid. |
| Last (Fully Paid) | Payments will cover invoice amount first (like the _Last_ option), but no amount will be transferred to the VAT account until the full amount of VAT has been paid. |

6. In the **Sales VAT Unreal. Account** field, choose the account for unrealized sales VAT.

    > [!NOTE]  
    > The VAT amount will be posted to this account, and stay there until the customer payment is posted. The amount is then transferred to the account for sales VAT.
7. In the **Purch. VAT Unreal. Account** field, enter the general ledger account for unrealized purchase VAT.

> [!NOTE]  
> The VAT amount will be posted to this account, and stay there until the customer payment is posted. The amount is then transferred to the account for purchase VAT.
