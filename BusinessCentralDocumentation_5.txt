# Make payments

You pay vendors or customers, or reimburse your employees, by posting payment lines on the **Payment Journal** page. The payment journal is a general journal that's optimized for making payments, and offers lots of powerful actions. For example, the **Suggest Vendor Payments** action that finds vendor payments that are due, and the **Vendor - Summary Aging** report that shows an overview of due vendor payments.  

You can start the payment process from the lists, cards, and ledger entries for vendors, customers, and employees. Each of these pages has a button that starts the payment flow and helps you fill in the payment journal.  

From the payment journal, you can print computer checks or record when checks are written. If you select **Computer Check** in the **Bank Payment Type** field, you must print lines that represent checks before you can post the payment journal.

After you post payments, you can export them to a bank file you can upload to your bank for processing.

After the payments are made at your bank, you must apply them to their related open vendor or employee ledger entries. You can apply them manually or by importing a bank statement file and applying the payments automatically. For more information, see [Applying Payments Automatically and Reconciling Bank Accounts](receivables-apply-payments-auto-reconcile-bank-accounts.md).

The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the articles that describe them.

# Setting up finance

Before you can begin to run your business, you must specify how you want to manage company finance processes. First, you set up the core of the company's accounting records: the chart of accounts (COA). Then you set up posting groups, which make the process of assigning default general ledger posting accounts to customers, vendors, and items more efficient.

Some finance setup can be done automatically with assisted setup guides, and some must be done manually. Learn more at [Getting Ready for Doing Business](ui-get-ready-business.md). The **General Ledger Setup** page specifies how to handle of your company's different accounting processes. For example, use this page to specify invoice rounding details, the currency code for your local currency, address formats, and whether you want to use an additional reporting currency. Learn more at [Understanding the General Ledger and the Chart of Accounts](finance-general-ledger.md).  

You can use dimensions to add different types of information to every transaction. You can set up your company's basic dimensions, such as *Projects* and *Departments*. Later, add more dimensions when you need them. For example, you can set up temporary dimensions to use for a limited time period, such during a sales campaign. Learn more at [Working with Dimensions](finance-dimensions.md).

Many of the setup tasks must be completed before you can begin recording financial transactions, but most settings can be adjusted as needed. That said, there are optional setup tasks as well. For example, you need only set up intercompany postings and consolidations if you are working with multiple companies. And other setup tasks, such as specifying the period during which posting is allowed, may have to be repeated periodically.  

The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the topics that describe them.

# Add Companies to Your Company Hub

[!INCLUDE[azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id](~/../shared-content/shared/azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id.md)]

With the company hub, you can access your work from across multiple companies from multiple [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] environments. You can add a environments and companies manually, if your companies do not show up automatically in the company hub.  

Right in the company hub landing page, you find the **Setup** menu, from where you can access the **Environment Links** page. Simply choose **New**, and then fill in the fields. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  

> [!NOTE]
> You can connect the company hub to as many companies as you need. However, you can only connect the company hub to companies that are hosted in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online.

## Environment links

An environment link is a card where you specify the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] environment that hosts one or more companies that you do work in. The data in the card for each environment is specified by you, and you can change it as needed. However, the **Environment Link** field is critical - this is how you can access each company in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Use the **Test the connection** action in the ribbon to test that you entered the right link. The link that you must enter points at environment that hosts the company that you are adding, and it must include the Microsoft Entra ID, or the organization's domain name. For example, if they have specified a domain such as MyBusiness.com, then the link to their [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is ```https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/mybusiness.com?redirectedfromsignup=1```. Otherwise, it will look something like this: ```https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/1a23b456-789c-0123-45de-678910fg12h/production?redirectedfromsignup=1```  

The link is used when you choose the company in the company hub.  

:::image type="content" source="media/company-hub-company-list-actions.png" alt-text="Actions for a company that is listed in the company hub.":::

> [!TIP]
> If you're working in the free trial version of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], it is easy to add the companies in your tenant. You can find the environment link by copying the ID for Microsoft Entra from the **Troubleshooting** section of the Help & Support page. The environment name is probably the default value, PRODUCTION. Add this information to the **Environment Link** field, such as ```https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/1a23b456-789c-0123-45de-678910fg12h/production?redirectedfromsignup=1```, and then choose **Test the connection**. The evaluation company will be added to the list.
>
> If you have moved to the thirty-day trial company, My Company, you can add that to the list by choosing the **Reload / Reload all Companies** action in the list.

## Load companies

When you have added your environments, your companies show up automatically. However, if you know that a new company has been added to an environment, you can choose the **Reload all companies** action to refresh the list. Use the same action to refresh data from across your companies.  

> [!TIP]
> In order to refresh the data in the company hub, you must have access to the data in the companies that the data comes from.

# Classifying data sensitivity fields

To classify the fields that hold sensitive or personal data, a Microsoft partner can set the ```DataClassification``` property on fields. This requires access to the database tables, either through the development environment or by running a Windows PowerShell script. For more information, see [Classifying Data](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-classifying-data).  

As a customer, you can add a second level of classification by specifying sensitivity levels for the data you store in standard and custom fields. Classifying data sensitivity helps ensure that you know where you keep personal data in your system, and makes it easier to respond to requests from data subjects. For example, if a contact or customer asks you to export their personal data. For more information, see [Responding to Requests About Personal Data](admin-responding-to-requests-about-personal-data.md).

> [!Important]  
> Microsoft is providing this Data Sensitivity Classification feature as a matter of convenience only. It's your responsibility to classify the data appropriately and comply with any laws and regulations that are applicable to you. Microsoft disclaims all responsibility towards any claims related to your classification of the data.  

The following table describes data sensitivity levels you can assign.

|Sensitivity|Description|
|----|----|
|Sensitive | Information about a data subject's racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious beliefs, involvement with trade unions, physical or mental health, sexuality, or details about criminal offenses. |
|Personal | Information that can be used to identify a data subject, either directly or in combination with other data or information.|
|Confidential | Business data that you use for accounting or other business purposes, and do not want to expose to other entities. For example, this might include ledger entries.|
|Normal | General data that does not belong to any other categories.|

## How do I classify my data?

Classifying the sensitivity of a large number of fields one-by-one would take a long time. To help speed up the process, we provide tools that you can use to bulk classify the sensitivity of fields, and then fine-tune classifications for specific fields. You can find tools on the Data Classification Worksheet page, which is available on the Administration of users, user groups, and permissions Role Center. You must be a system administrator to use the worksheet.
 
> [!Important]  
> When you open the Data Classification Worksheet page for the first time, it will be empty. You must run the Data Classification guide to generate the list of fields. To start the guide, choose the **Set Up Data Classifications** action.

For example, the Data Classification Worksheet page lets you do things like:  

* Use the Data Classification guide to export your fields to an Excel worksheet where you can bulk classify them. Using the Excel worksheet is particularly useful if you are collaborating with a Microsoft partner. After you update the worksheet, you can use the guide to import and apply the classifications. You can also use the guide to classify fields manually.  
* Choose a field and then filter the list to find similar fields that are likely to belong to the same classification as the field you based the search on.  
* Investigate a field by viewing its contents.  

> [!Tip]  
> We have defined sample sensitivity classifications for the tables and fields in the Cronus demonstration company. You can use those classifications as inspiration when you classify your own tables and fields.

# Liabilities (Power BI report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Liabilities** report provides an overview of your company's financial obligations, highlighting total liabilities, current liabilities, payroll liabilities, and long-term liabilities. It also shows key performance indicators such as debt ratio and dept-to-equity ratio, along with total assets.

These key performance indicators can help you understand the balance between debt and equity while monitoring liabilities that affect future cash flow and operational flexibility.

Drill through into the **Liabilities Drill-Through** page to explore the underlying ledger entries that make up the balance.

:::image type="content" source="media/finance/liabilities-report.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Liabilities report" lightbox="media/finance/liabilities-report.png":::

## Use the report

The audiences for the report are:

- Executives
- Directors
- Other high-level decision makers

Executives can use the report to evaluate your company's financial position before engaging in a new expansive initiative. By first analyzing current liabilities, you can gauge your immediate debt burden. This analysis helps you determine whether there are enough liquid assets to meet short term obligations, and ensure you have cash-flow to support existing operations and new development.

Next, you could assess the debt ratio and debt-to-equity ratios. These key performance indicators provide insight into the company's leverage and risk profile. For example, a high debt-to-equity ratio could indicate that the company has a high reliance on borrowed funds. This type of data can help inform how you decide to finance the expansion project.  

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The *Liabilities* report includes the following KPIs and measures: 

- [**Liabilities**](finance-powerbi-kpis.md#liabilities)
- [**Current Liabilities**](finance-powerbi-kpis.md#current-liabilities)
- [**Payroll Liabilities**](finance-powerbi-kpis.md#payroll-liabilities)
- [**Longterm Liabilities**](finance-powerbi-kpis.md#longterm-liabilities)
- [**Debt Ratio**](finance-powerbi-kpis.md#debt-ratio)
- [**Debt/Equity Ratio**](finance-powerbi-kpis.md#debtequity-ratio)
- [**Assets**](finance-powerbi-kpis.md#assets)
- [**Balance at Date (Neg)**](finance-powerbi-kpis.md#balance-at-date-neg)

# Teams FAQ

[!INCLUDE [online_only](includes/online_only.md)]

This article answers some of the questions you might have about working with Microsoft Teams and [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## [General](#tab/general)

### How do I sign in to the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app in Teams?

After installing the app, you'll be asked to sign in the first time you use it, when you paste a [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] link into Teams chat, or choose the **Details** action on a card in Teams. Depending on your Teams client, you might have to enter the credentials you use to access [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)].

### How do I sign out of the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app in Teams?

To sign out of the identity in Teams you used to connect to [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)], go to any chat compose box, right-click the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] icon underneath, then choose **Settings**. When the window appears, check your currently signed in identity and then choose **Sign out**.

### Does the app for Teams connect to [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises? 

No. The [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams only works with [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] online. There are no plans to support [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] deployment types&mdash;such as on-premises, hybrid cloud, or private cloud&mdash;that Microsoft doesn't host or manage directly.

### Does the app work with multiple companies and environments? 

Yes. To search for contacts in a different company, go to [Settings](across-teams-settings.md). When the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app expands a link into a card, the link must contain the environment and company names for the app to match the record to the right company. You can paste links to any companies and environments you have access to within your organization and from the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] account you used to sign in. Participants in the chat will see the card. But they can't view the card details unless they have permissions to the company or environment where that record is stored.

### In which countries or regions is the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app available? 

The [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams isn't restricted by country or region. The app is available in all markets currently supported by the Teams marketplace.

### Does the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app work with any localization of [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)]? 

Yes. The app works with any localization of [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)], whether offered by Microsoft or a partner.  Learn more at [Country/regional availability and supported languages](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/compliance/apptest-countries-and-translations?toc=/dynamics365/business-central/toc.json).

### <a name="language"></a>Which languages does the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app support?

Two things determine the language used for cards and card details in Teams:

1. Your language in Teams, which you can see from your account settings in Teams. 
2. Your language in [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)], which you can see in the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] Web client (learn more in [Change Basic Setting - Language](ui-change-basic-settings.md#language)).

The following table explains how the experience differs for message authors and recipients, depending on language settings and availability of languages.

|Who|Card|Card details |
|-|----|--------------| 
|Message author |Displays in the language that's specified for you in Teams. If [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't offer that same language, the card is displayed in English. |Displayed in the language that's specified for you in [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)], which might include languages from language apps provided by partners. |
|Message recipient |Displays in the language of the message author. |Displays in the language that's specified for you in [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)]. |

Get a list of supported languages for [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] in [Supported languages](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/compliance/apptest-countries-and-translations?toc=/dynamics365/business-central/toc.json#supported-languages).

### Does the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app work with industry solutions?

Yes. But only some features of the app work with Embed apps:

- The app works with links based on the **\*.bc.dynamics.com** pattern that's typically used with Embed apps.
- Contact search isn't available for Embed apps that replace the base application from Microsoft.

Learn more about emdeb apps in [Embed apps](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/deployment/embed-app-overview).

### Does [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] work with the Teams mobile app?

Yes. The [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app can be installed from the Teams desktop app or browser, or by an administrator for all users. Once installed, the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app is automatically available in Teams for iOS and Android. On mobile devices, you can only view cards sent by others, access details, or pop out the card to the full experience in the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] mobile app. You can't paste links that expand into cards when composing messages or searching for contacts. Learn more about minimum requirements for mobile in [Minimum Requirements for Using Business Central](product-requirements.md).

### Is the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams the same as the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for iOS and Android?

No. The app for Teams is an add-in to Microsoft Teams and exclusively designed for collaboration within Teams. Alternatively, the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] mobile app delivers a rich experience for you to work with [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] data on your mobile devices.

Mobile users are encouraged to install both the mobile app and the app for Teams to get the most out of [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)]. With both installed, you can choose the **Pop out** action on a card in Teams to open the card details in the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] mobile app. Learn more about installing the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] and Teams mobile apps in:

- [Get Business Central on Your Mobile Device](install-mobile-app.md)
- [Get the Teams Mobile App](https://support.microsoft.com/office/download-the-mobile-app-for-teams-5940ebdc-0082-4fb1-83c4-751edc23dcb5) in Microsoft Support

### Does the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app work in all Teams clients?

No. The [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams isn't supported when installed as a package for macOS or Linux. On those platforms, use a supported browser to access Teams.

Learn more about minimum requirements in [Minimum Requirements for Using Business Central](product-requirements.md#teams).

Learn more about the choice of Teams clients and how to install them at [Get clients for Microsoft Teams](/microsoftteams/get-clients) in the Teams documentation.

### Which Teams client is best for [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)]?

There are only minor differences and limitations between Teams clients that might affect your experience with the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams. When choosing a Teams client, consider:

- The camera and location can't be accessed from the details window in the Teams desktop app.
- Phone numbers can't be activated from the details window in Teams for iOS, Android, or in the browser.
- Using Microsoft Edge with Teams in the browser lets you easily work across multiple identities and accounts by signing in to Teams from different profiles. Learn more about using profiles in Microsoft Edge at [Sign in and create multiple profiles in Microsoft Edge](https://support.microsoft.com/office/sign-in-and-create-multiple-profiles-in-microsoft-edge-df94e622-2061-49ae-ad1d-6f0e43ce6435) in Microsoft Support.

### What is the best way for me to demonstrate [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] and Microsoft Teams to prospective customers?

If you're a reselling partner, you might want to have an environment that you can show prospects as part of pre-sales demonstrations. To avoid affecting Microsoft Teams in your organization, you can get a Microsoft 365 demo account at [https://aka.ms/CDX](https://aka.ms/CDX). This account gives you full control of an independent Azure organization that includes Microsoft Teams and [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)]. Learn more at [Preparing Demonstration Environments of Dynamics 365 Business Central](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/demo-environment).

### Does the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams cater to my customization and personalization?

The [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams can display cards for links to customer pages and tables in [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)], such as those pages and tables from your own custom extensions or AppSource.

The fields shown on a card in Teams can also be affected by [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] customizations installed for your organization. Cards don't consider any role-specific customizations or user personalization. However, the card details window shows record details as you would see them in [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)], including extensions, role customizations, and user personalization.

When you search for contacts, the fields matched in the **Contacts** table and fields shown in the search results aren't affected by any customization or personalization.

### How do the permissions required by the app affect my privacy?

Before installing the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams, you can review the minimum permissions required for the app to function. By installing the app, you give the app permission to receive the messages and data you provide to it and you give Teams permission to store and process those messages.

Also, some [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] features require opening external links or access to your camera or geographic location. So suppose you wanted to capture a photo of a purchase invoice for processing. The [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app doesn't use these capabilities without your consent and they're only used by specific features in the **Details** window. When you use one of these features for the first time, Teams displays a dialog box asking you to grant access to the required device capabilities.

- In Teams desktop, you review and adjust app permissions from the **Settings** window. Select your profile picture at the top of the app, select **Settings** > **Permissions**, then select the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app.

- For Teams in the browser and Teams for iOS or Android, you can review or adjust permissions from your browser or device settings.

> [!NOTE]
> Exactly which [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] features prompt you for permissions depends on the add-on apps and customizations applied to the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] environment you connect to.

### Where can I learn about my privacy? 

You can learn about how Microsoft handles your data in the [Microsoft Privacy Statement](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2030602). 

Contact your administrator to learn how your organization handles the privacy of your data.

### How do I uninstall the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams?

To remove the app that you installed for yourself, go to any chat compose box, find the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] icon underneath, right-click the icon, and select **Uninstall**.  

### Will Microsoft continue to improve the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams?

At Microsoft, we're constantly listening to feedback from our diverse user community and acting upon the top suggestions. To learn about what's next for the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams, see the [Dynamics 365 release plan](/dynamics365-release-plan/2021wave1/).

If you want to participate in improving the app for Teams, or have an idea that would help simplify your work or collaborative experiences in Teams, add an idea or vote for existing ideas at [https://aka.ms/BusinessCentralIdeas](https://aka.ms/BusinessCentralIdeas).

### Where can I find Teams integration inside the Business Central web client? 

To learn about the functionality in the web client that links to Teams, see [Share Records and Page Links in Microsoft Teams](across-working-with-teams.md#share-link).

## [Business Central Tabs](#tab/tabs)

### <a name="who-can-view"></a>Who can see the content of a tab?

Any person in your chat or channel who has:

1. The Business Central app for Teams installed.
2. Either a Business Central license or has been granted access to Business Central using their Microsoft 365 license.
3. Permissions to view the data on the page.

### <a name=#recommended-content></a>Where does the recommended content come from?

The recommended content that you can choose from in the **Tab content** option on a tab is based on your Role Center. The recommend content only includes list pages, like Customers, Sales Orders, and Vendors - not individuals card page alike a specific customer or vendor.

Specifically, the recommended content includes:

- Actions in the top navigation menu of the role center
- Any list pages you've bookmarked.
- If a list page offers different views, including any views you created, you also get to choose from those views

You can add list pages to the recommended content by adding bookmarks. You can also remove recommended content by deleting bookmarks. Learn more in [Bookmark a Page or Report on Your Role Center](ui-bookmarks.md).

If you switch the environment or company on the tab option, the recommended content will changed based on the Role Center and bookmarks for the environment and company you switch to.

### When I create a tab, does it grant permissions to the people in the channel or chat?

No. Creating tabs doesn't affect permissions, and users must already have permission to that data when they access the tab.

### Can I chat alongside a tab?

Yes. Use the chat icon to start the conversation. This chat thread is then associated with the tab. 

### If I remove a tab from a chat or channel, is any Business Central data deleted?

No.

### Can I safely rename a tab?

Yes. The contents of the tab are unrelated to the actual name of the tab. Rename at will! 

### I need to work across tasks in different windows. Can I do this?

Yes. You can pop out the tab to its own browser window to show the Business Central web client. 

### Can I add or pin tab in Team meetings?

No. The Business Central app for Teams doesn't support tabs in meetings.

### Can't add a tab if using ISV Urls like *.bc.dynamics.com (but can pin)

Not supported.

### When I do things in the tab, like navigate, resort, apply a filter, or search, do others see my changes?

No. Only field changes or running actions affect how others see the contents of the tab.

### Does the tab content refresh automatically? If not, how do I refresh it?

The content doesn't refresh automatically, and these currently no refresh button. The best way to refresh the content to make sure it's up to data, leave the tab and then come back. 

### Does this show lists and records from my customizations and add-ons?

Yes. 

### When I add a tab, will people see it in my language?

No. Each user views the tab contents in the language, region, and timezone settings from Business Central. 

### Can I have multiple tabs pointing to different content?

Yes.

### Can I also add tabs to chat with a single person?

Yes, as long as the chat isn't a draft (that is, a message hasn't been sent to initiate that chat) and the other person has the Business Central app installed too.

### Can I switch companies within a tab?

No.

### Is this different than using Teams' generic ability to create a tab that hosts a website?

Yes. We don't recommend that you use approach. In many cases, it doesn't work for Business Central.

## [Search for Contacts](#tab/contacts)

### Which tables does the app search in?

When searching for contacts from the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams, your search terms are matched against records in the **Contacts** table in [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)]. 

### Which fields in the contacts table can I search?

As you type your search terms in the search box, the terms are matched against most fields in the **Contacts** table. The fields include, for example, the **No.**, **Name**, **Address**, **Phone No.** or **Mobile Phone No.**, and **Email** fields. 

Search terms aren't matched against any custom fields added to the **Contacts** table by apps and extensions.

### Do search results include companies and persons?

Yes. In [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)], contacts can be of type **Company** or type **Person**, where one or more persons can be associated with a company. In the search results, companies and persons have different icons.

### Do contacts of any business relationship appear in the results?

Yes. Some contacts can represent customers or vendors, or both. Other contacts with no defined business relation typically represent prospective customers. Contacts with other business relations, including any custom relations you've configured in [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)], will also be displayed in the search results.

### Can I look up contact details during meetings?

Yes. You can look up contact information, history of interaction, and related documents for your customer or vendor during a Teams meeting or call while the meeting is happening, without leaving Teams.

In fact, you can look up contact details from anywhere in Teams by using the **Search** box. You can, for example, look up contact details from the Teams calendar to help you set up meetings.

### How do I view my last interactions with a contact?

The details window for a contact displays interaction log entries. The interaction log entries provide the history of interactions that your organization has had with the specific contact. The interactions can include emails you've exchanged, calls you've received, or documents you've sent.

For interactions to be displayed, [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] must be configured to track interactions. To learn more about logging interactions, see [Record Interactions With Contacts](marketing-interactions.md).

### How do I register a Teams call or meeting as an interaction?

From the details window for a contact, find the **Create Interaction** action, and choose from the incoming or outgoing calls as interaction templates. You can also create your own custom interaction templates specifically for use with Teams conversations.

### Can I call a contact from the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams?

[!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] has limited integration to Teams calling capabilities. It isn't possible to instantly start a VOIP call from the contact card or contact details window. However, when you view the contact details in the Teams desktop app, you can select the phone number field to dial that number if Teams is set up as your default dialing app on your device. To dial landlines or mobile phone numbers using PSTN, the traditional phone system, Teams requires that you have the Microsoft 365 Business Voice app. To learn more, see [What is Microsoft 365 Business Voice?](/MicrosoftTeams/business-voice/whats-business-voice).

### How do I view recent documents for a customer or vendor?

[!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] typically relates a contact with a customer or vendor record that in turn is related to business transaction records, such as sales quotes or purchase invoices. To view related documents for a contact, go to the details window for the contact, select the **Business Relation** field value or use the actions to navigate to the associated customer or vendor. On the customer or vendor page, expand the FactBox pane to reveal statistics for various documents that you can drill down into. Your experience can differ based on your customizations and personalization.

### How do I search for contacts using special characters?

You can enter search criteria using almost any unicode characters. However, [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] reserves the following symbols for other uses: **=**, **.**, **\***, and **@**. Using these symbols in your search terms might not return the expected results. If you don't see the expected results, enclose the symbols in your search terms in single quotes, for example, **Contoso'='2**.

### How can I search contacts stored in a different company?

The [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams can search for customers, vendors, and other contacts in one company at a time.  
To search for contacts stored in a different [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] company, open [Settings](across-teams-settings.md), then change the environment and company from there.

### Are [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] contacts different than the ones in the Teams contacts screen?

Yes. Contacts stored in [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] represent business contacts available to your organization. They're contacts with which you have an established and well-defined business relationship, or contacts that represent prospective customers. These contacts are typically external contacts. In comparison, the contacts shown in the Teams Calling contacts list are your own contacts. These contacts aren't necessarily shared with others in your organization, and they typically represent contacts internal to your organization.

### Does [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] synchronize contacts with Teams?

No. Contacts stored in [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] remain separate from your contacts stored in Teams. There are currently no plans to synchronize the two lists together. When you use the Teams feature **Share someone's contact info** from the chat compose box, it has no relation to Business Central contacts.

### Can I search from my mobile device?

Contact search isn't available from Teams for iOS and Teams for Android at this time.

### Which permissions do I need for contact search?

To search for contacts, you need object-level permission to the **Contacts** table within the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] company being searched. To view the details window for a contact, you need at least read permission to the **Contact** page within the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] company, and any other related objects.

### Can I use contact search if I'm a delegated admin?

Yes. You can also look up contacts and contact details if you have a delegated admin role in an organization.

### Is contact search affected by API limits?

Yes. Searching for contacts from Teams is based on [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] v2.0 APIs and subject to any API limits that manage usage. Learn more about the limits in [Current API Limits](/dynamics-nav/api-reference/v2.0/dynamics-current-limits).

### Why does it sometimes ask me to set up the app?

After you sign in to the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams for the first time, the app will attempt to determine your preferred company in [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)]. If the app can't determine the company, you might have to go to the **Settings** and choose the company you wish to search in. This situation happens, for example, if you have access to multiple companies across environments in your organization. In this case, you'll have to choose a company before you can start searching.  

The app can also ask you to visit the **Settings** if you don't have a [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] subscription, there are no [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] environments, or your account doesn't have a [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] license.

### I'd like to search for items or records from other tables. Can I do this from Teams?

Searching in other tables isn't possible at this time. The [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams searches only in the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] contacts list, which can include vendors, customers, and other contacts.

If you'd like to see the search capabilities evolve to include other tables, we encourage our community to add an idea or vote for existing ideas at https://aka.ms/BusinessCentralIdeas.

## [Work with cards](#tab/cards)

### Which types of links does the app support?

The [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams reacts to most [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] Web client links. When the link refers to a single record on a page, the card will display fields for that record. The supported page types include: 

- Card pages, such as the Item card
- Document pages, such as the Sales Order document
- ListPlus pages that represent a single record composed of other records, such as a Bank Account Reconciliation statement
- Simple list pages where a record doesn't offer the ability to drill down into a separate details page, such as the Zip codes list

When pasting a link to the root Web client Url, such as https://businesscentral.dynamics.com, the card instead displays information to help new users get started with accessing [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)].

### How do I delete a card I sent to a chat?

You can't delete a card that you've already sent to chat. But you can delete the entire message that the card is a part of.

As the message author, you can delete any messages you sent to chats with a person, group, or channel&mdash;unless your administrator has set up policies that prevent deleting messages. If you moderate a channel as a channel owner, your administrator might have also granted you permission to delete any messages in the channel, including those messages sent by other users.

Deleting a message that contains a card doesn't delete or affect any data in [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)].

### Do cards always show up-to-date information?

No. The field values on a card in Teams, including any images, are based on the data available when that card was sent to the chat. [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] cards don't automatically refresh in Teams. 

### Why don't cards show more information instead of just the page name and details button?

An administrator might have configured the Teams integration so that cards don't show data about records. For more information, see [Show or hide record data on cards](admin-teams-integration.md#show-or-hide-record-data-on-cards).

### Will others see my card if they don't have the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams? 

When you compose and send a message to chat that includes a card, all users will see the card&mdash;even if they haven't installed the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams.

### How do I find out which company a card in Teams belongs to?

If you work across [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] companies, talk to your administrator about enabling a company badge for each company. When enabled, this eye-catching hint appears in any details window inside Teams, and displays the company and environment that record belongs to. To learn how to set up company badge, see [Display a company badge](admin-company-information.md#badge).

## [Work with card details](#tab/carddetails)

### Where is the save button in the details window in Teams?

[!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically saves changes you make to any field as soon as you leave the field. To leave a field, click/tap anywhere outside the field or use the Tab key to move to the next field. When data appears in a dialog within the details window, you might need to choose the **OK** button to have [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] save your changes.

### If I choose to view details for a card, will other users see my details window?

No. While everyone in the chat or meeting can view the card itself, the details window only appears for you on your device when you choose **Details**. Other users must choose **Details** if they would like to view the details window on their device.

### Can I start a Teams call from the details window in Teams?

Yes. If you're using the Teams desktop app, start a call by choosing the linked number in a phone number field, like the **Mobile Phone No.** field on the **Contact** card. Teams must be your designated dialing app.

To call local or international landlines and mobile phones, Teams requires that you have a Business Voice license for enterprise calling. Also, you must set up Teams as your call solution. To learn more, see [Plan your Teams voice solution](/microsoftteams/cloud-voice-landing-page) in the Teams documentation.

### Can I print documents from the details window in Teams?

Yes. You print reports and other documents using standard [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] printing functionality and any cloud-enabled printer configured in the **Printer Management** page in [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)]. You can't print from Teams to local printers known to your client device, such as printers that you'd typically print to from your browser. For this reason, you can't print from the report preview window, but only from the main report request page, directly to your cloud printers.

For more information about setting up cloud printers, see [Set Up Printers](ui-specify-printer-selection-reports.md).

### Can I access the camera from the details window in Teams?

Yes. Any [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] features in the details window that use the camera are available on all Teams clients.

### <a name="location"></a>Can I access my location from the details window in Teams?

If you're using functionality in [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] that accesses your current location coordinates, such as with maps, you must use Teams in the browser or the Teams mobile app. Location isn't available when using the Teams desktop app.

### How do I open the details in a new window?

Popping out the details window as a separate window is useful for multi-tasking or for being able to work with business data while still being able to use Teams chat and other Teams functions. To open details in its own window, choose **Open in browser** from the ellipse menu (**...**) in the upper right corner of the window.

## [Collaborate with guests](#tab/collaborating)

### Can I share cards with users outside my organization?

Yes. When you compose and send a message that includes a card, all recipients in the chat will see the card&mdash;even if they're guests or external to your organization. Guests can also open the details window if they've been granted permissions to access that data in [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)].

### Is the experience any different for users that are guests?

Yes. Inviting guest users from outside your organization to participate in chat or a channel gives them a similar, but not identical experience compared to users within your organization. When a guest receives a message that includes a card, they can view it. Guests can also open the details page if they have permission to access that data in [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] and assigned a [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] license within your organization.

Choosing the details link on any Business Central card will sign you in to the environment from which the card was shared, assuming you have permission to the environment.

Guest users aren't allowed to use contact search because it's bound to the original tenant and we don't currently support such a delegated scenario.

When a guest composes a message, links to their [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] or yours won't expand into cards.

To learn about other similarities and differences between guests and team members, go to [Guest experience in Teams](/MicrosoftTeams/guest-experience) in the Teams documentation.

### How does a guest user install the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app? 

Guests don't have access to the app marketplace to install apps themselves. However, the app can be automatically installed for them based on your organization's policies. Another way for a guest user to install the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app is when they receive a chat message that includes a [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] card. In this case, the user chooses the **Details** button or the menu on the card, then installs the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for use with your organization. After installing the app, a user doesn't automatically receive any permissions to access data from your [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)].

## [Share to Teams](#tab/share)

### Does Share to Teams send a compact card? 

Yes. The link will automatically expand into a card if you have the Business Central app for Teams installed. 

### Will recipients receive the message from me or from a Business Central service account? 

When you use Share to Teams, the message is sent to a person, group, or channel, similar to if you had sent the message yourself from within Microsoft Teams. Recipients see the message from you on their preferred Teams client, and can react and respond as they normally would to a message from you. 

### Is Share to Teams available in Business Central on premises? 

No. Similar to the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams, this feature is only available for the web client in [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] online. There are no plans to support [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] deployment types&mdash;like on-premises, hybrid cloud, or private cloud&mdash;that Microsoft doesn't host or manage directly.

### Does Share to Teams grant permissions to recipients? 

No. When you share with a person, group, or channel, permissions are unaffected. Users who already have permission to view the page and data targeted by the link can do so. Users who don't have permission to view that page and data, or don't have a [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] license, are shown an error message. 
 
### Must I have the Teams desktop app installed to use Share to Teams? 

No. All you need is a valid account that has access to Microsoft Teams. 

### Is Share to Teams available in all Business Central clients? 

At this time, Share to Teams is available in the desktop web client, in the details window in Teams, and when opening a page in a new window from the Outlook add-in.

### Where do I find Share to Teams in Business Central? 

The **Share to Teams action** can be found in the **Share** menu on all pages, such as card and document pages, list or worksheet pages, including custom pages. The action isn't available on dialog boxes or pages shown as dialog boxes, such as lookup pages or wizards.

# Set Up Fixed Assets with User-Defined Depreciation Methods

You can use [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to set up the user-defined depreciation methods as described here.

For each user-defined method, you use the **Depreciation Tables** page, where you must enter a depreciation percentage for each period (month, quarter, year, or accounting period). Then, when you assign a depreciation book with a user-defined method to a fixed asset, you must set the **First User-Defined Depr. Date** and **Depreciation Starting Date** fields on the **FA Depreciation Books** page for the specific fixed asset.  

The formula for calculating the depreciation amounts is:  

*Depreciation Amount = (Depreciation % x Number of Depreciation Days x Depr. Basis) / (100 x 360)*


> [!NOTE]  
> While the date in the field **First User-Defined Depr. Date** is used to determine the time intervals, it is the **Depreciation Starting Date** that is used to determine the number of depreciation days. If the **First User-Defined Depr. Date** is earlier than the **Depreciation Starting Date**, the percentage for the first period in the depreciation table will be only partially used when the program calculates the first depreciation. This means that the asset will not be completely depreciated by the end of the last period.

## To assign a depreciation book to a fixed asset with a user-defined depreciation method

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Fixed Assets**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the fixed asset that you want to set up a fixed asset depreciation book for.
3. Choose the **Related** action, and then choose **Fixed Asset**, and then **Depreciation Books**. This opens the **FA Depreciation Books** page.

   By default, some of the fields that need to be filled in per the instructions below are hidden, so you must display them. To do this you need to personalize the page. For more information, see [To start personalizing a page through the Personalizing banner](ui-personalization-user.md#start-personalizing-by-using-the-personalization-mode).
4. In the field **Depreciation Method**, select **User-Defined**.
5. In the field **Depreciation Table Code**, select the **Depreciation Table** you want to use.
6. In the field **Depreciation Starting Date**, select the starting date for the depreciation calculation.
7. When you use a user-defined method, the **First User-Defined Depr. Date** field must be set to a date that is the same or earlier than the field **Depreciation Starting Date**. If you have selected a value in the **Period Length** field in the depreciation table, the date in the field **First User-Defined Depr. Date** must be the starting date of an accounting period.
8. Either fill in the field **No. of Depreciation Years** or the field **Depreciation Ending Date**. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)] 

## To set up user-defined depreciation methods

On the **Depreciation Table** page, you can set up user-defined depreciation methods. For example, you can set up depreciation based on number of units.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Depreciation Tables**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Depreciation Table List** page, choose the **New** action.  
3. On the **Depreciation Table Card** page, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  

> [!TIP]
> Use the **Create Sum of Digits Table** function to define a depreciation table based on the *Sum of Digits* method.

With the *Sum of Digits* method, if a fixed asset is depreciated over 4 years, then the depreciation for each year is calculated in the following way:

Sum of Digits = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10
Depreciation:

* Year 1 = 4/10  
* Year 2 = 3/10  
* Year 3 = 2/10  
* Year 4 = 1/10  

### Depreciation Based on Number of Units

This user-defined method can also be used to depreciate based on number of units, for example, in the case of production machines with an established lifetime capacity. On the **Depreciation Tables** page, you can enter the number of units that can be produced in each period (month, quarter, year,or accounting period).  

### Example - User-defined Depreciation

You use a depreciation method that allows you to depreciate assets in an accelerated manner for income tax purposes.  

You would use the following depreciation rates for a fixed asset with a three-year lifetime for tax purposes:  

* Year 1: 25%  
* Year 2: 38%  
* Year 3: 37%  

The acquisition cost is LCY 100,000, and the depreciable lifetime is five years. Depreciation is calculated annually.  

| Date | FA Posting Type | Days | Amount | Book Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 01/01/20 |Acquisition Cost |(Depreciation starting date) |100,000.00 |100,000.00 |
| 12/31/20 |Depreciation |360 |-25,000.00 |75,000.00 |
| 12/31/21 |Depreciation |360 |-38,000.00 |37,000.00 |
| 12/31/22 |Depreciation |360 |-37,000.00 |0 |
| 12/31/23 |Depreciation |None |None |0 |
| 12/31/24 |Depreciation |None |None |0 |

In the previous example, both the **First User-Defined Depr. Date** and **Depreciation Starting Date** fields would be set to 01/01/20 in the **FA Depreciation Books** page for the specific fixed asset. If, however, the **First User-Defined Depr. Date** field contained 01/01/20 and the **Depreciation Starting Date** field contained 04/01/20, the result would be:  

| Date | FA Posting Type | Days | Amount | Book Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 01/01/20 |Acquisition Cost |(Depreciation starting date) |100,000.00 |100,000.00 |
| 12/31/20 |Depreciation |270 |-18,750.00 |81,250.00 |
| 12/31/21 |Depreciation |360 |-38,000.00 |42,250.00 |
| 12/31/22 |Depreciation |360 |-37,000.00 |6,250.00 |
| 12/31/23 |Depreciation |90 |-6,250.00 |0 |
| 12/31/24 |Depreciation |None |None |0 |

# Approval workflow notifications

Set up your workflows to automatically notify users when their attention is required for a step in a workflow. Many workflow responses involve notifying a user an event they must act on has occurred.

For example, you can set it so User 2, the approver user, receives a notification whenever User 1 requests approval for a new record. On the next workflow step, after User 2 approves the record, User 3 is notified and can begin a related processing of the record. With approval workflow steps, each notification is tied to an approval entry. Learn more at [Workflow](across-workflow.md).  

> [!NOTE]  
> The default version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports notifications in email or as internal notes.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> All workflow notifications are sent through a job queue. Make sure the job queue in your installation is set up to handle workflow notifications, and that you've selected the **Start Automatically From Server** check box. Learn more at [Use Job Queues to Schedule Tasks](admin-job-queues-schedule-tasks.md).

## Set up notifications

You can set up different aspects of workflow notifications in the following places:  

* Approver notification

  For approval workflows, set up the recipients of workflow notifications by filling in a line on the **Approval User Setup** page for each user that takes part in the workflow.  

  For example, if User 2 is specified in the **Approver ID** field on the line for User 1, then the approval request notification is sent to User 2. Learn more at [Set Up Approval Users](across-how-to-set-up-approval-users.md). 
  
* Notification schedules

  Set up when and how users receive workflow notifications by filling in the **Notification Schedule** page for each workflow user. Learn more at [Specify When and How to Receive Notifications](across-how-to-specify-when-and-how-to-receive-notifications.md). 
  
* Customize the email notifications

  If you like, you can customize the content of the email notification by modifying Report 1320, Notification Email. Learn more at [Create and Modify Custom Report Layouts](ui-how-create-custom-report-layout.md).  

  > [!NOTE]
  > If you want to use email as the notification method, you must set up email for both the sender and the receiver in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Learn more at [Set up Email](admin-how-setup-email.md).
  
* Response options

  Set up specific content for and rules of a workflow notification when you create the workflow in question. Select the customization options on the **Workflow Responses** page for the workflow response that represents the notification. Learn more from step 9 in the [Create Workflows](across-how-to-create-workflows.md#to-create-a-workflow) section. 
  
* Notify sender

  For approval workflows, add a workflow response step to notify the sender when the request has been approved or rejected. Learn more from step 9 in the [Create Workflows](across-how-to-create-workflows.md#to-create-a-workflow) section.

# Correct or cancel unpaid sales invoices

You can correct or cancel an unpaid posted sales invoice, provided that it hasn't been fully shipped. This is useful if you make a mistake or if the customer requests a change before the shipment is complete. In all other scenarios, we recommend that you create a corrective sales credit memo directly. For more information, see [To create a sales credit memo from a posted sales invoice](sales-how-process-sales-returns-cancellations.md#to-create-a-sales-credit-memo-from-a-posted-sales-invoice).  

> [!NOTE]  
> After a posted sales invoice has been partially or fully paid, you cannot correct or cancel it from the posted sales invoice itself. Instead, you must manually create a sales credit memo to void the sale and reimburse the customer, optionally managed with a sales return order. For more information, see [Process Sales Returns or Cancellations](sales-how-process-sales-returns-cancellations.md).

The difference between canceling or correcting a posted sales invoice that isn't paid or shipped is described in the following table.

| Action | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Cancel** |The posted sales invoice is canceled. A corrective sales credit memo is automatically created and posted to void the initial posted sales invoice. On the initial posted sales invoice, the **Canceled** and **Paid** checkboxes are selected. |
| **Correct** |The posted sales invoice is canceled. A new sales invoice with the same information is created, unless the posted sales order was posted from a sales order. In that case, we suggest you cancel the posted sales invoice instead and then make the correction and continue the sales process from the original sales order. <br/><br/>The new sales invoice has a different number than the initial sales invoice. A corrective sales credit memo is automatically created and posted to void the initial posted sales invoice. On the initial posted sales invoice, the **Canceled** and **Paid** checkboxes are selected. |
|**Create Corrective Credit Memo**|A new sales credit memo is created with the same information. You can adjust the new sales credit memo before posting, and it will be applied to the original invoice when you post it. |

When you correct or cancel a posted sales invoice, the corrective sales credit memo is applied to all general ledger and inventory ledger entries that were created when the initial sales invoice was posted. This reverses the posted sales invoice in your financial records and leaves the corrective posted sales credit memo for your audit trail.  

> [!TIP]
> If you have posted a prepayment invoice for a sales invoice that you then correct or cancel, you must correct or cancel the prepayment as well. For more information, see [Correct Prepayments](finance-how-to-correct-prepayments.md).

## To cancel a posted sales invoice

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Posted Sales Invoices**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the posted sales invoice that you want to cancel.

    > [!NOTE]  
    > If the **Canceled** checkbox is selected, then you cannot cancel the posted sales invoice because it has already been canceled or corrected.
3. On the **Posted Sales Invoice** page, choose the **Cancel** action.

    A sales credit memo is automatically created and posted to void the initial posted sales invoice. The **Canceled** field on the initial posted sales invoice is changed to **Yes**.
4. Choose **Show Corrective Credit Memo** to view the posted sales credit memo that voids the initial posted sales invoice.

### Partial invoice posting also supported

If the cancellation is related to a partial invoice posting, then the originating sales order line is updated to reflect the canceled invoiced quantity. The **Qty. to Invoice** and **Qty. Invoiced** fields on the related sales order line are reset to the values before the partial posting.

## To correct a posted sales invoice

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Posted Sales Invoices**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the posted sales invoice that you want to correct.

    > [!NOTE]  
    >   If the **Canceled** checkbox is selected, you can't correct the posted sales invoice because it has already been corrected or canceled.
3. On the **Posted Sales Invoice** page, choose the **Correct** action.  

    > [!NOTE]
    > If the sales invoice was posted from a sales order, we recommend that you *cancel* this sales invoice and then process the correction from the original sales order. If the original sales order has been deleted, such as if it has been fully shipped, you can create a new sales order by using the **Copy Document** action. For more information, see [To create a sales credit memo by copying a posted sales invoice](sales-how-process-sales-returns-cancellations.md#to-create-a-sales-credit-memo-by-copying-a-posted-sales-invoice).
4. A new sales invoice with the same information is created where you can make the correction. The **Canceled** field on the initial posted sales invoice is changed to **Yes**.

    A sales credit memo is automatically created and posted to void the initial posted sales invoice.
5. Choose the **Show Corrective Credit Memo** action to view the posted sales credit memo that voids the initial posted sales invoice.

# Suggest vendor payments

On the **Payment Journal** page, you can use the **Suggest Vendor Payments** batch job to suggest payment lines. Based on your settings, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] suggests lines for:

- Payments that are due soon.
- Payments where a payment discount is available.

To benefit fully from payment suggestions, you must prioritize your vendors. To learn more about prioritizing vendors, go to [Prioritize Vendors](purchasing-how-prioritize-vendors.md).  

> [!NOTE]  
> The batch job excludes vendor ledger entries that are **On Hold** or that are already applied and have a value in the **Applies-to ID** field.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> If you want to take advantage of payment discounts, and have entered an available amount, the amount will be used for:  
>
> * Prioritized overdue vendor entries first, in order of priority.
> * Overdue vendor entries that aren't prioritized.  
> * Open vendor entries that qualify for payment discounts. The entries are arranged by vendor number.  

## Use the Suggest Vendor Payments action

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Payment Journals**, and then select the related link.  
2. Open the journal, and then select the **Suggest Vendor Payments** action.  
3. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  
4. Select the **OK** button.  

## Insert the due date as posting date on payment journal lines

When you use the **Suggest Vendor Payments** batch job to create payment lines for your vendors, you can fill two special fields to ensure that the generated lines use the due date to calculate the posting date. These fields are **Calculate Posting Date from Applies-to-Doc. Due Date** and **Applies-to-Doc. Due Date Offset**.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> You can't use the **Calculate Posting Date from Applies-to-Doc. Due Date** field together with the **Find Payment Discounts** field or the **Summarize per Vendor** field. If the posting date is based on the due date, some payment discounts might not calculate correctly because the posting date is after the payment discount date.  

Also, if the calculated posting date is in the past, then the posting date is moved up to the work date and a warning displays.  

You can also manually create payment lines using the due date to calculate the posting date. After you apply vendor ledger entries, you can use the **Calculate Posting Date** action to update the posting date on the journal line with the due date of the related purchase invoice. To learn more about this manual process, go to [Apply Purchase Transactions Manually](payables-how-apply-purchase-transactions-manually.md).  

> [!NOTE]  
> If the purchase invoice is overdue, the posting date is set to the work date and the font on the line changes to red.

# Troubleshoot your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automated workflows

When you connect [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with Power Automate to create automated workflows, you might run into error messages. This article provides suggested solutions to recurring problems.

## Flow doesn't run on all records created or changed

### Problem

If an event creates or changes many records, the flow doesn't run on some or all records.

### Possible cause

Currently, there's a limit on how many records a flow can process. If more than 1000 records are created or changed within 30 seconds, the flow isn't triggered.

> [!NOTE]
> For developers, the flow triggering is done via webhook notifications, and this limitation is due to the way the Business Central connector handles `collection` notifications. Learn more at [Working with Webhooks in Dynamics 365 Business Central](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/api-reference/v2.0/dynamics-subscriptions#notes-for-power-automate-flows) in the Developer and Admin help.

## "The response from the Business Central service is too large" error

### Problem

When using an action that interacts with records (such as *Create record (V3)* and *Get record (V3)*), Power Automate might display an error similar to this one:

`The response from the Business Central service is too large`

### Possible cause

Even though Business Central has no set limit on the size of records returned by APIs, the Dynamics 365 Business Central connector for Power Automate can handle only records up to 8 MB.

All the Business Central APIs provided by Microsoft return records under this limit, but APIs provided by partners might not. If you see an error "The response from the Business Central service is too large," reach out to the partner who created the API you're using.

## "Entity set not found" error

### Problem

When you create a new Power Automate flow using a [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] approval trigger, such as *When a purchase document approval is requested*, you might get an error message similar to this one:

`Entity set not found: \<name\>`

The placeholder, `\<name\>`, is the service name of the missing web service, such as *workflowWebhookSubscriptions* or *workflowPurchaseDocumentLines*.

### Possible cause

Using Power Automate for approvals requires certain page and codeunit objects to be published as web services. By default, most of the required objects are published as web services. But in some cases, your environment might have been customized so these objects are no longer published.

### Fix

Go to the **Web Services** page and make sure the following objects are published as web services. There should be an entry in the list for each object, with the **Published** check box selected.  

| Object Type | Object ID | Object Name | Service Name |
|--|--|--|--|
| Codeunit | 1544 | WorkflowWebhookSubscription | WorkflowActionResponse |
| Page | 6408 | workflowCustomers | workflowCustomers |
| Page | 6406 | workflowGenJournalBatches | workflowGenJournalBatches |
| Page | 6407 | workflowGenJournalLines | workflowGenJournalLines |
| Page | 6409 | workflowItems | workflowItems |
| Page | 6405 | Purchase Document Line Entity | workflowPurchaseDocumentLines |
| Page | 6404 | workflowPurchaseDocuments | workflowPurchaseDocuments |
| Page | 6403 | Sales Document Line Entity | workflowSalesDocumentLines |
| Page | 6402 | workflowSalesDocuments | workflowSalesDocuments |
| Page | 6410 | workflowVendors | workflowVendors |
| Page | 831 | workflowWebhookSubscriptions | workflowWebhookSubscriptions |

> [!NOTE]
> The **Service Name** value must be exactly as shown in the table. Don't change or translate the service name.

# Power BI Inventory Valuation app

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The Power BI Inventory Valuation app pulls data from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to provide business leaders key information about inventory across their organization. The app has various reports that offer insights into costing areas. The report can help you make informed decisions and ensure you account for costs.

## Inventory valuation analytics for leadership teams

To fit this category, you might have a role such as:

- Chief Executive Officer
- Chief Operations Officer
- Chief Finance Officer

### Example scenario: maintaining stock costs

Chief executives want to identify locations that hold the most stock value. The [Inventory Valuation by Location](inventory-valuation-powerbi-inventory-valuation-by-location.md) report can help you find that location. You can also break down this data by using the [Inventory Valuation by Item](inventory-valuation-powerbi-inventory-valuation-by-item.md) report to explore the value of each item you have on hand.

## How to use the reports in the Power BI Inventory Valuation app

The following table describes on how you can use each report in the app.

# FAQ for Suggest Number Series with Copilot (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]

These frequently asked questions (FAQ) describe the AI effect of the suggest number series feature in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/production-ready-preview-dynamics365.md)]

## What is suggest number series with Copilot?

Suggest number series can help you create number series for all entities and documents in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] based on structured input or natural language.

* Examples of entities are customers, vendors, and items.
* Examples of documents are quotes, orders, and invoices.

The feature isn't a general-purpose chat, but a highly specific and integrated experience that you can use to administrate number series. The feature offers two distinct skills that can help you create new or modify existing number series.

## What are the capabilities of suggest number series?

* Create new number series

   Use natural language to effortlessly set up new number series. Provide examples or masks to define how you envision your setup, and have Copilot draft suggestions for you to build upon.

* Modify existing number series

   Have Copilot help you maintain your existing number series. Extending number series can feel tedious. With Copilot, you can use natural language to modify number series and build upon the suggestions from Copilot.

* Prepare new number series for the next year

   Get ready for the next fiscal year by creating new number series ahead of time.

## What is the intended use of the suggest number series?

The suggest number series capability is intended for system administrators who set up and maintain number series in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. It's a tool to transform requirements written in natural language into the number series structure in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## How was suggest number series evaluated? What metrics are used to measure performance?

The feature underwent extensive testing where numerous prompts in US English representing both typical use and use by bad actors. Testing was based on [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] demonstration data and a large labeled product catalog available as open source.

This feature is built in accordance with Microsoft's Responsible AI Standard. [Learn more about responsible AI from Microsoft](https://aka.ms/RAI).

## What are the limitations of suggest number series? How can users minimize the effect of the limitations when using the system?

The feature works best when you use terminology known to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Using alternative terminology might produce results that aren't useful.

* Available geographies

   This Copilot feature is available in all supported [Business Central countries/regions](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/compliance/apptest-countries-and-translations). However, for customer environments located in countries/regions where Azure OpenAI Service isn't deployed, administrators must first consent to allowing their data to move across boundaries for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to connect to Azure OpenAI service. Learn more at [Copilot data movement across geographies](ai-copilot-data-movement.md).

* Available languages

   [!INCLUDE [copilot-language-support-en-only](includes/copilot-language-support-en-only.md)]

## What operational factors and settings allow for effective and responsible use of the feature?

AI-powered suggestions might be incorrect or incomplete. You should always review the accuracy of Copilot's suggestions before you choose whether to keep them. Copilot’s suggestions aren't saved to the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] database until you choose the **Keep it** button and exit the Copilot window. You can edit and correct any suggestions before you choose to keep it, or after they're inserted as No. Series.

### What is expected of administrators and end-users when using suggest number series?

Each individual user chooses whether or not to use suggest number series. Even if an administrator enables the feature and it's available, you can choose to use it always, sometimes, or never.  

Administrators make the overall decision on whether to use Copilot capabilities in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. If administrators enable Copilot, they should be sure to grant access to the appropriate users.

> [!NOTE]
> * We don't support this feature in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises or private cloud.
> * Partner's can't extend this feature. That means partner developers can't modify, replace, or extend it.

## Is Copilot the only means to create number series?  

No, the use of Copilot is optional. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers non-AI-powered ways to create number series. Organizations can use both approaches at the same time. To learn more, go do [Create number series](ui-create-number-series.md).

## How do I give feedback about AI-generated content?  

Each time Copilot provides suggestions, you can provide feedback to Microsoft directly from the Copilot window, using the **Like** and **Dislike** buttons. Your feedback remains anonymous and we use this data to improve the quality of the service.

# Use Allocation Keys in General Journals
You can allocate an entry in a general journal to several different accounts when you post the journal. The allocation can be made by quantity, percentage, or amount.

## To set up allocation keys
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Recurring General Journal**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **Batch Name** field to open the **General Journal Batches** page.
3. You can either modify allocations on an existing batch in the list or create a new batch with allocations.
   * To create a new batch, choose the **New** action, and go to the next step.
   * To change the allocations of an existing journal, select the journal and go to step 7.    
4. In the **Name** field, enter a name for the batch, such as CLEANING. In the **Description** field, enter a description, such as Cleaning Expenses Journal.
5. When you are done, close the page. A new, empty recurring journal opens.
6. Fill in the fields on the line.
7. Choose the **Allocations** action.
8. Add a line for each allocation. You must fill in either the **Allocation %**, **Allocation Quantity**, or **Amount** field. You must also fill in the **Account No.** field and, if you are allocating the transaction among global dimensions, the global dimension fields.
9. If you enter a percentage on a line, the amount in the **Amount** field is calculated automatically. These amounts have the opposite sign from the total amount in the **Amount** field in the recurring journal.
10. After entering the allocations lines, choose **OK** to return to the **Recurring General Journal** page. The **Allocated Amt. (USD)** field is filled in and matches the **Amount** field.
11. Post the journal.

## To change an allocation key that has already been set up
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Recurring General Journal**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Recurring General Journal** page, select the journal with the allocation.
3. Choose the line with the allocation, and then choose **Allocations** action.
4. Change the relevant fields, and then choose the **OK** button.

# Exchanging Data Electronically
You can use the Data Exchange Framework to manage the exchange of business documents, bank files, currency exchange rates, and any other data files with your business partners.

In the standard version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the Data Exchange Framework is used in processes such as exchanging electronic documents, importing and exporting bank files, and updating exchange rates for currencies. For more information, see [About the Data Exchange Framework](across-about-the-data-exchange-framework.md).

As an administrator or Microsoft partner, you can use the framework in new integration features by specifying the data to exchange, and how to exchange it. For more information, see [Set Up Data Exchange Definitions](across-how-to-set-up-data-exchange-definitions.md).

# Design Details: Expected Cost Posting
Expected costs represent the estimation of, for example, a purchased item’s cost that you record before you receive the invoice for the item.  

 You can post expected cost to inventory and to the general ledger. When you post a quantity that is only received or shipped but not invoiced, then a value entry is created with the expected cost. This expected cost affects the inventory value, but is not posted to the general ledger unless you set up the system up to do so.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  Expected costs are only managed for item transactions. Expected costs are not for immaterial transaction types, such as capacity and item charges.  

 If only the quantity part of an inventory increase has been posted, then the inventory value in the general ledger does not change unless you have selected the **Expected Cost Posting to G/L** check box on the **Inventory Setup** page. In that case, the expected cost is posted to interim accounts at the time of receipt. After the receipt has been fully invoiced, the interim accounts are then balanced and the actual cost is posted to the inventory account.  

 To support reconciliation and traceability work, the invoiced value entry shows the expected cost amount that has been posted to balance the interim accounts.  

## Prerequisites for posting expected costs

To make it possible to post expected costs you need to do the following:
1. On the **Inventory Setup** page, select the **Automatic Cost Posting** check box and the **Expected Cost Posting to G/L** check box.
2. Set up which interim accounts to use during the expected cost posting process.  

  On the **Inventory Posting Setup** page, verify the **Inventory Account** and the **Inventory Account (Interim)** fields for the **Location Code and Invt. Posting Group Code** of the item you will be purchasing. To learn more about these accounts see [Design Details - Accounts in the General Ledger](design-details-accounts-in-the-general-ledger.md).
3. On the **General Posting Setup** page, verify the **Invt. Accrual Acc. (Interim)** field for the **Gen. Bus. Posting Group** and the **Gen. Prod. Posting Group** you will be using.
4. When you create a purchase order the default is that the **Vendor Invoice No.** field is required. You need to turn that off on the **Purchase & Payables Setup** page, by unselecting the **Ext. Doc. No. Mandatory** field.

## Example  

> [!NOTE]  
> The account numbers used in this example are there for reference only, and will be different in your system. Set them up as directed in the Prerequisites above.

You post a purchase order as received. The expected cost is LCY 95.00.  

 **Value Entries**

## Configure date filtering for the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-finance-app-name](includes/power-bi-finance-app-name.md)] semantic model

This section describes how to configure date filtering for the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-finance-app-name](includes/power-bi-finance-app-name.md)]. You can configure the app to load data based on the **Start Date** and **End Date**. This filter helps improve performance in your [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] environment and reduce [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] load times by only loading the data you intend to analyze.

> [!NOTE]
> Configuring date filtering for the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-finance-app-name](includes/power-bi-finance-app-name.md)] is optional, and is designed to help manage large datasets.

The **Start Date** and **End Date** filter can apply to the following tables:

- G/L Entries (related to the Income Statement)
- G/L Budget Entries
- Customer Ledger Entries
- Vendor Ledger Entries

### Set up date filtering

1. Search and open the **[Power BI Connector Setup](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com?page=36951)** page.
1. Expand the **Finance Report** section.
1. Fill in the **Start Date** and **End Date** fields under **Income Statement & G/L Budget Entry Filters**.

Repeat steps 2-3 for the date setup under **Customer Ledger Entry Filters** and **Vendor Ledger Entry Filters**.

The following fields are available on the **Finance Report** FastTab:

|No.| Data Area | Field Name | Description |
|---| ---       | ---        | ---         |
|1  | Income Statement and G/L Budgets   | Start Date      | Specifies the starting date to apply to a range of income statement G/L entries and G/L budget entries.   |
|2  | Income Statement and G/L Budgets   | End Date        | Specifies the end date to apply to a range of income statement G/L entries and G/L budget entries.        |
|3  | Customer Ledger Entries            | Start Date      | Specifies the starting date to apply to a range of customer ledger entries.                               |  
|4  | Customer Ledger Entries            | End Date        | Specifies the end date to apply to a range of customer ledger entries.                                    |
|5  | Vendor Ledger Entries            | Start Date      | Specifies the starting date to apply to a range of vendor ledger entries.                                 |
|6  | Vendor Ledger Entries            | End Date        | Specifies the end date to apply to a range of vendor ledger entries.                                      |

## Set up G/L account categories for your chart of accounts

G/L account categories are groups of general ledger accounts. The categories are required for using the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/powerbi-name.md)] Finance app.

For each posting account in your chart of accounts, you must specify an **Account Category** and **Account Subcategory**. You don't need to set up the totaling accounts.

To learn more about how to work with G/L account categories, go to [G/L account categories](./finance-general-ledger.md#account-categories).

## Map G/L account categories to corresponding categories used in the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/powerbi-name.md)] Finance semantic model

The [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/powerbi-name.md)] Finance app has default mappings for G/L account categories in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to corresponding values in the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/powerbi-name.md)] Finance semantic model. This mapping enables the finance KPIs and reports to show correct values.

The following sections show the default mappings. You can change the default values of the **Business Central Category** columns to your choice of G/L account categories by choosing the **Power BI Account Categories** action on the **Power BI Connector Setup** setup page or directly on the **Power BI Account Categories** page.

### Level 1 Categories

Level 1 categories are the top-level categories without indentation.

| Power BI Account Category                 | Business Central Category |
| ---                                       | ---                       |
| Assets (Level 1 Category)                 | Assets                    |
| Liabilities (Level 1 Category)            | Liabilities               |
| Equity (Level 1 Category)                 | Equity                    |
| Revenue (Level 1 Category)                | Income                    |
| Cost of Goods Sold (Level 1 Category)     | Cost of Goods Sold        |
| Expense (Level 1 Category)                | Expense                   |

### Level 2 Categories

Level 2 categories are the second-level categories with indentation.

| Power BI Account Category	| Business Central Category     |
|---                    |---                              |
| Current Assets (Level 2 Category) | Current Assets   |
| Current Liabilities (Level 2 Category)  | Current Liabilities   |
| Shareholder's Equity (Level 2 Category) | Common Stock          |
| Interest Expense (Level 2 Category)     | Interest Expense      |
| Tax Expense (Level 2 Category)          | Tax Expense            |

| Liquid Assets (Level 3 Category)          | Cash                      |

## Troubleshooting

If you experience issues with the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-finance-app-name](includes/power-bi-finance-app-name.md)], the information in the following sections might help you get unblocked.

### Getting the "Column Entry No. in Table G/L Entries contains a duplicate value" error?

When you refresh data from your [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] environment into the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-finance-app-name](includes/power-bi-finance-app-name.md)], a refresh error might happen with the following error message:

```
Something went wrong
There was an error when processing the data in the dataset.
Please try again later or contact support. If you contact support, please provide these details.

Data source error: Column '<oii>Entry No.</oii>' in Table '<oii>G/L Entries</oii>' contains a duplicate value
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you get this error, you're affected by a bug in the semantic model for the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-finance-app-name](includes/power-bi-finance-app-name.md)].

This error indicates that there are duplicate G/L entries in the Finance fact table in the semantic model. The error displays when we attempt to combine the three sub-queries (Balance Sheet G/L Entries, Income Statement G/L Entries, and Close Income Statement G/L Entries) into the single G/L Entries Fact table.

The current Balance Sheet G/L Entries query has a hard-coded filter transformation. This filter assumes that the source code for closing entries is CLSINCOME. This leads the model to allow closing entries to exist in both the Balance Sheet query and the Closing Entries query, resulting in duplicate entries.

### Getting the "Column ‘G/L Account No.’ in Table ‘G/L Account’ contains a duplicate value" error?

When you refresh data from your [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] environment into the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-finance-app-name](includes/power-bi-finance-app-name.md)], a refresh error might happen due to how your **Begin-Total** and **End-Total** accounts are configured in your **Chart of Accounts**.

If you receive this error, review the totaling accounts.

```
Something went wrong
There was an error when processing the data in the dataset.
Please try again later or contact support. If you contact support, please provide these details.

Data source error: Column 'G/L Account No.' in Table 'G/L Account' contains a duplicate value 'X' and this is not allowed for columns on the one side of a many-to-one relationship or for columns that are used as the primary key of a table.
```

**Why did this happen?**

This error can happen because the Finance Connector app relies on the totaling accounts for hierarchy and indentation purposes.

Your totaling for an **End-Total** account must exactly reference both the **Begin-Total** and **End-Total** accounts. You can only use one **Begin-Total** account in one **End-Total** account.

**Fix the totaling on your G/L Accounts**

The following example shows how to set up the totaling accounts.

1. A **Begin-Total** account of **1300 (Vehicles)** and the **End-Total** account of **1390 (Vehicles, Total)**.
2. The totaling defined for the **End-Total** is **1300..1390**. Any other combination for your totaling account (such as 1300..1340, 1310..1390, or 1310..1340, etc.) can cause the error.
3. One **Begin-Total** account can only be used in one **End-Total** account. If you use a **Begin-Total** account in two or more **End-Total** accounts, the [!INCLUDE [power-bi-finance-app-name](includes/power-bi-finance-app-name.md)] can't match it to an **End-Total** account.

# Close income statement accounts

When a fiscal year is over, you must close the periods that comprise it. To do this, you run the **Close Income Statement** batch job. This job transfers the year's result to an account in the balance sheet and closes the income statement accounts. You do this by creating lines in a journal, which you then can post.

## To run the Close Income Statement batch job

1. Close the fiscal year. The fiscal year must closed before the batch job can be run. For more information, see [Close Accounting Periods](year-close-account-periods.md).
2. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Close Income Statement**, and then choose the related link.
3. Choose the **OK** button to run the batch job.

## About the Close Income Statement batch job

The batch job processes all general accounts of the income statement type and creates entries that cancel out their respective balances. That is, each entry is the sum of all the general ledger entries on the account in the fiscal year. These new entries are placed in a journal in which you must specify a balancing account and retained earnings account in the balance sheet before you post. When you post the journal, an entry is posted to each income statement account so that its balance becomes zero and at the same time the year's result is transferred to the balance sheet.

You must post the journal yourself. The batch job doesn't post the entries automatically, except when an additional reporting currency is being used. When an additional reporting currency is being used, the batch job posts entries directly to the general ledger.

The date on the lines that the batch job inserts in the journal is always a closing date for the fiscal year. The closing date is a fictitious date between the last day of the old fiscal year and the first day of the new year. The advantage of posting on a closing date is that you maintain the correct balances for the ordinary dates of the fiscal year.

The **Close Income Statement** batch job can be used several times. You can post in a previous fiscal year, even after the income statement accounts have been closed, if you run the batch job again.

# Walkthrough: Planning supplies automatically

<!-- [!INCLUDE[complete_sample_data](includes/complete_sample_data.md)]   -->

Phrases like "run planning" and "run MRP" refer to the calculation of the master production schedule (MPS) and the material requirements plan (MRP) based on actual and forecasted demand.  

-   MPS is the calculation of a master production schedule based on actual demand and the demand forecast. The MPS calculation is used for end items that have a forecast or a sales order line. These items are called "MPS items" and are identified dynamically when the calculation starts.  
-   MRP is the calculation of material requirements based on actual demand for components and the demand forecast on the component level. MRP is calculated only for items that aren't MPS items. The overall purpose of MRP is to provide time-phased formal plans, by item, to supply the right item at the right time, in the right place, in the right quantity.  

 The planning algorithms used for both MPS and MRP are identical. The planning algorithms use netting, reuse of existing supply orders, and action messages. The planning system process examines what is needed or will be needed (demand) and what is available or expected (supply). When these quantities are netted against each other, action messages are displayed in the planning worksheet. Action messages are suggestions to create a new supply order, change a supply order (quantity or date), or cancel an existing supply order. Supply orders can be production orders, purchase orders, and transfer orders. For more information, see [Design Details: Supply Planning](design-details-supply-planning.md).  

 The planning result is calculated partly from the demand-supply sets in the database and partly by the setup of stockkeeping unit cards or item cards, production BOMs, and routings.  

## About this walkthrough  
 This walkthrough demonstrates how to use the supply planning system to automatically plan all the purchase and production orders required to produce 15 touring bicycles demanded on different sales orders. To provide a clear and realistic walkthrough, the number of planning lines is delimited by filtering out all other demand-supply sets in the CRONUS demonstration company except the sales demand at location EAST.  

 This walkthrough illustrates the following tasks:  

-   Creating the sales order and calculating a complete supply plan.  
-   Viewing planning parameters and order tracking entries behind the planning lines.  
-   Automatically creating the suggested supply orders.  
-   Creating new sales demand and replanning accordingly.  

## Roles  

-   Production Planner  
-   Purchasing Agent  

## Prerequisites  
 To complete this walkthrough, you need:  

-   The CRONUS International Ltd. demonstration company.  
-   To change various item setup values by following the steps in the "Preparing Sample Data" section, later in this walkthrough.  

## Story  
 The customer, Cannon Group PLC, orders five touring bikes for shipment on 02-05-2021 (February 5).  

 Eduardo, the production planner, performs the routine supply planning for the first week of February 2021. Eduardo filters on their own location, EAST, and enters a planning interval of the work date (01-23-2021) to 02-07-2021 before calculating an initial supply plan.  

 The only demand that week is for the Cannon Group sales order. Eduardo sees that none of the planning lines have warnings, and proceeds to create supply orders without changes for the suggested planning lines.  

 The next day, before any of the initial supply orders are started or posted, Eduardo is notified when another customer orders ten touring bikes for shipment on 02-12-2021. Eduardo recalculates to adjust the supply plan according to the change of demand. The recalculation gives you a net change plan that suggests changes to both time and quantity of some of the supply orders created in the first run.  

 During the various planning steps, Eduardo looks up the involved orders, and uses the Order Tracking feature to see which demand is covered by which supply.  

## Preparing sample data  
 Create stockkeeping units (SKUs) for the touring bike and a selection of its components, item numbers 1001 to 1300. (Some components are excluded to simplify the procedures.) Adjust the planning parameters of the selected components to provide a more transparent planning result.  

### To create stockkeeping units  

1.  Open the item card for item 1001, Touring Bicycle.  
2.  Choose the **Create Stockkeeping Unit** action.  
3.  On the **Create Stockkeeping Unit** page, leave all options and filters unchanged, and then choose the **OK** button.  
4.  Repeat steps 1 through 3 for all items in the number range between 1100 and 1300.  

### To change selected planning parameters  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Stockkeeping Units**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Open the EAST stockkeeping unit card for item 1100, Front Wheel.  
3.  On the **Planning** FastTab, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Reordering Policy|Safety Stock Quantity|Lot Accumulation Period|Rescheduling Period|  
    |-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|  
    |Lot-for-Lot|Blank|2W|2W|  

4.  Repeat steps 2 and 3 for all SKUs in the number range between 1100 and 1300.  

 This completes the preparation of sample data for the walkthrough.  

## Creating a regenerative supply plan  
 In reaction to a new sales order for five touring bikes, Ricardo begins the planning process by setting options, filters, and planning interval to exclude all other demand except that of the first week of February at location EAST. Ricardo begins by calculating a master production schedule (MPS), and then proceeds to calculate a complete supply plan for all lower-level demand (MRP).  

### To create the sales order  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Choose the **New** action.  
3.  On the **Sales Order** page, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Sell-to Customer Name|Shipment Date|Item No.|Location|Quantity|  
    |----------------------------|-------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|  
    |Cannon Group|02-05-2014|1001|EAST|5|  

4.  Accept the availability warning and choose the **Yes** button to record the new demand quantity.  

### To create a regenerative plan to fulfill demand at location EAST  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Planning Worksheet**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Choose the **Calculate Regenerative Plan** action.  
3.  On the **Calculate Plan - Plan. Wksh.** page, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Calculate Plan|Starting Date|Ending Date|Show results:|Limit totals to|  
    |--------------------|-------------------|-----------------|-------------------|---------------------|  
    |**MPS** = Yes<br /><br /> **MRP** = No|01-23-2021<br /><br /> (work date)|02-07-2021|1001..1300|Location Filter = EAST|  

4.  Choose the **OK** button to start the planning run.  

     One planning line is created suggesting that a planned production order is issued to produce the ten touring bikes, item 1001, by 02-05-2021, the shipment date of the sales order.  

     Next, verify that this planning line relates to the Cannon Group sales order by using the **Order Tracking** function, which dynamically links demand with its planned supply.  

5.  Select the new planning line, and then choose the **Order Tracking** action.  
6.  On the **Order Tracking** page, choose the **Show** action.  

     The sales order for five touring bikes shipping to customer number 10000 on 02-05-2021 is shown.  

7.  Close the **Sales Order** and **Order Tracking** pages.  

### To calculate MRP to include underlying component needs  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Planning Worksheet**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Choose the **Calculate Regenerative Plan** action.  
3.  On the **Calculate Plan - Plan. Wksh.** page, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Calculate|Starting Date|Ending Date|Show results:|Limit totals to:|  
    |---------------|-------------------|-----------------|-------------------|----------------------|  
    |**MPS** = Yes<br /><br /> **MRP** = Yes|01-23-2021|02-07-2021|1001..1300|Location Filter = EAST|  

4.  Choose the **OK** button to start the planning run.  

     A total of 14 planning lines are created suggesting supply orders for all the demand that the touring bike sales order at EAST location represents.  

## Analyze the planning result  
 To analyze the suggested quantities, Eduardo drills down on selected planning lines to view order tracking entries and planning parameters.  

 On the **Planning Worksheet** page, note in the **Due Date** column that the suggested supply orders are scheduled backward from the due date of the sales order, 02-05-2021. The timeline begins on the top planning line with the production order to produce the finished touring bikes. The timeline ends on the bottom planning line with the purchase order for one of the lowest-level items, 1255, Socket Back, due on 01-30-2021. Like the planning line for item 1251, Axle Back Wheel, this line represents a purchase order for components that are due on the starting date of its produced parent, subassembly item 1250, which in turn is due on 02-03-2014. Throughout the worksheet, you can see that all underlying items are due on the starting date of their parents.  

 The planning line for item 1300, Chain Assy, suggests ten pieces. This deviates from the five pieces that we expect to need to fulfill the sales order. Proceed to view the order tracking entries.  

### To view order tracking entries for item 1300  

1.  Select the planning line for item 1300, and then choose the **Order Tracking** action.  

     The two lines on the **Order Tracking** page show that five pieces are tracked from the planning line (first order tracking line) to sales order 1001 (second order tracking line). The last five pieces suggested on the planning line aren't related to any document lines, but to a planning parameter, forecast entry, or blanket order entry. Such untracked quantities are summed in the **Untracked Quantity** field in the header of the **Order Tracking** page.  

2.  Choose the **Untracked Quantity** field.  

     The **Untracked Planning Elements** page shows that item 1300 uses a planning parameter, Minimum Order Quantity, of 10.00. Therefore, the planning line is for ten pieces in total, of which only five can be tracked to a demand. The last five pieces are an untracked quantity to satisfy the planning parameter. Proceed to review the planning parameter.  

### To check the planning parameter  

1.  On the **Untracked Planning Elements** page, select the order tracking line for item 1300.  
2.  Choose the **Item No.** field, and then choose the **Advanced** action.  
3.  On the **Item List** page, choose the **Stockkeeping Units** action.  
4.  On the **Stockkeeping Unit List** page, open the EAST stockkeeping unit card.  
5.  On the **Planning** FastTab, note that the **Minimum Order Quantity** field contains 10.  
6.  Close all pages except the **Planning Worksheet** page.  

### To view more order tracking entries  

1.  Select the planning line for item 1110, Rim, and then choose the **Order Tracking** action.  

     The **Order Tracking** page shows that five rims are needed for each production order for front and back wheels respectively.  

     The same order tracking applies to the planning lines for items 1120, 1160, and 1170. For item 1120, the **Quantity per** field on the production BOM of each wheel item is 50 PCS, which results in a total need of 100.  

     The planning line for item 1150 for six pieces looks irregular. Proceed to analyze.  

2.  Select the planning line for item 1150, and then, on then choose the **Order Tracking** action.  

     The **Order Tracking** page shows that five units are tracked to the front wheel, and one unit is untracked. Proceed to view the untracked quantity.  

3.  Choose the **Untracked Quantity** field.  

     The **Untracked Planning Elements** page shows that item 1150 uses a planning parameter, Order Multiple, of 2.00, which specifies that when the item is ordered, it must be in a quantity that is divisible by 2. The closest number to 5 that is divisible by 2 is 6.  

     The same order tracking applies to the planning lines for the Front Hub components, items 1151 and 1155, except that each need is multiplied by the scrap percentage that is defined for item 1150 in the **Scrap Percentage** field on the item card.  

 This completes the analysis of the initial supply plan. Notice that the **Accept Action Message** check box is selected in all planning lines indicating that they're ready to be converted to supply orders.  

## Carrying out action messages  
 Next, Eduardo converts the suggested planning lines to supply orders by using the **Carry Out Action Msg.** function.  

### To automatically create the suggested supply orders  

1.  Select the **Accept Action Message** check box on all planning lines with a warning of type Exception.  
2.  Choose the **Carry Out Action Message** action.  
3.  On the **Carry Out Action Msg.-Plan.** page, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Production Order|Purchase Order|Transfer Order|  
    |----------------------|--------------------|--------------------|  
    |Firm Planned|Make Purch. Orders|Make Trans. Orders|  

4.  Choose the **OK** button to automatically create all the suggested supply orders.  
5.  Close the empty **Planning Worksheet** page.  

 This completes the initial calculation, analysis, and creation of a supply plan for demand at location EAST in the first week of February. In the following section, another customer orders ten touring bikes, and Eduardo must replan.  

## Creating a net change plan  
 The next day, before any supply orders are started or posted, a new sales order arrives from Libros S.A. for ten touring bikes to be shipped on 02-12-2021. Eduardo is notified of the new demand, and proceeds to replan in order to adjust the current supply plan. Eduardo uses the Net Change Plan function to calculate only the changes that are made to demand or supply since the last planning run. In addition, Eduardo expands the planning period to 02-14-2021 to include the new sales demand on 02-12-2014.  

 The planning system calculates the best way to cover the demand for these two identical products, such as to consolidate some purchase and production orders, reschedule other orders, and create new orders where it's required.  

### To create the new sales, demand and replan accordingly  

1.  Choose the **New** action.  
2.  On the **Sales Order** page, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Sell-to Customer Name|Shipment Date|Item No.|Location|Quantity|  
    |----------------------------|-------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|  
    |Libros S.A.|02-12-2021|1001|EAST|10|  

3.  Accept the availability warning and choose the **Yes** button to record the demand quantity.  
4.  Proceed to replan to adjust the current supply plan.  
5.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Planning Worksheet**, and then choose the related link.  
6.  Choose the **Calculate Net Change Plan** action.  
7.  On the **Calculate Plan - Plan. Wksh.** page, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Calculate Plan|Starting Date|Ending Date|Show results:|Limit totals to|  
    |--------------------|-------------------|-----------------|-------------------|---------------------|  
    |**MPS** = Yes<br /><br /> **MRP** = Yes|01-23-2021|02-14-2021|1001..1300|Location Filter = EAST|  

8.  Choose the **OK** button to start the planning run.  

 A total of 14 planning lines are created. Notice in the first planning line that the **Action Message** field contains **New**, the **Quantity** field 10, and the **Due Date** field 02-12-21. This new line for the top parent item, 1001, Touring Bike, is created because the item uses a reordering policy of **Order**, which means that it must be supplied in a one-to-one relationship to its demand, the sales order of ten pieces.  

 The next two planning lines are the production orders for touring bike wheels. Each existing order of five, in the **Original Quantity** field, is increased to 15, in the **Quantity** field. Both production orders have unchanged due dates, as indicated in the **Action Message** field that contains **Change Qty.** This is also the case for the planning line for item 1300, except its order multiple of 10.00 rounds the tracked demand for 15 pieces up to the 20.  

 All other planning lines have an action message of **Resched. & Chg. Qty.**. This means that apart from being increased in quantity, the due dates are moved in relation to the supply plan to include the extra quantity in the available production time (capacity). Purchased components are rescheduled and increased to supply the production orders. Proceed to analyze the new plan.  

## Analyze the changed planning result  
 Because all lot-for-lot-planned items within the filter, 1100 to 1300, have a rescheduling period of two weeks, their existing supply orders are all modified to meet the new demand, which occurs within the specified two weeks.  

 Several planning lines are multiplied by three to provide 15 touring bikes instead of 5, and the due dates are moved back in time to provide the increased quantities by the shipment date of the sales order to the Cannon Group. For these planning lines, all quantities can be tracked. The remaining planning lines are increased by ten pieces in addition to moving their due dates. For these planning lines, a part of the quantities are untracked due to different planning parameters. Proceed to view some of these order tracking entries.  

### To view order tracking entries for item 1250  

1.  Select the planning line for item 1250, and then choose the **Order Tracking** action.  

     The seven lines on the **Order Tracking** page show that five and ten pieces are tracked through the back wheel to the touring bikes on the two sales orders respectively.  

     The last five pieces are untracked. Proceed to analyze.  

2.  Choose the **Untracked Quantity** field.  

     The **Untracked Planning Elements** page shows that item 1250 uses a planning parameter, Order Multiple, of 10.00. Therefore, the planning line is for 20 pieces in total to round the actual need up to the nearest number divisible by 10. The last five pieces are an untracked quantity to satisfy the planning parameter.  

3.  Close all pages except the **Planning Worksheet** page.  

### To view an existing order  

1.  In the planning line for item 1250, choose the **Ref. Order No.** field.  
2.  On the **Firm Planned Prod. Order** page for the Back Hub. The existing order for ten pieces, which you created in the first planning run, opens.  
3.  Close the firm planned production order.  

 This completes the walkthrough of how the planning system is used to automatically detect demand, calculate the appropriate supply orders according to demand and planning parameters, and then automatically create different types of supply orders with the appropriate dates and quantities.

# Sustainability value chain in transfers

To use the sustainability value chain with transfer orders, you must enable the **Enable Value Chain Tracking** field on the **Sustainability Setup** page.  

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sustainability Setup**, and then select the related link.
2. Check whether the basic setup already exists. If it doesn't, follow [these instructions](finance-sustainability-setup.md) to set it up.  
3. On the **Procurement** FastTab, select the **Enable Value Chain tracking** field.
4. Close the page.

## Work with transfer orders  

To learn how to work with transfer orders, go to [To transfer items with a transfer order](inventory-how-transfer-between-locations.md#to-transfer-items-with-a-transfer-order).  

To use transfer orders in the sustainability value chain process, you must add the carbon equivalent (CO2e) emission that you produce in the transfer process. For example, if you transfer goods by truck. You can add it in the **Total CO2e** field for each line on a transfer order. The value is the total emissions for the item quantities on the lines.

After you post a transfer order, you can find entries related to the transfer on the **Posted Transfer Shipment** page. To find the entries, follow these steps:  

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Posted transfer shipments**, and then select the related link.
2. Open the **Posted Transfer Shipment** you want to check, and then choose the **Find entries** action.
3. On the **Find entries** page, choose **Sustainability Value Entry** to review the transactions related to this document.
4. Close the page.

> [!NOTE]
> Regardless of whether you select the **Direct Transfer** field on the **Transfer Order** page, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates sustainability value entries only for transactions related to the posted transfer shipment. The transactions increase the **CO2e per Unit** value for transferred items using the average method.

# Organize general ledger (G/L) data using account categories

The **G/L Account Categories** page lets you create simple financial reports based on your chart of accounts.  

By providing categories, subcategories, and account mapping to your chart of accounts, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes basic financial reporting out of the box. If you're just getting started with financial reporting, the standard reports are excellent options until you become more experienced.

## Use G/L account categories

You create the first layer of a financial report by selecting an account category for each general ledger account. There are six categories:

* Assets
* Liabilities
* Equity
* Income
* Cost of Goods
* Expense

You specify categories on the **G/L Account Card** or **G/L Account Categories** pages. The purpose is to identify the major sections of primary financial reports, such as the Balance Sheet and Income Statement reports.  

:::image type="content" source="media/account categories financial reporting.png" alt-text="Shows the G/L account categories page.":::

## Use account subcategories

You can also create subcategories for each account. Subcategories help add more details to the mapping for accounts in each category. You also specify subcategories on the **G/L Account Card** or **G/L Account Categories** pages. The purpose is to identify the subsections of primary financial reports, such as the Balance Sheet and Income Statement reports. Subcategories are more flexible than categories because you can define them. 

:::image type="content" source="media/account subcategories.png" alt-text="Shows account subcategories."::: 

## Map general ledger accounts

The most important feature of the financial reports that [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides is the mapping between G/L accounts and account categories on the **G/L Account Categories** page. All accounts in the chart of accounts should be listed in a selected category and subcategory, so when you generate financial reports you include all mapped accounts. To learn more about mapping categories, go to the examples in [Walkthrough: Create custom financial reports](bi-examples-custom-financial-reports.md).  

:::image type="content" source="media/account mapping.png" alt-text="Shows accounts mapped to G/L account categories.":::

> [!NOTE]
> In 2024 release wave 1, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides the mapping only in the United States. If you're using another country version, you must create the mapping yourself. The mapping will become available in more country versions in future releases.

## Generate financial reports

After you set up categories and subcategories have and map all accounts on the chart of accounts, choose **Generate Financial Reports**. This action updates financial reports with the M- prefix with the mapping provided for your chart of accounts.  

To control which reports update when you generate financial reports, update the fields in the **Reporting** section of the **General Ledger Setup** page.  

You can remap and update these reports at any time. If you choose to regenerate them, you can choose to keep the original reports and create copies with the new mapping.

## Audit changes to account categories

You can use the Change Log feature to capture changes users make to your G/L account categories. [!INCLUDE [include-audit-what-who-when](includes/include-audit-what-who-when.md)] 

The following table lists the table for G/L account categories and its ID.

| Table | Table ID |
| ----- | -------- |
| G/L Account Category | 570 |

# Business Central for Multi-Site and International Organizations
Organizations that have multiple sites often use a hub-and-spoke business model where a parent company, or headquarters, manages the overall operations of the business while each site functions as a single, standalone entity. Sites are often geographically distributed and have different needs for sharing information with the headquarter company. Additionally, sites typically don't need the same level of complexity, and often lack the resources to maintain a large system.

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] gives small and mid-sized businesses a business management solution that's easy-to-use and maintain at a low cost of ownership.

This article introduces some of the ways in which [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports a hub-and-spoke business model.

## Integrating the Headquarter Company and the Sites

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can integrate with the headquarter company's accounting system while meeting the varying needs of different sites, regardless of size, location, or type of business.

The following diagram is an example of different sites integrated with a headquarter company.

![Diagram Description automatically generated.](media/multisite-headquarter-sites.png)

## Meet the Needs of Domestic and International Sites

Business needs at sites often differ based on industry, business methods, or their relationship to the headquarter company. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can be easily adapted and extended for various types of businesses and locales. Microsoft AppSource offers a wealth of apps from Microsoft and our partners, and partners can quickly deploy [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with minimal disruption to daily operations.

For multi-national organizations, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports local legal requirements and business practices.

* For online versions, there are more than [40 localized country/region versions](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/compliance/apptest-countries-and-translations?toc=/dynamics365/business-central/toc.json) that you can install as extensions from Microsoft AppSource.  
* For on-premises versions, [country/region versions](/azure/architecture/solution-ideas/articles/business-central) are available either as Microsoft-localized versions or partner-led add-on localizations.

A network of more than 4,000 Microsoft partners world-wide provides local expertise.

## Respond Quickly to New Business Conditions

The headquarter company must be able to react quickly to business changes at each site. Combined with Power Automate, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can serve as an early warning mechanism.

# Selling Inventory Items in Assemble-to-Order Flows

If the **Assembly Policy** field on the item card of an assembly item contains **Assemble-to-Order**, the sales order process assumes that the item isn't in inventory and must be assembled for sales orders. When you add the item to a line on a sales order, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates an assembly order that's linked to the sales order. To learn more about how to sell assemble-to-order items, go to [Sell Items Assembled to Order](assembly-how-to-sell-items-assembled-to-order.md). However, if some of the sales order quantity is already available in inventory, you can decrease the assembly order quantity by changing the **Qty. to Assemble to Order** field on the sales order line.  

It's relatively rare for businesses to sell inventory items as assemble-to-order items. Assemble-to-order items typically aren't standard. They're customized to meet specific customer requirements. However, you might have quantities of assemble-to-order items in inventory due to returns or order cancellations. Those quantities should be picked and sold before new ones are assembled.  

> [!NOTE]  
> To check whether whether assemble-to-order items are already available for assembly orders, use the **Sales Line Details** FactBox on the sales order.  

You can do similar things when you're selling assembly items from inventory and some or all of the quantity isn't available. You can supply the missing quantity through an assembly order. To learn more about selling inventory and assembly items, go to [Sell Assemble-to-Order Items and Inventory Items Together](assembly-how-to-sell-assemble-to-order-items-and-inventory-items-together.md).  

> [!NOTE]  
> There are rules that apply to the **Qty. to Ship** field on sales order lines that contain a combination of assemble-to-order quantities and inventory quantities. To learn more about the rules, go to [Combination scenarios](assembly-assemble-to-order-or-assemble-to-stock.md#combination-scenarios).  

In this procedure, you replace assemble-to-order quantities with inventory quantities on a sales order line. The following steps provide an overview:

1. Determine availability.
2. Reducing that quantity from the linked assembly order.
3. Reserve the inventory quantity to make sure that it's picked and shipped for the order.  

## To sell inventory items in assemble-to-order flows

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Create a sales order. To learn about creating sales orders, go to [Sell Products](sales-how-sell-products.md).  
3. On a sales order line that contains an assemble-to-order item, in the **Quantity** field, enter the quantity.  
4. In the **Sales Line Details** FactBox, determine whether some of all of the quantity is available.  
5. In the **Qty. to Assemble to Order** field, deduct the available quantity so that only the unavailable quantity is assembled to the order. The **Reserved Quantity** field is decreased accordingly to reflect that the order-to-order link, or reservation, only applies to the quantity to be assembled.  
6. On the **Lines** FastTab, choose **Functions**, and then choose the **Reserve** action.  
7. On the **Reservation** page, select the item ledger entry line or lines that contain the available quantities, choose the **Reserve from Current Line** action, and then choose the **OK** button.  

    On the **Sales Order** page, the **Reserved Quantity** field now shows that the full quantity for the order line is reserved. The **Qty. to Assemble to Order** field still reflects the quantity to assemble.  

8. Release the sales order to make the items available for picking and for assembly of the unavailable items. To learn more about assembling items, go to [Assemble Items](assembly-how-to-assemble-items.md).  

> [!CAUTION]  
> The **Bin Code** field on the sales order might contain the value from the **Assemble-to-Order Shpt. Bin Code** or **From-Assembly Bin Code** fields on the location card. If it does, the **Bin Code** field on the sales order line might be incorrect for this combination of assemble-to-order and assemble-to-stock quantities. It's a good idea to double-check that the bin in the **Bin Code** field works for all quantities. Alternatively, enter the two different quantities on separate sales order lines.

# Terminology in cost accounting

This article defines the key terms that are used in cost accounting.  

## Key terms

 The following table shows definitions of the key terms in cost accounting.  

|**Term**|**Definition**|  
|--------------|--------------------|  
|Allocation key|The allocation key is the basis that is used to allocate costs. It's typically a quantity, such as square meters occupied, number of employees, or work hours used. For example, two departments, with 20 and 10 employees respectively, share canteen costs. The costs are distributed between the departments by using an allocation key that represents the number of employees. Two thirds of the costs are allocated to the first department, and one third of the costs are allocated to the second department.|  
|Allocation source|The allocation source establishes which costs are allocated. Allocations are defined in allocation source and allocation target tables. Each allocation consists of an allocation source and one or more allocation targets. For example, all costs for the heating cost type, which is an allocation source, can be allocated to the workshop, production, and sales cost centers, which are three allocation targets.|  
|Allocation target|The allocation targets determine where the costs are allocated. Allocations are defined in allocation source and allocation target tables. Each allocation consists of an allocation source and one or more allocation targets. For example, all costs for the heating cost type, which is an allocation source, can be allocated to the workshop, production, and sales cost centers, which are three allocation targets.|  
|Cost accounting|In cost accounting, actual costs of operations, processes, departments, or products are recorded. These costs are allocated to cost centers and cost objects by using different cost allocation methods. Managers use statistics and reports, such as cost distribution sheet and profit and loss analysis to make decisions and reduce costs. Cost accounting retrieves data from the general ledger, but works independently. Therefore transactions posted in cost accounting don't affect the data in the general ledger.|  
|Cost type|The chart of cost types has the same function as the chart of accounts in the general ledger. They're often structured similarly. Therefore it's possible to transfer the general ledger chart of accounts to the chart of cost types and then modify it. The chart of cost types can also be created from scratch.|  
|Cost center|Cost centers are most often departments and profit centers that are largely responsible for company’s costs and income. Cost centers can be synchronized with dimensions in the general ledger. It's also possible to add new cost centers and define their own sorting with subtotals.|  
|Cost object|Cost objects are products, product groups or services of a company, the finished goods of a company, that in the end carries the costs. Cost objects can be synchronized with dimensions in the general ledger. It's also possible to add new cost objects and define their own sorting with subtotals.|  
|Cost allocation|Cost allocation is a process of allocating costs to cost centers or cost objects. For example, the wage of the truck driver of the sales department is allocated to the sales department cost center. It isn't necessary to allocate the wage cost to other cost centers. Another example is that the cost of an expensive computer system is allocated to the products of the company that use the system.|  
|Dynamic allocation|Dynamic allocations are dependent on changeable allocation bases, for example, the number of department employees, or the sales revenue of the project within a certain period of time. There are nine predefined dynamic allocation bases that users can define by using five filters.|  
|Direct cost|Direct costs are the costs that can be directly allocated to a cost object, for example, material purchase for a specific product.|  
|Fixed cost|Fixed costs are the costs that aren't dependent on the level of goods or services produced by the company. They tend to be time-related, such as salary or rent being paid per month. They are in contrast to variable costs, which are volume-related, and are paid per quantity produced.|  
|Indirect cost|Indirect costs aren't directly accountable to a cost object, such as a particular function or product. Indirect costs may be either fixed or variable. Indirect costs can be tax, administration, personnel, and security costs and are also known as overhead costs.|  
|Level|Level is used to define allocation order. Level is defined as a number between 1 and 99. The allocation posting follows the order of the levels. For example, level ensures that first administration is allocated to workshop before workshop is allocated to vehicle and production.|  
|Static allocation|Static allocations are based on a fixed set of values, for example, the square meters used, or an established allocation ratio, such as 5:2:4.|  
|Operational cost|Operational costs are the recurring expenses, which are related to the operation of a business, a device, and a component.|  
|Overhead cost|Overhead costs refer to ongoing expenses of operating a business. They're all costs on the income statement except for direct labor, direct materials, and direct expenses. Overhead costs include accounting fees, advertising, depreciation, insurance, interest, legal fees, rent, repairs, supplies, taxes, telephone bills, travel, and utilities costs.|  
|Step variable cost|Step variable costs are costs that change dramatically at certain points because they involve large purchases that can't be spread out over time. For example, one employee can produce 100 tables in a month. The employee’s wage is constant over a production range of 1 to 100 tables. If the company wants to produce 110 tables, the company needs two employees. So the cost will double.|  
|Share|The portion or part that is allocated among cost centers or cost objects.|  
|Static weighting|Costs are allocated according to allocation keys, which can be modified by using a multiplier. <br />For example, two departments, with 20 and 10 employees respectively, share canteen costs. The costs are distributed between the departments by using an allocation key that represents the number of employees that eat in the canteen. In the first department, only five employees eat in the canteen, so this department has a multiplier of 0.25. The basis for allocation is 20 x 0.25 = 5. The total number of employees that eat in the canteen is 15. One third of the costs are allocated to the first department and two thirds of the costs are allocated to the second department.|  
|Variable cost|Variable costs are expenses that change in proportion to the activity of a business. Variable costs are the sum of marginal costs over all units produced. Fixed costs and variable costs make up the two components of total costs.|  
|Variant|A variant is used as an optional user-defined label for allocations. The purpose of the label is to filter groups of allocation.|

# Work with Service Contracts and Service Contract Quotes
You can create a service contract either manually or from a service contract quote. You can use a service contract quote as a forerunner of a service contract, in which your company makes an offer to the customer and obtains customer approval before you can convert it to a service contract. The procedures for creating either a service contract or service contract quote are similar.  

## To create a service contract or service contract quote  
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Contracts** or **Service Contract Quotes**,and then choose the related link.  
2. Create a new service contract or service contract quote.  
3. Fill in the **No.** field. A dialog box opens, asking whether you want to fill it with the common data from a contract template. If you want to create such a service contract or service contract quote, choose the **Yes** button. The **Service Contract Template List** page opens.  
4. Select the appropriate template, and then choose **OK** to use it to create the service contract or service contract quote.  
5. In the **Customer No.** field, choose the customer.  
6. If you do not want an annual amount difference to be distributed automatically, choose the **Allow Unbalanced Amounts** check box. The values in the **Annual Amount** and **Calcd. Annual Amount** fields are not automatically equalized. If you want application to do automatically distribute any annual amount difference that might occur from a change in the service contract, leave the **Allow Unbalanced Amounts** check box clear.  
7. Add contract lines to the service contract or service contract quote.  
8. Fill in the rest of the fields as necessary.  

## To convert a service contract quote to service contract  
When a customer has accepted a service contract quote, you convert it to a service contract. At the same time, you can create a service invoice for the starting period of the contract if the starting date of the contract is before the beginning of the next invoice period.

After you complete the following steps, a service contract is created with the status **Signed**. If a service invoice is created for the starting period of the contract, the invoiced amount is calculated in the following way, depending on whether the contract is detailed or not.  

For detailed contracts, the invoiced amount is calculated as follows:  

* Invoiced amount = sum of the invoiced amount for each contract line.  
* Invoiced amount for each contract line = ((quote value ÷ 12) × number of months in the starting period) + ((quote value ÷ number of days in the year) × number of days left in the starting period).  
* If the contract line expires before the starting period ends, the expiration date becomes the ending date of the starting period for the line.  

For contracts that are not detailed, the invoiced amount is calculated as follows:  

* Invoiced amount = (annual amount ÷ number of days in the year) × number of days in the starting period.  
* If the contract expires before the starting period ends, the expiration date becomes the ending date of the starting period.    

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Contract Quotes**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the service contract quote you want to convert to a service contract.  
3. Choose the **Make Contract** action.  
4. If the starting date of the contract is before the beginning of the next invoice period, you are asked if you want to create an invoice for the starting period of the contract. Choose **Yes**.  

 The service invoice is posted to the service account of the contract, even if the contract is prepaid.

## To create contract service credit memos
You can use a contract service credit memo when a customer cancels a prepaid service contract or removes a service item from a prepaid contract. You can also use it to correct an erroneous service invoice.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Credit Memos**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Create a new service credit memo.  
3. Fill in the **No.** field.  
4. In the **Customer No.** field, enter the number of the customer in the service contract.  

     The **Invoicing** FastTab shows information copied from the **Customer** card. If you want to post the credit memo to a different customer than the one specified on the **General** FastTab, enter the number of that customer in the **Bill-to Customer No.** field.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  You can compare the credit memo to the original posted document on the **Posted Service Invoices** page. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Posted Service Invoices**, and then choose the related link.  

5. Fill in the **Posting Date** and **Document Date** fields.  
6. On the credit memo lines, enter information about the items that have been returned or removed, or the allowance that will be sent. You can also use the **Get Prepaid Contract Entries** batch job.  

 To automatically create a credit memo when contract lines are removed from a service contract, on the **Service Contract** page, on the **Invoice Details** FastTab, select the **Automatic Credit Memos** check box.  

 To manually create a credit memo when contract lines are removed from a service contract, on the **Service Contract** page, choose the **Credit Memo** action.  

## Updating and evaluating contracts
Sometimes you have to change the terms of a contract after it has been created. In most cases, you open the relevant contract on the **Service Contract** page, and change it as necessary.  

You can change the status of the contract, initially set to **Locked**, add and remove contract lines, and cancel a contract. If you want to see how your business is doing as measured by gain and loss, you can do quick business analysis using the contract trendscape feature.

## To add a contract line to a service contract or contract quote  
When a customer purchases a new item and wants to include it in the existing service contract or contract quote, you can register the item as a service item and then add it as a new contract line to the contract or contract quote.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Contracts**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the relevant service contract or service contract quote that you want to add a new contract line for.  
3. Choose the **Open Contract** action to open the service contract or service contract quote for editing.  
4. On the **Invoice Details** FastTab, select the **Allow Unbalanced Amounts** field if you want to change the annual amount and distribute the annual amount difference manually on the contract lines. Otherwise, clear the check box in the **Allow Unbalanced Amounts** field. This will distribute the annual amount difference automatically on the contract lines after you change the annual amount.  
5. On the **Lines** FastTab, add a service item or item, or text description, on each contract line. Alternatively, you can add contract quote lines. Note that you can create multiple contracts per service item to have it included in different service contracts or contract quotes at the same time.  
6. Verify and correct the numbers in the **Line Discount %**, **Line Discount Amount**, **Response Time**, **Service Period**, and other fields as needed.

## To remove contract lines  
You may need to remove contract lines from the service contract as you remove corresponding service items from the service contract. Usually you remove a contract line that is expired or corresponds to the service item that has broken down.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Contracts**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the service contract from which you want to remove contract lines.  
3. Choose the **Open Contract** action to open the service contract for editing.  
4. Choose the contract line you want to remove. Fill in the **Contract Expiration Date** field with the date as of which you want to remove the line. For example, you could enter the date when the service item broke down.  
5. Choose the **Remove Contract Lines** action. The **Remove Lines from Contract** page opens.  
6. Fill in the default filters: **Contract No.**, **Service Item No.**, and **Contract Type**. If needed, you can apply more filters or change the existing ones.  
7. Fill in the fields on the **Options** FastTab, and then choose the **Delete Lines** action.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  If the contract is not detailed, you must update the value in the **Annual Amount** field on the **Invoice Details** FastTab on the **Service Contract** page, reflecting the loss of the service item from the contract.  
>   
>  If the contract is detailed and prepaid, and you have posted invoices for the contract, you can create a credit memo for the contract. Choose the **Create Credit Memo** action. This is unnecessary if the check box in the **Automatic Credit Memos** field on the **Invoice Details** FastTab is selected. In that case, a credit memo is created automatically when you remove a contract line.

## Service Line Cost and Value
On a service contract lines, the amounts in the **Line Cost** and **Line Value** are calculated as described in the following tables.

| Line Cost Options | Description|
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
|**Service item** | The cost is automatically retrieved from the **Default Contract Cost** field in the **Service Item** table and copied into the **Line Cost** field. The following formula is used to calculate the line cost:<br /><br /> Sales Unit Cost × Contract Value % ÷ 100|  
|**Item** | The cost is automatically retrieved from the **Unit Cost** field in the **Item** table and the **Contract Value %** field value in the **Service Mgt. Setup** table. The following formula is used to calculate the line cost:<br /><br /> Unit Cost × Contract Value % ÷ 100|  
|**Text description** | The value in the **Line Cost** field is set to zero.|  

| Line Value Options | Description|
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
|**Service item** | The price is automatically retrieved from the **Default Contract Value** field in the **Service Item** table and copied into the **Line Value** field.|  
|**Item** | Depending on the value in the **Contract Value Calc. Method** field in the **Service Mgt. Setup** table, the amount is retrieved from either the **Unit Price** or the **Unit Cost** field in the **Item** table. After that, this value is multiplied by the contents of the **Contract Value %** field in the **Service Mgt. Setup** table and divided by 100. This amount is copied into the **Line Value** field.<br /><br /> **NOTE:** If the **Contract Value Calc. Method** field is set to **None**, the contents of the **Line Value** field are not calculated.|  
|**Text description** | The contents of the **Line Value** field are set to zero.|  

## To add a contract discount to service contract quotes  
You can add contract discounts on services for contract quotes and service contracts. The discounts can be on spare parts in particular service item groups, on resource hours for resources in particular resource groups, and on particular service costs.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Contract Quotes**, and choose the related link.  
2. Choose the quote to add discounts for.  
3. Choose the **Service Discounts** action. The **Contract/Service Discounts** page opens.  
4. To create a new contract discount, choose the **New** action.  
5. Fill in the fields on the line as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)].  

> [!Tip]  
>  To add contract discounts directly to a service contract, perform similar steps from the **Service Contract** page.  

## To change the owner of a service contract  
You may need to change the owner of a service contract. If a service item in a service contract is registered in noncanceled multiple contracts owned by the same customer, then the owner of all service contracts that include this service item and of all other service items included in these contracts is updated automatically.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  In this case, only noncanceled contracts are considered. The status of the contract quotes is not taken into account.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  Service items and contracts can be related. Changing the owner of a service contract can affect these relationships.  
>   
>  For example, suppose service item No. 8 is included in contracts SC00003 and SC00015. Contract SC00015 also contains service item No. 15, which is also included in the contract SC00080. In this case, the owner for all three contracts and service items will be changed.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Contracts**, and then choose the related link. Open the relevant service contract whose owner you want to change.  
2. Choose the **Open Contract** action to open the contract for editing.  
3. Choose the **Change Customer** action. The **Change Customer in Contract** page opens.  
4. In the **Contract No.** and **Service Item No**. fields you can see the numbers of the contract and service item owned by the selected customer. If the customer owns more than one contract with more than one service item included, then the value of these fields will be **Multiple**. To see the list of related contracts or service items, select these field values.  
5. In the **New Customer No.** field, choose the new customer.  
6. In the **New Ship-to Code** field, choose the address.  
7. Choose the **OK** button to change the customer and ship-to code of the service contracts.  
8. Choose the **Lock Contract** action to lock the contract and to make sure that the changes will be part of the contracts.  

## To update a service contract price  
You can update the prices on service contracts by specifying a price update percentage.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Update Service Contract Prices**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the service contract.  
3. In the **Update to Date** field, enter a date. The batch job will update prices for contracts with next price update dates on or before this date.  
4. In the **Price Update %** field, enter the percentage that you want to update the prices by.  
5. In the **Action** field, select **Update Contract Prices**.  

## To post prepaid contract entries  
If you work with prepaid service contracts, you must regularly post prepaid contract entries, thereby transferring the prepaid payments from the prepaid contract accounts to the regular contract accounts.  

Before you can post prepaid contract entries, you must specify a number series in the **Prepaid Posting Document Nos.** field on the **Service Mgt. Setup** page.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Post Prepaid Contract Entries**, and then choose the related link.  
2. In the **Post until Date** field, enter a date. The batch job posts prepaid service ledger entries with posting dates up to this date.  
4. In the **Posting Date** field, enter the date you want to use as the posting date on the general journal line.  
5. In the **Action** field, choose **Post Prepaid Transactions**.  
6. Choose **OK** to post the entries.

## Changing the Service Contract Status
After the service contract is signed, the **Change Status** field value is automatically set to **Locked**. If you want to modify information in the service contract or service contract quote, first you have to change the status of the contract or contract quote from **Locked** to **Open**. Note that you cannot create service invoices for the service contract with the **Open** change status. After the contract or contract quote is modified, you have to change the status back to **Locked** to make it possible to create service invoices and ledger entries for the service contract, which includes the changes that you made to it.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  The **Change Status** field is not related to the **Release Status** field on the service order header, which governs the warehouse handling of service items.  

## To cancel a service contract  
You may need to cancel a service contract when the contract has expired or has been canceled by you or the customer.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  You cannot reopen a contract after it is canceled.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Contracts**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the relevant service contract to cancel.  
3. Choose the **Open Contract** action to open the service contract for editing.  
4. In the **Cancel Reason Code** field, choose the relevant reason code. To add more reason codes, choose the **Advanced** action.  

     If the check box in the **Use Contract Cancel Reason** field on the **Service Mgt. Setup** page is selected, you must specify a cancel reason code when canceling contracts.  

5. In the **Status** field, choose **Canceled**.  
6. If there are unposted invoices, credit memos, or opened prepaid entries for the contract, a confirmation message will appear. In the message box, choose **No** to return to the contract and post the documents, or **Yes** to continue the cancellation process.  

## Filing a service contract or contract quote  
You can file service contracts and contract quotes at any time to record and archive a copy of the contract or contract quote. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] files service contracts automatically when you convert contract quotes to service contracts or cancel service contracts. You can file a contract or quote yourself by choosing the **File Contract** action in the **Service Contracts** or **Service Contract Quotes** pages. If you want to view your archived contracts of quotes by searching for **Filed Contracts**.

:::image type="content" source="media/manufacturing/expected-capacity-need.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Expected Capacity Need Power BI Report" lightbox="media/manufacturing/expected-capacity-need.png":::

## Use the report

The report is meant for manufacturing managers and supervisors.

Manufacturing managers use the report to view the expected capacity needs of each work center. The data can help you allocate resources efficiently to meet production demands. This report shows the backlog of production orders and the work center availability to meet the demands. You can further break down production orders to see which orders are scheduled for each work center group and take actions to handle the expected capacity need.

Production supervisors use this report to understand the workload on your work center group, and take action to handle the expected capacity need. The report provides insights into the expected capacity need, capacity used, and capacity used variance. These insights help you optimize the use of resources.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The *Expected Capacity Need* report includes the following KPIs and measures: 

- [Expected Capacity Need (Hours)](manufacturing-powerbi-kpis.md#expected-capacity-need-hours)
- [Capacity Used (Hours)](manufacturing-powerbi-kpis.md#capacity-used-hours)
- [Capacity Used Variance (Hours)](manufacturing-powerbi-kpis.md#capacity-used-variance-hours)

# Send documents and emails

You can easily share information and documents, such as sales and purchase orders and invoices, by email directly from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], without having to open an email app.  

You can send almost all types of documents as PDF attachments. Alternatively, you can set up a report layout that includes information from the document in the email text, along with text that makes the email more friendly, for example, a standard greeting. For more information, see [Managing Report and Document Layouts](ui-manage-report-layouts.md).

When you send invoices, you can make it easier for customers to make payments through a payment service, such as PayPal, by automatically adding information and a link to the service in the email. For more information, see [Enable Customer Payments Through Payment Services](sales-how-enable-payment-service-extensions.md).

To enable emails from within [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], start the **Set Up Email** assisted setup guide. For more information, see [Set Up Email](admin-how-setup-email.md).

> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports only outbound email communications. You cannot also receive replies from within the app.

## To send documents by email

This procedure describes how attach a posted sales invoice to an email as a PDF file, and with document-specific email text. The steps are the same for other documents.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Posted Sales Invoices**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the invoice, choose the **Print/Send** action, and then choose **Send by Email**.
3. In the **Email** field, choose **Yes (Prompt for Settings)**. For more information, see [Set Up Document Sending Profiles](sales-how-setup-document-send-profiles.md).

    If the **Email** field on the **Send Document to** page is set to **Yes (Prompt for Settings)**, then the **Send Email** page opens pre-filled with the contact person in the **To:** field and the document attached as a PDF file. In the **Body** field, you can either enter text manually or you can have the field filled with a document-specific email body that you have set up.

4. Choose the **OK** button.
5. In the **To:** field, enter a valid email address. The default value is the customer email address.
6. In the **Subject** field, enter a descriptive subject text. The default value is the customer name and invoice number.
7. In the **Attachment** field, the generated invoice is attached by default as a PDF file.
8. In the **Body** field, enter a short message to the recipient.

    If a document-specific email text is set up on the **Report Selection - Sales** page, the **Body** field is filled in automatically. For more information, see [Set Up Reusable Email Texts and Layouts](admin-how-setup-email.md#set-up-reusable-email-texts-and-layouts).
9. Choose the **OK** button to send the email message.

> [!NOTE]  
> If you do not want to specify email settings each time you email a document, you can select the **Yes (Use Default Settings)** option in the **Email** field on the **Send Document to** page. In that case, the **Send Email** page will not open. See Step 4. For more information, see [Set Up Document Sending Profiles](sales-how-setup-document-send-profiles.md).  

## To compose and send an email

You can quickly compose emails for contacts, customers, vendors, salespeople/purchasers, and bank accounts directly from the pages for those entities. Just choose **Process**, and then **Send Email** to open the email editor. For bank accounts, the **Send Email** action is under **Actions**.

> [!TIP]
> If you often send email messages that are similar in nature, or want to send a bulk communication, for example, to advertise a sales campaign, using Word templates with email can speed up the process. You can create a template for an entities such as customers, vendors, and contacts, that will generate the content of an email message for you, and even personalize the content for the recipient based on data in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For more information, see [Use Word Templates for Bulk Communication](ui-mail-merge.md).  

### Attach a document to an email

There are several ways to attach documents to emails.

If you're assigned to an email scenario related to the entity you're sending the email to, or the document you're sending, an attachment might be automatically added to your message. That's because a default attachment has been assigned to the email scenario. You can delete the attachment if you don't want to send it with your message. For more information, see [Assign Email Scenarios to Email Accounts](admin-how-setup-email.md#assign-email-scenarios-to-email-accounts). 

To attach a file yourself, in the email editor, use the following actions:

* Choose **Add file** to select a file.
* Choose **Add files from default selection** to manually add a file that's associated with the email scenario.
* Choose **Add file from source document** to choose a file that's attached to the document you're working with. The files are either attached to the document itself, or one or more of its lines.

## Documents marked as printed when they are sent

Some documents in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] have a field that specifies how many times the document has been printed. The number in that field <!--"that field?" need a name...--> is also updated if you send the document by email because a PDF file is generated for it. The number is updated even if you don't send the email. <!--guessing this is because emails are technically reports, so the counter bumps up whenever someone creates an email. Need to verify.-->

## Sent emails and your email outbox

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] stores the emails that you send on the **Sent Items** page. That's to let you resend emails, or forward them to someone else. If you can't find an email in your sent items, look for it on the **Email Outbox** page. 

> [!NOTE]
> Depending on the extension that your company uses for email, administrators can see a list of messages that everyone has sent, but not the content of the messages

The **Email Outbox** is where you'll find the emails that you saved as drafts, and emails that failed to send, for example, if the email address was invalid. For messages that failed to send, you can choose **Show Error** or **Investigate Error** to troubleshoot the problem.

# Design Details: Posting Date on Adjustment Value Entry

This article provides guidance for users of the Inventory Costing functionality in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], and in particular for how the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job identifies and assigns a posting date to the value entries that the batch job is about to create.

## How posting dates are assigned

The **Adjust Cost – Item Entries** batch job assigns a posting date to the value entry it is about to create in the following steps:  

1. Initially the Posting Date of the entry to be created is the same date as the entry it adjusts.  

2. The Posting Date is validated against Inventory Periods and/or General Ledger Setup.  

3. Assignment of Posting Date; If the initial Posting Date is not within allowed posting date range the batch job will assign an allowed Posting Date from either General Ledger Setup or Inventory Period. If both Inventory Periods and allowed posting dates in General Ledger Setup are defined, the later date of the two will be assigned to the Adjustment Value Entry.  

Let’s review this process more in practice. Assume we have an Item Ledger Entry of Sale. The item was shipped on September 5, 2020 and it was invoiced the day after.  

#### Item Ledger Entry

|Entry No.  |Item No.  |Posting Date  |Entry Type  | Document No. |Location Code  |Quantity  |Cost Amount (Actual)  |Invoiced Quantity  |Remaining Quantity  |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|319     |A         |2020-09-05     |  Sale       |102033     |  Blue       | -1    |    -11     |-1     |    0     |

Below are the related value entries:

- **Entry No. 379** represents the shipment and carry the same Posting Date as the parent Item ledger Entry.  
- **Entry No. 381** represents the invoice.  
- **Entry No. 391** is an Adjustment of the invoicing Value Entry (Entry No. 381 above).  

|Entry No.  |Item No.  |Posting Date  |Item Ledger Entry Type  |Entry Type  |Document No.  |Item Ledger Entry No.  |Location Code  |Item Ledger Entry Quantity  |Invoiced Quantity  |Cost Amount (Actual)  |Cost Amount (Expected)  |Adjustment  |Applies-to Entry  |Source Code  |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|--------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|379     |  A       |    2020-09-05     |    Sale     | Direct Cost   | 102033        |319     | Blue        | -1       |0         |  0       |     -10   |No   |0    |Sales          |
|381     |  A       |    2020-09-06     |    Sale     | Direct Cost   | 103022        |319     | Blue        |  0       |-1        |-10       |    10     | No  |0      |       Sales   |
|391     |  A       |    2020-09-10     |    Sale     | Direct Cost   | 103022        |319     | Blue        |  0       |0         |-1        |    0     |Yes   |    181   | INVTADJMT   |

To assign the posting date for **Entry No. 391** the following steps were applied:

1. The **Adjustment Value Entry** to be created (**Entry No. 391**) is assigned same **Posting Date** as the entry it adjusts.

2. The **Adjust Cost – Item Entries** batch job determines if the initial Posting Date of the Adjustment Value Entry is within allowed posting date range based upon Inventory Periods and/or General Ledger Setup.  

Let’s review the above mentioned Sale by adding setup of allowed posting date ranges.  
  
#### Inventory Periods

|Ending Date  |Name  |Closed  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|2020-01-31     |January 2020      |  Yes    |
|2020-02-28     |February 2020     |  Yes    |
|2020-03-31     |March 2020        |  Yes    |
|2020-04-30     |April 2020        |  Yes    |
|2020-05-31     |May   2020        |  Yes    |
|2020-06-30     |June   2020       |  Yes    |
|2020-07-31     |July  2020        |  Yes    |
|2020-08-31     |August   2020     |  Yes    |
|2020-09-30     |September   2020  |         |
|2020-10-31     |October   2020    |         |
|2020-11-30     |November   2020   |         |
|2020-12-31     |December   2020   |         |

The first allowed posting date is the first day in the first open period, which is September 1, 2020.  

#### General Ledger Setup

|Field|Value  |
|---------|---------|
|Allow Posting From:  |  2020-09-10      |
|Allow Posting To:    |  2020-09-30      |
|Register Time:       |         |
|Local Address Format:|   Post Code      |  

The first allowed posting date is the date stated in field **Allow Posting From**: September 10, 2020. If both Inventory Periods and allowed posting dates in **General Ledger Setup** are defined, the later date of the two will define the allowed posting date range.  

**Assignment of an allowed posting date**  

The initial assigned Posting Date was September 6 as illustrated in step 1. However, in the second step the Adjust Cost – Item entries batch job identifies that earliest allowed Posting Date is September 10 and thereby assigns September 10 to the Adjustment Value Entry (**Entry No. 391**), below.  


|Entry No.  |Item No.  |Posting Date  |Item Ledger Entry Type  |Entry Type  |Document No.  |Item Ledger Entry No.  |Location Code  |Item Ledger Entry Quantity  |Invoiced Quantity  |Cost Amount (Actual)  |Cost Amount (Expected)  |Adjustment  |Applies-to Entry  |Source Code  |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|379     |  A       |    2020-09-05     |    Sale     | Direct Cost   | 102033        |319     | Blue        | -1       |0         |  0       |     -10   |No   |0    |Sales          |
|381     |  A       |    2020-09-06     |    Sale     | Direct Cost   | 103022        |319     | Blue        |  0       |-1        |-10       |    10     | No  |0      |       Sales   |
|391     |  A       |    **2020-09-10**     |    Sale     | Direct Cost   | 103022        |319     | Blue        |  0       |0         |-1        |    0     |Yes   |    181   | INVTADJMT   |

## Common problems with the "Adjust Cost - Item entries"-batch job

There are two scenarios that the support team encounters frequently enough for them to warrant their own problem resolution articles.

### Error message: "Posting Date is not within your range of allowed posting dates…"

If you encounter this error you need to adjust the dates for which the user is allowed to post entries. To learn more, see [Error Message "Posting Date is not within your range of allowed posting dates"](design-details-inventory-adjustment-value-entry-allowed-posting-dates.md).

### Posting Date on Adjustment Value Entry versus Posting Date on entry causing the adjustment such as Revaluation or Item charge

To learn more, see [Posting Date on Adjustment Value Entry Compared to the Source Entry](design-details-inventory-adjustment-value-entry-source-entry.md).

# Allocate Costs to Intercompany Partners
When you use intercompany postings to transfer documents between partner companies, the VAT-related settings (primarily the VAT business posting group) assigned to the customer or vendor accounts (associated with the intercompany Partner) control whether, and how, VAT is calculated and registered. 
You can also do cost distributions directly from a purchase order to partner companies. For example, if you register a purchase invoice from an external vendor and you want to distribute some or all of the costs to one or more intercompany partners.

You can allocate costs can be to one or more intercompany partners using the following:

* **Intercompany General Journals** - These journals are useful when a service is purchased. For example, when a parent company hires a service to set up computer systems in two subsidiaries. The invoice is sent to the parent company, but the costs are allocate to the intercompany partners. For more information, see [Work with Intercompany Documents and Journals](intercompany-how-work-documents-journals.md).
* Purchase orders and invoices - Using purchase documents is useful when the purchasing functions of, for example, operating expenses, are centralized in one company and then allocated to the intercompany partners.

## To allocate costs using an intercompany general journal
To enter a  line in an intercompany general journal, follow these steps. 

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Intercompany General Journal** , and then choose the related link.
2. If required, in the **External Document No.** field, enter the document number on the invoice from the vendor.
3. In the **Document Type** field, choose **Invoice**.
4. In the **Account Type** field, choose **Vendor**.
5. In the **Account No.** field, choose the vendor.
6. In the **Amount** field, enter a negative amount equal to the amount on the invoice.
7. In the **Bal. Account Type** field, choose **G/L Account**.
8. In the **Bal. Account No.** field, choose the balancing account to use.
9. To allocate costs to intercompany partners, follow these steps:
   1. Create a new line.
   2. Leave the **Document Type** field, choose the option that leaves the field blank.
   3. In the **Document No.** field, enter a number that is different than the number in the **External Document No.** field. The cost allocation is considered a different transaction.
   4. In the **Account Type** field, choose **IC Partner**.
   5. In the **Account No.** field, choose the intercompany partner to allocate the cost to.
   6. In the **Balance Account Type** field, choose **G/L Account**.
   7. In the **Balance Account No.** field, choose the G/L account to which to post the amount you receive from the intercompany partner.
   1. In the **Amount** field, enter the amount of the invoice to allocate to the intercompany partner.
   1. In the **IC Partner G/L Acc. No.** field, choose the G/L account that you want to post the amount to for the intercompany partner. 
   1. Fill in the remaining fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)] Repeat these steps for each intercompany partner who should share in the cost.
1. To post the document and allocate the costs, choose **Post**.  

## To allocate costs using a purchase document
The following procedure describes how to allocate costs using a purchase invoice. The steps are the same for purchase orders.

> [!NOTE]
> To complete these steps you must personalize the **Purchase Invoice** page by adding the **IC Partner Code**, **IC Partner Ref. Type**, and **IC Partner** fields. For more information, see [To start personalizing a page through the Personalizing banner](ui-personalization-user.md#start-personalizing-by-using-the-personalization-mode).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Invoice** , and then choose the related link.
2. In the **Type** field, choose **G/L Account**.
   
   G/L Account is the only option you can use to allocate costs.  
1. In the **No.** field, choose the G/L account to post to.
1. In the **IC Partner Code** field, choose the intercompany partner to allocate the cost to.
1. In the **IC Partner Ref. Type** choose the G/L account to use for the allocation. This account will map the expense to an account in the intercomany partner's chart of accounts.
1. In the **Quantity** field, specify the number of units to charge to the intercompany partner.
1. In the **Direct Unit Cost Excl. VAT (or Incl. VAT)** field, enter the cost per item to charge to the intercompany partner.
1. Fill in the remaining fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)] 
1. To post the purchase order, choose **Post**.

## To send the allocated costs to intercompany partners
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **IC Outbox Transactions**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose lines to send, and then choose the **Send to IC Partner** action. 
3. To allocate the costs, choose the **Complete Line Actions** action.

## Calculating VAT for Cost Distributions
When you use a document to distribute costs to intercompany partners, there are two VAT settings to be aware of: 
* The settings on the G/L account for expenses:
   * If the general business or VAT business posting groups are set up on the G/L account, then the calculation depends on the groups and the product groups from the document line.
   * If the general business or VAT business posting groups are not specified on the G/L account, the calculation depends on the following:
* The posting group settings on the intercompany partner
   * Whether the intercompany partner is assigned to a customer number that does not have a general business or VAT business posting groups specified.
   * There is no customer number associated with the intercompany partner. Then the general business or VAT business posting groups are blank, and the line in the VAT posting setup is used, which is usually a group where 0% VAT is specified.

> [!NOTE]
> It is important to validate both the intercompany partner setup and the G/L account setup (for the expense account used for the cost distribution) before you allocate costs to intercompany partners.

# Search for a record in company data

When you want to find a particular record or value, use the ![Tell me what you want to do.](media/ui-search/search-list.png "Search for Page or Report") **Search** icon to look for it. Learn more about searching in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in [Finding Pages and Information with Tell Me](ui-search.md).

## How search works

[!INCLUDE [ui-how-search-works](includes/ui-how-search-works.md)]

## Getting started

You can speed up results by choosing the fields on the tables that you want to include in your searches. The tables and fields that you can choose from vary, depending on your Role Center. By default, all tables and fields are chosen, which can slow down the search. We recommend that you exclude as many tables and fields as you can.

# The Sales and Inventory Forecast extension

Inventory management is a trade-off between customer service and managing your cost. On one hand, a low inventory requires less working capital, but, on the other hand, stock-outs potentially lead to missed sales. The Sales and Inventory Forecast extension predicts potential sales using historical data and gives a clear overview of expected stock-outs. Based on the forecast, the extension helps create replenishment requests to your vendors and saves you time.  

## Setting up forecasting

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the connection to [Azure AI](https://azure.microsoft.com/overview/ai-platform/) is already set up for you. But you can configure the forecast to use a different type of period to report by, such as changing from forecasting by month to forecasting by quarter. You can also choose the number of periods to calculate the forecast by, depending on how granular you want the forecast to be. We suggest that you forecast by month and with a 12 month horizon for the forecast.

> [!TIP]  
> Consider the length of the periods that the service will use in its calculations. The more data you provide, the more accurate the predictions will be. Also, watch out for large variances in periods. They will also impact predictions. If Azure AI does not find enough data, or the data varies a lot, the service will not make a prediction.

## Use the forecasts

The extension uses Azure AI to predict future sales based on your sales history to help you avoid inventory shortage. For example, when you choose an item on the **Items** page, the chart in the **Item Forecast** pane shows the estimated sales of this item in the coming period. This way you can see if you're likely to run out of stock of the item soon.  

You can also use the extension to suggest when to stock up on inventory. For example, you might create a purchase order for Fabrikam to buy their new desk chair. The Sales and Inventory Forecast extension might suggest that you also restock on the LONDON swivel chair that you usually buy from this vendor. The extension can forecast that you'll soon run out of stock of the LONDON swivel chair, so you might order more chairs already now.  

## Design details

Subscriptions for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] come with access to several predictive web services in all regions where [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is available. For more information, see the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central Licensing Guide. The guide is available for download on the [Business Central](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/en-us/business-central/overview/) website.

These web services are stateless, meaning they use data only to calculate predictions on demand. They don't store data.

> [!NOTE]  
> You can also use your own predictive web service instead of ours. For more information, see [Create and use your own predictive web service for sales and inventory forecasts](#AnchorText). 

### Data required for forecast

To make predictions about future sales, the web service requires quantitative data about past sales. That data comes from the **Posting Date**, **Item No**, and **Quantity** fields on the **Item Ledger Entries** page, where:

- The entry type is "Sale."
- The posting date is between the date that is calculated based on the values in the **Historical Periods** and **Period Type** fields on the **Sales and Inventory Forecast Setup** page and the work date.

Before is uses the web service, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] compresses transactions by **Item No.** and **Posting Date** based on the value in the **Period Type** field in the **Sales and Inventory Forecast Setup** page.

## <a name="AnchorText"> </a>Create and use your own predictive web service for sales and inventory forecasts

For [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, the model is published by Microsoft and connected to the Microsoft subscription. For other deployment options, you must create Machine Learning resources in your own Azure subscription. You can find sample steps in the [sample repo](https://github.com/microsoft/BCTech/tree/master/samples/MachineLearning). The purpose of this task is to get the API URI and API key.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales and Inventory Forecast Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Expand the **General** FastTab, and then fill in the API URL and API key fields.

> [!NOTE]
> You can always switch back to resources managed by Microsoft by removing values from API URL and API Key fields.  

## Limitations of the Sales and Inventory Forecast extension

The Sales and Inventory Forecast extension produces aggregated forecast for all locations and variants. If you have multiple locations, for example, that represent different stores, you can't get a forecast for each location. You must distribute amounts afterwards.

Regarding throughput, we estimate that [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can process approximately 50000 items in 12 hours, which is defined as the *Max Execution Timeout*. The exact number depends on the data and settings for extensions. For more information about report limits in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and how they're configured in the online service, see [Report limits in Business Central](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/operational-limits-online#Reports).

The Sales and Inventory Forecast extension doesn't support filtering, means you can't split items into separate batches.

# Set up unrealized VAT for cash-based accounting

If you're using cash-based accounting methods, you can set up [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to handle unrealized VAT.

## To use general ledger accounts for unrealized VAT

You can choose to have VAT amounts calculated and posted to a temporary general ledger account when an invoice is posted, and then posted to the correct general ledger account and included in VAT statements when the actual payment of the invoice is posted. Before you can do this, you must complete the [VAT posting setup](finance-setup-vat.md).

To use accounts for unrealized VAT, follow these steps:

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, and enter **General Ledger Setup**.
2. On the **General Ledger Setup** page, select the **Unrealized VAT** check box.
3. Choose the **Search for Page or Report** icon ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do"), and enter **VAT Posting Setup**.
4. On the **VAT Posting Setup** page, choose the VAT posting group, and then choose the **Edit** action.
5. In the **Unrealized VAT Type** field, choose an option to specify how to allocate payments to the invoice amount (excluding VAT) and the VAT amount itself, and how to transfer VAT amounts from the unrealized VAT account to the realized account. The following table describes the options.

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Blank | Choose this option if you don't want to use the unrealized VAT feature. |
| Percentage | Payments cover both VAT and the invoice amount in proportion to the payment's percentage of the remaining invoice amount. The paid VAT amount is transferred from the unrealized VAT account to the realized VAT account. |
| First | Payments cover VAT first and then invoice amounts. In this case, the amount transferred from the unrealized VAT account to the VAT account will equal the amount of the payment until the total VAT has been paid. |
| Last | Payments cover the invoice amount first and then VAT. In this case, no amount will be transferred from the unrealized VAT account to the VAT account until the total amount of the invoice, excluding VAT, has been paid. |
| First (Fully Paid) | Payments will cover VAT first (like the _First_ option), but no amount will be transferred to the VAT account until the full amount of VAT has been paid. |
| Last (Fully Paid) | Payments will cover invoice amount first (like the _Last_ option), but no amount will be transferred to the VAT account until the full amount of VAT has been paid. |

6. In the **Sales VAT Unreal. Account** field, choose the account for unrealized sales VAT.

    > [!NOTE]  
    > The VAT amount will be posted to this account, and stay there until the customer payment is posted. The amount is then transferred to the account for sales VAT.
7. In the **Purch. VAT Unreal. Account** field, enter the general ledger account for unrealized purchase VAT.

> [!NOTE]  
> The VAT amount will be posted to this account, and stay there until the customer payment is posted. The amount is then transferred to the account for purchase VAT.

# Put Items Away with Inventory Put-aways

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you receive items and put them away using one of four methods, as described in the following table.

|Method|Inbound Process|Require Receipts|Require Put-aways|Complexity Level (Learn more at [Warehouse Management Overview](design-details-warehouse-management.md))|  
|------------|---------------------|--------------|----------------|------------|  
|A|Post receipt and put-away from the order line|||No dedicated warehouse activity.|  
|B|Post receipt and put-away from an inventory put-away document||Turned on|Basic: Order-by-order.|  
|C|Post receipt and put-away from a warehouse receipt document|Turned on||Basic: Consolidated receive/ship posting for multiple orders.|  
|D|Post receipt from a warehouse receipt document and post put-away from a warehouse put-away document|Turned on|Turned on|Advanced|  

Learn more at [Inbound Warehouse Flow](design-details-inbound-warehouse-flow.md).

This article refers to method B in the table.

When your location is set up to require put-away processing but not receive processing, use an **Inventory Put-away** document to record and post put-away and receipt information for your source documents. Inbound source documents can be purchase orders, sales return orders, and inbound transfer orders.

> [!NOTE]
> Production and assembly output also represent inbound source documents. Learn more about handling production and assembly output for internal processes at [Design Details: Internal Warehouse Flows](design-details-internal-warehouse-flows.md).

You can create an inventory put-away in three ways:  

* Create the inventory put-away directly from the source document itself.  
* Create inventory put-aways for several source documents at the same time by using a batch job.  
* Create the put-away in two steps by first by releasing the source document to make the items available to be put away. You can create the inventory put-away based on the source document by using the **Inventory Put-away** page.  

## To create an inventory put-away from the source document

1. In the source document, which can be a purchase order, sales return order, or inbound transfer order, choose the **Create Inventory Put-away/Pick** action.  
2. Select the **Create Invt. Put-away** checkbox.
3. Choose the **OK** button. A new inventory put-away is created.

## To create multiple inventory put-aways with a batch job

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Create Inventory Put-away/Pick/Movement**, and then choose the related link. 
2. On the **Warehouse Request** FastTab, use the **Source Document** and **Source No.** fields to filter on certain types of documents or ranges of document numbers. For example, you can create put-aways for purchase orders only.
3. On the **Options** FastTab, select the **Create Invt. Put-away** checkbox.
4. Choose the **OK** button. The specified inventory put-aways are created.

## To create the put-away in two steps

### To request an inventory put-away by releasing the source document

When you release purchase orders, sales return orders, and inbound transfer orders, the items on the orders become available to be put away. The following steps describe how to make the items on a purchase order ready to be put away.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Orders**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the purchase order that you want to release, and then choose the **Release** action.  

### To create an inventory put-away based on the source document

A warehouse employee can create a new inventory put-away based on the released source document.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Inventory Put-away**, and then select the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. In the **Source Document** field, select the type of source document you are putting away for.  
4. In the **Source No.** field, select the source document.  
5. Alternatively, choose the **Get Source Document** action to select the document from a list of inbound source documents that are ready for put-away at the location.  
6. Choose the **OK** button to fill the put-away lines according to the selected source document.  

## To record the inventory put-away

1. On the **Inventory Put-aways** page, open a previously created put-away document.  
2. In the **Bin Code** field on the put-away lines, the bins where the items must be put away are suggested based on the items' default bin. You can change the bin if needed.  
3. Perform the put-away, and then enter the actual quantity that was put away in the **Qty. to Handle** field.

    If you must place the items for one line in more than one bin, for example because the designated bin is full, use the **Split Line** action on the **Lines** FastTab. The action creates a line for the remaining quantity to handle.  
4. After you put the items away, choose the **Post** action.  

    * Post the receipt of the source document lines that have been put away
    * If the location uses bins, posting will also create warehouse entries to post the bin quantity changes.

# Set Up Service Items and Service Item Components
To work with service items, you must set up the following

* Service item groups.
* Optional

## To set up service item groups
You can set up groups of items that are related in terms of repair and maintenance. You can define default values for service items in a service item group, such as response time, contract discount percent, and service price group. For items in a service item group, you can select whether you want them to be automatically registered as service items when they are sold.  

You assign service item groups to items on the **Item** card, and to service items on the **Service Item** card.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Item Groups**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Create a new service item group.  
3. Fill in the **Code** and **Description** fields.  
4. In the **Default Contract Discount %** field, enter the default contract discount percentage that you want the service items in the group to have.  
5. In the **Default Serv. Price Group Code** field, enter the default service price group code that you want the service items in the group to have.  
6. In the **Default Response Time (Hours)** field, enter the default response time in hours that you want the service items in the group to have.  
7. If you want to register the items in the group as service items when they are sold, select the **Create Service Item** field.  

## To set up service item components
A service item can consist of several components, which can be replaced with spare parts when the item is serviced. These components are set up on the **Service Item Component List** page. Additionally, if you want to set up components for service items that are BOMs, you can copy the BOM items and create them as service item components.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Items**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the service item for which you want to set up components.  
3. Choose the **Components** action. The **Service Item Component List** page opens.  
4. Add a new component.  
5. In the **Type** field, choose **Service Item** if the component itself is a registered service item. Otherwise, select **Item**.  
6. In the **No.** field, choose the item or service item that is a component of the service item.  

## To set up service item components from a BOM
1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Items**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the service item for which you want to set up components from a BOM.  
3. Choose the **Components** action. The **Service Item Component List** page opens.  
4. Choose the **Copy from BOM** action.  

    If the item that the service item is linked to is a BOM, the components for all the items in the BOM are created automatically.  

## To set up a service shelf
You can set up service shelves that identify where you store your service items. You assign service shelves to service items on the **Service Order** and **Service Item Worksheet** pages.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Shelves**, and then choose the related link.
2. Fill in the fields as necessary.

# Design Details: Item Tracking Posting Structure
To align with inventory costing functionality and to obtain a simpler and more robust solution, item ledger entries are used as the primary carrier of item tracking numbers.  
  
Item tracking numbers on order network entities and non-order network entities are specified in the **Reservation Entry** table (T337). Item tracking numbers that are related to historical information are retrieved directly from the item ledger entries that are related to the transaction in question. This means that item ledger entries reflect the item tracking specification of the posted order line.  
  
The **Item Tracking Lines** page retrieves the information from T337 and the item ledger entries and shows it through the temporary table, **Tracking Specification** (T336). T336 also hold the temporary data in the **Item Tracking Lines page** for item tracking quantities that remain to be invoiced.  
  
## One-to-Many Relation  
The **Item Entry Relation** table, which is used to link a posted document line with its related item ledger entries, consists of two main parts:  
  
* A pointer to the posted document line, the **Order Line No.** field.  
* An entry number pointing to an item ledger entry, the **Item Entry No.** field.  
  
The functionality of the existing **Entry No.** field, which relates an item ledger entry to a posted document line, handles the typical one-to-one relation when no item tracking numbers exist on the posted document line. If item tracking numbers exist, then the **Entry No.** field is left blank, and the one-to-many relation is handled by the **Item Entry Relation** table. If the posted document line carries item tracking numbers but only relates to a single item ledger entry, then the **Entry No.** field handles the relation, and the no record is created in the **Item Entry Relation** table.  
  
## Codeunits 80 (Sales-Post)  and 90 (Purch-Post)
To split the item ledger entries during posting, the code in codeunit 80 and codeunit 90, is encircled by loops that run through global temporary record variables. This code calls codeunit 22 with an item journal line. These variables are initialized when item tracking numbers exist for the document line. To keep the code simple, this looping structure is always used. If no item tracking numbers exist for the document line, then a single record is inserted, and the loop runs only once.  
  
## Posting the Item Journal  
Item tracking numbers are transferred via the reservation entries that relate to the item ledger entry, and the looping through item tracking numbers occurs in codeunit 22  (Item Jnl.-Post Line). This concept works in the same way when an item journal line is used indirectly to post a sale or purchase order as when an item journal line is used directly. When the item journal is used directly, the **Source Row ID** field points to the item journal line itself.  
  
## Code Unit 22  (Item Jnl.-Post Line)
Codeunits 80 (Sales-Post)  and 90 (Purch-Post) loop the call of codeunit 22 (Item Jnl.-Post Line) during the invoice posting of item tracking numbers and during the invoicing of existing shipments or receipts.  
  
During quantity posting of item tracking numbers, codeunit 22 (Item Jnl.-Post Line) retrieves item tracking numbers from the entries in T337 (Reservation Entry) that relate to the posting. These entries are placed directly on the item journal line.  
  
Codeunit 22 (Item Jnl.-Post Line) loops through the item tracking numbers and splits the posting into the respective item ledger entries that carry the item tracking numbers. Information about which item ledger entries are created is returned to T337(Reservation Entry)by using a temporary T336 record, which is called by a procedure in codeunit 22. This procedure is triggered when codeunit 22 has finished its run because at that point, the codeunit 22 object contains the information. When the temporary T336 record is retrieved, Codeunits 80 (Sales-Post)  and 90 (Purch-Post) create records in the **Item Entry Relation** table to link the created item ledger entries to the created shipment or receipt line. Codeunits 80 (Sales-Post)  and 90 (Purch-Post) then converts the temporary T336 (Tracking Specification) records to real T336 (Tracking Specification) records that are related to the line in question. However, this conversion occurs only if the posted document line is not deleted, because it is only partially posted.

# Design details: planning parameters

This article describes the planning parameters that you can use in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

How the planning system controls item supply is determined by various settings on the **Item Card**, **SKU**, and **Manufacturing Setup** pages. The following table explains how planning uses these settings.  

|Purpose|Settings|
|-------------|---------------|
|Define whether the item is planned|Reordering Policy = Blank|
|Define when to reorder|Time Bucket<br /><br /> Reorder Point<br /><br /> Safety Lead Time|
|Define how much to reorder|Safety Stock Quantity<br /><br /> Reordering Policy:<br /><br /> - Fixed Reorder Qty. plus Reorder Quantity<br />-   Maximum Qty. plus Maximum Inventory<br />- Order<br />- Lot-for-Lot|
|Optimize when and how much to reorder|Rescheduling Period<br /><br /> Lot Accumulation Period<br /><br /> Dampener Period|
|Modify the supply orders|Minimum Order Quantity<br /><br /> Maximum Order Quantity<br /><br /> Order Multiple|
|Delimit the planned item|Manufacturing Policy:<br /><br /> - Make-to-Stock<br />- Make-to-Order|

## Define whether the item is planned  

To include an item or SKU in the planning process, you must assign it a reordering policy. Otherwise, it must be planned manually, for example, by using the **Order Planning** page.  

## Define when to reorder  

Reorder proposals are typically released only when the projected available quantity is equal to or below a given quantity. The reorder point defines the quantity. Otherwise, it's zero. Zero can be adjusted by entering a safety stock quantity. If you define a safety lead time, the proposal is delivered in the period before the required due date.  

The **Time Bucket** field is used by reorder point policies (**Fixed Reorder Qty.** and **Maximum Qty.**). The inventory level is checked after each time bucket. The first time bucket begins on the planning start date.  

> [!NOTE]  
> When planning calculates time buckets, it ignores working calendars that are defined in the **Base Calendar Code** field on the **Company Information** and **Location Card** pages.  

On the **Manufacturing Setup** page, you should set the default safety lead time to at least one day. The due date of the demand might be known, but not the due time. The planning schedules backward to meet gross demand. If you don't define a safety lead time, the goods might arrive too late to meet the demand.  

The **Rescheduling Period**, **Lot Accumulation Period**, and **Dampener Period** fields also play a role in defining when to reorder. To learn more, go to [Optimize When and How Much to Reorder](design-details-planning-parameters.md#optimize-when-and-how-much-to-reorder).  

## Define how much to reorder

If the planning system detects the need to reorder, the reordering policy determines when, and how much, to order.  

Independent of the reordering policy, the planning system usually follows this logic:  

1. Calculate the quantity of the order proposal to meet the minimum inventory level of the item, usually the safety stock quantity. If nothing is specified, the minimum inventory level is zero.  
2. If the projected available inventory is below the safety stock quantity, a backward-scheduled supply order is suggested. The order quantity refills the safety stock quantity. Gross demand can increase it within the time bucket according to the reordering policy and the order modifiers.  
3. If the projected inventory is on or below the reorder point (calculated from aggregated changes within the time bucket) and above the safety stock quantity, a forward-scheduled exception order is suggested. Both the gross demand to be met and the reordering policy determine the order quantity. At a minimum, the order quantity meets the reorder point.  
4. If more gross demand is due before the ending date of the forward-scheduled order proposal, and this demand brings the currently projected available inventory below the safety stock quantity, the order quantity is increased to make up the deficit. The suggested supply order is then scheduled backward from the due date of the gross demand that exceeded the safety stock quantity.  
5. If the **Time Bucket** field isn't filled in, only the gross demand on the same due date is added.  

### Reordering policies  

The reordering policies in the following table affect the reorder quantity. To learn more about reordering policies, go to [Design Details: Handling Reordering Policies](design-details-handling-reordering-policies.md).  

|Reordering policy|Description|  
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------|  
|**Fixed Reorder Qty.**|At a minimum, the order quantity is equal to the reorder quantity. You can increase the quantity to meet the demand or the desired inventory level. This reordering policy is often used with a reorder point.|  
|**Maximum Qty.**|The order quantity is calculated to meet the maximum inventory. If quantity modifiers are used, then maximum inventory can be violated. We don't recommend that you use the time bucket together with maximum quantity. The time bucket is often overruled. This reordering policy is often used with a reorder point.|  
|**Order**|The order quantity is calculated to meet each single demand event, and the demand-supply set remains linked until execution. No planning parameters are considered.|  
|**Lot-for-Lot**|The quantity is calculated to meet the sum of the demand that becomes due in the time bucket.|  

## Optimize when and how much to reorder  

A planner can fine-tune planning parameters to limit rescheduling suggestions, accumulate demand (dynamic reorder quantity), or to avoid insignificant planning actions. The following fields help optimize when and how much to reorder.  

|Field|Description|  
|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
|**Rescheduling Period**|This field determines whether the action message should reschedule an existing order or cancel it and create a new order. The existing order will be rescheduled within one rescheduling period before the current supply and until one rescheduling period after the current supply.<br><br>**Note:** This parameter only works with the **Lot-for-Lot** reordering policy.|  
|**Lot Accumulation Period**|With the reordering policy Lot-for-Lot, this field is used to accumulate multiple supply needs into one supply order. From the first planned supply, the system accumulates all supply needs in the following lot accumulation period into one supply, which is placed on the date of the first supply. Demand outside the lot accumulation period isn't covered by this supply.|  
|**Dampener Period**|This field is used to avoid minor rescheduling of existing supply out in time. Changes from the supply date until one dampener period from the supply date don't generate action messages.<br /><br /> The dampener period specifies a period of time during which you don't want the planning system to propose to reschedule existing supply orders forward. This setting limits the number of insignificant rescheduling of existing supply to a later date if the rescheduled date is within the dampener period.<br /><br /> As a result, a positive delta between the suggested new supply date and the original supply date is always larger than the dampener period.|  

> [!NOTE]
> With the reordering policy Lot-for-Lot, the value of the **Lot Accumulation Period** field must be equal to or larger than the value of the **Dampener Period** field. Otherwise, the dampener period is reduced during the planning routine to match the lot accumulation period.  

The timing of rescheduling period, dampener period, and lot accumulation period is based on a supply date. The time bucket is based on the planning start date, as shown in the following illustration.  

:::image type="content" source="media/supply_planning_5_time_bucket_elements.png" alt-text="Time bucket elements.":::

In the following examples, the black arrows represent existing supply (up) and demand (down). Red, green, and orange arrows are planning suggestions.  

**Example 1**: The changed date is outside the rescheduling period, which causes the existing supply to be canceled. A new supply is suggested to cover the demand in the lot accumulation period.  

:::image type="content" source="media/supply_planning_5_recheduling_period_lot_accumulation_period.png" alt-text="Rescheduling and lot accumulation periods.":::

**Example 2**: The changed date is in the rescheduling period, which causes the existing supply to be rescheduled. A new supply is suggested to cover the demand outside the lot accumulation period.  

:::image type="content" source="media/supply_planning_5_recheduling_period_lot_accum_period_reschedule.png" alt-text="Rescheduling period, lot accumulation period, and reschedule.":::

**Example 3**: There's a demand in the dampener period and the supply quantity in the lot accumulation period matches the supply quantity. The next demand is uncovered and a new supply is suggested.  

:::image type="content" source="media/supply_planning_5_dampener_period_lot_accumulation_period.png" alt-text="Dampener period and lot accumulation period.":::

**Example 4**: There's a demand in the dampener period and the supply remains on the same date. However, the current supply quantity doesn't cover the demand in the lot accumulation period. A change quantity action for the existing supply order is suggested.  

:::image type="content" source="media/supply_planning_5_dampener_period_lot_accum_period_change_qty.png" alt-text="Dampener period, lot accumulation period, and change quantity.":::

**Default values:** The default value of the **Time Bucket** field and the three reorder period fields is blank. For all fields, except the **Dampener Period** field, this means 0D (zero days). If the **Dampener Period** field is blank, the global value in the **Default Dampener Period** field on the **Manufacturing Setup** page is used.  

## Modify the supply orders  

When the quantity of the order proposal is calculated, one or more of the order modifiers can adjust it. For example, the maximum order quantity is larger than or equal to the minimum order quantity, which is larger than or equal to the order multiple.  

The quantity is decreased if it exceeds the maximum order quantity. Then, it increases if it's below the minimum order quantity. Finally, it rounds up so that it matches a specified order multiple. Any remaining quantity uses the same adjustments until the total demand is converted to order proposals.  

## Delimit the item  

The **Manufacturing Policy** field on the **Item Card** page defines which other orders the MRP calculation proposes.  

If the **Make-to-Stock** option is used, the orders concern only the item.  

If the **Make-to-Order** option is used, the planning system analyzes the production BOM of the item and creates linked order proposals for those lower-level items that are also defined as make-to-order. This pattern continues as long as there are make-to-order items in the descending BOM structures.

## Use low-level codes to manage derived demand

Use low-level codes to make derived demand for components progress through to the lower levels of the BOM. To learn more about low-level codes, go to [Item Priority / Low-Level Code](design-details-central-concepts-of-the-planning-system.md#item-priority--low-level-code).

You can assign a low-level code to each part in the product structure or the indented BOM. The top final assembly level is denoted as level 0 - the end item. The higher the low-level code number, the lower the item is in the hierarchy. For example, end items have low-level code 0, and the item parts that go into the assembly of the end item have low-level codes 1, 2, 3, and so on. The result is the planning of component parts coordinated with the requirements of all higher-level part numbers. When you calculate a plan, the BOM is exploded in the planning worksheet, and the gross requirements for level 0 are passed down the planning levels as gross requirements for the next planning level.

On the **Manufacturing Setup** page, use the **Dynamic Low-Level Code** toggle to specify whether to immediately assign and calculate low-level codes for each component in the product structure. If you have large amounts of data, this function can have negative effects on the program's performance, for example during automatic cost adjustment. This function isn't retroactive, so it's a good idea to consider the use of this feature beforehand.

As an alternative to the automatic calculation that occurs dynamically if the field is selected, you can run the **Calculate Low-Level Code** batch job from the **Manufacturing** menu by clicking **Product Design**, **Calculate Low-Level Code**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you don't turn on the **Dynamic Low-Level Code** toggle, you must run the **Calculate Low-Level Code** batch job before you calculate a supply plan (the **Calculate Plan** batch job).  

> [!NOTE]
> Although you turn on the **Dynamic Low-Level Code** field selected, the low-level codes of component items aren't changed dynamically if a parent BOM is deleted or set to noncertified. This case might make it difficult to add new items to the end of the product structure because it might exceed the maximum number of low-level codes. Therefore, for large product structures that reach the low-level code limit, you can run the **Calculate Low Level Code** batch job frequently to maintain the structure.

# Inventory by Serial No. (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

If you track items by serial numbers, the **Inventory by Serial No.** report shows your total inventory per serial number. Use this report to track the performance of items on a serial by serial basis.

:::image type="content" source="media/inventory/inventory-by-serial-no.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Inventory by Serial No Power BI Report" lightbox="media/inventory/inventory-by-serial-no.png":::

## Use the report

Inventory management and warehousing staff use this report to track inventory per serial number.

Inventory managers use the report to optimize stock levels for each serial number. This information can help identify slow moving inventory, so you can take corrective action. It can also help you find serial numbers that are due to expire.

The report gives warehouse staff a clear picture of the quantities of each serial number, so you can manage inventory efficiently and avoid stock-outs.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The *Inventory by Serial No.* report includes the following KPIs:

- [**Quantity**](inventory-powerbi-kpis.md#quantity)
- [**Inventory (Quantity)**](inventory-powerbi-kpis.md#inventory-quantity)

[!INCLUDE[click-on-a-kpi-link](includes/click-on-a-kpi-link.md)] 

[!INCLUDE[powerbi-tip-track-kpis](includes/powerbi-tip-track-kpis.md)] 


## Data used in the report

The report uses data from the following tables in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]:

- Item
- Item Ledger Entries

# Record purchases with purchase invoices and orders

You create a purchase invoice or purchase order to record the cost of purchases and to track accounts payable. Purchase invoices and purchase orders are also used to dynamically update inventory levels, meaning you can minimize inventory costs and provide better customer service. The purchasing costs, including service expenses, and inventory values that result from posting purchase invoices or orders, contribute to profit figures and financial key performance indicators (KPIs) in your Role Center.

## Record purchases with purchase invoices

When you receive the inventory items or the purchased service is complete, post the purchase invoice to update inventory and financial records and to activate payment to the vendor according to the payment terms. [Making Payments](payables-make-payments.md).

> [!CAUTION]  
> Do not post a purchase invoice for physical items until you receive the items and know the final cost of the purchase, including any additional charges. Otherwise, your inventory value and profit figures may be skewed.

### Create and post a purchase invoice

The following steps describe how to create a purchase invoice. The steps for creating a purchase order are similar. The main difference is that purchase orders have some extra fields and actions for physical handling of items.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Invoices**,  then choose the related link.  
2. In the **Vendor Name** field, enter the name of an existing vendor.

    Other fields on the **Purchase Invoice** page are now filled with standard information for the selected vendor. If the vendor isn't registered, follow these steps:

    1. In the **Vendor Name** field, enter the name of the new vendor.
    2. In the dialog box about registering the new vendor, choose **Yes**.
    3. To learn more on how to fill in the vendor card, go to [Register New Vendors](purchasing-how-register-new-vendors.md).  
    4. When you complete the vendor card, choose **OK** to return to the **Purchase Invoice** page.

3. Fill in the remaining fields on the **Purchase Invoice** page as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

    You're now ready to fill in the purchase invoice lines with items or resources purchased from the vendor.

    > [!NOTE]  
    > If you have set up recurring purchase lines for the vendor, such as a monthly replenishment order, then you can insert these lines on the invoice by choosing the **Get Recurring Purchase Lines** action.
4. On the **Lines** FastTab, in the **Item No.** field, enter the number of an inventory item or a service.
5. In the **Quantity** field, enter the number of items to be purchased.

    The **Line Amount** field is updated to show the value in the **Direct Unit Cost** field multiplied by the value in the **Quantity** field.

    The price and line amount are shown with or without sales tax depending on what you select in the **Prices Including Tax** field on the vendor card.

    The totals fields under the lines are automatically updated as you create or modify lines to display the amounts posted to the ledgers.

6. In the **Inv. Discount Amount** field, enter an amount that should be deducted from the value shown in the **Total Incl. Tax** field at the bottom of the invoice.

    > [!NOTE]  
    > If you have set up invoice discounts for the vendor, then the specified percentage value is automatically inserted in the **Vendor Invoice Discount %** field if the criteria are met. The related amount is inserted in the **Inv. Discount Amount** field.
7. When you receive the purchased items or services, choose **Post**.

The purchase is now reflected in inventory, resource ledgers, and financial records, and the vendor payment is activated. The purchase invoice is removed from the list of purchase invoices and replaced with a new document in the list of posted purchase invoices. For more information on what happens when you post purchase documents, see [Posting Purchases](purchasing-how-record-purchases.md#posting-purchases).

> [!NOTE]
> In rare cases, the posted amounts may deviate from what is displayed in the totals fields. This is typically due to rounding calculations in relation to value-added tax (VAT) or sales tax.
>
> To check the amounts that will actually be posted, go to the **Statistics** page, which takes the rounding calculations into account. Also, if you choose the **Release** action, the totals fields will be updated to include rounding calculations.

## Posted invoices

[!INCLUDE [posted-invoices](includes/posted-invoices.md)]

You can easily correct or cancel a posted purchase invoice before you pay the vendor. For example, if you need to correct a typo or change the purchase early in the order process. Learn more at [Correct or Cancel Unpaid Purchase Invoices](purchasing-how-correct-cancel-unpaid-purchase-invoices.md). To reverse a purchase for items or services on a posted purchase invoice for which the payment is processed, create a purchase credit memo. Learn more at [Process Purchase Returns or Cancellations](purchasing-how-process-purchase-returns-cancellations.md).

[Open the **Posted Purchase Invoices** list](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=146) in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## Purchasing noninventory items

The lines on a purchase invoice can be of the **Resource** or **Item** type. Item cards can be further classified as of the **Inventory**, **Service**, or **Non-Inventory** type, which specifies if the item is a physical inventory unit, a labor time unit (also applicable for resources), or a physical unit that isn't kept in inventory. Learn more at [Register New Items](inventory-how-register-new-items.md). The purchase invoice process is the same for all mentioned types.

> [!NOTE]
> With the **Resource** purchase line type, you can also purchase external resources, for example, to invoice a vendor for work delivered. Learn more at [Set Up Resources](projects-how-setup-resources.md).
>
> To use a purchased resource, you may need to set the resource's capacity and manually assign it to a project. Purchasing a resource creates a resource ledger entry; however, resource ledger entries are not tracked for quantity and value as, for example, items are. If quantity and value tracking is required, then consider using other line item types.

## When to use purchase orders

Use purchase orders if you need to record partial receipts of an order quantity. For example, because the full quantity isn't available at the vendor. If you deliver sold items directly from your vendor to your customer as a drop shipment, you must also use purchase orders. Learn more at [Make Drop Shipments](sales-how-drop-shipment.md).

In all other aspects, purchase orders work the same as purchase invoices. The following procedure is based on a purchase invoice. The steps are similar for a purchase order.

<br><br>

## Receive items with a purchase order

The following steps describe how to receive items with a purchase order. 

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Orders**, then choose the related link.
2. Open an existing purchase order, or create a new one.
3. In the **Qty. to Receive** field, enter the received quantity.

   > [!NOTE]
   > If the received quantity is more than the quantity on the purchase order, and the vendor has been set up to allow over-receipts, use the **Over-Receive** field to handle the excess quantity. Learn more in the [To receive more items than you ordered](purchasing-how-record-purchases.md#receive-more-items-than-you-ordered) section.
4. Choose the **Post** action.

  The value in the **Qty. Received** field is updated. If this receipt is partial, the value is lower than the value in the **Quantity** field.

> [!NOTE]
> If you use a warehouse handling, you can't use the **Post** action on the purchase order to register receipt. That's because a warehouse employee has already posted the purchase order quantity as received. Learn more at [Design Details - Inbound Warehouse Flow](design-details-inbound-warehouse-flow.md).

## Receive more items than you ordered

When more goods arrive than were ordered, you might want to receive them instead of canceling the receipt. For example, it might be cheaper to keep the excess items in inventory than return them, or your vendor might offer a discount for keeping them.

The following video shows how to work with over-receipts.

> [!VIDEO https://learn-video.azurefd.net/vod/player?id=61ce06f8-b3e7-42fd-b332-85f09d65a4e1]

<!--move the over-receipt setup info to an article about purchasing. Keep the concept info here and link to the steps-->
### Set up over-receipts

Create over-receipt codes to define a percentage by which a received quantity can exceed the ordered quantity. Specify the percentage in the **Over-Receipt Tolerance %** field. You then assign the code on the Item Card or Vendor Card pages for items and vendors.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Over-Receipt Codes**, then choose the related link.
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

### Assign the over-receipt code to an item

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, then choose the related link.
2. Open the **Item Card** page for the item.
3. In the **Over-Receipt Code** field, choose the code that contains the percentage you want to allow for over-receipts.

The over-receipt code is assigned to the item. Purchase orders or warehouse receipts for the item now allow you to receive more than the ordered quantity within the over-receipt tolerance percentage.

> [!NOTE]
> You can set up an approval workflow requiring over-receipts to be approved before they can be handled. Select the **Approval Required** checkbox on the **Over-Receipt Codes** page. Learn more at [Create Workflows](across-how-to-create-workflows.md).

### Over-receive an order

On purchase lines and warehouse receipt lines, the **Over-Receipt Quantity** field is used to record over-received quantities, meaning quantities exceeding the ordered-quantity value in the **Quantity** field.

When you handle an over-receipt, you can increase the value in the **Qty. to Receive** field to the quantity received. The **Over-Receipt Quantity** field updates to show the excess quantity. Alternatively, you can enter the excess quantity in the **Over-Receipt Quantity** field. The **Qty. to Receive** field updates to show the ordered quantity plus the excess quantity. The following procedure described how to fill in the **Qty. to Receive** field.  

1. On a purchase order or a warehouse receipt document where the received quantity is higher than ordered, enter the quantity received in the **Qty. to Receive** field.

    If the increase is within the tolerance specified by an assigned over-receipt code, the **Over-Receipt Quantity** field updates to show the quantity by which the value in the **Quantity** field is exceeded.

    If the increase is over the tolerance, the over-receipt isn't allowed. Investigate whether another over-receipt code allows it. Otherwise, only the ordered quantity can be received, and the excess quantity must be handled another way, such as returning it to the vendor.

2. Post the receipt as you would any other receipt.

> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] does not automatically handle financial aspects of over-receipts. You must manually handle this in agreement with the vendor, for example, by the vendor forwarding a new or updated invoice.

## External document number

[!INCLUDE [ext-doc-no-purch](includes/ext-doc-no-purch.md)]

## Posting purchases

On a purchase document, you can choose between the following posting actions:

* **Post**
* **Preview Posting**
* **Post and Print**
<!--* **Test Report**-->
* **Post Batch**

When a purchase document is posted, the vendor's account, the general ledger (G/L), the item ledger entries, and the resource ledger entries are updated.

For each purchase document, a purchase entry is created in the **G/L Entry** table. An entry is also created in the vendor's account in the **Vendor Ledger Entry** table and a G/L entry is created in the relevant payables account. In addition, posting the purchase can result in a value-added tax (VAT) entry and a G/L entry for the discount amount. Whether an entry for the discount is posted depends on the contents of the **Discount Posting** field on the **Purchases & Payables Setup** page.

For each purchase line, as applicable, entries are created in the:

* **Item Ledger Entry** table if the purchase line is of the **Item** type.
* **G/L Entry** table if the purchase line is of the **G/L Account** type.
* **Resource Ledger Entry** table if the purchase line is of the **Resource** type.

In addition, purchase documents are always recorded in the **Purch. Recpt. Header** and **Purch. Inv. Header** tables.

You can always review various ledger entries that are created as a result of postings. Choose **Preview Posting** to validate document and inspect expected ledger entries.


> [!IMPORTANT]  
> When you post a purchase order for items, you can create both a receipt and an invoice. These can be done simultaneously or independently. You can also create a partial receipt and a partial invoice by completing the **Qty. to Receive** and **Qty. to Invoice** fields on the individual purchase order lines before you post. Note that you cannot create a purchase invoice from a purchase order for products or services that have not been received. That is, before you can invoice, you must have recorded a receipt, or you must choose to receive and invoice at the same time.

You can either post or post and print. If you choose to post and print, a report is printed when the order is posted. You can also choose the **Post Batch** action to post several orders at the same time. Learn more at [Post Multiple Documents at the Same Time](ui-batch-posting.md).

## Viewing ledger entries

When the posting is completed, the posted purchase lines are removed from the order. A message tells you when the posting is completed. Afterward, the posted entries are available on various pages, including the **Vendor Ledger Entries**, **G/L Entries**, **Item Ledger Entries**, **Resource Ledger Entries**, **Purchase Receipts**, and **Posted Purchase Invoices** pages.

In most cases, you can open ledger entries from the affected card or document. For example, on the **Vendor Card** page, choose the **Entries** action.

## Editing ledger entries

You can edit certain fields on posted purchase documents, such as the **Payment Reference** field. Learn more at [Edit Posted Documents](across-edit-posted-document.md). For more critical fields that affect the auditing trail, you must reverse or undo posting. Learn more at [Reverse Journal Postings and Undo Receipts/Shipments](finance-how-reverse-journal-posting.md).

# Reconcile payments using automatic application

The **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page specifies payments, either incoming or outgoing, that have been recorded as transactions on your online bank account or on a payment service. You can apply the payments to related open customer, vendor, and bank account ledger entries. Fill in the journal by importing a bank statement as a bank feed or file or by manually entering transactions that you make through your payment service.

> [!NOTE]
> The page offers automatic matching functionality that applies payments to their related open entries based on a matching of data on a bank statement line (journal line) with data on one or more open entries. Note that you can overwrite the suggested automatic applications, and you can choose to not use automatic application at all. For more information, see step 7.

A payment reconciliation journal is related to one bank account in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The bank account represents the online bank account where the payment transactions are recorded. Any open bank account ledger entries related to the applied customer or vendor ledger entries will be closed when you choose the **Post Payments and Reconcile Bank Account** action. The bank account will be automatically reconciled for payments that you post with the journal.

If you use the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page to register and apply customer payments, you can set up the journal to use a specific number series. Afterward, you can specify the number series in the **Payment Reconciliation No. Series** field on a bank account. Using a dedicated number series can make it easier to identify any entries that were posted through the journal.

Similar to other journals, when you correct posted entries you can reverse entries that were posted through the payment reconciliation journal from the **G/L Register** page. For example, you might want to reverse entries for payments you applied to the wrong customer. You must first un-apply the posted customer ledger entries. Then you can use the **Reverse Register** action in the **G/L Register** page to reverse the journal that posted the payments. Alternatively, on the **Posted General Journals** page, you can use the **Copy Selected Lines to Journal** action to reverse specific lines from the posted payment reconciliaiton journal. 

When you use automatic application, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] recognizes bank ledger entries that have already been posted, which helps prevent double-posting.

You can import bank transactions as .csv bank files or other format that your bank provides. If you want to import bank statements as bank feeds, you must first enable a dedicated bank integration service, and then link the bank account to its related online bank account. The payment reconciliation journal will then automatically detect bank feeds when you choose the **Import Bank Transactions** action. In addition, you can set a bank account up to automatically import new bank statement feeds every hour. Transactions for payments that have already been posted as applied and/or reconciled won't be imported. You can use the Envestnet Yodlee Bank Feeds service for to get those transactions, which is preinstalled in some country versions of [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)]. For more information, see [Set Up the Envestnet Yodlee Bank Feeds Service](bank-how-setup-bank-statement-service.md). Alternatively, a Microsoft partner can help you meet your business or country requirements.

The **Map Text to Account** action lets you set up mappings between text on payments and specific debit, credit, and balancing accounts so that such payments are posted to the specified accounts when you post the payment reconciliation journal. Mapping is useful, for example, for recurring cash receipts or expenses, such as frequent purchases of car fuel or bank fees and interest, that regularly occur on the bank statement and don't need a related business document. (See step 10) For more information, see [Map text on recurring payments to accounts for automatic reconciliation](receivables-how-map-text-recurring-payments-accounts-auto-reconcilliation.md).

Journal lines might have no suggested application, which can happen for various reason. For example, because a document is missing, or a customer overpaid and there's an excess amount after applying the payment on another journal line. For such cases, you can use the **Transfer Difference to Account** action to create and post the missing general ledger entry, for example for a refund, that is needed to apply the payment to. (See step 11) For more information, see [Reconcile payments that can't be applied](receivables-how-reconcile-payments-cannot-apply-auto.md).

You use the **Apply Automatically** function either automatically when you import a bank file or feed with payment transactions or when you activate it, to apply payments to their related open entries based on a matching of text on a bank statement line (journal line) with text on one or more open entries. This automation is based on rules that you define on the **Payment Application Rules** page, where you also define whether an application suggestion requires review. For more information, see [Set up rules for automatic application of payments](receivables-how-set-up-payment-application-rules.md).

On journal lines where a payment has been applied automatically to one or more open entries, the **Match Confidence** field has a value of **Low**, **Medium**, or **High** to indicate the quality of the data matching that the suggested payment application is based on.

Some payment applications require your review as defined by the used matching rule, such as lines with **Low** match confidence. Other lines require your review and manual change because there's a value in the **Difference** field. To review one or more payment applications, choose the **Lines to Review** or **Lines with Difference** field at the bottom. The **Payment Application Review** page opens showing all relevant information about the customer or vendor that the payment is applied to, the matching details, and actions to process the line, such as the **Accept Application** action. (See steps 7 and 8)

For each journal line on the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page, you can open the **Payment Application** page to see all candidate open entries for the payment and view detailed information for each entry about the data matching that a payment application is based on. Here, you can manually apply payments or reapply payments that were applied automatically to a wrong entry. (See step 10) For more information, see [Review, or apply payments after automatic application](receivables-how-review-apply-payments-auto-application.md).

> [!NOTE]  
> You can start the bank transactions import at the same time as you open the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page for an existing journal. The following procedure describes how to import bank transactions into the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page after you have created a new journal.

## To reconcile payments using automatic application
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Payment Reconciliation Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. To work in a new payment reconciliation journal, choose the **New Journal** action.
3. On the **Payment Bank Account List** page, select the bank account that you want to reconcile payments for, and then choose the **OK** button.
   The **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page opens prepared for the selected bank account.
4. Choose the **Import Bank Transactions** action.
   If the bank account for the selected journal isn't set up for importing bank transactions, [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] will help you do that.
5. On the **Select a file to import** page, select the file that contains the bank transactions for payments that you want to reconcile, and then choose the **Open** button.  
6. If the Envestnet Yodlee Bank Feeds service is enabled, on the **Bank Statement Filter** page that opens automatically, specify the date interval for the bank statements to be imported.

    The **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page is filled with lines for payments representing bank transactions in the imported bank statement.

     On lines for payments that have been automatically applied to related open entries, the **Match Confidence** field indicates the quality of the data matching on which the suggested payment application is based. Also, the **Account Name**, **Account Type**, and **Account No.** fields show information about the customer or vendor that the payment is applied to.

    The automatic applications, the matching qualities, and whether lines require review are controlled by rules. You can edit the rules to adjust the results. For more information, see [Set Up Rules for Automatic Application of Payments](receivables-how-set-up-payment-application-rules.md).

7. To review, accept/remove, or manually change multiple payment applications that have a value in the **Difference** field, choose the **Lines with Difference** action at the bottom.

    The **Payment Application Review** page opens and shows the first application to review. The next application to review will be shown on the page as you process the preceding one. The review includes information about the customer or vendor that the payment is applied to, the matching details, and actions to process the line, such as the **Accept Application** and **Apply Manually** actions.

8. To review, accept or remove, or manually change multiple payment applications that the rule has set to be reviewed, choose the **Lines to Review** action. 

9. To change an automatic application, select a journal line, and then choose the **Apply Manually** action to reapply or apply the payment manually on the **Payment Application** page. For more information, see [Review or apply payments after automatic application](receivables-how-review-apply-payments-auto-application.md).

10. Select an unapplied journal line for a recurring cash receipt or expense, such as a car gasoline purchase, and then choose the **Map Text to Account** action. For more information, see [Map text on recurring payments to accounts for automatic reconciliation](receivables-how-map-text-recurring-payments-accounts-auto-reconcilliation.md).

    When you've finished your mapping of payment text to accounts, choose the **Apply Manually** action.

    When text-to-account mapping is set up, the resulting automatic payment application will contain **High - Text-to-Account Mapping** in the **Match Confidence** field.

11. For a journal line has no suggested application because no ledger entry exists that it can be applied to, choose the **Transfer Difference to Account** action to create and post the missing general ledger entry that is needed to apply the payment to. For more information, see [Reconcile payments that can't be applied.](receivables-how-reconcile-payments-cannot-apply-auto.md)

12. When no more lines require review and the **Difference** field is blank on all lines, choose the **Post** action, and then choose one of the following options:

    - **Post Payments and Reconcile Bank Accounts** - To post the payments as applied and also close the related bank account ledger entries as reconciled.
    - **Post Payments Only** - To only post the payments as applied, but leave the related bank account ledger entries open. Required that you reconcile the bank account separately,  for example: For more information, see [Reconcile bank accounts](bank-how-reconcile-bank-accounts-separately.md).
    - **Test Report** - To review the result of posting before you post. The **Bank Account Statement** report opens and shows the same fields as at the bottom of the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page.

When you post the payment reconciliation journal, the applied open entries are closed. The customer, vendor, or general ledger accounts are updated. For payments on journal lines based on text-to-account mapping, the specified customer, vendor, and general ledger accounts are updated. For all journal lines, bank account ledger entries are created. If you choose the **Post Payments and Reconcile Bank Account** action, any open bank account ledger entries related to the applied customer or vendor ledger entries will be closed. This means that the bank account is automatically reconciled for payments that you post with the journal.

You can compare the value in the **Balance on Bank Account After Posting** field together with the value in the **Statement Ending Balance** field to track when the bank account is reconciled based on payments that you post.

> [!NOTE]  
>   If you do not want to reconcile the bank account from the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page, then you must use the **Bank Account Reconciliation** page. For more information, see [Reconcile bank accounts](bank-how-reconcile-bank-accounts-separately.md).

# Set up VAT statement templates and VAT statement names

Tax authorities can, and do, change their requirements for posting VAT. VAT Statement templates and VAT statement names can help you prepare for upcoming changes and make a smooth transition to the new requirements. You can use VAT statement templates to set up different Reports when choosing to print the statement. Each VAT Statement Template can have multiple Vat Statement names, which in turn define the calculations, and you can create a new VAT statement name when requirements change. For example, one name might calculate VAT for this year based on the current requirements, and another might calculate VAT based on requirements for next year. Names are also a way to keep a history of VAT statement formats, for example, so that you can look back to see how you calculated VAT in previous years.

## To define a VAT statement

VAT statements let you calculate your VAT settlement amount for a certain period, for example, a quarter.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Statements**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **Name** field, and then choose **New** on the **VAT Statement Names** page.
3. Fill in the required fields. Usually you want to have a setting for each VAT Bus. Posting Group / VAT Prod. Posting Group combination. For Row numbers it does make sense to use equivalent numbers or codes as in your official VAT Statement [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  

> [!Tip]
> You can filter the information that the statement will include, depending on what you choose in the **Type** field. **Account Totaling** is useful when you want the VAT from a specific account.
**VAT Entry Totaling** gets VAT from the accounts assigned to the selections in the **Gen. Posting Type**, **VAT Bus. Posting Group**, and/or the **VAT Prod. Posting Group** fields. **Row Totaling** lets you enter a value or quick filter criteria in the **Row Totaling** field. For more information, see [Searching, filtering, and Sorting Data](ui-enter-criteria-filters.md). **Description** is often used to add a note to the statement. For example, you could use it as a heading when you've used row totaling.

## To preview the VAT statement

After you define a VAT statement, you can preview it to make sure it meets your needs.
> [!Tip]
> It is best practice to have one section in the VAT Statement using **Type** **Vat Entry Totaling** and another section below using **Type** **Account Totaling** to reconcile the amounts based on the **VAT Entry** table compared to the amount on the **G/L Accounts**. You can also use the **G/L - VAT Reconciliation** Report for this purpose.

1. Choose **Preview**.
2. Enter a date filter to limit the statement to a specific period. For more information about how to customize the page to show the date filter, see [Searching, filtering, and Sorting Data](ui-enter-criteria-filters.md).
3. You can select various options to specify the type of VAT entries to include in the statement.
4. On the lines where the **Type** field contains **VAT Entry Totaling** you can see a list of VAT entries by choosing the amount in the **Column Amount** field.
5. You can use personalization to show more fields in the lines. For example the Unrealized Base Amount and Unrealized VAT Amount, if you're using unrealized VAT.

# Set up calculations and posting methods for value-added tax

Consumers and businesses pay value-added tax (VAT) when they purchase goods or services. The amount of VAT to pay can vary, depending on several factors. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you set up VAT to specify the rates used to calculate tax amounts based on the following parameters:

* Who you sell to  
* Who you buy from  
* What you sell  
* What you buy  

You can set up VAT calculations manually, but that can be tricky and time-consuming. It's easy to use different VAT rates by mistake and create inaccurate VAT-related reports. To make VAT set up easier, we recommend you use the **VAT Setup** assisted setup guide.

However, if you want to set up the VAT calculations yourself, or just want to learn about each step, this article contains descriptions of each step.  

[!INCLUDE [finance-vat](includes/finance-vat.md)]

## Set up VAT using the assisted setup guide (recommended)

> [!NOTE]
> You can use the **VAT Setup** guide only if you have created a *My Company* and haven't posted transactions that include VAT. To learn more about a My Company, go to [Create new companies in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]](about-new-company.md).

To start the assisted setup guide, follow these steps:

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon and enter **Assisted Setup**. 
2. Choose **Set up Value-Added Tax (VAT)** and complete the steps.
3. After you complete the assisted setup, go to the **VAT Posting Setup** page to check whether you need to fill in more fields according to the local requirements in your version of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Learn more at [Local functionality in Business Central](about-localization.md).  

### Check the VAT posting setup

To support your fast start, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] notifies you of missing general ledger (G/L) accounts in posting groups or posting setups, such as on the **VAT Posting Setup** page. You can turn this type of notification on or off using the **G/L Account is missing in posting group or setup** notification in the **My Notifications** page. Just go to the **My settings** page, and then choose the **Change when I receive notifications** link.  

If you choose the notification, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates posting setups based on the posting groups in the document or journal you're currently working on.  

At this point, you can just fill in the missing G/L accounts. But, when you further refine your setup later, you might realize your initial setup is wrong. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't allow you to delete a VAT posting setup and general posting setup after they're used to create entries. To prevent people from mistakenly using a setup that's no longer relevant for new postings, you can use the **Blocked** field on the **General Posting Setup** page.

## Set up a default VAT date for documents and journals

VAT reporting in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is based on the **VAT Date** to include VAT entries on VAT reports in a VAT period. The VAT date can be changed on all documents and journals, but you must specify a default value for VAT date.

> [!NOTE]
> After posting the document or journal, the **VAT Date** will appear on **VAT Entries** and **G/L Entries** as well as on the posted document if exists.

To set up a default value for a VAT date, follow these steps:

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon and enter **General Ledger Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **General** FastTab, in the **Default VAT Date** field, choose either **Posting Date** or **Document Date**.
3. Close the page.  

> [!NOTE]
> By default, the **Default VAT Date** is the **Posting Date**.

### Enable or disable the VAT Date feature

Some countries/regions require that businesses use a specific VAT date, but other countries/regions don't. Some countries/regions also require businesses to change the VAT date in specific situations after they post documents, but other countries/regions don't allow changes to VAT dates. To allow for different contexts, you can choose whether you want to use this functionality and, if so, to what degree.

To set up the level of VAT date usage, follow these steps:

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon and enter **General Ledger Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **General** FastTab, in the **VAT Date Usage** field, specify the degree to which you want to use the VAT date feature. You can choose one of the following options:

   | Type | Description |
   |--------------------|-----------------------------------------|
   | **Use full VAT Date functionality** | Everything related to **VAT Date** works by default, giving you the maximum **VAT Date** functionality. You can set up the date, change it in documents, report based on it, and modify the date after posting as long as the period isn't closed or protected with allowed dates for posting. |
   | **Use but do not allow modifications** | Everything related to **VAT Date** works by default with one exception. You can't modify the **VAT Date** in **VAT Entries**. |
   | **Not using VAT Date functionality** | [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] hides and makes the **VAT Date** fields unavailable on documents, journals, and entries. The **Default VAT Date** is configured as the **Posting Date**. |

3. Close the page.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Even if you choose the **Not using VAT Date functionality** option, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will use the **VAT Date** in the background. Because the **Default VAT Date** is configured as the **Posting Date**, and you can't change it in this case, you'll get the same experience as without this feature. **VAT Date** fields will be removed from all pages, but this field will still exist in tables and reports will work based on it.

### Limiting periods for posting and changing the VAT date

You can prevent people from posting or changing VAT entries in specific date ranges. You set the restriction using two settings:

* Based on closed **VAT Return Period**
* Based on the **Allow Posting From** and **Allow Posting To** fields.

#### To limit posting based on VAT return period

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the TellF Me feature 1.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Ledger Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **General** FastTab, in the **Control VAT Period** field, specify the degree of VAT Return Period control. The following table describes the options.

| Type | Description |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **Block posting within closed and warn for released period** | Prevent people from posting a document or journal, or changing VAT entries that have a VAT date within a closed **VAT Return Period**. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] also shows a warning if your **VAT Return Period** is open, but the status of **VAT Return** is **Released** or **Submitted**. |
| **Block posting within closed period** | Prevent people from posting a document or journal, or changing vat entries that have a VAT date within the closed **VAT Return Period**. |
| **Warn when posting in closed period** | Show a warning, but don't block posting, if you want to post a document or journal that has a VAT date within a closed **VAT Return Period**. |
| **Disabled** | Take no action based on a closed **VAT Return Period**. |

#### Limit posting based on Allow from/to period

> [!NOTE]
> As of Business Central version 23.1, this control is changed. In earlier versions, there was only one control on the **General Ledger Setup** page for both Posting Date and VAT Date. Now, these controls are split, so control in the **General Ledger Setup** page is for the **Posting Date** only and control in the **VAT Setup** page is for the **VAT Date** only. There are also new date controls in the **User Setup** page.  

##### Version 23.1 or newer

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When you upgrade to a newversion, be aware that values are upgraded in the new **Allow VAT Date From/To** in the **VAT Setup** page based on the values in **Allow Posting From/To** in the **General Ledger Setup**. If you want to use different date controls, open the **VAT Setup** page and make changes.  

You can set up limitations on the company or at specific user levels.

To limit all postings for the whole company:

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Setup**, and then select the related link.  
2. On the **VAT Date** FastTab, in the **Allow VAT Date From** field, specify the VAT date from which you allow posting. Posting a document or journal with a VAT date before this date isn't allowed.  
3. On the **VAT Date** FastTab, in the **Allow VAT Date To** field, specify the VAT date until which you allow posting. Posting a document or journal with a VAT date after this date isn't allowed. 

To limit postings for the specific user:  

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **User Setup**, and then select the related link.  
2. In the **User ID** field, specify the user allowed to post in a specific period.  
3. In the **Allow VAT Date From** field, specify the VAT date from which you allow posting. Posting a document or journal with a VAT date before this date isn't allowed. 
4. In the **Allow VAT Date To** field, specify the VAT date until which you allow posting. Posting a document or journal with a VAT date after this date isn't allowed.  

##### Versions before 23.1 

You can set up limitation on the company or specific user levels.

To limit all postings for the whole company:

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Ledger Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **General** FastTab, in the **Allow Posting From** field, specify the VAT date from which you allow posting. Posting a document or journal with a VAT date before this date isn't allowed.  
3. On the **General** FastTab, in the **Allow Posting To** field, specify the VAT date until which you allow posting. Posting a document or journal with a VAT date after this date isn't allowed.

To limit postings for the specific user:

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **User Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. In the **User ID** field, specify the user allowed to post in specific period.  
3. In the **Allow Posting From** field, specify the VAT date from which you allow posting. Posting a document or journal with a VAT date before this date isn't allowed.
4. In the **Allow Posting To** field, specify the VAT date until which you allow posting. Posting a document or journal with a VAT date after this date isn't allowed.

## Set up VAT registration numbers for your country/region

To help ensure people enter valid VAT registration numbers, you can define formats for the VAT registration numbers that are used in the countries/regions in which you do business. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] displays an error message if someone makes a mistake or uses a format that is incorrect for the country/region.

To set up VAT registration numbers, follow these steps:

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 2.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Countries/Regions**.
2. Choose the country or region, and then choose the **VAT Reg. No. Formats** action.
3. In the **Formats** field, define the format by entering one or more of the following characters:  

* **#** Requires a single-digit number.  
* **@** Requires a letter. This format isn't case-sensitive.  
* **?** Allows any character.  

    > [!TIP]
    > You can use other characters as long as they are always present in the country or region format. So, if you need to include a period or a hyphen between sets of numbers, you can define the format as ##.####.### or @@-###-###.  

## Set up VAT business posting groups

VAT business posting groups should represent the markets in which you do business with customers and vendors, and define how to calculate and post VAT in each market. Examples of VAT business posting groups are **Domestic** and **European Union (EU)**.  

Use codes that are easy to remember and describe the business posting group, such as **EU**, **Non-EU**, or **Domestic**. Each code must be unique, meaning you can set up as many codes as you need, but you can't have the same code more than once in a table.

To set up a VAT business posting group, follow these steps:

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 3.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Business Posting Groups**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary.

You can set up default VAT business posting groups by linking them to general business posting groups. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically assigns the VAT business posting group when you assign the business posting group to a customer, vendor, or general ledger account.

## Set up VAT product posting groups

VAT product posting groups represent the items and resources you buy or sell, and determine how to calculate and post VAT according to the type of item or resource.

It's a good idea to use codes that are easy to remember and describe the rate, such as **NO-VAT** or **Zero**, **VAT10** or **Reduced** for 10 percent VAT, and **VAT25** or **Standard** for 25 percent.

To set up a VAT business posting group, follow these steps:

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 4.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Product Posting Groups**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary.

## Combine VAT posting groups in VAT posting setups

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates VAT amounts on sales and purchases based on VAT posting setups, which are combinations of VAT business and product posting groups. For each combination, you can specify the VAT percent, VAT calculation type, and general ledger accounts for posting VAT for sales, purchases, and reverse charges. You can also specify whether to recalculate VAT when a payment discount is applied or received.  

Set up as many combinations as you need. To group VAT posting setup combinations with similar attributes, define a **VAT Identifier** for each group, and assign the identifier to the group members.  

> [!NOTE]
> A **VAT Identifier** is a code you can use to group similar attributes. We recommend you use different VAT identifiers for different VAT percentages.  

To combine VAT posting setups, follow these steps:

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 5.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Posting Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

## Assign VAT posting groups by default to multiple entities

If you want to apply the same VAT posting groups to multiple entities, you can set up [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to do so by default.

* You can assign VAT business posting groups to general business posting groups, or customer or vendor templates.
* You can assign VAT product posting groups on general product posting groups.  

The VAT business or product posting group is assigned when you choose a business or product posting group for a customer, vendor, item, or resource.

## Assign VAT posting groups to accounts, customers, vendors, items, and resources

The following sections describe how to assign VAT posting groups to individual entities.

### To assign VAT posting groups to individual general ledger accounts

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 6.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Chart of Accounts**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the **G/L Account Card** for the account.  
3. On the **Posting** FastTab, in the **Gen. Posting Type** field, choose either **Sale** or **Purchase**.  
4. Choose the VAT posting groups to use for the sales or purchase account.  

### To assign VAT business posting groups to customers and vendors

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 7.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customer** or **Vendor**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Customer** or **Vendor** card, expand the **Invoicing** FastTab.  
3. Choose the **VAT Bus. Posting Group**.  

### To assign VAT product posting groups to individual items and resources

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 8.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Item** or **Resource**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Do one of the following steps:  

    * On the **Item** card, expand the **Price & Posting** FastTab, and then choose **Show more** to display the **VAT Prod. Posting Group** field.  
    * On the **Resource** card, expand the **Invoicing** FastTab.  
3. Choose the VAT product posting group.  

## Set up clauses to explain VAT exemption or nonstandard VAT rates

You set up a VAT clause to describe information about the type of VAT that is being applied. Government regulations might require this information. After you set up a VAT clause and associate it with a VAT posting setup, the VAT clause displays on printed sales documents that use the VAT posting group setup.

If needed, you can also specify how to translate VAT clauses to other languages. When you create and print a sales document that contains a VAT identifier, the document includes the translated VAT clause. The language code specified on the customer card determines the language.

When you use nonstandard VAT rates in different types of documents, such as invoices or credit memos, you might have to include an exemption text (VAT clause). The exemption text states why you calculated a reduced VAT or zero VAT rate. You can define different VAT clauses to include on business documents for each type of document on the **VAT Clauses by Document Type** page.

You can modify or delete a VAT clause, and your modifications are reflected in a generated report. However, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't keep a history of the change. On the report, the VAT clause descriptions are printed and displayed for all lines in the report alongside the VAT amount and the VAT base amount. If a VAT clause isn't defined for any lines on the sales document, the whole section is omitted when you print the report.

### To set up VAT clauses

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 9.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Clauses**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **VAT Clauses** page, create a new line.  
3. In the **Code** field, enter an identifier for the clause. You use this code to assign the clause to VAT posting groups.  
4. In the **Description** field, enter the VAT exemption text that you want to display on documents that can include VAT. In the **Description 2** field, enter more text, if needed. The text is displayed on new document lines.
5. Choose the **Description by document type** action.
6. On the **VAT Clauses by Document Type** page, fill in the fields to set up which VAT exemption text to display for which document type.  
7. Optional: To assign the VAT clause to a VAT posting setup right away, choose **Setup**, and then choose the clause. If you want to wait, you can assign the clause later on the **VAT Posting Setup** page.  
8. Optional: To specify how to translate the VAT clause, choose the **Translations** action.

### To assign a VAT clause to a VAT posting setup

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 10.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Posting Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. In the **VAT Clause Code** column, choose the clause to use for each VAT posting setup it applies to.  

### To specify translations for VAT clauses

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 11.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Clauses**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **Translations** action.  
3. In the **Language Code** field, choose the language you're translating to.  
4. In the **Description** and **Description 2** fields, enter the translations of the descriptions. This text displays in the translated VAT report documents.  

### To specify extended text for VAT clauses

> [!NOTE]  
> If your country or region requires longer text for the VAT clauses than the default version supports, you can specify the longer text for the VAT clauses as *extended text* so that it prints on the sales and purchase reports.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 11.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Clauses**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **Extended Texts** action.  
3. Choose the **New** action.  
4. Fill in the **Language Code** and **Description** fields.  
5. Optionally, select the **All Language Codes** field, or specify the relevant language in the **Language Code** field if you use language codes.  
6. Fill in the **Starting Date** and **Ending Date** fields if you want to limit the dates on which the extended text is used.  
7. In the **Text** lines, write the extended text for your VAT clauses.  
8. Select the relevant fields for the document types where you want the extended text printed.  
9. Close the page.  

## Create a VAT posting setup to handle Import VAT

Use the *Import VAT* feature when you need to post a document where the entire amount is VAT. You use this feature if you receive an invoice from the tax authorities for VAT for imported goods.  

To set up codes for import VAT, follow these steps:  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 12.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Product Posting Groups**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the VAT Product Posting Groups page, set up a new VAT product posting group for import VAT.  
3. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 13.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Posting Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
4. On the VAT Posting Setup page, create a new line, or use an existing VAT business posting groups in combination with the new VAT product posting group for import VAT.  
5. In the **VAT Calculation Type** field, choose **Full VAT**.  
6. In the **Purchase VAT Account** field, enter the general ledger account to use for posting import VAT. All other accounts are optional.  

## Use reverse charge VAT for trade between EU countries/regions

Some companies must use reverse charge VAT when trading with other companies. For example, this rule applies to purchases from EU countries/regions and sales to EU countries/regions.  

> [!NOTE]  
> This rule applies when trading with companies that are registered as VAT liable in another EU country/region. If you do business directly with consumers in other EU countries/regions, then you should contact your tax authority for applicable VAT rules.  

> [!TIP]  
> You can verify that a company is registered as VAT liable in another EU country/region by using the EU VAT Registration Number Validation service. The service is available for free in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For more information, see [Verify VAT registration numbers](finance-how-validate-vat-registration-number.md).

### Sales to EU countries/regions

VAT isn't calculated on sales to VAT-liable companies in other EU countries/regions. You must report the value of these sales to EU countries/regions separately on your VAT statement.  

To correctly calculate VAT on sales to EU countries/regions, you should:  

* Set up a line for sales with the same information for purchases. If you set up lines on the **VAT Posting Setup** page for purchases from EU countries/regions, you can also use these lines for sales.  
* Assign the VAT business posting groups in the **VAT Bus. Posting Group** field on the **Invoicing** FastTab of the customer card of each EU customer. You should also enter the customer's VAT registration number in the **VAT Registration No.** field on the **Foreign Trade** FastTab.  

When you post a sale to a customer in another EU country/region, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates the VAT amount and creates a VAT entry based on information about the reverse charge VAT and the VAT base. This amount is used to calculate the VAT amount. No entries are posted to the VAT accounts in the general ledger.

If you want to use combination of VAT business posting group and VAT product posting group for reporting as services in the periodic VAT reports, mark the **EU Service** field.

> [!NOTE]  
> The **EU Service** field is only applicable for VAT reports. The field isn't related to the **Service Declaration** or **Intrastat for Services** features.

## VAT rounding for documents

Amounts in documents that aren't posted are rounded and displayed to correspond with the final rounding of amounts that are posted. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates VAT for a complete document. The VAT calculation is based on the sum of all lines with the same VAT identifier in the document.  

## Set up VAT reporting

You must set up information about how the tax authorities in your country or region require you to submit VAT reports. The following steps illustrate the most commonly used information. However, your country or region might require other steps. For more information, see the relevant article in the *Local functionality* section in the panel to the left.

# Let Business Central suggest values

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] helps you complete tasks faster and more accurately by prefilling fields or completing lines with data that you would otherwise calculate and enter manually. Although such automatic data entry is always correct, you can change it afterwards if you want to.

This article contains a selection of such functionality. More sections will be added in future updates of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## Autofill fields with Copilot (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner-section.md)]

When you draft a new record or edit an existing record, Copilot suggests values for editable fields on the page. Learn more in [Autofill fields with Copilot](autofill-fields-with-copilot.md).

## The **Suggest Balancing Amount** check box on the **General Journal Batches** page

When, for example, you're entering general journal lines for multiple expenses that must all be posted to the same bank account, then each time you enter a new journal line for an expense, you can have the **Amount** field on the bank account line automatically updated to the amount that balances the expenses. For more information about working with general journals, see [Work with General Journals](ui-work-general-journals.md).

### To have the **Amount** field on balancing general journal lines filled automatically

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Journals**, and then choose the related link.
1. On the line for your preferred general journal batch, choose the **Suggest Balancing Amount** check box.
1. Open the general journal and proceed to register and post transactions using the described functionality for automatic entry of a field value.       

For information about how to set up a personal general journal batch, for example, for expense handling, see [Work with General Journals](ui-work-general-journals.md).

## The **Automatically Fill Date Received** field on the **Payment Registration** page

The **Register Customer Payments** page shows outstanding incoming payments as lines that represent sales documents where an amount is due for payment. For more information about applying customer payments, see [Reconcile Customer Payments from a List of Unpaid Sales Documents](receivables-how-reconcile-customer-payments-list-unpaid-sales-documents.md).

Your main actions on the page are to fill in the **Payment Made** check box and the **Date Received** field. You can set [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] up to automatically enter work date in the **Date Received** field when you select the **Payment Made** check box.

### To have the **Date Received** field on the **Payment Registration** page filled automatically

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Payment Registration Setup**, and then choose the related link.
1. Select the **Automatically Fill Date Received** check box.
1. Open the **Register Customer Payments** page and proceed to process incoming customer payments using the described functionality for automatic entry of a field value.

# Run Batch Jobs and XMLports

A batch job is a routine that processes data in batches, for example the **Adjust Exchange Rates** batch job. There are batch jobs that perform periodic accounting activities, such as closing the income statement at the end of a fiscal year. Many batch jobs do calculation work, such as calculation of finance charges, exchange rate adjustment, and calculation of unit prices.

A batch job is like a report, except the batch job uses the result of its work to update information directly, instead of printing the results.

You can schedule when a batch job runs. For more information, see [Use Job Queues to Schedule Tasks](admin-job-queues-schedule-tasks.md).

## To run a batch job
1. To open the request page for the relevant batch job, choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter the name of the batch job, and then choose the related link.
2. If there is an **Options** FastTab for the batch job, fill in the fields to determine what the batch job will do.
3. The page may contain one or more FastTab with filters, which you can use to limit the data included in the batch job. You can enter criteria in the suggested filters or add more filters.
4. Choose the **OK** button to start the batch job.

# Register new customers

Customers are your source of income. You must register each customer you sell to as a customer card. Customer cards contain the information required to sell products to the customer. Learn more at [Invoice Sales](sales-how-invoice-sales.md) and [Register New Items](inventory-how-register-new-items.md).  

Before you can register new customers, you must set up various sales codes to choose from when you fill in customer cards. Learn more at [Setting Up Sales](sales-setup-sales.md).

> [!VIDEO https://learn-video.azurefd.net/vod/player?id=37d3ec2a-71c2-4f0d-9a94-62c83805fbfa]

## Add new customers

You can add new customers manually by filling out the **Customer Card** page, or you can use templates that contain predefined information. For example, you can create a template for different types of customer profiles. Using templates saves time when adding new customers, and helps ensure the information is correct each time. 

If you create:
* Multiple templates for use with more than one type of customer, you can choose the suitable template when you add a customer.
* Only one template is used for all new customers. 

After you create a template, you can use the **Apply Template** action to apply it to one or more selected customers. To create a template, fill in the information to be reused on the **Customer Card** page, then save it as a template. Learn more in the [To save the customer card as a template](sales-how-register-new-customers.md#to-save-the-customer-card-as-a-template) section.

> [!TIP]
> It can be helpful to personalize the **Customer Template** page when you create a template. For example, you might want to add the **Credit Limit** field to a template. Learn more in the [Personalize your workspace](/dynamics365/business-central/ui-personalization-user#start-personalizing-by-using-the-personalization-mode) section.

You can also create a customer from a contact. Learn more in the [To create a customer, vendor, employee, or bank account from a contact](marketing-create-contact-companies.md#to-create-a-customer-vendor-employee-or-bank-account-from-a-contact) section.  

### To create a new customer card

[!INCLUDE[create_new_customer](includes/create_new_customer.md)]

The **Prices & Discounts** action provides options for managing special prices or discounts for a customer when an order meets certain criteria. When purchasing a certain item, ordering a minimum quantity, or buying before a date, such as when a campaign ends, are examples of such criteria. Learn more at [Record Sales Price, Discount, and Payment Agreements](sales-how-record-sales-price-discount-payment-agreements.md).

The customer is now registered, and the customer card is ready to be used on sales documents.  

### To save the customer card as a template

You can use a customer card as a template when you create new customer cards.

1. On the **Customer Card** page, choose the **Save as Template** action. The **Customer Template** page opens showing the customer card as a template.
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
3. To reuse dimensions in templates, choose the **Dimensions** action. The **Dimension Templates** page opens showing any dimension codes set up for the customer.
4. Edit or enter dimension codes you want to apply to new customer cards created with this template.  
5. When you complete the new customer template, choose **OK**.

The customer template is added to the list of customer templates, and you can use it to create new customer cards.

## Delete customer cards

If you post a transaction for a customer, you can't delete the customer card because the ledger entries might be needed for auditing. To delete customer cards with ledger entries, contact your Microsoft partner to do so through code.  

## Manage credit limits

Credit limits, balance amounts, and payment terms make it possible for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to issue a credit and an overdue balance warning when you enter a sales order. Furthermore, reminder term and finance charge term elements enable you to invoice interest and/or extra fees.  

The **Credit Limit** field on a customer card specifies the maximum amount you allow the customer to exceed the payment balance before warnings are issued. When you enter information in journals, quotes, orders, and invoices, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] tests both the sales header and individual sales lines to determine if the credit limit is exceeded.

You can post even if the credit limit exceeds. A blank field means there's no credit limit for this customer.  

You can choose not to receive warnings when the customer's credit limit is exceeded, and you can specify which types of warnings you want to see.

### To specify credit limit warnings

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales & Receivables Setup**, then choose the related link.

2. On the **General** FastTab, in the **Credit Warnings** field, choose the relevant option as described in the following table:

    |Option| Description|
    |------|------------|
    |**Both Warnings**| Both the **Credit Limit** and the **Balance Due** fields on the customer's card are checked, and a warning is shown if the customer exceeds its credit limit or has an overdue balance.|
    |**Credit Limit**|The value in the **Credit Limit** field on the customer's card is compared with the customer's balance, and a warning is shown if the customer's balance exceeds this amount.|
    |**Overdue Balance**|The **Balance Due** field on the customer's card is checked, and a warning is shown if the customer has an overdue balance.|
    |**No Warning**|No credit warnings are shown regarding the customer's status.|

## Assign a salesperson

You can assign salespeople to customer ship-to address rather than their billing address so your sales reports reflect the true geographical distribution of your sales. Assigning a salesperson to a customer's ship-to address gives you more precise insights and optimizes resource allocation.

Assign a salesperson on the **Customer** card page by choosing **Customer**, and then **Ship-To Addresses** to open the **Ship-to Addresses List** page. Choose **Manage**, and then **Edit** to open the **Ship-to Address** card page. Enter or choose a **Salesperson Code** to select the salesperson.

When you choose the **Alternate Shipping Address** option as a **Ship-To** location on a sales document, the **Salesperson Code** updates to match the salesperson from the **Ship-to** rather than the **Bill-to** address.

# Sustainability value chain overview

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This set of features is available as a _public preview_ in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], starting from **2025 release wave 1**. Read carefully, and be sure to understand which features we currently support.  

The sustainability value chain features are a comprehensive tool designed to streamline the collection and use of data from your value chain partners. This feature empowers organizations to accurately calculate Scope 3 emissions, enabling better sustainability reporting and compliance with environmental standards.  

## Introduction to value chain for Scope 3 emissions calculation

The sustainability value chain enables you to use data you from your value chain partners to calculate your scope 3 emissions. A value chain in general is a vendor you do business with and from whom you collect inbound emission data. After you collect emissions or carbon data from your vendors, you can use the data to calculate your Scope 3 emissions in your business processes. You can also calculate other emissions for other types of item handling, such as transfers, production, and so on. These calculations help give you accurate information about embedded emissions for items you plan to sell.

The sustainability value chain helps businesses:

- Achieve a higher level of accuracy in sustainability reporting.
- Provide better communication with customers related to emissions in their products.
- Better align with regulatory demands.
- Actively contribute to reducing their environmental footprint.  

## How the system keeps sustainability value chain data

To track the sustainability value chain, record and use transactions from the **Sustainability Value Entries** page.  

> [!NOTE]
> The sustainability value chain process works only with the CO2e (carbon equivalent).

The **Sustainability Value Entry** page is an important component for managing and tracking the value of the embedded carbon footprint in items. It records all changes in the CO2e emissions of inventory items, including purchases, location transfers, production, sales, and so on. This page helps ensure accurate CO2e (carbon equivalent) valuation and provides detailed insights into the emissions effect of inventory transactions.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The sustainability value chain uses only the average method of CO2e emission calculation per item. An item's **CO2e per Unit** is calculated as the average **CO2e per Unit** at each point in time after a purchase.

# Liquidity (Power BI report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The Liquidity Report is designed to help you evaluate your company's short-term financial health by focusing on three key performance indicators: Current Ratio, Quick Ratio, and Cash Ratio. These ratios, along with their supporting details, allow you to assess your ability to meet current liabilities.

:::image type="content" source="media/finance/liquidity-report.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Liquidity report" lightbox="media/finance/liquidity-report.png":::

## Use the report

The audiences for the report are:

- Executives
- Directors
- Other high-level decision makers

Executives use the report to analyze the company's financial stability and help ensure there's sufficient cash flow for ongoing operations. For a broad perspective of liquidity, you could assess the current ratio. The current ratio compares current assets to current liabilities. This helps assess day-to day operational stability.

For a more conservative assessment, you can analyze the quick ratio, which removes inventory and purchase prepayments from the equation. This ratio focuses on cash and assets that you can quickly convert to cash, such as accounts receivable.  

Finally, you could review the cash ratio, which focuses on liquid assets to meet financial obligations. This perspective is the most conservative, and focuses on cash and cash equivalents to meet current liabilities.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The *Liquidity* report includes the following KPIs and measures: 

- [**Current Ratio**](finance-powerbi-kpis.md#current-ratio)
- [**Quick Ratio**](finance-powerbi-kpis.md#quick-ratio)
- [**Cash Ratio**](finance-powerbi-kpis.md#cash-ratio)
- [**Current Assets**](finance-powerbi-kpis.md#current-assets)
- [**Current Liabilities**](finance-powerbi-kpis.md#current-liabilities)
- [**Inventory**](finance-powerbi-kpis.md#inventory)
- [**Purchase Prepayments**](finance-powerbi-kpis.md#purchase-prepayments)
- [**Liquid Assets**](finance-powerbi-kpis.md#liquid-assets)

[!INCLUDE[click-on-a-kpi-link](includes/click-on-a-kpi-link.md)] 

[!INCLUDE[powerbi-tip-track-kpis](includes/powerbi-tip-track-kpis.md)]

## Data used in the report

The report uses data from the following tables in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]:

- G/L Entry
- G/L Accounts
- G/L Account Categories

title: Reconcile customer payments with the cash receipt journal or from customer ledger entries
description: Apply customer cash receipts or refunds to one or more open customer ledger entries.

# Reconcile customer payments with a cash receipt journal or from customer ledger entries

When you receive a cash payment from a customer or give a cash refund, you can apply the payment or refund to close open debits or credits. You can specify the amount to apply. For example, you can apply partial payments to customer ledger entries. Closing customer ledger entries keeps customer statistics, account statements, finance charges, and so on, up-to-date.

> [!TIP]  
> On the **Customer Ledger Entries** page, red font means that the related payment is past its due date. If overdue payments are becoming a problem, we can help you reduce their frequency. You can enable the **Late Payment Prediction Setup** extension, which uses a predictive model that we built in Azure Machine Learning to predict the timing of payments. These predictions help you reduce outstanding receivables and fine-tune your collections strategy. For example, if a payment is predicted to be late, you can adjust the terms of payment or the payment method for the customer. For more information, see [Late Payment Predictions](ui-extensions-late-payment-prediction.md).  

You can apply customer ledger entries in several ways:

* Enter information on the following pages:
   * The **Payment Reconciliation Journals** page. For more information, see [Applying Payments Automatically and Reconciling Bank Accounts](receivables-apply-payments-auto-reconcile-bank-accounts.md).
   * The **Payment Registration Setup** page. For more information, see [Reconcile Customer Payments from a List of Unpaid Sales Documents](receivables-how-reconcile-customer-payments-list-unpaid-sales-documents.md).
   * The **Cash Receipt Journals** page. For more information, see [To fill and post a cash receipt journal](#to-fill-and-post-a-cash-receipt-journal).
* By filling in the **Applies-to Doc. No.** field on sales credit memo documents. For more information, see [To apply a credit memo to a single customer ledger entry](#to-apply-a-credit-memo-to-a-single-customer-ledger-entry).
* By using the **Set Applies-to ID** action on a customer ledger entry. For more information, see [To apply a payment to a single customer ledger entry](#to-apply-a-payment-to-a-single-customer-ledger-entry).
* By using the **Apply Entries** action on the **Bank Deposit** page, and then entering the invoice number in the **Applies-to ID** field. For more information, see [Create Bank Deposits](bank-create-bank-deposits.md).

> [!NOTE]  
> If the **Application Method** field on the customer card contains **Apply to Oldest**, payments are applied to the oldest open credit entry, unless you manually specify an entry. If the application method is **Manual**, you always apply entries manually.

## To fill and post a cash receipt journal

A cash receipt journal is a type of general journal. You can use it to post transactions to general ledger, bank, customer, vendor, and fixed assets accounts. You can apply the payment to one or more debit entries when you post the payment. You can also apply from the posted entries later.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Cash Receipt Journals**, and then choose the related link.

   > [!NOTE]
   > By default, the External Document No. field is hidden. If it is, and you want to use it, you can use personalization to add it. For more information, see [Personalize your workspace](ui-personalization-user.md).

7. In the **Account Type** field, select **Customer**.
8. In the **Account No.** field, select the customer.
9. To post the application at the same time as you post the journal, fill in the following fields:
   1. In the **Bal. Account Type** field, select **G/L Account** for cash payments, and **Bank Account** for other payments.

3. To apply the credit memo to a single customer ledger entry when posting, in the **Applies-to Doc. No.** field, select the entry to which you want to apply the payment.
4. On the line in the **Amount to Apply** field, enter the amount you want to apply to the entry.  

    If you don't enter an amount, application automatically applies the maximum amount. At the bottom of the **Apply Customer Entries** page, you can see the specific amount in the **Applied Amount** field and also whether the application balances.  
5. Choose the **OK** button. The **Sales Credit Memo** page now shows the entry you selected in the **Applies-to Doc. Type** and **Applies-to Doc. No.** fields. And the amount of the credit memo to be posted, adjusted for any possible payment discounts.
6. Post the credit memo.

## To apply a credit memo to multiple customer ledger entries

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Credit Memos**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the relevant sales credit memo.
3. To apply the credit memo to multiple customer ledger entries when posting, choose the **Apply Entries** action.
4. Select the lines with the entries that you want the applying entry to be applied to, and then choose the **Set Applies-to ID** action.
5. On each line, in the **Amount to Apply** field, enter the amount you want to apply to the individual entry. If you don't enter an amount, the maximum amount is applied.  

    At the bottom of the **Apply Customer Entries** page, you can see the specific amount in the **Applied Amount** field and also whether the application balances.  
6. Choose the **OK** button. The **Sales Credit Memo** page now shows the amount of the credit memo to be posted, adjusted for any possible payment discounts.
7. Post the credit memo.

## To apply posted customer ledger entries

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customers**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the customer card for the customer with entries that you want to apply.
3. Choose the **Ledger Entries** action from the **Related** tab, and then select the line with the entry that is the applying entry.
4. Choose the **Apply Entries** action. The **Apply Customer Entries** page opens showing the open entries for the customer.
5. Select the lines with the entries that you want the applying entry to be applied to, and then choose the **Set Applies-to ID.** action.
6. For each line in the **Amount to Apply** field, enter the amount you want to apply to the individual entry. If you don't enter an amount, the maximum amount is applied.  

    At the bottom of the **Apply Customer Entries** page, you can see the specific amount in the **Applied Amount** field.  
7. Choose the **Post Application** action. The **Post Application** page appears with the document number of the applying entry and the posting date of the entry with the most recent posting date.  
8. Choose the **OK** button to post the application.

    If the posted application resulted in closed customer ledger entries, the **Open** field is cleared for these ledger entries.  
9. To see the ledger entries, choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customers**, and then choose the related link. Browse to the card for the relevant customer to see the ledger entries.  

On the ledger entry list, on the line that contains the ledger entry that was fully applied to, you can see that the **Open** check box isn't selected.  

> [!NOTE]  
> After you select an entry on the **Apply Customer Entries** page, or several entries by setting the **Applies-to ID**, the **Applied Amount** field on the journal line will contain the sum of the remaining amounts for the posted entries you've selected, unless the field contains something already. If you select **Apply to Oldest** in the **Application Method** field on the customer card, the application occurs automatically.

## To apply customer ledger entries in different currencies to one another

If you sell to a customer in one currency and receive payment in another currency, you can still apply the invoice to the payment.  

Here's an example. You apply Entry A in one currency to Entry B in another currency. The posting date on Entry A is used to find the exchange rate to use to convert amounts on Entry B. The exchange rate is found on the **Currency Exchange Rates** page.  

Applying customer ledger entries in different currencies must be enabled. For more information, see [Enable Application of Ledger Entries in Different Currencies](finance-how-enable-application-ledger-entries-different-currencies.md).  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Cash Receipts Journal**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the journal you want, and fill in the first empty journal line using a currency code.
3. Choose the **Apply Entries** action.
4. Select the line with the entry you want to apply to the entry in the cash receipt journal, choose the **Set Applies-to ID** action, and then select the entry you want to apply to.
5. Choose the **OK** button to return to the cash receipt journal.
6. Post the sales journal.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>   When you apply entries in different currencies, the entries are converted to USD. Although the exchange rates for the two currencies are fixed, for example between USD and EUR, there may be a small residual amount when they are converted to USD. These small residual amounts are posted as gains and losses to the account specified in the **Realized Gains Account** or **Realized Losses Account** fields on the **Currencies** page. The **Amount (USD)** field is also adjusted on the vendor ledger entries.  

## To correct an application of customer entries
When you correct an application, correcting entries are created and posted for all entries. The correcting entries are the same as the originals but have an opposite sign in the **Amount** field. The correcting entries include all general ledger entries derived from the application. For example, the payment discount and currency gains/losses. The entries that the application closed are reopened.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customers**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the relevant customer card.
3. Choose the **Ledger Entries** action.
4. Select the relevant ledger entry, and then choose the **Unapply Entries** action.
5. Alternatively, choose the **Detailed Ledger Entry** action.
6. Select the application entry, and then choose the **Unapply Entries** action.
7. Fill in the fields in the header, and then choose the **Unapply** action.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>   If an entry has been applied by more than one application entry, you must unapply the latest application entry first.

# Suggest substitute items with Copilot

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](includes/preview-banner.md)]

This article explains how to find and assign substitute items faster by letting Copilot suggest the items to add.

[!INCLUDE [production-ready-preview-dynamics365](includes/production-ready-preview-dynamics365.md)]

## About item substitution suggestions

To ensure they can fulfill orders quickly, businesses often assign similar items to each other so they can use them as substitutes. For example, substitutes are good to have when the item that was originally requested is out of stock. Finding and assigning the right items to use as substitutes can be time consuming, and that's where Copilot can help. The suggest item substitutions capability for Copilot can speed up the process of finding similar items.

Information about products is stored in multiple places in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For example, item numbers and descriptions are stored in the Item table, multiple barcodes are stored in the Item Reference table, and item properties are stored in the Item Attributes table. Copilot uses a large language model combined with embedded search to comb through this information and suggest items that might be good substitutes. While you might prompt for *Red bicycle*, the actual product might be *Crimson Tourer**, where *Bicycle* is an item category and *Red* is an attribute.

## Available languages

[!INCLUDE [copilot-geo-and-language-availability](includes/copilot-geo-and-language-availability.md)]

## Prerequisites

- Your administrator must activate the **Create product information** capability on the **Copilot & agent capabilities** page. [Learn more about how to configure Copilot and agent capabilities](enable-ai.md).
- You're familiar with creating and managing product (item) information.

## Suggest item substitutions on item substitution entries

This process describes how to get Copilot to suggest substitute items.

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, and then select the related link.
2. Select the item you want Copilot to find substitutes for.
3. Choose the **Substitutions** action.
4. On the **Item Substitution Entry** page, choose **Suggest with Copilot**.
5. Review the suggestions. To learn more, go to [Review, save, discard, or regenerate suggestions](#review-save-discard-or-regenerate-suggestions).

## Adjust the search

By default, the capability uses the item description as search criteria, which you can adjust if you want to fine-tune the search results. To edit the prompt, select the :::image type="content" source="media/edit-pencil.png" alt-text="Edit the prompt."::: icon in the Copilot window. For example, you can add more details to the prompt such as colors, sizes, or other item attributes.

## Review, save, discard, or regenerate suggestions

After Copilot suggests the items to add, review the suggestions and decide whether they're what you want:

- To discard a single proposed line, select it in the list, and then choose the **Delete Line** action.
- To discard all proposed lines and close the Copilot window, choose **Discard** (trash can).
- To transfer the lines shown in the Copilot window, choose **Insert all**. This step confirms that you want to transfer the lines to the **Item Substitution Entry** page. You can delete or edit the transferred lines there as well. The **Score** field that displays **High (85+)**, **Medium (83-85)**, and **Low (79-83)** scores and points you to lines that need attention.

# View a financial report on-screen, as a PDF, or in Excel

After you set up definitions for your financial reports, you can start using the data to support your finance and accounting processes. The Financial Reporting feature offers multiple ways to view the reports:

- On-screen, with drill-through to the underlying numbers.
- As PDF documents designed for sharing and printing.
- As Excel files that use the template or layout of your choice.

This article describes each approach.

## View a financial report on-screen

You can view any report on-screen with drill-through to the underlying numbers.

To view a financial report, follow these steps:

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 4.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Financial Reports**, and then choose the related link.
1. On the **Financial Reports** page, select the financial report you want to view, and then choose the **View Financial Report** action.

The page has **Options** and **Dimensions** FastTabs. If the FastTabs aren't available, you might need to enable them with the **Show all options** action.

On the **Options** FastTab, specify how the report shows data. For example:

- Use the **View by** field to specify the period for which to summarize data. Specifying a period is a good way to make the data more granular.
- Use the **Date Filter** field to show amounts for a certain data or date range.
- The **Show All Lines** toggle specifies whether the page displays all lines, or excludes empty lines, as defined in the row definition.
- The **Negative Amount Format** field allows you to define how you want to format negative numbers.

On the **Dimensions** FastTab, you can choose to filter data according to global dimensions.

> [!TIP]
> If you change a setting, to refresh the data on the screen, use the **Recalculate** action.

### Show or hide the Row No. field on a report

The **Row No.** field might show when you view a report on-screen. The field doesn't show when you view the report in a PDF. To show or hide the field, personalize the page. To learn more, go to [Personalize your workspace](ui-personalization-user.md).

## Integrate financial reports with Excel

You can integrate a financial report with an Excel workbook template, adjust the layout to suit your needs, and then update the Excel template with data from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For example, this integration makes it easier to generate your monthly and yearly financial statements in a format that works for you.

### Set up Excel integration for a financial report (create an Excel template)

To set up Excel integration for a financial report, follow these steps to create an Excel template.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 4.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Financial Reports**, and then choose the related link.
1. On the **Financial Reports** page, select the financial report to enable with Excel, and then choose the **View Financial Report** action.
1. On the **Financial Report** page, choose the **Create New Excel Template** action. This action downloads a template Excel workbook with a single worksheet named after the report.
1. Copy the worksheet, and rename it to **Data**.
1. Rename the report worksheet to your liking.
1. In the report worksheet, mark all cells that show data from the financial report, including column and row headers. On the **Home** ribbon, find the **Number** menu and choose **General** as the category.
1. Choose the leftmost cell of the area with data from the financial report, and set a reference to the equivalent cell in the Data worksheet. Drag the formula to extend it to all cells in the first row, and then drag the row down to cover all rows in the financial report.
1. Hide the **Data** worksheet.
1. Format the report worksheet to suit your needs.
1. Save the workbook in OneDrive, or a similar place where the file is backed up and versioned.
1. Close the workbook.

> [!TIP]
> The **Row No.** field is shown on the data worksheet, but you might not want to include it on your worksheet.

> [!NOTE]
> If you make changes to the row or column definitions of the report you created a template for, you must update the template too. Each row and column in the Excel template must be in the same position as the generated report.

### Run a financial report with an Excel template

To run a financial report with an Excel template, follow these steps:

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 4.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Financial Reports**, and then choose the related link.

# Data ownership models for synchronization

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] requires that you specify an owner for the data you store. For more information, see [Types of tables](/powerapps/maker/data-platform/types-of-entities) in the Power Apps documentation. When you set up integration between [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] you must choose the **User or team** ownership for records that are synchronized. Actions that can be performed on these records can be controlled on a user level. <!--We recommend the Team ownership model because it makes it easier to manage ownership for multiple people.NO LONGER TRUE IN DATAVERSE-->

## Team Ownership
In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], a company is a legal and business table that offers ways to secure and visualize business data. Users always work in the context of a company. The closest that [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] comes to this concept is the business unit table, which does not have legal or business implications.

Because business units lack legal and business implications, you cannot force a one-to-one (1:1) mapping to synchronize data between a company and a business unit, either one-way or bi-directional. To make synchronization possible, when you enable synchronization for a company in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the following happens in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)]:

* We create a company table that is equivalent to the company table in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The name of the company is suffixed with "BC Company ID." For example, Cronus International Ltd. (93555b1a-af3e-ea11-bb35-000d3a492db1).
* We create a default business unit that has the same name as the company. For example, Cronus International Ltd. (93555b1a-af3e-ea11-bb35-000d3a492db1).
* We create separate owner team with the same name as the company and associate it with the business unit. The name of the team is prefixed with "BCI -." For example, BCI - Cronus International Ltd. (93555b1a-af3e-ea11-bb35-000d3a492db1).
* Records that are created and synchronized to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] are assigned to the "BCI Owner" team that is linked to the business unit.

> [!NOTE]
> If you rename a company in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the names of the company, business, and team that we create automatically in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] are not updated. Because only the company ID is used for integration, this does not affect synchronization. If you want the names to match you must update the company, business unit, and team in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)].

The following image shows an example of this data setup in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)].

![The root business unit is on top, the teams are in the center, and then the companies are at the bottom.](media/cds_bu_team_company.png)

In this configuration, records that are related to the Cronus US company will be owned by a team that is linked to the Cronus US business unit in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)]. Users who can access that business unit through a security role that is set to business unit–level visibility in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] can now see those records. The following example shows how to use teams to provide access to those records.

* The Sales Manager role is assigned to members of the Cronus US Sales team.
* Users who have the Sales Manager role can access account records for members of the same business unit.
* The Cronus US Sales team is linked to the Cronus US business unit that was mentioned earlier. Members of the Cronus US Sales team can see any account that is owned by the Cronus US user, which would have come from the Cronus US company table in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

However, the 1:1 mapping between business unit, company, and team is just a starting point, as shown in the following image.

![The security role controls data visibility.](media/cds_bu_team_company_2.png)

In this example, a new EUR (Europe) root business unit is created in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] as the parent for both Cronus DE (Gernamy) and Cronus ES (Spain). The EUR business unit is not related to synchronization. However, it can give members of the EUR Sales team access to account data in both Cronus DE and Cronus ES by setting the data visibility to **Parent/Child BU** on the associated security role in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)].

Synchronization determines which team should own records. This is controlled by the **Default owning team** field on the BCI row. When a BCI record is enabled for synchronization we automatically create the associated business unit and owner team (if it doesn't already exist), and set the **Default owning team** field. When synchronization is enabled for an table, administrators can change the owning team, but a team must always be assigned.

> [!NOTE]
> Records become read-only after a company is added and saved, so be sure to choose the correct company.

## Choosing a different business unit
You can change the business unit selection if you are using the Teams ownership model. If you use the Person ownership model, the default business unit is always selected. 

If you choose another business unit, for example, one that you created earlier in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)], it will keep its original name. That is, it will not be suffixed with the company ID. We will create a team that does use the naming convention.

When changing a business unit, you can choose only the business units that are one level below the root business unit.

## Person Ownership
If you choose the Person ownership model you must specify each salesperson who will own new records. The business unit and team are created as described in the [Team Ownership](admin-cds-company-concept.md#team-ownership) section.

The default business unit is used when the Person ownership model is chosen, and you cannot choose another business unit. The team that is associated with the default business unit will own records for common tables, such as the Product table, that are not related to specific salespersons.

When you couple salespersons in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to users in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)], [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will add the user to the default team in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)]. You can verify that users are added by looking at the **Default Team Member** column on the **Users - Common Data Service** page. If the user is not added, you can add them manually by using the **Add Coupled Users to Team** action. For more information, see [Synchronizing Data in Business Central with Dataverse](admin-synchronizing-business-central-and-sales.md).

# Multi-language [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] apps for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]

This article describes how to test and use multi-language capabilities in the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] apps for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## Try a [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] app in your language/locale

To try an app in a language, add `language = <culture name>` to the url parameters. For example, this URL shows an app in German:

``` link
https://<your domain>.powerbi.com/groups/a1d27337-134a-4326-99ed-9e68a1485679/reports/3173137b-a485-42e2-a3df-8f3acd7640a6/ReportSection2fa580b0181e8c981cdc?experience=power-bi&language=de-DE
```

## Languages and locales

A culture name is usually a lower-case language identifier and an upper-case locale identifier separated by a hyphen. Here are some examples of culture names:

- **en-US** identifies a user in the United States who speaks English.
- **es-ES** identifies a user in Spain who speaks Spanish.
- **fr-FR** identifies a user in France who speaks French.
- **de-DE** identifies a user in Germany who speaks German.

| language parameter | Language | Locale        |
|--------------------|----------|---------------|
| en-US              | English  | United States |
| es-ES              | Spanish  | Spain         |
| fr-FR              | French   | France        |

# Walkthrough: Selling, Assembling, and Shipping Kits

<!-- [!INCLUDE[complete_sample_data](includes/complete_sample_data.md)]   -->

To support just-in-time inventory and the ability to customize products to customer requests, assembly orders can be automatically created and linked as soon as the sales order line is created. The link between the sales demand and the assembly supply enables sales order processors to customize the assembly item and promise delivery dates according to component availability. In addition, assembly consumption and output are posted automatically with the shipment of the linked sales order.  

Special functionality exists to govern the shipping of assemble-to-order quantities, both in basic and in advanced warehouse configurations. When workers in charge of assembly finish assembling parts or all of the assemble-to-order quantity, they record it in the **Qty. to Ship** field on the warehouse shipment line, in advanced configurations, and then choose **Post Shipment**. The result is that the corresponding assembly output is posted, including the related component consumption, and a sales shipment for the quantity is posted for the linked sales order. This walkthrough illustrates the advanced warehouse process.  

In basic warehouse configurations, when an assemble-to-order quantity is ready to be shipped, the warehouse worker in charge posts an inventory pick for the sales order lines. This creates an inventory movement for the components, posts the assembly output, and the sales order shipment. For more information, see [Handling Assemble-to-Order Items in Inventory Picks](warehouse-how-to-pick-items-with-inventory-picks.md#handling-assemble-to-order-items-with-inventory-picks).  

## About This Walkthrough

This walkthrough demonstrates the following tasks:  

### Setting up Assembly Items

Assembly items are characterized by their replenishment system and the assembly BOM. The item's assembly policy can be either assemble-to-order (ATO) or assemble-to-stock (ATS). This section covers the following tasks:  

-   Setting the appropriate replenishment system and assembly policy on a new assembly item card.  
-   Creating an assembly BOM that lists the assembly components and the resource that go into the assembly item.  

### Selling Customized Assembly Items

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides the flexibility to enter both an inventory quantity and an assemble-to-order quantity on one sales order line. This section covers the following tasks:  

-   Creating a pure ATO sales order line where the full quantity is unavailable and must be assembled before shipment.  
-   Customizing ATO items.  
-   Recalculating the unit price of a customized assembly item.  
-   Creating a mixed sales order line where parts of the sales quantity is provided from inventory and the remaining part must be assembled before shipment.  
-   Understanding ATO availability warnings.  

### Planning for Assembly Items

Assembly demand and supply are handled by the planning system, just like for purchase, transfer, and production. This section covers the following tasks:  

-   Running a regenerative plan for items with sales demand for assembled supply.  
-   Generating an assembly order to fulfill a sales line quantity by the demanded shipment date.  

### Assembling Items

Assembly orders function in a similar way as production orders, expect the consumption and output is recorded and posted directly from the order. When the items are assembled to inventory, the assembly worker has full access to all header and line fields. When the items are assembled to an order where the quantity and date are promised to the customer, then certain fields on the assembly order are not editable. In that case, the assembly posting is performed from the warehouse shipment for the linked sales order. This section covers the following tasks.  

-   Recording and posting assembly consumption and output to inventory.  
-   Accessing a warehouse shipment line from an ATO assembly order to record assembly work.  
-   Accessing an ATO assembly order from a warehouse shipment line to review the automatically entered data.  

### Shipping Assembly Items, from Stock and Assembled to Order

Special functionality exists to govern the shipping of assemble-to-order quantities. This section covers the following tasks:  

-   Creating a warehouse pick for inventory assembly items and for assembly components to be assembled before shipment.  
-   Registering warehouse picks for assembly components and then for assembly items.  
-   Accessing an assembly order from a warehouse shipment to review picked or consumed components.  
-   Shipping assemble-to-order quantities.  
-   Shipping inventory assembly items.  

## Roles

This walkthrough demonstrates tasks that are performed by the following user roles:  

-   Sales Order Processor  
-   Planner  
-   Assembly Worker  
-   Picker  
-   Shipping Responsible

## Story

On January 23, Susan, the sales order processor takes an order from The Device Shop for three units of Kit B, which is an ATO item. All three units are customized and must contain the strong graphics card and an extra RAM block. The disc drives are upgraded to DWD because the CD drives are unavailable. Susan knows that the units can be assembled immediately, and leaves the suggested shipment date of January 23.  

At the same time, the customer orders fifteen units of Kit A with a special request that five units be customized to contain the strong graphics card. Although Kit A is typically an assemble-to-stock item, the order processor combines the sales line quantities to sell ten units from stock and assemble five customized units to the order. The ten units of Kit A are unavailable and must first be supplied to inventory by an assembly order according to the item's assembly policy. Susan learns from the assembly department that Kit A units cannot be completed in the current week. Susan sets the shipment date of the second sales order line, for the mixed ATO and inventory quantity, to January 27 and informs the customer that the 15 units of Kit A will be shipped four days later than the three units of Kit B. To signal to the shipping department that this sales order requires assembly processing, Susan creates the warehouse shipment document from the sales order.  

Eduardo, the planner, runs the planning worksheet and generates an assembly order for ten standard units of Kit A with an internal due date of January 27.  

Sammy, who is responsible for shipping, gets three warehouse shipment lines for the sales order: One line for the three pure ATO units, one line for the five ATO units on the mixed sales order line, and one line for the ten ATS units on the mixed sale order line. Sammy creates a warehouse pick document for all the assembly components that are needed to assemble the total of eight ATO units on the warehouse shipment document.  

John, the picker, retrieves components for all the ATO quantities on the warehouse shipment document and brings them to the assembly area. John enters the quantity to handle and registers the warehouse pick.  

Linda assembles the three ATO units of Kit B. The components are already picked, and Linda does not record output and consumption quantities or post the order, because both of these actions are performed automatically through the related warehouse shipment lines.  

Sammy records the assembled quantity on the warehouse shipment line and posts the shipment of the three units of Kit B. The first line on the sales order is updated as shipped. The linked assembly order remains open until the sales order is fully invoiced. The two warehouse shipment lines, one ATO and one ATS, for Kit A with due dates on January 27 remain open.  

On January 27, Linda processes two assembly orders for Kit A. The first order is the ATO order for five units, which Linda processes differently than the ATO order for Kit B processed on January 23. On this order, Linda is authorized to access the warehouse shipment line herself to record the completed assembly work. The needed components are ready in the assembly department, as they were picked together with components for Kit B.  

The second assembly order is the ATS order for ten units that were created by the planning system. On this ATS order, Linda performs all involved actions from the assembly order. Linda creates a warehouse pick document for the assembly components that are needed to assemble the ten units. When the PCs are assembled, Linda posts the assembly order and thereby signals that the items are available in inventory and can be picked for shipment.  

Sammy creates a warehouse pick document for any quantities that remain before the warehouse shipment can be posted. A pick document is created for the ten units of Kit A that have just finished. The components needed to assemble the five units of Kit A to order where picked on January 23.  

John brings the ten units of Kit A from the warehouse to the specified shipping area, records the quantity to handle, and then registers the pick.  

Sammy packs the ten ATS units with the five ATO units that Linda assembled earlier in the day. Sammy fills in the quantity to ship on both lines and then posts the last shipment for The Device Shop. The related assembly order for five units of Kit A is automatically posted. The second line on the sales order is updated as shipped. Two linked assembly order remains open until the sales order is invoiced and closed.  

When the sales order is later posted as fully invoiced, the sales order and the linked assembly orders are removed.

    Proceed to review the related assembly order.  

9. Select the shipment line for three units of Kit B.  
10. On the **Lines** FastTab, choose **Line**, and then choose **Assemble to Order**. The **Assembly Order** page opens.  

    Notice that several fields on the assembly order are unavailable because the order is linked to a sales order.  

    Notice on the assembly order lines that the **Qty. Picked** field is filled. This is due to the pick that you registered in step 7 in this section.  

11. In the **Quantity to Assemble** field, try to enter any value lower than **3**.  

    Read the error message explaining why this field can only be filled through the **Qty. to Ship** field on the related shipment.  

    The **Quantity to Assemble** field is editable is to support situations where you want to partially ship an inventory quantity instead of assembling more units to the order. For more information, see the "Combination Scenarios" section in [Understanding Assemble to Order and Assemble to Stock](assembly-assemble-to-order-or-assemble-to-stock.md).  

12. Close the **Assembly Order** page to return to the **Warehouse Shipment** page.  
13. On the shipment line for three units of Kit B, in the **Qty. to Ship** field, enter **3**.  
14. Choose the **Post Shipment** action, and then select the **Ship** button.  

    Along with this warehouse shipment posting, the full consumption and output quantities of the related assembly order are posted, and the **Remaining Quantity** field is empty. The sales order line for Kit B is updated to show that the three units are shipped.  

    Warehouse activities to fulfill the first sales order line by January 23 are completed. Next, fulfill the sales order lines that are shipping on January 27  

### Assembling and Recording the Second ATO Quantity  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Assembly Orders**, and then choose the related link.  

    Notice that the ATO order for shipped units of Kit B is still in the list, although the **Remaining Quantity** is empty. This is because the linked sales order is still not fully invoiced.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  In this section, the assembly worker is responsible for recording the completed ATO assembly work on the warehouse shipment line. This workflow may occur in environments where the assembly work is performed in a separate assembly department and assembly workers are authorized to change the warehouse shipment line.  

2.  Open the ATO assembly order for five units of Kit A.  

    Notice that the **Quantity to Assemble** and the **Quantity to Consume** fields are empty because no work is recorded yet.  

    Notice on the assembly order lines that the **Qty. Picked** field is filled. This is due to the pick that was registered on January 23.  

    Next, record that the assembly order is completed.  

3.  Choose the **Asm.-to-Order Whse. Shpt. Line** action.  
4.  On the **Asm.-to-Order Whse. Shpt. Line** page, in the **Qty. to Ship** field, enter **5**, and then close the page.

5.  Close the **Assembly Order** page.  

### Assembling the ATS Quantity  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Assembly Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Open the assembly order for ten units of Kit A.  

    Notice that the **Quantity to Assemble** field is filled with the expected quantity.  

    Next, create a pick document to retrieve the needed components.  

3.  Choose the **Release** action.  
4.  Choose the **Create Whse. Pick** action, and choose the **OK** button.  

    Next, perform the picker's task.  

5.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Picks**, and then choose the related link.  
6.  Open the warehouse pick document that you created in step 4 in this section.  

     Proceed to register the pick without changing the default information.  

7.  Choose the **Autofill Qty. to Handle** action.  
8.  Choose the **Register Pick** action.  

    Return to the assembly order to perform the last assembly task.  

9. In the **Assembly Order**, choose the **Post** action, and then choose the **Yes** button.

    Next, pick any remaining items.  

3.  Choose the **Create Pick** action, and then choose the **OK** button.  

    Next, perform the picker's last task for this warehouse shipment.  

4.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Picks**, and then choose the related link.  
5.  Open the warehouse pick document that you created in step 3 in this section.  

    Notice that this pick document is for assembly item, not for assembly components.  

    Next, register the pick without changing the default information.  

6.  Choose the **Autofill Qty. to Handle** action.  
7.  Choose the **Register Pick** action, and then choose the **Yes** button.  

    Return to the warehouse shipment to perform the last task.

# Set up invoice rounding

If you need to round invoice amounts when you create invoices, you can use the automatic rounding function. When an invoice is rounded, an extra line is added with the rounding amount and posted with the other invoice lines.

> [!NOTE]  
> Local regulations or local custom might require that you to round invoice amounts in a specific way. For example, to an amount divisible by 0.05.  

To use automatic invoice rounding, you must:  

* Specify the general ledger accounts to which rounding differences are posted.  
* Set up rules for rounding invoices in local currency and in foreign currency.  
* Activate the function.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  In addition to the invoice rounding features, you can round amounts on invoices by the unit-amount rounding feature and the amount rounding feature.  

## Set up general ledger accounts for invoice rounding differences

To use automatic invoice rounding, you must set up the general ledger account or accounts where rounding differences are posted. Before you can do so, you must set up VAT product posting groups. For more information, see [Set up VAT](finance-setup-vat.md).  

### To set up general ledger accounts for invoice rounding differences  
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Chart of Accounts**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Chart of Accounts** page, set up the account and name it **Invoice Rounding** or something similar. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses the account name as text for invoices that are rounded.  
3. Depending on whether you use VAT or sales tax, in the **Tax Prod. Posting Group** or **VAT Prod. Posting Group** fields, choose a posting group for rounded amounts. You might want to set up a new group code to use for invoice rounding.
4. Leave the **Gen. Posting Type**, and either the **Tax Bus. Posting Group** or **VAT Bus. Posting Group** fields blank. <!-- Why do we say to leave these blank, when there are a lot of other fields we also leave blank but don't mention? -->  

Now you can assign the invoice rounding account to posting groups on the **Vendor Posting Groups** page.  <!-- Why only the vendor posting groups? -->

## Set up rounding for foreign and local currencies
Before you can use the automatic invoice rounding function, you must set up rounding rules for foreign and local currencies.

### To set up rounding for foreign currencies  
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Currencies**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Currencies** page, choose the foreign currency to open the **Currency Card**, and then fill in the **Amount Rounding Precision**, **Unit-Amount Rounding Precision**, **Invoice Rounding Precision** and **Invoice Rounding Type** fields.

### To set up rounding for your local currency
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Ledger Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **General Ledger Setup** page, on the **General** FastTab, fill in the **Inv. Rounding Precision** and **Inv. Rounding Type** fields.  

## Activate the invoice rounding function  
To ensure that sales and purchase invoices are rounded automatically, you must activate the invoice rounding function. You activate invoice rounding separately for sales and purchase invoices.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales & Receivables Setup** or **Purchases & Payables Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **General** FastTab, choose the **Invoice Rounding** check box.

# Find Posted Documents without Incoming Document Records

From the **Chart of Accounts** and **General Ledger Entries** pages, you can use a search function to find general ledger entries for posted purchase and sales documents that don't have incoming document records and then centrally link to existing records or create new ones with attached document files.

## To find posted documents without incoming document records

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Chart of Accounts**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select a line for a G/L account for whose general ledger entries you want to see posted purchase and sales documents without incoming document records, and then choose the **Posted Documents without Incoming Document** action.
3. Alternatively, choose the **Ledger Entries** action.
4. On the **General Ledger Entries** page, choose the **Posted Documents without Incoming Documents** action.

The **Posted Documents without Incoming Document** page opens showing posted purchase and sales documents without incoming document records represented by general ledger entries on the G/L account that you opened the page for. The page can show a maximum of 1000 lines. By default, the **Date Filter** field therefore contains a filter that limits the lines to entries with posting dates from the beginning of the accounting period to the work date.

## To connect found documents to existing incoming document records

1. On the **Posted Documents without Incoming Document** page, select the line for a posted document that you want to connect to an existing incoming document record, and then choose the **Select Incoming Document** action.
2. On the **Incoming Documents** page, select the incoming document record that you want to connect to posted document found, and then choose the **OK** button.
3. On the **Posted Documents without Incoming Document** page, the selected incoming document record is now connected to the posted document, as you can see in the **Incoming Document Files** FactBox.

If a relevant incoming document record doesn't exist on the **Incoming Documents** page, then you can create it. For more information, see [Create Incoming Document Records](across-how-create-income-document-records.md).

## Create a sales order  

When you sell something to a customer, you have two options. The first, and simplest, is to just create a sales invoice. However, if your sales process is more complex, for example if you have situations where you only ship parts of an order quantity, you use a sales order.

### To create a sales order  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 10.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Orders**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select **New** to create a new entry.
3. In the **Customer** field, enter the name of an existing customer.

    Other fields on the **Sales Order** page are now filled with the standard information of the selected customer.  

4. Fill in the remaining fields on the **Sales Order** page as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

5. On the **Lines** FastTab, in the **Type** field, select what type of product, charge, or transaction that you will post for the customer with the sales line.

6. In the **No.** field, enter the number of an inventory item or service.

7. In the **Quantity** field, enter the number of items to be sold.

8. In the **Line Discount %** field, enter a percentage if you want to grant the customer a discount on the product.

9. To add a comment about the order line that the customer can see on the printed sales order, write a comment in the **Description** field on an empty line.

10. Repeat steps 5 through 9 for every item that you want to sell to the customer.

11. To only ship a part of the order quantity, enter that quantity in the **Qty. to Ship** field. The value is copied to the **Qty. to Invoice** field.

12. To only invoice a part of the shipped quantity, enter that quantity in the **Qty. to Invoice** field. The quantity must be lower than the value in the **Qty. to Ship** field.

13. When the sales order lines are completed, choose the **Post and Send** action.

For more information and additional things you can do when creating customer sales orders, see [Sell Products with a Customer Sales Order](sales-how-sell-products.md).  

## Create a sales invoice

When you create and post a sales invoice, you not only create the invoice document you send to the customer, you also create the related quantity and value entries in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

### To create and post a sales invoice  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 20.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Invoices**, and then choose the related link.  

2. Select **New** to create a new entry.

3. In the **Customer** field, enter the name of an existing customer.

4. Fill in the remaining fields on the **Sales Invoice** page as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

5. On the **Lines** FastTab, in the **Type** field, select what type of product, charge, or transaction that you will post for the customer with the sales line.

6. In the **No.** field, select a record to post according to the value in the **Type** field.

7. In the **Quantity** field, enter how many units of the product, charge, or transaction that the line will record for the customer.  

8. If you want to give a discount, enter a percentage in the **Line Discount %** field. The value in the **Line Amount** field updates accordingly.  

9. Repeat steps 5 through 8 for every product or charge that you want to invoice the customer for.  

10. In the **Invoice Discount Amount** field, enter an amount that should be deducted from the value shown in the **Total Incl. Tax** field.

11. When the sales invoice lines are completed, choose the **Post and Send** action.

# Set up cost accounting

Before you start working with cost accounting, you must perform setup tasks.

## Balances between Cost Type, Cost Center, and Cost Object

When you set up cost accounting, you must make sure that all entries are assigned to a cost type as well as a cost center or a cost object. The means that each cost entry must have a cost type assigned and a cost center code or a cost object assigned. This rule ensures that each cost entry appears in either the cost centers or the cost objects, but never in both places.  

By doing this, you create the following accounting equation:  

*Cost Type Balance* = *Cost Center Balance* + *Cost Object Balance*  

When you print the chart of cost type, the chart of cost centers, and the chart of cost objects reports, you can analyze this relationship.

## Set up Cost Types

The chart of cost types is similar to the chart of accounts in the general ledger. You can set up the chart of cost types in the following ways:  

- Structure the chart of cost types similar to the income statement accounts in the general ledger chart of accounts. Then, you can transfer the general ledger chart of accounts to the chart of cost types. You can make any necessary adjustments after the transfer.  
- Create new chart of cost types or add new cost types to existing chart of cost types. You must create each new cost type individually.  

### To transfer the general ledger chart of accounts to the chart of cost types

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Chart of Cost Types**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **Get Cost Types from Chart of Accounts** action. In the dialog box, choose the **Yes** button to confirm the transfer. The function uses the chart of accounts to create a chart of cost types.  

    The chart of cost types now contain all income statement accounts in the general ledger and include headings and subtotals. You can change the chart of cost types, as necessary. For example, you can delete duplicate existing cost types.  

    > [!IMPORTANT]  
    >  The **Register Cost Types in Chart of Accounts** function updates the relationship between the chart of accounts and the chart of cost types. The **No.** field is filled and verified to make sure that each general ledger account is related to only one cost type. The function runs automatically before transferring general ledger entries to cost accounting.  

### To set up new cost types in the Chart of Cost Types page

1. Open the **Chart of Cost Types** page in edit mode.  
2. Fill in the fields as described as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  You can set up and maintain cost types in either the **Cost Type Card** page or on the **Chart of Cost Types** page. In this procedure, you set up cost types on the **Chart of Cost Types** page.

3. After you have created all cost types, choose the **Indent Cost Types** action. In the dialog box, choose the **Yes** button.  
4. Link the new cost type to the corresponding general ledger account.  

    > [!IMPORTANT]  
    >  If you have entered definitions in the **Totaling** fields for the line type of **End-Total** before you run the **Indent Cost Types** function, then you must enter the definitions again because the function overwrites the values in all **End-Total** fields.  

### To update cost types

1. On the **Cost Accounting Setup** page, select if you want the chart of cost types to be automatically updated when the chart of accounts is changed.  
2. In the **Align G/L Account** field, you can choose from the following options.  

- **No Alignment** - There is no corresponding change in the chart of cost types when you change the chart of accounts.  
- **Automatic** - A corresponding change is made in the chart of cost types when you change the chart of accounts.  
- **Prompt** - A message is displayed asking if you want to make a corresponding change in the chart of cost types when you change the chart of accounts.

## Defining the Relationship Between Cost Types and General Ledger Accounts

The relationship between the cost type and the general ledger account is created in the cost type and in the general ledger account.  

- The **G/L Account Range** field in the **Cost Type** table establishes which general ledger accounts belong to a cost type.  
- The **Cost Type No.** field in the chart of accounts establishes which cost type a general ledger account belongs to.  

These two fields are filled automatically when you use the **Get Cost Types from Chart of Accounts** function.  

### Relationship Between General Ledger Accounts and Cost Types

There is an n:1 relationship between general ledger accounts and cost types. Several general ledger accounts can belong to one cost type, but each general ledger account belongs to only one cost type. The following table describes the details in the relationship.  

|Relationship|**G/L Account Range**|**Cost Type No.**|  
|------------------|------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|  
|One general ledger account for each cost type|One general ledger account|One cost type|  
|Several general ledger accounts for one cost type|General ledger account range, for example, 7110..7193 for each general ledger account|For each general ledger account in the range, there is only one cost type|  
|Cost types without corresponding general ledger accounts|\<Empty\>||  
|General ledger accounts whose entries will not be transferred||\<Empty\>|  

### Cost Types Without a Relationship to the General Ledger

A cost type may not have a relationship to general ledger accounts if one of the following conditions is true:  

- Accounts for operational accounting, such as Calc. Interest and Depreciation, only take costs from the operational accounting.  
- Helping cost types, such as cost types 9901, 9902, and 9903 in the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] database, are used as credit and debit accounts for allocations.  
- The helping account, 9920 in the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] database, contains actual accruals that show the difference between costs and the expense from the general ledger.

## Setting Up Cost Centers

Cost centers are departments that are responsible for costs and income. The chart of cost centers is similar to the dimension information for the general ledger. You can set up the chart of cost centers in the following ways:  

- Transfer dimension values in the general ledger to the chart of cost centers. You can make any necessary adjustments after the transfer.  
- Create a new chart of cost center that is independent of the general ledger or add a new cost center to an existing chart of cost center. You must create each cost center individually.  

### To transfer dimension values in the general ledger to the chart of cost centers

1. Set up a dimension to be the cost center dimension on the **Cost Accounting Setup** page. Only the values from this dimension are transferred.
You can choose **Update Cost Acctg. Dimensions** action to update cost accounting dimensions.
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 2.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Chart of Cost Centers**, and then choose the related link.  
1. On the **Actions** tab, in the **Functions** group, choose **Get Cost Centers from Dimension** to transfer dimension values to the chart of cost centers. The function transfers the dimension values that you defined in step 1.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  You can set up the **Align Cost Center Dimension**  field to define a one-way synchronization of dimension values from the general ledger to the chart of cost centers. You cannot define a synchronization of the chart of cost centers to dimension values from the general ledger.  

The chart of cost centers now contains all specified dimension values from the general ledger and includes titles and subtotals.  

### To create new cost centers in the Chart of Cost Centers page

You can set up and maintain cost centers in either the **Cost Center Card** card or on the **Chart of Cost Centers** page. In this procedure, you set up cost centers on the **Chart of Cost Centers** page.  

1. Open the **Chart of Cost Centers** page in edit mode.  
2. In the **Code** field, enter the cost center code. All cost centers must have a code.  
3. In the **Name** field, enter the cost center name.  
4. Choose the drop-down arrow in the **Line Type** field to specify the purpose of the cost center.  

    - For cost centers of the **Total** type, you must fill in the **Totaling** field. Use the **or** operator, which is a vertical line (**&#124;**) to set ranges of cost centers.  
    - For cost centers of the **End-Total** line type, this field is filled in automatically when you use the indent function.  
5. Fill in the **Sorting Order** and **Cost Subtype** fields.  
6. Choose the next empty line to create a new cost center, and then repeat steps 2 through 5.  
7. After you have set up all the cost centers, choose the **Indent Cost Centers** action. Choose the **Yes** button.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> If you have entered definitions in the **Totaling** fields for **End-Total** cost centers before you run the indent function, then you must enter them again. The function overwrites the values in all **End-Total** fields.

## Setting Up Cost Objects

Cost objects are projects, products, or services of a company. The chart of cost objects is similar to the dimension information for the general ledger. You can set up the chart of cost objects in the following ways:  

* Transfer dimension values in the general ledger to the chart of cost objects. You can make any necessary adjustments after the transfer.  
* Create a new chart of cost object that is independent of the general ledger or add a new cost object to an existing chart of cost objects. You must create each cost object individually.  

### To transfer dimension values from the general ledger to the chart of cost objects

1.  Set a dimension to be the cost object dimension on the **Update CA Dimensions** page. Only the values from this dimension are transferred.  
2.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 3.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Chart of Cost Objects**, and then choose the related link.  
3.  Choose the **Get Cost Objects from Dimension** action to transfer dimension values to the chart of cost objects. The function transfers the dimension values that you defined in step 1.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  You can set up the **Align Cost Object Dimension**  field to define a one-way synchronization of dimension values from the general ledger to the chart of cost objects. You cannot define a synchronization of the chart of cost objects to dimension values from the general ledger.  

The chart of cost objects now contains all specified dimension values from the general ledger and includes titles and subtotals.  

### To create new cost objects in the Chart of Cost Objects page

You can set up and maintain cost objects in either the **Cost Object Card** card or on the **Chart of Cost Objects** page. In this procedure, you set up cost objects on the **Chart of Cost Objects** page.  

1.  Open the **Chart of Cost Objects** page in edit mode.  
2.  In the **Code** field, enter the cost object code. All cost objects must have a code.  
3.  In the **Name** field, enter the cost object name.  
4.  Choose the drop-down arrow in the **Line Type** field to specify the purpose of the cost object.  

    * For cost objects of the **Total** line type, fill in the **Total From/To** field. Use the **or** operator, which is a vertical line (**&#124;**), to set ranges of cost objects.  
    * For cost objects of the **End-Total** line type, this field is filled in automatically when you use  the indent function.  
5.  Fill in the **Sorting Order** field.  
6.  Chose the next empty line to create a new cost object, and then repeat steps 2 through 5.  
7.  After you have set up all the cost objects, choose the **Indent Cost Objects** action. Choose the **Yes** button.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  If you have entered definitions in the **Total From/To** fields for **End-Total** cost objects before you run the indent function, then you must enter them again. The function overwrites the values in all **End-Total** fields.

## Defining Cost Centers and Cost Objects for Chart of Accounts

You can automatically transfer the expense and income entries from the general ledger to cost accounting either for each general ledger posting or with a batch job. When you do the transfer, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] only transfers the entries that are already linked to a cost center or a cost object. To establish a meaningful transfer, you must ensure that the cost centers and cost objects are correctly defined.  

### Defining Default Dimension Values for General Ledger Accounts

For each general ledger account, you can define default dimension values in the **Default Dimension** table. The following example shows how to define that there should always be a DEPARTMENT cost center, but never be a PROJECT cost object when posting to a general ledger account.  

|**Dimension Code**|**Value Posting**|  
|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|  
|Department|Code Mandatory|  
|Project|No Code|  

### Defining Dimension Values for Overhead Costs and Direct Costs

 You can transfer overhead costs to a cost center and direct costs to a cost object. The following table shows the optimal combination of the dimension setup values.  

|Transfer To|Cost Center Posting|Cost Object Posting|  
|-----------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|  
|Cost Center|Code Mandatory|No Code|  
|Cost Object|No Code|Code Mandatory|  

> [!NOTE]  
>  To make sure that the predefined cost center and cost object that you set up in the general ledger are automatically carried over to cost accounting, select the **Check G/L Postings** check box on the **Cost Accounting Setup** page.

# Incoming documents

External business documents can come into your company as an email attachment or a paper copy that you scan to file. This scenario is typical of purchases, where such incoming document files represent payment receipts for expenses or small purchases.

On the **Incoming Documents** page, you can use different functions to review expense receipts, manage OCR tasks, and convert incoming document files, manually or automatically, to the relevant documents or journal lines. The external files can be attached at any process stage, including to posted documents and to the resulting vendor, customer, and general ledger entries.

## Usage scenario

You can register files or paper copies received from your trading partners in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and create a document record. For example, a purchase or sales invoice, credit memo or a journal line.

Upload the received files, or use your device's camera to take a photo, and create entries to represent the external documents. Optionally, with PDF or image files, you can have an external optical character recognition (OCR) service generate electronic documents that can then be converted to records inside [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

> [!NOTE]
> The OCR feature is provided by external providers. Choose a service package that is appropriate for your organization and/or country/region. Find services compatible with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and details on available features at [AppSource.microsoft.com](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2081646).

For example, when you receive an invoice in PDF format from your vendor, you can send it to the OCR service from the **Incoming Documents** page. Alternatively, some OCR providers offer the option of processing files forwarded to a dedicated email address, which then automatically creates a related incoming document record. After some seconds, you receive the file back from the OCR service as an electronic invoice that can be converted to a purchase invoice for the vendor.

> [!TIP]
> Create incoming document records in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] directly from emails sent by vendors using the Outlook add-in. To learn more, go to [Use Business Central as your Business Inbox in Outlook](work-outlook-addin.md).

## Incoming document features

The incoming document process can consist of the following main activities:

* Record the external documents in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] by creating lines on the **Incoming Documents** page in the following ways:
  * Manually, either from a PC or from a mobile device, in one of the following ways:
    * Use the **Create from File** button, upload a file, and then fill the relevant fields on the **Incoming Document** page.
    * Use the **New** button, fill the relevant fields on the **Incoming Document** page and manually attach the related file.
    * From a tablet or phone, use the **Create from Camera** button to create a new incoming document record using the device's built-in camera.

      > [!NOTE]
      > To use a mobile phone, you must install the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] mobile app. The app is available on the App Store and on Google Play. To learn more, go to [Getting Business Central on your mobile device](install-mobile-app.md).

  * Automatically, by receiving the document from the OCR service as an electronic document after you've uploaded or emailed the related PDF or image file to an OCR service. The **Financial Information** FastTab is automatically filled on the **Incoming Document** page.
* Use an external OCR service to have PDF or image files turned into electronic documents that can be converted to document records in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].
* Create new documents or general journal lines for incoming document records by entering the information as you read it from incoming document files.
* Attach incoming document files to purchase and sales documents of any status, including to the vendor, customer, and general ledger entries that result from posting.
* View incoming document records and their attachments from any purchase and sales document or entry, or find all general ledger entries without incoming document records from the **Chart of Accounts** page.

> [!NOTE]
> Files attached to cards and documents on the **Attachments** tab aren't included on the **Incoming Documents** page. To learn more, go to [Manage Attachments, Links, and Notes on Cards and Documents](ui-how-add-link-to-record.md).

# Frequently asked questions about the Power BI apps in Business Central

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

This article provides answers to frequently asked questions (FAQs) about the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] apps for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## What [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] licenses do I need?

To use the Power BI apps, you need [!INCLUDE [powerbi-pro-license-name](includes/powerbi-pro-license-name.md)] licenses for the following users:

- Users who install the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] template apps.
- Users who refresh the report data.
- Users who access the reports.

Alternatively, you can use [!INCLUDE [powerbi-premium-capacity-name](includes/powerbi-premium-capacity-name.md)].

To learn more, go to [Installing Power BI apps for Business Central (prerequisites)](across-powerbi-install-business-central-apps.md#prerequisites).

## Why do I need [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] licenses?

You must have [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] licenses for the following reasons:

1. You must install [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] template apps from Microsoft AppSource.
2. You must share a [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] workspace.

The use of free license alternative for [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] allows you to embed your own reports. Anything in the free [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] license must be present in your personal [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] workspace. So, the free license alternative does not work with the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] apps.

## Can I install the same app multiple times for different companies or environments?

Yes. Just rename the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] workspace after installing the app.

To learn more, see [Rename a [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] workspace](/power-bi/create-reports/service-rename#rename-a-workspace).

## Can I use the same app to do reporting across multiple companies or environments?

No. [!INCLUDE [powerbi-apps-per-company-include](includes/powerbi-apps-per-company-include.md)]

## How do I refresh the data in an app?

To learn more, go to [Get the latest data (refresh the semantic model)](./across-powerbi-install-business-central-apps.md#get-the-latest-data-refresh-the-semantic-model).

## My semantic model does not refresh. How do I see what is wrong?

[!INCLUDE [powerbi-refresh-tsg-include](includes/powerbi-refresh-tsg-include.md)]

## I can't see any dimension data in my reports

Check whether the job queue entry for updating dimension set data is stopped.

To learn more, go to [Job queue entry for updating dimension set entries](across-powerbi-install-business-central-apps.md#job-queue-entry-for-updating-dimension-set-entries).

## How do I change the connection parameters for an app?

To learn more, go to [Connect the Power BI semantic models to Business Central](across-powerbi-install-business-central-apps.md#connect-the-power-bi-semantic-models-to-business-central).

## How do I update an app?

To learn more, go to [Updating a Power BI app](across-powerbi-install-business-central-apps.md#updating-a-power-bi-app).

## Can I get a copy of the source code (.pbix files) for the apps?

No. At the moment, the source code (.pbix files) for the apps isn't available. However, its availability might change in a later release.

## Are the apps available for on-premises installations?

No. At the moment, the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] apps are only available for online environments.

# Set Up Pricing and Additional Costs for Services
You can use the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] pricing features to set up and customize your application so that you apply and adjust pricing on service items, repairs, and orders. These pricing decisions are then easily transmitted to the invoicing process.  
  
As your implementation requires, you can set up pricing groups and map them to specific time periods, customers, or currency. You can set up fixed, minimum, or maximum pricing, depending on the service contracts that you have with customers. Finally, as you adjust your prices, you can view and approve the changes before committing them to the ledger.  

## To set up a service price group
You can set up groups containing service items that you want to receive the same special service pricing. You assign service price groups to service items on service item lines. You can also assign service price groups to service item groups.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Price Groups**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Create a new service price group.  
3. Fill in the **Code** and **Description** fields.  
4. Choose the **Setup** action.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  

 > [!Tip]
 > The **Adjustment Type** and **Amount** fields work together to specify whether an adjustment concerns a fixed amount, or applies only when the total service price exceeds or is lower than the amount in the **Amount** field.  

## To set up a service price adjustment group  
You can set up price adjustment groups to adjust service pricing of service items. For example, you can set up price adjustment groups that adjust price of freight or spare parts.  
  
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Price Adjustment Groups**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Create a new service price adjustment group.  
3. Fill in the **Code** and **Description** fields.  
4. In the **Type** field, enter the type of the entry that you want to adjust.  
  
    * To adjust only one specific entry, enter the number of this entry in the **No.** field. When you leave this field blank, your adjustment group will adjust all entries of the type defined in the **Type** field.  
    * To adjust service prices related to only one specific service, fill in the **Work Type** field. When you leave this field blank, it will just be ignored.  
  
5. In the **Description** field, enter a short description of the service price adjustment.  
6. To adjust service prices related to only one specific general product posting group, fill in the **Gen. Prod. Posting Group** field.

> [!Tip]
> You can choose **Details** to add additional information about the adjustment group. For example, you can specify which item belongs to the service price adjustment group, and whether this is an item, a resource, a resource group, or a service charge.  

## To set up additional costs for services
When you work with service items and service orders, you may need to register additional costs, such as travel costs to particular service zones or starting fees. When you create a service order, you can insert these costs and a line with the type **Cost** will be added to the order. Alternatively, if you want to apply the cost to all service orders, you can set up a default cost. For example, if you always want to apply a starting fee.
  
### To set up service costs
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Costs**, and then choose the related link. 
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  

### To specify a default cost for service orders
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Setup**, and then choose the related link. 
2. In the **Service Order Starting Fee** field, choose the appropriate service cost.

# Consolidate Balances for a Company that is a Customer and a Vendor
A company that you do business with might be both a customer and a vendor. When that's the case, you can avoid making unnecessary payments or receipts, and perhaps save on transaction fees, by consolidating the company's customer and vendor balances. Consolidation compares the company's balances as a vendor and as a customer, and then nets the amount so that that either the customer or vendor balance remains, depending on which amount was higher. 

To consolidate the balances, you must first link the customer and vendor companies through a contact that has the type **Company**. A customer or vendor can only have one contact of the type **Company**. For more information, see [Create Contacts](marketing-create-contact-companies.md).

After you link the companies, the **Customer Card** page offers the **Balance as Vendor** field, and the **Vendor Card** page includes the **Balance as Customer** field.

Though it's not a requirement, the customer and vendor companies are typically the same legal entity. 

## Before you start
Before you consolidate balances, specify a few settings on the **Marketing Setup** page. 

* On the **Interactions** FastTab, you must specify business relation codes in the **Customers** and **Vendors** fields. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses this information to determine the type of relation to display for contacts. 
* Optional: On the **Duplicates** FastTab, turn duplicate search on or off. By default, duplicate search is turned on. For more information, see [Handling duplicates](#handling-duplicates). 

## Link an existing customer and vendor company through a contact
The following steps describe how to link a customer and a vendor through a contact.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customer** or **Vendor**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the customer or vendor, and then choose the **Contact** action.   
3. Choose the contact, and then choose the **Link with existing** action.
4. Choose the type of entity to create a business relation with.
5. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

## Create a vendor from a customer, or vice versa
You can create a new vendor from an existing customer, or a new customer from a vendor. From the **Customer** or **Vendor** pages, open the **Contact** page. Choose the **Create as** action, and then either the **Customer** or **Vendor** options. 

## Create a new customer or vendor and link them through a vendor or customer contact
1. Create a new customer or vendor. For more information, see [Register New Customers](sales-how-register-new-customers.md).
2. After you set up the customer or vendor, choose the **Create** action, and then choose either the **Customer** or **Vendor** options. 

## To consolidate the customer and vendor balances for a contact company
On the **Payment Journal** page, use the **Net Customer/Vendor Balances** action to consolidate the customer and vendor balances into a single net amount. The action creates, but doesn't post, payment journal lines that contain the net balances.

> [!NOTE]
> If the customer or vendor balances contain amounts that are in different currencies, a line is created for the amount in each currency.

## Handling duplicates
If you turn on duplicate search on the **Duplicates** FastTab on the **Marketing Setup** page, a warning will display when you change the values of fields that are part of the setup for duplicate search strings. When a duplicate is found, you can take the following actions:

* Combine the duplicate contacts into a single contact that is the same for both the customer and vendor by using the **Merge With** capability on the **Contact Card** page. Typically, merging contacts is done only when the customer and vendor are the same legal entity. For more information, see [Merge Duplicate Records](sales-how-merge-duplicate-records.md). 
* Delete the vendor business relation for the vendor or customer contact, and then use the **Link to Existing** action to link to a different contact.

# Create projects

When you start a new project, you must create a project card with integrated project tasks and project planning lines, structured in two layers.  

The first layer consists of project tasks. You must create at least one project task per project because all posting refers to a project task. Having at least one project task in your project enables you to set up project planning lines and to post consumption to the project.

The second layer consists of project planning lines, which specify the detailed use of resources, items and various general ledger expenses.

The layer structure enables you to divide the project into smaller tasks, and therefore use more specific details in budgeting, quotes, and registration. In addition, it gives you insight into how a project is progressing. For example, you can track whether you're meeting designated milestones or if you're on target to meet budget expectations.

> [!TIP]
> Choose the **New Project** action on the **Project Manager** Role Center to launch an assisted setup guide that takes you through the steps of creating a project with integrated tasks and planning lines. The following procedure describes how to perform the steps manually. <!-- For an example of how to create a project manually, go to [Video: How to create a project in Dynamics 365 Business Central](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqaPWr7BWmw).-->

## To create a project card

You create a project card and then create project task lines and project planning lines for it.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Projects**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action, and then fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
3. To base the project on information from another project, choose the **Copy Project** action, fill in the fields as necessary, and then choose the **OK** button.

> [!NOTE]  
> If you're using time sheets with your project, you must also designate a person responsible. This person can approve time sheets for the employee tasks associated with the project. For more information, see [Set Up Time Sheets](projects-how-setup-time-sheets.md).

> [!NOTE]  
> The **Apply Usage Link** toggle indicates whether project ledger entries are linked to project planning lines. The **Apply Usage Link** toggle also activates warehouse handling, planning, assembly-to-order, item tracking, and reservation capabilities for a project.

Optionally, mark actions on project as blocked using the **Blocked** field. The following table describes the effect of the options for this field.

## To create tasks for a project

A key part of creating a project is to specify the various tasks involved in the project. You specify tasks by creating one line per task on the **Tasks** FastTab on the **Project Card** page. Every project must have at least one task.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Projects**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the project card for a relevant project.
3. On the **Tasks** FastTab, fill in the fields as necessary on a new line.
4. To indent tasks and create a hierarchy, Choose the **Tasks** action, the then choose **Indent Project Tasks** action.
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 for all the tasks that you need for the project.
6. To specify the project tasks with information on other project tasks, choose the **Copy Project Tasks from** action, fill in the fields as necessary, and then choose the **OK** button.

## Invoice one or more customers for project tasks

Sometimes the party that is receiving a service is different from the party that pays the bill. Also, sometimes you might need to invoice multiple customers for tasks in the project. On the **Project Card** page, use the **Task Billing Method** field to specify whether you're billing one customer, or multiple customers.

If the customer who is receiving the service also pays the bill, in the **Bill-to** and **Ship-to** fields, choose **Default (Customer)** and **Default (Sell-to Address)**.

If you're billing multiple customers, you can specify the customer who receives the service and the customer to invoice for each task in the project. You can also provide the following information:

* Select the ship-to address for the customer where the work happens.
* Add information about external references to simplify communication about the project.
* Overwrite the standard financial terms of the project.

## Specify a default location for project items

You can save time on data entry by specifying a default location and bin for projects on the **Project Card** page. When you create tasks, project planning lines, and project journal lines for the project, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] assigns the default location. You can, however, change the location code and bin on tasks and lines if needed.

If you define a **To-Project Bin Code** on the location, the bin code is populated when you select the location code. If your warehouse flow requires warehouse picks, you can also define other bins from which to consume items.

These fields are the defaults when you create project tasks. Existing project tasks don't change.

There are a few things to know about using default locations:

* For project tasks, if you define a **To-Project Bin Code** on the location, the bin code is assigned when you select the location code. If your warehouse flow requires warehouse picks, you can also define other bins from which to consume items.
* For project planning lines, the **Location Code** is based on the value selected on the project planning line when you select an item. If a bin code isn't defined for the project task, the bin from the default bin content is selected. You can change both values manually.
* For project journal lines, the **Location Code** is based on the value selected on the job journal line when you select an item. If a bin code isn't defined for the project task, the bin from default bin content is selected. You can change both values manually.

> [!NOTE]
> The processes businesses use to pick items in their warehouses differ, depending on whether they use basic or advanced warehouse configurations. To learn more about the options for warehouse configuration, go to [Overview of different configuration options](design-details-warehouse-management.md#overview-of-different-configuration-options).

## To create planning lines for a project

You can refine your new project tasks on project planning lines. A planning line can capture the information that you want to track for a project. For example, you can track the resources the project requires, or the items that are needed. For example, you have a task to get a customer to approve a project. You associate the task with planning lines for items such as meeting the customer and assigning a resource.  

A project planning line can have one of the types described in the following table.  

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Budget** |Provides estimated usage and costs for the project, typically in a time and materials type project. You can't invoice planning lines of this type. |
| **Billable** |Provides estimated invoicing to the customer, typically in a fixed price project. |
| **Both Budget and Billable** |Provides budgeted usage equal to what you want to invoice. |

> [!NOTE]
> While you enter information on project planning lines, cost information is automatically filled in. For example, the cost, price, and discount for resources and items are based on information from the resource and item.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Projects**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open a relevant project card.
3. Select a project task for which the **Project Task Type** field contains **Posting**, and then choose the **Project Planning Lines** action.  
4. On the **Project Planning Lines** page, on a new line, fill in the fields as necessary.
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 for all planning lines that you need for the project task.

> [!TIP]
> If the line is for an item, you can use the **Item Availability by** action to explore the item's availability by location, event, or period.

## Avoid document number errors when you post project journals

If you use a number series for project journal batches, you can't post the journal if the document numbers aren't consecutive. If needed, you can correct the order of document numbers when you post project journals.

On the **Project Journals** page, the **Document No.** field is editable so that you can specify different document numbers for different journal lines, or the same document number for related journal lines.

If a number series is specified in the **No. Series** field on the project journal batch, document numbers for individual or grouped lines must be sequential when you post a project journal. If they aren't, you can't post the journal. To avoid getting stuck, use the **Renumber Document Numbers** action on the **Project Journals** page before you post the journal. If you group journal lines by document number before you use the action, they stay grouped but might be assigned a different document number.

> [!TIP]
> The **Renumber Document Numbers** action also works on filtered views.

# Set up projects, prices, and project posting groups

As a project manager, you can set up each of the projects that you manage in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Use the **Project Setup** page to define how you'll use project features.

For each project, specify various information:

* Prices for project items
* Project resources
* Project G/L accounts
* Project posting groups (required)

## To set general information for projects

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Project Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> The **Apply Usage Link by Default** toggle on the **Projects Setup** page indicates whether project ledger entries are linked to project planning lines by default. Turn on the toggle to apply this setting to all new projects. You can enable or disable project usage tracking for a specific project by turning the **Apply Usage Link** toggle on or off on the **Project Card** page. The **Apply Usage Link** toggle also activates warehouse handling, planning, assembly-to-order, item tracking, and reservation capabilities for project.

### To set up project usage tracking

When you're working on a project, you might want to know how your usage is tracking against your plan. To explore usage, you can create a link between your project planning lines and the actual usage. The link lets you track your costs and understand how much work remains. By default, the project planning line type is **Budget**, but using the line type **Both Budget and Billable** has similar effects.

After you set up usage tracking by turning on the **Apply Usage Link by Default** toggle, you can review information on the project planning line. For example, you can set the quantity of the resource, item, or general ledger account. You can also set the quantity to transfer to the project journal. The **Remaining Quantity** field on the project planning line shows what remains to transfer and post to the project journal.

>[!NOTE]
> If the **Apply Usage Link** is chosen on the project, and the **Line Type** field on the project journal line or purchase line is **Billable**, new project planning lines of the line type **Both Budget and Billable** are created when you post the project journal or purchase document.  
>
> For more information, see [Record Usage for Projects](projects-how-record-job-usage.md) and [Manage Project Supplies](projects-how-manage-project-supplies.md)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you don't specify a value in the **Line Type** field on the project journal line or purchase line, project planning lines aren't created when you post the project journal or purchase document.

### Invoice multiple customers for project tasks

When projects involve multiple customers, billing the right customers for the right tasks can be challenging. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] makes billing less complex by letting you specify the bill-to and sell-to customers on each project task line, so you can automatically generate invoices for the correct customers.  Use the **Default Task Billing Method** field to specify whether you're billing one customer, or multiple customers by default. You can change task billing method for a specific project by using the **Task Billing Method** field on the **Project Card** page. To learn more about invoicing multiple customers, go to [Invoice one or more customers for project tasks](projects-how-create-jobs.md#invoice-one-or-more-customers-for-project-tasks).

### Synchronize the cost of used items

The cost of an item (inventory value) that you purchase and later use in project might change during its lifetime. For example, because a freight cost is added to its purchase cost after you post the usage of the item.

In [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can manually or automatically adjust item costs. The adjustment is reflected in the value entries and general ledger. To learn more, go to [Managing Inventory Cost](finance-manage-inventory-costs.md)

In relation to projects, you also have options for how to reflect those adjustments.

To ensure that cost changes automatically adjust in a project each time the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job is run, turn on the **Automatic Update Project Item Cost** toggle.

If you keep it off, remember to run the **Update Job Project Cost** task manually or by using a job queue entry.

## To set up prices for resources, items, and general ledger accounts for projects

> [!NOTE]
> In 2020 release wave 2, we released new processes for setting up and managing prices and discounts. If you're a new customer, you're using the new experience. If you're an existing customer, whether you are using the new experience depends on whether your administrator has enabled the **New sales pricing experience** feature update in **Feature Management**. For more information, see [Enabling Upcoming Features Ahead of Time](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/feature-management).

You can set up prices for the items, resources, and general ledger accounts related to a project. 

#### [Current Experience](#tab/current-experience)

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Project**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the project, and then choose the **Resource**, **Item**, or **G/L Account** action.
3. On the **Project Resource Prices**, **Project Item Prices**, or **Project G/L Account Prices** pages, fill in the fields as necessary.

When you choose a resource, item, or general ledger account for a project, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses information in the optional fields on project planning lines and project journals. The following table explains how.

|Column1  |Column2  |
|---------|---------|
|**Project Items**|The **Project Task No.**, **Currency Code**, and **Line Discount %** fields. The value in the **Unit Price** field for the item will be used on the project planning lines and project journals when this item is entered. This price overrides the regular customer price (the "best price" mechanism) for items. To use the regular customer price, don't specify project item prices for the project.|
|**General Ledger Accounts**|The information in the **Project Task No.**, **Currency Code**, **Line Discount %**, **Unit Cost Factor**, and **Unit Cost** fields will be used on the project planning lines and project journals when this general ledger account is entered and added to a project. When you choose a general ledger account, project planning lines and project journals use the value in the **Unit Price** field for the general ledger project expense.|
|**Project Resources**|The **Project Task No.**, **Work Type**, **Currency Code**, **Line Discount %**, and **Unit Cost Factor** fields. The value in the **Unit Price** field for the resource is used on project planning lines and project journals when you enter a resource, or a resource assigned to the resource group. This price overrides prices specified on the **Resource Price/Resource Group Prices** page.|

#### [New Experience](#tab/new-experience)

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Projects**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the relevant project, and then choose the **Sales Price Lists** action.

## To set up project posting groups

One aspect of planning projects is deciding which posting accounts to use for project costing. To be able to post projects, you set up accounts for posting for each project posting group. A posting group represents a link between the project and how it should be treated in the general ledger. When you create a project, you specify a posting group, and by default, each task you create for the project is associated with that posting group. However, as you create tasks, you can override the default and select a posting group that is more appropriate.  

> [!NOTE]  
> You must set up accounts in the chart of accounts before you set up posting groups. For more information, see [Set Up or Change the Chart of Accounts](finance-setup-chart-accounts.md).  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Project Posting Groups**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action, and then fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

| Account field | Description | Used in WIP Type |
| --- | --- |  --- |
| **Code** |An identifier for the posting group. You can enter up to 10 characters, including spaces. | |
| **WIP Costs Account** |The WIP account for the calculated cost of the project WIP, which is a balance sheet capital asset account. | Applied Cost, Recognized Costs|
| **WIP Accrued Costs Account** |An account for the Cost Value or Cost of Sales method of WIP calculation. This account is for accrued expense liability on your balance sheet. When a WIP adjustment requires you to increase the usage costs that you post to your income statement, you post to this account. | Accrued Costs|
| **Project Costs Applied Account** |A balancing account to the WIP Costs Account, which is a contra for a negative expense account. Used when **WIP Posting Method Used** is set to *Project*. | Applied Costs, Recognized Costs|
| **Item Costs Applied Account** |Same as  **Project Costs Applied Account**, but used when **WIP Posting Method Used** is set to *Project Ledger Entry*.| |
| **Resource Costs Applied Account** |Same as  **Project Costs Applied Account**, but used when **WIP Posting Method Used** is set to *Project Ledger Entry*.| |
| **G/L Costs Applied Account** |Same as  **Project Costs Applied Account**, but used when **WIP Posting Method Used** is set to *Project Ledger Entry*.| |
| **Project Costs Adjustment Account** |The balancing account to the WIP Accrued Costs account, which is an expense account. | Accrued Costs|
| **G/L Expense Acc. (Budget)** |The sales account that will be used for general ledger expenses in project tasks with this posting group. If left empty, the general ledger account entered on the project planning line is used. | |
| **WIP Accrued Sales Account** |The WIP account for the calculated sales value of the WIP, which is an accrued revenue account for your balance sheet. When a WIP adjustment requires you to increase the recognized revenue, you post to this account. | Accrued Sales, Recognized Sales|
| **WIP Invoiced Sales Account** |The account for the invoiced sales value of the WIP that is not able to be recognized. It is a balance sheet Unearned Revenue account. | Recognized Sales, Applied Sales|
| **Project Sales Applied Account** |The balancing account to the WIP Invoiced Sales account, which is a contra income account. | Applied Sales, Recognized Sales|
| **Project Sales Adjustment Account** |The balancing account to the WIP Project Sales Account, which is an income account. | Accrued Sales|
| **Recognized Costs Account** |The expense account that contains the recognized costs for the project. It is a debit expense account ordinarily. | Recognized Costs|
| **Recognized Sales Account** |The income account that contains the recognized income for the project. It is a credit income account ordinarily. | Recognized Sales|

### Allow multiple people to post project transactions at the same time

To allow people to post transactions for projects at the same time, you can enable the **Enable multiple users to post job ledger entries at the same time** feature update on the **Feature Management** page. By default, the feature isn’t enabled.

> [!NOTE]
> Similar features are available for resource, inventory, and warehouse entries. To learn more, go to:
>
> * [Allow multiple people to post resource transactions at the same time](projects-how-setup-resources.md#allow-multiple-people-to-post-resource-transactions-at-the-same-time)
> * [Allow workers to post inventory transactions at the same time](inventory-how-setup-general.md#allow-workers-to-post-transactions-at-the-same-time)
> * [Design details: Creating warehouse entries](design-details-warehouse-entries.md)

If you enable the feature, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] assigns entry numbers for each table from `SequenceNumbers` in the database, which allows people to post transactions at the same time. The result can be that sometimes entries from two or more transactions are interleaved.

There's a similar feature for inventory transactions. An item register might contain any or all of the entry tables, as shown in the following image.

:::image type="content" source="media/interleaved inventory tables.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the item register with several entry tables." lightbox="media/interleaved inventory tables.png":::

If you don’t enable the feature, when someone posts a transaction the tables are locked and other users can’t post. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] finds the last entry in each table and assigns a number that’s one higher. This numbering ensures that entries that belong to the same register are consecutive, but prevents other people from posting at the same time.

> [!NOTE]
> You might not want to enable the feature if you have a feature or extension that:
>
> * Relies on consecutive entry numbers.
> * Requires that tables are locked throughout the posting process.

# Walkthrough: Create custom financial reports

The examples in this article describe how to create the following reports:

* Example 1 creates a Trial Balance report
* Example 2 creates a Balance Sheet report
* Example 3 creates an Income Statement report

> [!NOTE]
> The examples are based on the demonstration data that [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides for its CRONUS demonstration company.

> [!TIP]
> Formulas are expressed as a row number reference, such as "R" or "CA" (current assets), which adds all accounts with row number "R" or "CA."

## Example 1: Trial Balance

In this example, we have a new financial report called **Trial Balance** and a new row definition called **TB**.

:::image type="content" source="media/trialbalanceselection.png" alt-text="Shows the trial balance selection.":::

1. Open the new Trial Balance report.
1. Open the **TB** row definition, and choose **Insert**.
1. Choose the **Insert G/L Accounts** action to open the G/L Accounts page.
1. Filter the **Account Type** column to **Posting**.

   > [!TIP]
   > To quickly apply the filter, choose any row that has Posting in the Account Type column, and then right-click the Account Type column header and choose **Filter to this value**.

1. On the first line, choose **Show more options** :::image type="content" source="media/show-more-options-icon.png" alt-text="Show more options icon.":::, and then choose **Select more**.
1. Select all lines by choosing the radio button next to the first column header.

   :::image type="content" source="media/account type select all.png" alt-text="Shows how to select all lines.":::

1. Choose **OK** to assign all general ledger accounts with a totaling type of Posting to your row definition.

   > [!TIP]
   > To sum the results of all lines, add a formula on the last line of the row definition. Because this is a trial balance report, the expected result is zero.

Your trial balance report is complete. To view the report, choose the report on the Financial Reporting page, and then choose **View Financial Report**. Choose the column definition you prefer for the report. Often used column definitions for a trial balance report are **Balance Only**, **M-Balance**, and **Default**.

> [!TIP]
> If you add a new general ledger account to the chart of accounts, you must update your row definition to include it. Otherwise, your trial balance report won't balance to zero.

## Example 2: Balance Sheet

In this example, we have a new financial report called **Balance Sheet** and a new row definition called **BS**.

:::image type="content" source="media/balance sheet selection.png" alt-text="Shows a balance sheet selection in financial reporting.":::

1. Open the Balance Sheet report.
1. Open the **BS** row definition.
1. Map the accounts as shown in the following table. This example maps the balance sheet to the chart of accounts in the CRONUS demonstration company.

| Row No.| Description | Totaling Type | Totaling  | Row Type  | Bold  |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| | **Current Assets**| Formula | |Balance at Date    | Yes |
|CA | Cash                | Posting Accounts | 18000..18999 |Balance at Date|     |
|CA | Accounts Receivable | Posting Accounts | 15000..15999 |Balance at Date|    |
|CA |  Other Receivables  | Posting Accounts | 13000..13999 |Balance at Date|    |
|CA | Inventory           | Posting Accounts | 14000..14999 |Balance at Date|    |
|CA |Prepaid Expenses     | Posting Accounts | 16000..16999 |Balance at Date|    |
|CA |Other Current Assets | Posting Accounts | 100000..11999|Balance at Date|    |
|F1 | **Total Current Assets**  | Formula    |              |Balance at Date|    |
|   |                           | Formula    |              |Balance at Date|    |
|   | **Long Term Assets**      |            |              |Balance at Date|Yes |
|LTA|Fixed Assets         | Posting Accounts| 10000..12899  |Balance at Date|    |
|LTA|Accumulated Depreciation| Posting Accounts|12900..12999|Balance at Date|    |
|LTA|Other Long Term Assets | Posting Accounts|17000..17999|19000..19999|Balance at Date|
|F2 |**Total Long Term Assets**|Formula     |   LTA         |Balance at Date | Yes |
|   |                          | Formula    |               |Balance at Date |     |
|F3 | **Total Assets**         |            | F1+F2         | Balance at Date|     |

The following table describes the fields on the **Row Definition** page.

|Field  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|Row No.      |Alphanumeric codes are used for each section. The codes let you group by row number when you use formulas. Groupings help make formulas shorter and more simple. Each formula line is labeled with an alphanumeric code for easy identification.         |
|Description  | Used to hold the words to label each row of the report.        |
|Totaling type| Formula is used in three ways:<br><br>* To add the results of rows together.<br><br>* When combined with a section header or total.<br><br>* When inserting a blank row into the report.<br><br> Posting accounts are used to indicate that the row pulls the result of posted transactions based on the accounts listed in the Totaling column. |
|Totaling | Contains either a range of accounts shown as 10000..11999, or multiple nonconsecutive ranges of accounts shown as 17000..17999\|19000..19999.<br><br> Formulas are expressed as a row number reference, such as CA, which adds all accounts with Row No. of CA.<br><br> Following the general accounting convention of displaying financial report lines in the order of liquidity, general ledger accounts initially appear out of order. Notice that accounts show in the ranges created for each line. Totaling ranges let the report update dynamically when you add a new general ledger account to your chart of accounts.  |
|Row type     | Balance at Date is used for Balance Sheet reports.        |
|Bold         | Section headers and totals are set to Bold so they stand out.        |

> [!TIP]
> This example shows a summarized balance sheet, where each line is a group of related balance sheet accounts. Your report’s level of summarization is up to you. Good financial report design tries to provide enough detail to tell the story of financial performance without detailing every account. Avoid creating a balance sheet that is a categorized trial balance. It can be hard for people to digest such a large amount of information.

Continue to add balance sheet sections as shown in the following table. You can incorporate your own account groupings to create or replicate your company’s method of displaying accounts.  

The last line of this report is a check figure that the report complies with the accounting equation where Assets=Liabilities+Equity. The result of this check figure should be zero. If it isn't zero, it's a good indication that there's a problem:

* Some accounts aren't included in the report.
* Accounts might be included more than once.
* A formula in the report isn't calculating correctly.

> [!TIP]
> This example shows a summarized income statement, where each line is a group of related incomes statement accounts. Your report’s level of summarization is up to you. Good financial report design attempts to provide enough detail to tell the story of financial performance without detailing every account. Avoid creating an income statement that's a categorized trial balance. It can be hard for people to digest such a large amount of information.

Continue to add income statement sections as shown in the following table. You can incorporate your own account groupings to create or replicate your company’s method of displaying accounts.  

The last line of this report is a check figure that the report complies with the accounting equation where Assets = Liabilities + Equity. The result of this check figure should always be zero. If it isn't zero, it's a good indication that there's a problem:

* Some accounts aren't included in the report.
* Accounts might be included more than once.
* A formula in the report isn't calculating correctly.

# Work with responsibility centers

Responsibility centers provide the ability to handle administrative centers. A responsibility center can be a cost center, a profit center, an investment center, or other company-defined administrative center. Examples of responsibility centers are a sales office, a purchasing department for several locations, and a plant planning office. For example, companies can set up user-specific views of sales and purchase documents related to a particular responsibility center.  

Using multiple locations together with responsibility centers provides the ability to manage business operations in flexible, optimal ways.

Multiple locations allow companies to manage their inventory in multiple locations using one database. Two concepts, locations and stockkeeping units, are the cornerstones of this granule. A location is defined as a place that handles physical placement and quantities of items. The concept is broad enough to include locations such as plants or production facilities and distribution centers, warehouses, showrooms, and service vehicles. A stockkeeping unit is defined as an item at a specific location and/or as a variant. Using stockkeeping units, companies with multiple locations can add replenishment information, addresses, and some financial posting information at the location level. As a result, they can replenish variants of the same item for each location and order items based on location-specific replenishment information.  

## To set up a responsibility center

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Responsibility Centers**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  

    If you're using responsibility centers to administer your company, it can be useful to have a default responsibility center.
4. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Company Information**, and then choose the related link.
5. On the **Shipping** FastTab, in the **Responsibility Center** field, enter a responsibility center code.

This code is used on all purchase, sales, or service documents, if the user, customer, or vendor has no default responsibility center. On sales, purchase, or service documents, you can enter another responsibility center than the default.

> [!NOTE]  
> When you enter a responsibility center code on a document, it affects the address, dimensions, and prices on the document.  

## To assign responsibility centers to users

You can set up users so that [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] retrieves only the documents relevant for their particular work areas. Users are associated with one responsibility center and work only with documents related to specific application areas at that particular center.  

To set this up, you assign responsibility centers to users in three functional areas: Purchases, Sales, and Service Management.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **User Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **User Setup** page, select the user you want to assign a responsibility center to. If the user not is on the list, you must enter a user ID in the **User ID** field.  
3. In the **Sales Resp. Ctr. Filter** field, enter the responsibility center where the user will have tasks related to sales.  
4. In the **Purchase Resp. Ctr. Filter** field, enter the responsibility center where the user will have tasks related to purchasing.  
5. In the **Service Resp. Ctr. Filter** field, enter the responsibility center where the user will have tasks related to service management.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Users can view only those posted documents that related to their own responsibility center. However, they can view all ledger entries and navigate to other posted documents from the ledger entries.

# Allocate Resources
The key element to service management is the people who supply service. You can set up [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to assign the appropriate people to the appropriate projects. Assignments can be based on service zones where the people are located or where the service occurs. In addition, you can group resources together when responding to service requests. For more information, see [Set Up Resource Allocation](service-how-setup-resource-allocation.md).

You can allocate resources, for example, technicians, by using the **Dispatch Board**, or from a service order. You can use resource availability to allocate resources to perform the service tasks in the orders or quotes.

You can allocate the same resource, for example, a technician, or resource group to all the service items in a service order. Allocation entries are created for the other service items in the order with the same resource number and allocation date as the line you allocated. The allocated hours are the hours you allocated divided by the number of service items in the order. The **Status** field is automatically set to **Active** for all the entries that were created.

## To see an overview of service orders and service quotes  
You may often need to see the list of service orders or service quotes that meet certain requirements to be able to perform specific actions with them one by one. For example,you may need to allocate resources to service orders that belong to a specific customer.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Dispatch Board**, and then choose the related link.  
2. In the **Document Filter** field, choose the type of the documents you want to see.
3. To get a list of documents that contain service tasks a certain resource or resource group is allocated to, fill in the **Resource Filter** and **Resource Group Filter** fields and select <kbd>Enter</kbd>.  
4. To get a list of documents with a certain response date or response dates within a certain date period, fill in the **Response Date Filter** field and select <kbd>Enter</kbd>.  
5. To get a list of documents with a specified allocation state or document status, fill in the **Allocation Filter/Status Filter** field and select <kbd>Enter</kbd>.  
6. To get a list of documents that belong to a certain contract, customer, or zone, fill in the **Contract Filter/Customer Filter/Zone Filter** field and select <kbd>Enter</kbd>.  
7. Choose a line that corresponds to a service order or service quote, and then choose the **Show Document** action.  

    The **Service Order** or **Service Quote** page opens, and you can work with the document. To return to the **Dispatch Board** page, choose **OK**.

## To allocate a resource using resource or resource group availability    
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Dispatch Board**, and choose the related link.  
2. Choose the service order, and then choose the **Resource Allocations** action.  
3. Choose the entry with the service task to which you want to allocate a resource.  
4. Choose either the **Resource Availability** or **Res. Group Availability** action.  
5. On the **Res. Availability (Service)** page, choose **Show Matrix**.  
6. Choose a resource to allocate. You can base your selection on whether the resource is skilled for the task, whether it is located in the customer zone, and/or whether it is preferred by the customer.  
7. Specify a date on which the resource has enough available hours for the task, and which is close to the response date of the service order.  
8. In the **Qty. to Allocate** field, enter the number of hours you want to allocate the resource to the service task for.  
9. Choose the **Allocate** action to allocate the selected resource on the selected date.  

     The **Status** field is automatically set to **Active**.  

 Repeat these steps for each date that you want to allocate the resource to the service task.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  For a service item in a service order, there can only be **Active** allocation entries with one resource or resource group at a time.  

## To allocate a resource using a service order  
After you have created and filled in a service order or service quote, you can allocate resources, for example, technicians, to perform service tasks registered as service item lines in the document.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the service order, and then choose **Edit**.  
3. Choose the service item line corresponding to the service task you want to allocate a resource to.  
4. Choose **Resource Allocations**.
5. On the **Resource Allocations** page, choose a nonactive allocation entry with the service task you want to allocate the resource to. If the allocation entry does not exist, you can create a new one by choosing **New**.  
7. Specify the service task by filling in the **Service Item No.** field on the same line.  
8. In the **Resource No.** field, choose the resource. If the resource is a member of a resource group, the number of the resource group is entered automatically into the **Resource Group No.** field.  
9. Fill in the **Allocation Date** and **Allocated Hours** fields. The **Status** field is set to **Active**. This means that the resource is allocated to the service task.  
10. Optionally, to assign the resource to all items, choose **Allocate to All Service Items**.

> [!NOTE]  
>  For a service item in a service order, there can only be active allocation entries with one resource or resource group at a time.

## To reallocate resources on a service order  
You can reallocate resources directly from a service order or service quote when you are working with it. The original entry will still exist, but its status is updated as follows:  

* If service was started while the allocation was **Active**, that is, if the repair status of the service item in the entry was changed to **In Process**, the allocation status changes from **Reallocation Needed** to **Finished**.  
* If service was not started while the allocation was **Active**, allocation status changes from **Reallocation Needed** to **Canceled**.  
* If you are reallocating a service order that you have converted from a quote, the status of the allocation entries registered for the quote always changes to **Finished** when you reallocate the service items in the service order.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the relevant service order.  
3. Select the service item line corresponding to the service task you want to allocate a resource to, and then choose the **Resource Allocations** action.  
4. On the **Resource Allocations** page, select an allocation entry with the service task you want to reallocate the resource to. In the **Resource No.** field, select the relevant resource. This overwrites the resource number already in the field.  
5. Select <kbd>Enter</kbd>. A dialog box opens, asking whether you want to reallocate this entry. Fill in the **Reason Code** field if appropriate and choose the **Yes** button to confirm the reallocation.  
6. Fill in the **Allocation Date** and **Allocated Hours** fields. The entry now contains the new resource and its status is **Active**.

## To reallocate a resource using the dispatch board  
If the resource allocated to a service task cannot accomplish the work, it means that this service task needs reallocation. Usually you reallocate resources to a service task by using the **Dispatch Board**.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Dispatch Board**, and then choose the related link.  
2. In the **Allocation Filter** field, select **Reallocation Needed**. The **Dispatch Board** page now shows the list of service orders that include service tasks that need reallocation.  
3. Select the relevant service order, and then choose the **Resource Allocations** action. The **Resource Allocations** page opens.  
4. Select the allocation entry with the service task you want to reallocate a resource to.  
5. In the **Resource No.** field, select the relevant resource. It overwrites the resource number already in the field.  
6. Select <kbd>Enter</kbd>. The **Reallocation Entry Reasons** dialog box opens, asking whether you want to reallocate this entry. Fill in the **Reason Code** field if appropriate and choose the **Yes** button to confirm the reallocation.  
7.  Fill in the **Allocation Date** and **Allocated Hours** fields. The entry now contains the new resource and its status is **Active**.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  The old entry still exists but the status is updated in the following ways:  
    >   
    >  * If service was started while the allocation was **Active**, that is, if the repair status of the service item in the entry was changed to **In Process**, the allocation status changes from **Reallocation Needed** to **Finished**.  
    > * If service was not started while the allocation was **Active**, the allocation status changes from **Reallocation Needed** to **Canceled**.  
    > * If you are reallocating a service order that you have converted from a quote, the status of the allocation entries registered for the quote always changes to **Finished** when you reallocate the service items in the service order.  

## To register resource hours  
When working on service items in service orders, you need to register the resource hours used for the service. The following procedure shows how to register the resource hours on the **Service Item Worksheet** page.  

You can use the same procedure to register the hours on the **Service Lines** page, which you can open from the Service Order page. Open the relevant service card, and then choose the **Service Lines** action.  

If the same resource works on all the service items in the service order, you can register the total resource hours for one service item only and then split the resource line to assign the resource hours to the other service items.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Tasks**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the line that includes the relevant service item, and then choose the **Item Worksheet** action.  
3. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

## To assign a resource to all service items in an order
If the same resource, for example a technician, works on all the service items in the service order, you can register the total resource hours for one service item only and then split the resource line to divide the resource hours onto the resource lines for the other service items.  

The following procedure shows how to split resource lines on the **Service Invoice Lines** page.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the relevant service order.  
3. On the **Lines** FastTab, choose the **Service Lines** action. The **Service Lines** page opens.  
4. Select the resource line you want to split. The contents of the **Quantity** field is divided between all the service items in the order.  
5. Choose the **Split Resource Line** action. Choose **Yes** to confirm.  

    Resource lines for the other service items in the order are created with the same resource number as the line you split. The quantity is the quantity for the line you split divided by the number of service items in the order.  

## To cancel an allocation  
You can cancel resource allocations for service tasks without reallocating the tasks.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Dispatch Board**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the service order, and then choose the **Resource Allocations** action.  
3. Choose the allocation entry with the service task that you want to cancel allocation for.  
4. Choose the **Cancel Allocation** action.  
5. In the **Reason Code** field, select the appropriate reason code.  
6. Choose **Yes** to confirm the cancellation.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > In the **Status** field, the **Reallocation Needed** option is automatically selected. If the repair status of the service item in the entry is **Initial**, the repair status is changed to **Referred**, that is, no service has been started. If the repair status is **In Process**, it is changed to **Partly Serviced**, that is, some service has been completed.

# Register consumption and output for a released production order

Use the **Production Journal** page to register consumption output for a released production order. The journal combines the functions of the separate consumption journal and output journals into one journal. You open the combined journal from a released production order. Its purpose is to manually post the consumption of components, the quantity of end items produced, and the time spent on operations. The values post to ledger entries under the released production order. Consumption quantities post as negative item ledger entries, output quantities post as positive ledger entries, and time spent posts as capacity ledger entries. The posted values also display at the bottom of the journal as actual quantities.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Because consumption data is processed together with output data, this journal displays linked components and operations in a logical process structure. Components are indented under their respective operation. This linking requires that you use routing link codes. To learn more about routing links, go to [To create routing links](production-how-to-create-routings.md#to-create-routing-links).  

> [!NOTE]  
> Components without routing link codes list first in the journal.  

## To register consumption and output  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon enter **Released Prod. Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open a released production order line that's ready to register. On the **Lines** FastTab, choose the **Line** action, and then choose the **Production Journal** action.  

    The **Production Journal** page shows journal lines for the production order line according to the **Prod. Order Component** and **Prod. Order Routing** pages. These lines come from the production BOM and routing assigned to the item that is being produced. To learn more, go to [Create Production BOMs](production-how-to-create-routings.md).  

3. In the **Posting Date** field, enter a posting date that applies to all lines. The work date is entered by default. The field is meant as a quick way to align posting dates on all lines, if relevant.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > Posting dates on individual lines override this field.  

4. In the **Flushing Method Filter** field, you can choose to also view consumption and output that is posted automatically according to the flushing methods defined for the item and resource respectively. To learn more, go to [Enable Flushing of Components According to Operation Output](production-how-to-flush-components-according-to-operation-output.md).

5. Enter the consumption and output quantities.  
  
    On each type of line in the journal, only the relevant fields are shown. Other fields are blank and you can't edit them.  

    When you open the journal, it shows the quantities to post. If nothing is posted so far, all quantity fields show the expected quantities from the production order. If partial postings were done, the quantity fields on the lines show the remaining quantities. The quantities and times already posted for the order display at the bottom of the journal as actual entries.  

    > [!TIP]
    > For the quantities in the **Output Quantity** field, you can specify which values to preset when you first open the journal. On the **Manufacturing Setup** page, on the **General** FastTab, enter the value in the **Preset Output Quantity** field.

    > [!NOTE]  
    > Only the output quantity on the last journal line of entry type **Output** adjusts the inventory level when posting the journal. Therefore, don't post the journal with the expected output quantity preset on the last output line until all end items are produced.  

6. Select the **Finished** field of output lines to indicate that the operation is finished. This field is related to the **Routing Status** field on a production order routing line.  
7. Choose the **Post** action to register the quantities and then close the journal.  

    [!INCLUDE [preview-posting-inventory](includes/preview-posting-inventory.md)]

    If values remain to be posted, the journal contains the remaining values the next time you open it. Posted values show as actual values in the bottom of the journal.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > If an item that's being consumed is blocked, the journal doesn't post consumption quantities for it. If a machine or work center is blocked, the journal doesn't post output quantities or process times for the output line.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > If you close the journal without posting, the changes are lost.  

> [!WARNING]

# Set Up the AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals extension
A global provider of services to convert payment information to any data format that your bank requires is connected and ready to be enabled in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. This is referred to in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] as the AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals extension.

You can export payment lines from the **Payment Journal** page to a file or a data stream that you then upload to your bank for automatic processing so that you do not have to make electronic payments individually. For more information, see [Export Payments to a Bank File](finance-make-payments-with-bank-data-conversion-service-or-sepa-credit-transfer.md#exporting-payments-to-a-bank-file).

You can import bank statement files into the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page by using the AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals extension to convert a file that you receive from your bank to a data stream that [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can import. For more information, see [Applying Payments Automatically and Reconciling Bank Accounts](receivables-apply-payments-auto-reconcile-bank-accounts.md).

As an alternative to importing bank statements with the AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals extension, you can use the Envestnet Yodlee Bank Feeds service. For more information, see [Set Up the Envestnet Yodlee Bank Feeds Service](bank-how-setup-bank-statement-service.md).

To import or export bank files, you must set up your own bank account and your vendors' bank accounts. For more information, see [Set Up Bank Accounts](bank-how-setup-bank-accounts.md).

> [!NOTE]  
> The AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals extension may impose a limit on the number of lines that can be exported in one file. You will receive an error message if the limit is exceeded. It is recommended that bank statement files do not exceed 1000 lines as the processing time in the AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals extension may otherwise increase significantly.

# Service Posting
Service posting functionality lets you process your documents efficiently and maintain successful customer service policy. You can create and update posted documents, and create ledger entries both in the service area and in other modules to ensure the correct update.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  The following describes service posting regardless of how items are physically handled in the warehouse.  
>   
>  In a location that is not set up to require warehouse handling, you perform the posting actions directly from the **Service Lines** page. In locations that involve warehouse handling, the described posting actions, except Ship and Consume, are performed indirectly through varying warehouse ship functions, depending on setup. For more information, see [Pick Items with Inventory Picks](warehouse-how-to-pick-items-with-inventory-picks.md).  

## Ship  
The ship option lets you register the relevant items and time entered on the lines of a service order after you complete the service. A posted shipment is created and updates occur in the Inventory module and other modules in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to reflect that the items have been taken out of the inventory and sent to the customer. In particular, the item ledger entries, value ledger entries, service ledger entries, and warranty ledger entries are produced.  

If the location is set up to require warehouse handling, then the shipping and moving of service line items functions in the same ways as for other source documents. The only difference is that service line items can be consumed either externally or internally, which requires two different release functions.

## Invoice  
You have to use the invoice option to issue an invoice to the customer you want to charge for the service. Usually, it is the difference between the shipped quantity registered by the **Post Shipment** function and the consumed quantity registered by the **Post Consumption** function that is subject to invoice. You cannot invoice what has not been shipped. When you run the **Post Invoice** function, you create a posted service invoice and update the documents posted before to make them consistent with the quantities that are contained in the issued invoice. Like in other posting procedures, the relevant ledger entries that includes general ledger entries, are generated.  

## Ship and Invoice  
The ship and invoice option lets you issue both a service shipment and an invoice at the same time.  

## Ship and Consume  
With the ship and consume option, you can register and post items, costs, or hours that have been used for servicing but that cannot be included in the invoice to the customer. An invoice is not issued, but you can issue both a service shipment and service consumption at the same time to reflect the fact that some items or hours have been given to the customer free of charge. The corresponding ledger entries are also created to register consumption.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  The service posting procedure enables you to perform partial posting. You can create a partial shipment or a partial invoice by filling in the **Qty. to Ship** and **Qty. to Invoice** fields on the individual service lines of the service orders before you post. Note that you cannot create an invoice for something that is not shipped. That is, before you can invoice, you must have registered a shipment, or you must choose to ship and invoice at the same time.  

After the posting has been completed, you will be able to view the posted service documents from the corresponding **Posted Service Shipment** and **Posted Service Invoice** pages. The posted entries created can be seen in various pages that contain posted entries, such as **G/L Entries**, **Item Ledger Entries**, **Warehouse Entries**, **Service Ledger Entries**, **Project Ledger Entries**, and **Warranty Ledger Entries**.  

## To view information about a posted service document  
When you post a service invoice, a service shipment, or a service credit memo, the information on the document is transferred to the **Posted Service Invoice**, **Posted Service Shipment**, or **Posted Service Credit Memo** pages respectively. You cannot enter, change, or delete anything in these pages. You can print a shipment, invoice, or credit memo from these pages.  

The following procedure uses a posted service invoice as an example, but the same procedure can apply to posted service shipments and posted credit memos.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Posted Service Invoice**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the posted service invoice you want to view.  
3. To get an overview of the posted invoice, choose the **Statistics** action.  

    The **Service Order Statistics** page opens. The page displays information such as quantity, amount, VAT, cost, profit, and customer credit limit for the posted document.

# Acquire fixed assets

Use the **Fixed Asset Card** page to enter information about an asset. You can set up buildings or production equipment as a main asset with a component list, and you can group them in various ways, such as by class, department, or location. You must set up and assign a depreciation book to each fixed asset before you can acquire it.

After you set up a fixed asset and assign a depreciation book, you must acquire the fixed asset. To acquire a fixed asset, you record its acquisition cost in the relevant G/L account, bank account, or vendor by posting an acquisition transaction from the **Fixed Asset G/L Journal** page. You can use the **Assisted Fixed Asset Acquisition** page to create and post the required general journal lines automatically.

Use indexation to adjust values for general price-level changes. Use the **Index Fixed Assets** batch job to calculate the acquisition costs and replacement costs.

## Add a fixed asset to your list of fixed assets

Before you can acquire a fixed asset, you must add it to your list of assets. There are several ways to add fixed assets to your list:

* Enter information about the assets on the **Fixed Asset Card** page.
* Use the **Edit in Excel** action to download your list of assets to a worksheet, add new assets to the list, and then publish the update to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].
* Use a purchase order to add assets.
* Use the **Copy fixed asset** action.

After you add fixed assets to your list, the next step is to acquire them so you can use them in transactions. Learn more at [Acquire a fixed asset](#acquire-fixed-assets).

### Add a fixed asset on the Fixed Asset Card page

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Fixed Assets**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action, and then fill in the fields on the **General** FastTab as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
3. On the **Depreciation Book** FastTab, fill in the fields as necessary. This step assigns a depreciation book to the fixed asset.  
4. If you need to assign more than one depreciation book to the fixed asset, choose the **Add More Depreciation Books** action. To learn more, go to [To assign a depreciation book to a fixed asset](fa-how-setup-depreciation.md#to-assign-a-depreciation-book-to-a-fixed-asset).

    After you fill in the required fields, the **You are ready to acquire the fixed asset.** notification appears at the top of the page. If you're ready to acquire the asset now, choose the **Acquire** action. Follow the steps on the **Assisted Fixed Asset Acquisition** page to complete the acquisition. If you aren't ready, you can always acquire the asset later.

### Use Edit in Excel to add assets

If you want to add numerous fixed assets, Edit in Excel is a great tool to use. The tool downloads your current list of assets in a worksheet that includes most of the fields available on the Fixed Asset Card page. You can fill in some or all of fields on a row for each asset, and publish your changes to add them to your list in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. If you can't fill in all required field, that's ok. You can update them in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] when you're ready.

> [!NOTE]
> To use the Edit in Excel action, you must have the Microsoft Dynamics Office Add-in installed. The add-in creates the connection between Excel and [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. To learn more, go to [Get the Business Central Add-in for Excel](admin-deploy-excel-addin.md).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Fixed Assets**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the :::image type="content" source="media/share-icon.png" alt-text="Share this page with other users or apps icon."::: icon, and then choose **Edit in Excel**.
3. Open the downloaded file, and enter information about the new fixed assets.

   > [!TIP]
   > You don't need to enter an identifier in the **No.** column. When you publish your update, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] assigns an identifier based on the number series you use for fixed assets.

4. To update [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], on the **Microsoft Dynamics** pane, choose **Publish**.

### Add a fixed asset from a purchase order or invoice

The following steps describe how to add a fixed asset from a purchase order. The steps are similar for a purchase invoice.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Orders**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose **New** to create a new purchase order.
3. On the **General** FastTab, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](../archive/SetupAndAdministration/includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
4. On the **Lines** FastTab, in the **Type** field, choose **Fixed Asset**.
5. In the **No.** field, either choose an existing fixed asset to add an expense, or choose **New** to add a new asset.
6. After you enter the information for the new asset and the purchase order, choose **Post**.

## Acquire a fixed asset by using a fixed asset G/L journal

The following procedure describes how to acquire by creating and posting the required fixed asset G/L journal lines. You can also create and post the journal lines manually. To learn more, go to [Acquire a fixed asset by using a fixed asset G/L journal](#acquire-a-fixed-asset-by-using-a-fixed-asset-gl-journal).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Fixed Assets**, and then choose the related link.
1. Choose the asset you want to acquire, and then choose the **Acquire** action.
1. Follow the steps on the **Assisted Fixed Asset Acquisition** page to complete the acquisition.

> [!NOTE]  
> You can also post acquisition cost as credits. In that case, remember that the value in the **Acquisition Cost Incl. VAT** field must be with a minus sign to indicate a credit.

When you choose **Finish**, the **Book Value** field on the **Fixed Asset Card** page is filled in, which indicates that the fixed asset was acquired at the specified acquisition cost.  

## To post a fixed asset acquisition manually with a fixed asset G/L journal

The following procedure describes how to acquire a fixed asset manually by creating and posting lines on the **Fixed Asset G/L Journal** page. You can also acquire a fixed asset automatically on the **Fixed Asset Card** page by choosing the **Acquire fixed asset** action. To learn more, go to [Acquire a fixed asset](#acquire-fixed-assets).

> [!NOTE]  
> You can also post acquisition cost as credits. In that case, remember that the value in the **Amount** field must be with a minus sign to indicate a credit.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Fixed Asset G/L Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Fixed Asset G/L Journal** page, in the **FA Posting Type** field, select **Acquisition Cost**.
3. Fill in the remaining fields as necessary.
4. Choose the **Post** action.  

> [!TIP]  
> If you fill in the **Insurance No.** field, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] also posts the acquisition cost of the fixed asset to the insurance coverage ledger. To learn more, go to [Insure Fixed Assets](fa-how-insure.md).

## To set up a component list for a main asset

You can group your fixed assets into main assets and their components. For example, you might have a production machine that consists of several parts that you want to group in this manner.  

You must set up the main asset and all its components as individual fixed asset. After you set up a component list, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically fills in the **Main Assets/Component** and **Components of Main Asset** fields on the fixed assets.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Fixed Assets**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the fixed asset that is the main asset, and then choose the **Main Asset Components** action.
3. On the **Main Asset Components** page, choose the **FA No**. field, and then select the fixed asset that you want to add as a component of the main asset.
4. Close the page.
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 for each component asset that you want to add.
6. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Fixed Asset Setup**, and then choose the related link.
7. Turn on the **Allow Posting to Main Assets** toggle.

## To cancel an acquisition cost posting for one fixed asset

If you make an error when posting an acquisition cost, you can remove the entry with the **Cancel FA Entries** batch job and then post the correct acquisition entry. The erroneous entries are transferred to the **FA Error Ledger Entries** page.

For example, if you post an acquisition with the wrong date, you must correct it as soon as possible because the fixed asset posting date is used for many calculations.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> You can't use the **Reverse Transactions** action for fixed asset entries.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **FA Ledger Entries**, and then choose the related link.  
2. In the **FA Ledger Entries** page, select the entry or entries that you want to cancel.  
3. Choose the **Actions** menu, and then choose the **Cancel Entries** action.
4. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
5. Choose the **OK** button to run the batch job.
6. When the incorrect entry or entries are canceled, proceed to post the correct acquisition cost.

## To post the salvage value together with the acquisition cost

The salvage value is the residual value of a fixed asset when it can no longer be used. You can post the salvage value at the same time as you post the acquisition cost. To learn more, go to [Depreciate or Amortize Fixed Assets](fa-how-depreciate-amortize.md).

You can post the salvage value together with the acquisition cost from a fixed asset journal.

> [!NOTE]
> This process might require that you personalize the Fixed Asset Journals page by adding the Salvage Value field. By default, the field is not displayed on the page. To learn more, go to [Personalize Your Workspace](ui-personalization-user.md).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Fixed Asset Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Fixed Asset Journals** page, create the acquisition line. To learn more, go to [To post a fixed asset acquisition manually with a fixed asset G/L journal](#to-post-a-fixed-asset-acquisition-manually-with-a-fixed-asset-gl-journal).
3. In the **Salvage Value** field on the journal line, enter the salvage value amount as a credit (prefix the amount with a minus sign, for example, **-**100).
4. Choose the **Post** action.

> [!NOTE]
> If a salvage value exists for a fixed asset, that value is used in depreciation posting instead of the value in the **Ending Book Value** field on the **FA Depreciation Books** page. To learn more, go to [To manage the ending book value](fa-how-depreciate-amortize.md#to-manage-the-ending-book-value).

# Enable Application of Ledger Entries in Different Currencies

If you purchase from a vendor in one currency and submit payment in another currency, you can apply the payment to the purchase.

Likewise, if you sell to a customer in one currency and receive payment in another currency, you can apply the payment to the sales invoice.

The following procedure describes how to set this up for vendor ledger entries on the **Purchases & Payables Setup** page. The setup is similar for customer ledger entries on the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page.

## To enable application of vendor ledger entries in different currencies

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchases & Payables Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. In the **Appln. between Currencies** field, select one of the following options.

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| None |Application between currencies is not allowed. |
| EMU |Application between EMU currencies is allowed. |
| All |Application between all currencies is allowed. |

## To set up G/L accounts for currency application rounding differences

If you apply entries in different currencies, you must set up the general ledger accounts to which you want to post rounding differences.  

> [!NOTE]  
> You must set up the general ledger accounts before you complete the task. For more information, see [Understanding the General Ledger and the Chart of Accounts](finance-general-ledger.md).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customer Posting Groups**, and then choose the related link.

The service order status reflects the repair status of all the service items in the service order.

> These two status field are not related to the **Release Status** field on the service order header, which determines how the warehouse handles service items.  

Each time the repair status of a service item is changed in a service order, the status of the order is updated. To display the status that reflects the overall repair status of the individual service items, you must specify the following:  

* The service order status that each repair status is linked to.  
* The level of priority of each service order status option.  

When you convert a service quote to a service order, the repair status of each service item is changed in the order to **Initial** and the service order status is changed to **Pending**.  

> [!NOTE]
> Before you can create service orders, you must set up repair statuses and service status priorities. For more information, see [Set Up Statuses for Service Orders and Repairs](service-order-repair-status.md).

## Specifying Service Order Status for Repair Status

Each repair status is linked to a particular service order status. The options for the service order status are as follows:

* **Pending**
* **In Process**
* **On Hold**
* **Finished**

The repair status options are as follows:

* **Initial**
* **In Process**
* **Referred**
* **Partly Serviced**
* **Quote Finished**
* **Waiting for Customer**
* **Spare Part Ordered**
* **Spare Part Received**
* **Finished**  

### Pending

The service order status **Pending** indicates that the service can start or continue at any time. Therefore, the repair status options of **Initial**, **Referred**, **Partly Serviced**, and **Spare Part Received** can be linked to this service order status.  

### In Process

The service order status **In Process** indicates that the service is in process. Therefore, the repair status options **In Process** and **Spare Part Ordered** can both be linked to this service order status. If you link the **Spare Part Ordered** status to an **In Process** service order status, you must also link the **Spare Part Received** status to this service order status.  

### On Hold

The service order status **On Hold** indicates that the service is temporarily on hold because you are waiting for a customer response or spare parts before the service can start. Therefore, the repair status options of **Quote Finished**, **Spare Part Ordered**, and **Waiting for Customer** can be linked to this service order status.  

### Finished

The service order status **Finished** indicates that the service has been completed. Therefore, the **Finished** repair status is linked to this status.  

## Assigning Priority to Service Order Status

When a repair status of a service item is changed, the service order status options linked to the different repair status options of all the service items in the order are identified. If the service items are linked to two or more service order status options, the service order status option with the highest priority is selected.  

You must decide which service order status contains the most important information about the status of the service order and assign that status the highest priority, and so on.  

Then, when you create a new service order and you add service items to it, the **Priority** field on the service order header is updated based on the priorities on the service items.  

### Example

A typical priority level assignment could be as follows:  

* In Process - High  
* Pending - Medium high  
* On Hold - Medium low  
* Finished - Low  

For example, if one service item has the repair status **Initial**, linked to the service order status **Pending**, another has the repair status **In Process**, linked to the service order status **In Process**, and a third has the repair status **Spare Part Ordered**, linked to the service order status **On Hold**, the resulting service order status will be **In Process** because this has the highest priority.

# Create service invoices or credit memos

Ease in invoicing your service orders is a key feature of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. You can set up your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] so that a service technician in the field can create an invoice for a service that isn't connected to a contract or order. Alternatively, set up [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] so that you invoice service contracts periodically. The invoice period for each contract defines how often you invoice it.

## To invoice several service contracts

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Create Service Contract Invoices**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Set the filters you want to apply.  
3. In the **Posting Date** field, enter the date to use as the posting date on the service invoices.  
4. In the **Invoice to Date** field, enter the date up to which you want to invoice contracts. The batch job will include the contracts with the next invoice dates, up to this date.  
5. In the **Action** field, choose **Create Invoices**.  
6. Choose **OK** to create the service invoices.  
  
You can also invoice a service contract directly from the **Service Contract** page, if the next invoice date on the contract is earlier than the working date.

## To invoice a service contract from the Service Contract page   

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Contracts**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the service contract to invoice, and open the contract card.  
3. Choose **Create Service Invoice** action. 
4. Choose **Yes** to create the service invoices.  
  
  > [!NOTE]  
  > You can't create service invoices for the service contract when the **Change Status** field value is set to **Open**.  

## To post an invoice from a service order  

The following procedure describes how to define the part of service that you'll charge the customer for.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the service order to invoice, and open the order card.  
3. Choose the **Service Lines** action.  
4. Find the required entries, and then specify the quantities for which you will charge the customer in the **Qty. to Invoice** field.  
  
   > [!NOTE]  
   > You can invoice the customer for the registered service either fully or in parts. If you choose to invoice the customer fully, the value in the **Qty. to Invoice** field must equal the value in the **Quantity** field. You can post a full invoice together with a full shipment, and you can post a full invoice for an already posted full shipment that isn't invoiced or consumed.  
   >  
   > When you post a partial invoice, there are two ways of specifying the quantity to invoice. If you're going to post the service with **the Ship and Invoice** option, the value in the **Qty. to Invoice** field must equal the value in the **Qty. to Ship** field. If you want to invoice an already posted shipment, the quantity to invoice must not be larger than the value in the **Quantity Shipped** field.  
  
5. Choose **Post**, and then either **Invoice** or **Ship and Invoice**. To learn more, go to [Posting in Service Management](service-service-posting.md).  
  
 The service line you selected is posted. You can post several service lines at the same time by selecting them and choosing **Post**. If you do, make sure you fill in all the necessary information on the lines.  
  
 When you post the order with the **Invoice** option, a posted service invoice is created along with the corresponding ledger entries and updates to the relevant fields on the service lines of the order. Also, previously posted shipment documents are updated with the invoiced quantities. If you select the **Ship and Invoice** posting option, a posted shipment is created.

## To create a service invoice manually  

Typically, after you post a service order with the **Invoice** or **Ship and Invoice** option, a service invoice is posted automatically. Yet, you may need to issue an invoice that isn't linked to a service contract or order. This procedure explains how to issue an invoice at the same time that the customer receives the service.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Invoices**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Create a new service invoice.  
3. Fill in the **No.** field.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  If you have set up number series for service invoices on the **Service Mgt. Setup** page, you can select **Enter** to select the next available service invoice number.  
  
4. In the **Customer No.** field, enter the number of a customer. Select the relevant customer from the list.  
  
    The customer fields are filled in with information from the **Customer** card.  
  
5. Enter a date in the **Posting Date** field. This date will appear on the posted entries. This field shows your current work date, but you can change the date.  
6. In the **Document Date** field, enter a date that will appear on the printed invoice and be used to calculate the due date.  
7. Fill in the service lines of the invoice. Fill in the **Type**, **No.**, and **Quantity** fields to register items, resources and costs that have been used in servicing.

## To create an invoice that combines posted shipment lines from one or more service orders 

You might need to create a service invoice for a service that's already shipped, either from one or several service orders, but not yet invoiced or consumed. You can fill in the invoice lines automatically with the selected posted shipment lines for a specific customer.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Invoices**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields on the line as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)] 
3. Create invoice lines for services shipped but not invoiced. Alternatively, you can use the **Get Shipment Lines** action to add posted shipment lines to the invoice.  
4. Post the service invoice.  
  
 The posted service invoice and the corresponding ledger entries are created. Previously posted shipment documents update with the invoiced quantities and the quantities on the service lines of the source orders.  

## To create a service credit memo  

You typically use a service credit memo document when a customer returns an item. However, you can also use them to reimburse a customer or to correct a invoice that was a mistake.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Credit Memos**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields on the line as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
3. The **Posting Date** and **Document Date** fields display the work date. If needed, you can change it.    
4. On the credit memo lines, enter information about the items that have been returned or removed, or the compensation that will be given to the customer.  

## Correct errors in service invoices

You can delete service invoices that have service ledger entries associated with them. This means that you can correct errors or make changes to service invoices without getting stuck or losing data. For example, if you forget to assign a product posting group to a G/L account, you can add it later and recreate the service invoice.

Use the :::image type="content" source="media/copilot-delete-trash-can.png" alt-text="Delete action icon"::: action to delete a service invoice. 

When you delete a service invoice, the following things happen:

* Post a corrective service ledger entry
* Restore the invoicing date and period in the contract, which lets you create the invoice again.

> [!NOTE]
> You can revert several invoices, but you must do so sequentially, starting from the last invoice.
>
> You can't delete a service invoice if its details, such as the invoicing period or the **Prepaid** toggle were changed in the related service contract. Make sure that you delete invoices before you change settings on the service contract.

# Manage Interactions for Segments
The **Segment** page is a type of worksheet where you can:

* Create segments.
* Save the segmentation criteria you have used to select contacts.
* Log the segment and record interactions involving the contacts within the segment.

## Segmenting
There are several ways to create segments:

* You can manually enter the contacts you want to include in the segment in the segment lines.
* You can select contacts.
* You can reuse a logged segment as the basis to create a new one.
* You can reuse saved segmentation criteria.

## Interactions
On the **Segment** page, you can create interactions for several contacts simultaneously. For example, you can merge a segment with a Microsoft Word document, so that you can send a letter to all the contacts in the segment.

You can specify information about the interaction for the segment on the **Segment** header. For example, you can decide which interaction template you want to use for all the contacts, specify a description, a correspondence type, and so on. However, you can modify this information in the segment line for each particular contact, for example, by specifying another description for one contact. If you are merging a segment with a Microsoft Word document, you can personalize the document to be sent for one or several of the contacts within the segment, for example, by adding individualized comments to the document.

## Logging
On the **Segment** page, when you choose **Log**, the application records the interactions on the **Interaction Log Entry** page, and logs the segment. After you have logged the segment, you can only find it on the **Logged Segments** page.

On the **Logged Segments** page, you can decide to create a follow-up segment containing the same contacts as the segment you have logged.

title: Design Details - Item Tracking and Reservations

# Design Details: Item Tracking and Reservations

Simultaneous use of reservation and specific item tracking is uncommon, because they both create a coupling between supply and demand. Except for situations where a customer or production planner requests a specific lot, it rarely makes sense to reserve inventory items that already carry item tracking numbers for specific application. Although it is possible to reserve items that require specific item tracking, special functionality is needed to avoid availability conflicts between order processors that request the same item-tracked items.  
  
The concept of Late Binding ensures that a nonspecific reservation of a serial number or a lot number remains loosely coupled until posting. At posting time, the reservation system can reshuffle nonspecific reservations to ensure that fixed application is possible against the serial or lot number that is actually picked. Meanwhile, the serial or lot number is made available for specific reservation in other documents that request that particular serial or lot number.  
  
A nonspecific reservation is one in which the user does not care which specific item is picked, and a specific reservation is one in which the user does care.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
> The Late Binding functionality relates only to items that are set up with specific item tracking, and it applies only to reservations against inventory, not against inbound supply orders.  
  
Reservation of item tracking numbers falls into two categories, as shown in the following table.  
  
|Reservation|Description|  
|-----------------|---------------------------------------|  
|Specific|You select a specific serial or lot number when you reserve the inventory item from a demand, such as a sales order.<br /><br /> This is a regular reservation. It is a rigid link between supply and demand that both carry serial or lot numbers. **Note:**  The demand carries serial or lot numbers. <br /><br /> For example, you want to reserve a can of blue paint from Lot A, because the customer requests it. A can of blue paint from Lot A is shipped to the customer.|  
|Nonspecific|You do not select a specific serial or lot number when you reserve the inventory item from a demand, such as a sales order.<br /><br /> This is a state that is imposed on a reservation entry for serial or lot numbers that are not selected specifically. **Note:**  The demand does not carry serial or lot numbers. <br /><br /> For example, you want to reserve a can of blue paint from any lot for your sales order. A can of blue paint from a random serial or lot number is shipped to the customer.|  
  
The main difference between specific and nonspecific reservation is defined by the existence of serial or lot numbers on the demand side, as shown in the following table.  

| Type            | Supply                | Demand                   |
|-----------------|-----------------------|--------------------------|
| **Specific**    | Serial or lot number. | Serial or lot number.    |
| **Nonspecific** | Serial or lot number. | No serial or lot number. |
  
When you reserve inventory quantities from an outbound document line for an item that has item tracking numbers assigned and is set up for specific item tracking, the **Reservation** page leads you through different workflows depending on your need for the serial or lot numbers.  
  
## Specific Reservation  
When you choose **Reserve** from the outbound document line, a dialog box appears that asks you if you want to reserve specific serial or lot numbers. If you choose **Yes**, then a list is displayed with all the serial or lot numbers that are assigned to the document line. The **Reservation** page opens after you select one of the serial or lot numbers, and you can then reserve among the selected serial or lot numbers in a typical fashion.  
  
If some of the specific item tracking numbers that you are trying to reserve are held in nonspecific reservations, then a message at the bottom of the **Reservation** page informs you how many of the total reserved quantity are held in nonspecific reservations and whether they are still available.  
  
## Nonspecific Reservation  
If you choose **No** in the dialog box that appears, the **Reservation** page opens and allows you to reserve among all serial or lot numbers in inventory.  
  
Because of the structure of the reservation system, when you place a nonspecific reservation on an item-tracked item, the system must select specific item ledger entries to reserve against. Because the item ledger entries carry the item tracking numbers, the reservation indirectly reserves specific serial or lot numbers, even though you did not intend to. To handle this situation, the reservation system tries to reshuffle nonspecific reservation entries before posting.  
  
The system actually still reserves against specific entries, but then it uses a reshuffling mechanism whenever there is specific demand for the lot or serial number in the nonspecific reservation. This can be the case when you post a demand transaction, such as a sales order, consumption journal, or transfer order, for the serial or lot number, or when you try to specifically reserve the serial or lot number. The system reshuffles the reservations to make the lot or serial number available to the demand or to the specific reservation, thereby placing a different lot or serial number in the nonspecific reservation. If there is insufficient quantity in inventory, the system reshuffles as much as possible, and you receive an availability error if there is still insufficient quantity at the time of posting.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  On a nonspecific reservation the lot number or serial number field is blank in the reservation entry that points at the demand, such as the sale.  
  
## Reshuffle  
When a user posts an outbound document after picking the wrong serial or lot number, other nonspecific reservations are reshuffled to reflect the actual serial or lot number that is picked. This satisfies the posting engine with a fixed application between supply and demand.  
  
For all supported business scenarios, reshuffling  is possible only against positive item ledger entries that carry reservation and serial or lot numbers but without defined serial or lot numbers on the demand side.  
  
## Supported Business Scenarios  
The Late Binding functionality supports the following business scenarios:  
  
* Entering a specific serial or lot number on an outbound document with nonspecific reservation of a wrong serial or lot number.  
* Reserving a specific serial or lot number.  
* Posting an outbound document with nonspecific reservation of a serial or lot number.  
  
### Entering Serial or Lot Numbers on an Outbound Document with Wrong Nonspecific Reservation  
This is the most common of the three supported scenarios. In this case, the Late Binding functionality ensures that a user can enter a serial or lot number, which is actually picked, on an outbound document that already has a nonspecific reservation of another serial or lot number.  
  
For example, the need arises when an order processor has first made a nonspecific reservation of any serial or lot number. Later when the item is actually picked from inventory, the picked serial or lot number must be entered on the order before it is posted. The nonspecific reservation is reshuffled at posting time to ensure that the picked serial or lot number can be entered without losing the reservation and to ensure that the picked serial or lot number can be fully applied and posted.  
  
### Reserve Specific Serial or Lot Numbers  
In this business scenario, Late Binding functionality ensures that a user who is trying to reserve a particular serial or lot number that is currently nonspecifically reserved can do so. A nonspecific reservation is reshuffled at the time of reservation to free the serial or lot number for the specific request.  
  
The reshuffle happens automatically, but embedded Help is displayed at the bottom of the **Reservation** page and shows the following text:  
  
**XX of the Total Reserved Quantity are nonspecific and may be available.**  
  
In addition, the **Nonspecific Reserved Qty.** field shows how many reservation entries are nonspecific. By default, this field is not visible to users.  
  
### Posting an Outbound Document with Nonspecific Reservation of Serial or Lot Numbers  
This business scenario is supported with Late Binding functionality that enables fixed application and outbound posting of what is actually picked by reshuffling another nonspecific reservation of a serial or lot number. If reshuffling is not possible, then the following standard error message appears when the user tries to post the shipment:  
  
**Item XX cannot be fully applied.**

# Calculate order promising dates

A company must be able to inform their customers of order delivery dates. The **Order Promising Lines** page enables you to do this from a sales order.  

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates shipment and delivery dates based on an item’s known and expected availability dates, which you can promise to customers.  

If you specify a requested delivery date on a sales order line, then that date is used as the starting point for the following calculations:  

- requested delivery date - shipping time = planned shipment date  
- planned shipment date - outbound whse. handling time = shipment date  

If the items are available to pick on the shipment date, then the sales process can continue. If the items aren't available to be picked on the shipment date, then a stock-out warning is displayed.  

If you don't specify a requested delivery date on a sales order line, or if the requested delivery date can't be met, then the earliest date on which that the items are available is calculated. That date is then entered in the **Shipment Date** field on the line, and the date on which you plan to ship the items and the date on which they'll be delivered to the customer are calculated using the following calculations:  

- shipment date + outbound whse. handling time = planned shipment date  
- planned shipment date + shipping time = planned delivery date  

## About order promising

The Order Promising functionality enables you to promise an order to be shipped or delivered on a specific date. The date that an item is available to promise or capable to promise is calculated, and order lines are created for those dates that you accept. The functionality calculates the earliest possible date that an item is available for shipment or delivery. It also creates requisition lines, in case the items must first be purchased or produced, for those dates that you accept.

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses two fundamental concepts:  

- Available to Promise (ATP)  
- Capable to Promise (CTP)  

### Available to promise

Available to promise (ATP) calculates dates based on the reservation system. It performs an availability check of the unreserved quantities in inventory about planned production, purchases, transfers, and sales returns. Based on this information, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates the delivery date of the customer’s order because the items are available, either in inventory or on planned receipts.  

### Capable to promise

Capable to promise (CTP) assumes a “what if” scenario, which only applies to item quantities that aren't in inventory or on scheduled orders. Based on this scenario, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates the earliest date that the item can be available if it's to be produced, purchased, or transferred.

#### Example

If there's an order for 10 pieces, and 6 pieces are available in inventory or on scheduled orders, then the capable to promise calculation will be based on 4 pieces.

### Calculations

When [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates the customer’s delivery date, it performs two tasks:  

- Calculates the earliest delivery date when the customer hasn't requested a specific delivery date.  
- Verifies if the delivery date requested by the customer or promised to the customer is realistic.  

If the customer doesn't request a specific delivery date, the shipment date is set to equal the work date, and availability is then based on that date. If the item is in inventory, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates forward in time to determine when the order can be delivered. This is accomplished by the following formulas:  

- Shipment Date + Outbound Warehouse Handling Time = Planned Shipment Date  
- Planned Shipment Date + Shipping Time = Planned Delivery Date  

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] then verifies if the calculated delivery date is realistic by calculating backward in time to determine when the item must be available to meet the promised date. This is accomplished by the following formulas:  

- Planned Delivery Date - Shipping Time = Planned Shipment Date  
- Planned Shipment Date - Outbound Warehouse Handling = Shipment Date  

The shipment date is used to make the availability check. If the item is available on this date, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] confirms that the requested/promised delivery can be met by setting the planned delivery date to equal the requested/promised delivery date. If the item is unavailable, it returns a blank date and the order processor can then use the CTP functionality.  

Based on new dates and times, all related dates are calculated according to the formulas listed earlier in this section. The CTP calculation takes longer but it gives an accurate date when the customer can expect to have the item delivered. The dates that are calculated from CTP are presented in the **Planned Delivery Date** and **Earliest Shipment Date** fields on the **Order Promising Lines** page.  

The order processor finishes the CTP process by accepting the dates. This means that a planning line and a reservation entry are created for the item before the calculated dates to ensure that the order is fulfilled.  

In addition to the external order promising that you can perform on the **Order Promising Lines** page, you can also promise internal or external delivery dates for bill-of-material items. For more information, see [View the Availability of Items](inventory-how-availability-overview.md).

## To set up order promising

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Order Promising Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Enter a number and time unit code in the **Offset(Time)** field. Select one of the following codes.  

    |Code|Description|  
    |----------|-----------------|  
    |**d**|Calendar day|  
    |**w**|Week|  
    |**m**|Month|  
    |**q**|Quarter|  
    |**y**|Year|  

    For example, "3w" indicates that the offset time is three weeks. To indicate the current period, prefix to any of these codes with the letter “c”. For example, if you want the offset time to be the current month, enter **cm**.  
3. Enter a number series in the **Order Promising Nos.** field by selecting a line from the list on the **No. Series** page.  
4. Enter an order promising template in the **Order Promising Template** field by selecting a line from the list on the **Req. Worksheet Template List** page.  
5. Enter a requisition worksheet in the **Order Promising Worksheet** field by selecting a line from the list on the **Req. Wksh. Names** page.

### Inbound and outbound warehouse handling times in order promising

If you want to include warehouse handling time in the order promising calculation on the purchase line, on the **Inventory Setup** page you can specify a default handling time to use on sales and purchase documents. You can also enter specific times for each of your locations on the **Location Card** page. 

#### To enter default inbound and outbound warehouse handling times for sales and purchase documents

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Inventory Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **General** FastTab, in the **Inbound Whse. Handling Time** and **Outbound Whse. Handling Time** fields, enter the number of days that you want to include in the order promising calculations.  

#### To enter inbound and outbound warehouse handling times on locations

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Location**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Open the relevant location card.  
3.  On the **Warehouse** FastTab, in the **Inbound Whse. Handling Time** and **Outbound Whse. Handling Time** fields, enter the number of days that you want to be included in the order promising calculations.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  When you are creating a purchase order, if you choose **Location** in the **Ship-to** field on the **Shipping and Payment** FastTab, and then choose a location in the **Location Code** field, the **Outbound Whse. Handling Time** and **Inbound Whse. Handling Time** fields will use the handling time specified for the location. For sales orders, the same is true if you choose a location in the **Location Code** field. If no handling time is specified for the location, the **Outbound Whse. Handling Time** and **Inbound Whse. Handling Time** fields will be blank. If you leave the **Location Code** field blank on sales and purchase documents, the calculation uses the handling time specified on the **Inventory Setup**  page.

## To make an item critical

Before an item can be included in the order promising calculation, it must be marked as critical. This setup ensures that non-critical items don't cause irrelevant order promising calculations.   
1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Open the relevant item card.  
3.  On the **Planning** FastTab, select the **Critical** field.  

## To calculate an order promising date

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Order**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Open the relevant sales order and select the sales order lines that you want application to calculate.  
3.  Choose the **Order Promising** action, and then choose the **Order Promising Lines** action.  
4.  Select a line, and then select one of the following options:  

    - Select **Available-to-Promise** if you want to calculate the earliest date that the item will be available with respect to inventory, scheduled receipts, and gross requirements.  
    - Select **Capable-to-Promise** if you know that the item is presently out of stock and you want to calculate the earliest date that the item can be available by issuing new replenishment requisitions.  
5.  Choose the **Accept** button to accept the earliest shipment date available.

# Consolidate financial data from multiple companies

Some organizations use [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in multiple business units or legal entities. Others use [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in subsidiaries that must report into parent organizations. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] gives accountants tools that help them transfer general ledger entries from two or more companies (subsidiaries) into a consolidated company.  

Each company involved in a consolidation is called a business unit. The company in which you combine the data is called the consolidated company.  

You can transfer financial data from subsidiaries to the consolidated company, even if the subsidiaries use [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in different environments. To learn more about how to connect to other environments, go to [Set Up Company Consolidation](finance-consolidated-company-reporting-setup.md#busunit).

If the financial statements of a business unit use a different currency than the consolidated company, you must set up exchange rates for consolidation. To learn more about exchange rates for consolidations, go to [Set Up Company Consolidation](finance-consolidated-company-reporting-setup.md#exchrates).  

You can consolidate:  

* Across companies that have different charts of accounts.  
* Companies that use different fiscal years and different currencies.  
* Either the full amount or a percentage of a company's financial information.
* Using different currency exchange rates in individual G/L accounts.
* Companies in other accounting and business management programs.
* Companies in different [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] environments.

You set up the consolidated company in the same way that you set up other companies. The chart of accounts is independent of the chart of accounts in the business units. The chart of accounts in the business units can differ from one another. To learn more about setting up a consolidation, go to [Set Up Company Consolidation](finance-consolidated-company-reporting-setup.md).  

> [!TIP]
> Consolidating financial data can be especially relevant for intercompany processes. To learn more about intercompany features, go to [Managing Intercompany Transactions](intercompany-manage.md).

## Consolidate data

Before you consolidate, it's a good idea to test your data before you transfer it to the consolidated company. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] looks for differences in the information in the business units and the consolidated company. For example, whether account numbers or dimension codes are different. Correct any errors you find before you run the report. You can test the database or, if you're importing data from an XML file, the file.

### Test the data before you consolidate

1. Open the consolidated company.  
2. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Business Units**, and then choose the related link.  
3. Test the file and database, as follows:  

    * To test a file, choose the **Test File** action, enter the name of the file to test, and then choose **Print**.  
    * To test the database, choose **Test Database**.  

### Run the consolidation

After you've tested the data, you can transfer it to the consolidated company. An assisted setup guide will help you through the process.

> [!NOTE]
> When you run the consolidation you can choose the companies to include. If your consolidated company doesn't have access to one or more subsidiaries, the guide will let you grant access to them.

1. Sign in to the consolidated company.  
2. On the **Business Units** page, choose the **Consolidate** action.  
3. Fill in the required fields.  

## Use the Consolidated Trial Balance report

The **Consolidated Trial Balance** report can give you an overview of the overall financial health of your business. The report combines general ledger entries from each of your companies in a new company that you created for the consolidated data. The consolidated company is just a container for the consolidated data, and doesn't have any live business data. The companies that you include in the consolidated company become **Business Units** in the report. If you have four business units or fewer, you can also use the **Consolidated Trial Balance (4)** report.  

The report shows a line for each account, and follows the structure of the chart of accounts. An account isn't shown if all the amounts on the line are 0. The report shows the following information for each account:

* The account number and the name of the account.
* The totals for the consolidated company and for each business unit. Totals can display either as a net change or the balance to date.
* The eliminations made in the consolidated company. Eliminations always show for a period corresponding to the consolidated company's fiscal year.
* The total for the consolidated company after the eliminations show either as a net change or the balance to date.

## Eliminate repeated transactions

After you consolidate the companies, you must find and eliminate any transactions that are recorded more than once across companies. Processing consolidation eliminations is a manual process.  

To eliminate repeated transactions:

1. Find transactions that might need to be adjusted, and enter general journal lines to eliminate them.
2. Run the **G/L Consolidation Eliminations** report to help you assess the effect of the general journal lines before posting.
3. Post the adjusting transactions.

The **G/L Consolidation Eliminations** report displays a tentative trial balance where you can simulate the consequences of eliminating entries. The report compares the entries in the consolidated company with the eliminations entered in the general journal.

Before you can include a business unit in the report, you must set up the unit on the **Business Units** page. Make sure to turn on the **Consolidate** toggle.

A line is created for each account, following the structure of the chart of accounts. An account isn't shown if all amounts on the line are 0. The report shows the following information for each account:

* Account number.
* Account name.
* If you selected one or more business unit codes in the **Business Unit Code** field on the request page, a total shown for the consolidated company excludes the selected business units and eliminations. If you didn't fill in **Business Unit Code** field, the total for the consolidated company excludes eliminations.
* If you selected a business unit code in the **Business Unit Code** field on the request page, a total shows for the imported entries from the business unit. If you didn't fill in the **Business Unit Code** field, a total shows for the posted eliminations in the consolidated company.
* The total for the consolidated company with all the business units and all posted eliminations.
* The eliminations to make in the consolidated company. That is, the entries in the general journal that is selected on the request page.
* The posting text copied from the general journal.
* The consolidated company's total after the eliminations, if they're posted.

## Export and import consolidated data between databases

If data for a business unit is in another database, you can do a manual file-based transfer or automate the process by using an API. To learn more about the API, go to [Use our API to automatically share data across environments](#use-our-api-to-automatically-share-data-across-environments).

This section describes the manual, file-based process.

You export the data to a file before you include it in the consolidation. Export each company separately by using the **Export Consolidation** batch job.  

> [!TIP]
> Use the same process to export consolidated data that you must submit to Dynamics 365 Finance. For example, if the business unit is a subsidiary and the parent company uses Dynamics 365 Finance.

After you run the batch job, all entries in general ledger accounts are processed. For every combination of selected dimensions and date, the contents of the entries' **Amount** fields are totaled and exported. The next combination of the selected dimensions and date with the same account number is processed. Then the combinations in the next account number are processed, and so on.  

The exported entries contain the following fields: **Account No.**, **Posting Date**, and **Amount**. If dimensions information was also exported, dimension codes and dimension values are also included.  

1. For each exported line, if the total of the **Amount** fields is a debit, the account number that is set up in the business unit's **Consol. Debit Acc.** field is exported to the line. If the total is a credit, the corresponding number in the **Consol. Credit Acc.** field is exported to the line.  
2. The date used for each exported line is either the period's ending date or, if the transfer occurs each day, the exact date of the calculation.  
3. The dimension value exported for the entry will be the consolidated company dimension value that is specified in the **Consolidation Code** field for that dimension value. If a consolidated company dimension value hasn't been entered in the **Consolidated Code** field for the dimension value, the dimension value itself will be exported to the line.  
4. The XML files also contain the currency exchange rates in the consolidation period. These rates are included in a separate section at the beginning of the file.  

## Use our API to automatically share data across environments

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides an API that let's you automate the process of sharing financial data from business units to the consolidated company. The API is free to use and easy to set up. It even let's you share data across [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] environments. For example, you might need to share across environments when business units are not in the same Azure geographies. To learn more about using the API to automate the consolidation process, go to [Set Up Company Consolidation](finance-consolidated-company-reporting-setup.md#busunit).

# Set up prices and discounts

> [!NOTE]
> In 2020 release wave 2, we released streamlined processes for setting up and managing prices and discounts. If you're a new customer using that version, you're using the new experience. If you're an existing customer, whether you're using the new experience depends on whether your admin enabled the **New sales pricing experience** feature update on the **Feature Management** page. To learn more, go to [Enabling Upcoming Features Ahead of Time](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/feature-management).

Price and discount strategies for the purchase and sale of items and services are fundamental tools for successful businesses. After you set up the items and services your company buys and sells, you can define what you pay or charge for them. When you select the item or service on sales and purchase documents, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] adds the amounts.

## Setting up prices and discounts

Before you create price lists, you must define your pricing and discount strategies on the **Sales & Receivables Setup** and **Purchase & Payables Setup** pages.

You can set up and use two types of discounts:

| Discount Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Line Discount** |A discount amount that is given for lines on sales and purchase documents. Typically, line discounts are based on a combination of customer, item, minimum quantity, unit of measure, or period of time that you define for sales and purchases on the **Sales & Receivables Setup** and **Purchase & Payables Setup** pages.|
| **Invoice Discount** |A discount percentage that is subtracted from sales and purchase document total if the sum of all lines on the document exceeds a certain minimum. |

Because sales prices and sales line discounts are based on a combination of item and customer, you can also set them up on the items to which the rules and values apply.

> [!TIP]  
> If an item should never be sold with a discount, leave the discount fields on the item empty, and don't include the item in any line discount setups.

## About price lists

Price lists are flexible and let you specify the business partner or activity that they apply to. For example, you can set up one price list that applies to all vendors and customers, or offer special prices or discounts for each business partner. Special prices or discounts are often based on a minimum quantity on purchase or sales orders, periods of time, or a certain combination of customer, item, minimum quantity, and unit of measure. The prices and discounts you define automatically apply to purchase and sales documents.

## Set up prices

These steps differ, depending on whether your admin turned on the **New sales pricing experience** feature update.

### [Current Experience](#tab/current-experience)  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customers**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the customer, and then choose the **Prices** action.
3. Fill in the fields on the line as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)] Fill a line for each combination that grants a special sales price to the customer.

### [New Experience](#tab/new-experience)  

You can add items and services manually for each line, or you can use the **Suggest Lines** action to create new prices for selected items, item discount groups, resources, and other product types. If you choose **Suggest Lines**, on the **Price Lines - Create New** page you can use filters to select the items or services to include on the price list. You can also specify whether to consider other factors, such as:

* A minimum quantity when calculating prices.
* The adjustment factor to apply for new price list lines.
* The rounding method to apply for prices.

[!INCLUDE [edit-in-excel-price-list](includes/edit-in-excel-price-list.md)]

By default, the status of new price lists is **Draft**. When you're ready to start using the list, you can change the status to **Active**.

To review price lists and prices that apply for specific customers or vendors, on the **Customer** or **Vendor** pages, choose either **Sales Price Lists** or **Purchase Price Lists** action. For items and resources, you can view price list lines by choosing **Sales Prices** or **Purchase Prices** on the **Item** and **Resource** pages.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customers**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the customer, and then choose the **Sales Price Lists** action.
3. Choose **New** to create a new sales price list.
4. On the **General** and **Tax** FastTabs, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
5. Add items to the list in one of the following ways:
   * To add many items, choose **Suggest Lines**, and then enter filter criteria to specify the types of items to add. Optionally, you can enter settings for the items that are specific to the price list. You can change the settings later, if needed.
   * To copy items from another price list, choose **Copy Lines**, and then choose the price list to copy.
   * To add items manually, in the **Product Type** field, choose the type of product that the price list is for. Depending on your selection, fill in the remaining fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
6. To start using the price list, in the **Status** field, choose **Active**.

## Work with invoice discounts and service charges

When you use invoice discounts, the size of the invoice amount determines the size of the discount that is granted. On the **Invoice Discounts** page, you can also add a service charge to invoices over a certain amount.

Before you can use invoice discounts with sales, you must enter certain information in application. You must decide which customers you want to grant this type of discount, and the discount percentages.  

If you want [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to automatically calculate invoice discounts, turn on the **Calc. Inv. Discount** toggle on the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page.  

For each customer, you can specify whether you grant invoice discounts if the requirement is satisfied (that is, if the invoice amount is large enough). You can define the terms of the invoice discount in local currency for domestic customers and in foreign currency for foreign customers.  

You link discount percentages to specific invoice amounts on the **Invoice Discounts** page. You can enter as many percentages as you need. Each customer can have their own page, or you can link several customers to the same page.  

In addition to (or instead of) a discount percentage, you can link a service charge amount to a specific invoice amount.  

> [!TIP]  
> Before you start entering this information, it's a good idea to prepare your discount structure beforehand, so it's easier to see which customers to link to the same invoice discount page. For more information about discounts in sales, see [Set up discounts for your customers](/training/modules/customer-discounts-dynamics-365-business-central/index).

### To set up an invoice discount for a customer

After you decide which customers are eligible for invoice discounts, enter the invoice discount code on the customer cards and set up the terms for each code.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customers**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the customer page for a customer that's eligible for invoice discounts.
3. In the **Invoice Disc. Code** field, select a customer for which you specified the invoice discount terms to use to calculate invoice discounts.

> [!NOTE]  
> Invoice discount codes are the discount term settings for a customer, which can save you time. You can quickly assign invoice discount terms to customers by reusing the settings from another customer.

Proceed to set up new the sales invoice discount terms.

1. On the **Customers** page, choose the **Invoice Discounts** action. The **Cust. Invoice Discounts** page opens.
2. In the **Currency Code** field, enter the code for a currency that the invoice discount terms on the line applies to. Leave the field blank to set up invoice discount terms in USD.
3. In the **Minimum Amount** field, enter the minimum amount that an invoice must have to be eligible for the discount.
4. In the **Discount %** field, enter the invoice discount as a percentage of the invoice amount.
5. Repeat steps 2 through 4 for each currency that the customer uses.

The invoice discount is now set up and assigned to the customer. When you select the customer code in the **Invoice Disc. Code** field on other customer cards, the same invoice discount is assigned to those customers.

## To copy sales prices

These steps differ, depending on whether your admin turned on the **New sales pricing experience** feature update.

### [Current Experience](#tab/current-experience/)

To copy sales prices, such as an individual customer's sales prices, to use for a customer price group, you must run the **Suggest Sales Price on Wksh.** batch job on the **Sales Price Worksheet** page.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Price Worksheet**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **Suggest Sales Price on Wksh.** action.  
3. On the **Sales Prices** FastTab, fill in the **Sales Type** and **Sales Code** fields with the original sales prices you want to copy.  
4. In the top section of the request page, fill in the **Sales Type** and **Sales Code** fields with the type and name you want the sales prices copied to.  
5. If you want the batch job to create new prices, select the **Create New Prices** check box.  
6. Choose the **OK** button to fill in the lines on the **Sales Price Worksheet** page with the suggested new prices, indicating that they're valid for the selected sales type.  

   > [!NOTE]  
   > This batch job only creates suggestions and it doesn't implement the suggested changes. If you're satisfied with the suggestions and want to implement them, that is insert them on the **Sales Prices** page, choose the **Implement Price Changes** action on the **Sales Price Worksheet** page.

### [New Experience](#tab/new-experience/)

The status of the price list must be **Draft**.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Price Lists**, and then choose the related link. 
2. Choose the price list to copy, and then choose **Copy Lines**.
3. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

   > [!NOTE]
   > You can't have two lines that have the same settings but different prices. If that happens, a message displays when you activate a price list. You can choose the price to use by opening the list and deleting the incorrect price.  
  
---

## To bulk update item prices

These steps differ, depending on whether your administrator turned on the **New sales pricing experience** feature update.

### [Current Experience](#tab/current-experience/)

If you want to bulk update item prices, such as increase all item prices by some percentage, you must run the **Suggest Item Price on Wksh.** batch job. You can find a link to the batch job on the **Sales Price Worksheet** page.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Price Worksheet**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **Suggest Item Price on Wksh.** action.  
3. On the **Item** FastTab, fill in the **No.** or **Inventory Posting Group** or other fields with the original item prices you want to update.  
4. In the top section of the request page, fill in the **Sales Type** and **Sales Code** with the type and name you want the sales prices copied to.
5. If you want the batch job to automatically adjust suggested item prices, enter adjustment in **Adjustment Factor** field. For example, you would enter 1.15 in **Adjustment Factor** for 15% increase in item price.  
6. If you want the batch job to create new prices, select the **Create New Prices** field.  
7. Choose the **OK** button to fill in the lines on the **Sales Price Worksheet** page with the suggested new prices, indicating that they're valid for the selected **Item**.  

> [!NOTE]
> This batch job only creates suggestions and it doesn't implement the suggested changes. If you're satisfied with the suggestions and want to implement them, that is insert them in the **Sales Prices** table, you can use the **Implement Price Changes** batch job, which is found on the **Actions** tab, in the **Functions** group, on the **Sales Price Worksheet** page.

### [New Experience](#tab/new-experience/)

To update prices for multiple items, you must create a new price list, and then copy the lines from an existing price list. When you copy the lines you can use filters to specify what to copy, and you can specify an integer or decimal number in the **Adjustment Factor** field to increase or decrease prices. The price list must be in the **Draft** status. If needed, you can then deactivate the old price list.

> [!NOTE]
> You can't have two lines that have the same settings but different prices. If that happens, a message displays when you activate a price list. You can choose the price to use by opening the list and deleting the incorrect price.

## Calculating the best price

When you record special prices and line discounts for sales and purchases, [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] optimizes your profit. It automatically calculates the best price on sales and purchase documents, and on job and item journal lines. To learn more, go to [Best Price Calculation](sales-how-record-sales-price-discount-payment-agreements.md#best-price-calculation).

# Multiple Contracts
Depending on your service level agreements with a customer, you may have to handle a service item under more than one service contract.  
  
By handling a service item under multiple contracts, you can do the following:  
  
* Issue different contracts for the same service item.  
* Service parts separately.  
* Consider different skills that are required to service different aspects of a service item, such as mechanical components and software.  
* Specify different response times and frequencies in servicing different parts of a service item.  
* Address different kinds of activities to be performed on a service item when the service item requires different types of service in different time periods.  
* Select and assign an appropriate contract number to a service item line when you are creating a service order.  
* Handle relevant financial information about service items and service level agreements.  
  
You can consider the following examples of using the multiple contracts functionality.  
  
## Creating Multiple Contracts per Service Item  
You can manually create a service contract or contract quote for service items already registered in non-canceled contracts owned by the same customer. To do this, follow the standard procedure of creating service contracts and service contract quotes. For more information, see [Work with Service Contracts and Service Contract Quotes](service-how-to-create-service-contracts-and-service-contract-quotes.md).  
  
When you add a service item on a contract line that is registered in other service contracts or contract quotes, a warning message is displayed stating that the service item already belongs to one or more service contracts or contract quotes. If you confirm this message, all relevant service item information is copied to a newly created contract line.  
  
## Copying Documents  
You can automatically create a service contract or contract quote for service items that are already registered in other service contracts or contract quotes by using the **Copy from Document** action.  
  
## Creating Service Orders for Multiple Contracts  
You can manually create a service order for a service item that is registered in multiple active contracts. A service contract is active when it is signed and not expired.

# Work with recurring revenue in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]

Many companies are moving from a business revenue model where revenue is made from a customer's one-time purchase to a subscription model where revenue is made on a recurring basis in return for consistent access to the delivery of a good or service.
[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] has the following options for automating how you send subscription invoices to your customers and register recurring revenue. 

## Register revenue with a recurring general journal

A recurring journal is a general journal with specific fields for managing transactions that you post frequently with few or no changes, such as rent, subscriptions, electricity, or heat. Using these fields for recurring transactions, you can post both fixed and variable amounts. 
With a recurring journal, entries that are posted regularly need to be typed in only once. That is, the accounts, dimensions and dimension values, and so on, that you enter will remain in the journal after posting. If any adjustments are necessary, you can make them with each posting.

### Why use this option

With this option, you define flexible invoicing periods with [Date Formulas](ui-enter-date-ranges.md#use-date-formulas).

However, with this option, you can't print and send invoices in the default version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

For more information, see [Work with Recurring Journals](ui-work-general-journals.md#work-with-recurring-journals).  

## Create multiple invoices based on a recurring project journal

The recurring job journal is a more advanced alternative to the general journal. You define Items, Resources, and G/L Accounts that must be repeated for each job and you specify the frequency of recurrence.  

After posting a recurring project journal, you can create multiple invoices with the **Create Job Sales Invoice** task. You can review and post created invoices in the **Sales Invoices** page.

### Why use this option

With this option, you follow the standard invoicing procedure with all the benefits of that, including standard and customer layouts for communication preferences. You can also define prices for each project individually.

However, for each new customer, you must create a new project and add lines to the recurring journal. 

For more information, see [Create project journal lines](projects-how-record-job-usage.md#to-create-project-journal-lines-manually) and [Create multiple project sales invoices](projects-how-invoice-jobs.md#to-create-multiple-project-sales-invoices).

## Create multiple invoices based on recurring sales lines

If you often need to create sales and purchase lines with similar information, you can set up recurring sales lines that you can then insert on recurring sales and purchase documents, for example, for recurring replenishment orders. Use the **Create Recurring Sales Invoices** batch job to create sales invoices according to recurring sales lines that are assigned to the customers and with posting dates within the valid-from and valid-to dates that you specify on the recurring sales lines.  

### Why use this option

With this option, you can assign the same recurring lines to multiple customers. You can define period of validity for the recurring sales lines for specific customer. You can assign multiple recurring lines to the same customer and all of them will be included in the invoice.

However, there's no way to set fixed prices for items because [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will use the actual prices and discount valid on document date, trying to find best combination that gives the lowest price.  

For more information, see [Create Recurring Sales and Purchase Lines](sales-how-work-standard-lines.md).

## Recurring invoices with service contract

A service contract contains the service contract agreements between your customers and your company. A service contract includes service level agreements and the service items that you service as a part of the contract.  

You can define the starting date of the contract, the invoice period, whether or not the contract is prepaid, price update specifications if you plan to change prices while contract is active. You can use both service items or items in service contract lines.
You can create contract templates to define how to create certain types of contracts.  

### Why use this option

With this option, you use a part of the advanced service management functionality that not limited to issuing of recurring invoices but support repair shop and field service operations.

However, this option requires the Premium license. Setting up service management and maintaining it might not give huge advantages in simpler subscription scenarios.  

For more information, see [Work with Service Contracts and Service Contract Quotes](service-how-to-create-service-contracts-and-service-contract-quotes.md) and [Invoice several service contracts](service-how-create-invoices.md#to-invoice-several-service-contracts).

## Related features
There are several related capabilities in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

### Blanket sales orders

A blanket sales order represents a framework for a long-term agreement between your company and your customer.
A blanket order is typically made when a customer has committed to purchasing large quantities that are to be delivered in several smaller shipments over a certain period of time. Often blanket orders cover only one item with predetermined delivery dates. The main reason for using a blanket order rather than a sales order is that quantities entered on a blanket order don't affect item availability, however it can be used for planning purposes.

#### Why use this option

With this option, you use the anticipated demand, so the information is considered during the normal planning routines. For more information, see [Demand Forecasts and Blanket Orders](design-details-central-concepts-of-the-planning-system.md#demand-forecasts-and-blanket-orders).  

However, the default version doesn't offer an out-of-the-box possibility to process multiple blanket orders in bulk.

For more information, see [Work with Blanket Sales Orders](sales-how-to-create-blanket-sales-orders.md).

### Recurring Orders (Norway)

You can use recurring orders to create blanket order templates so that sales orders can be created based on date intervals that you define. For example, if you deliver the same sales order every two weeks, you can use a blanket sales order and create recurring orders.
You can use recurring groups to define a range of parameters that show how you make the orders. These groups are assigned to blanket orders that have to be created regularly. To create the recurring orders, you'll have to periodically run the create recurring orders process. 

#### Why use this option

With this option, you can choose between fixed and "best" prices.

However, this is only available in Norway. Validity period can be defined on the recurring group level.

For more information, see [Recurring Orders](LocalFunctionality/Norway/recurring-orders.md).

### Recurring revenue and subscription billing by other providers

At [AppSource.microsoft.com](https://appsource.microsoft.com/), you can get extensions for Business Central. Some extensions are provided by Microsoft, and other extensions are provided by other companies. The list of the extensions by other companies grows each month. So keep an eye out for [AppSource.microsoft.com](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2081646) and get apps to help you in your work in Business Central.

# Use Approval Workflows

A workflow is a sequence of tasks triggered by an action, a condition, or a rule. Workflows are usually implemented to integrate business logic into an organization, such as the separation of duties, unifying processes, or to apply best practices.

The workflows can be designed to create requests for approval of a record field change while keeping the old data in case the request isn't approved. The new value won't be implemented until the last request is approved.

The business logic could be the approval of:

- New master data such as general ledger (G/L) accounts, customers, vendors, or items.
- Changes to fields in existing records containing sensitive information, such as **Vendor Bank Account No.** or **Customer Credit Limit**.
- Changes to fields in existing records containing business critical information, such as **Item Sales Prices**.
- New users or changes to user permissions.
- Purchase documents.
- Sales documents.
- Incoming documents.
- Finance journals prior to posting.

The following illustration is example of a workflow with sequential approval triggered by a user. By triggering the workflow, an approval request is created for the first approver.  

![Illustration of a workflow with sequential approval.](media/Workflows/approval-flow.png)

You see in the illustration above how the request must be approved by the first approver before it's sent on to the next one. If the request isn't approved by the first approver, the request will never go to the next.

The route taken from the initial triggering of the workflow can vary depending on the nature of the approval.  

The following illustration shows a parallel approval triggered by the user. A parallel approval means the approval request is sent to all approvers simultaneously.  

![Illustration of a workflow with parallel approval.](media/Workflows/approval-flow-2.png)

However, the workflow isn't concluded until all requests have been approved, as shown in the following illustration:  

![Illustration of a rejected workflow with parallel approval.](media/Workflows/approval-flow-3.png)

> [!NOTE]  
> For a workflow with multiple approvers, all approvers must approve each step before the workflow can move forward to the next event. Approval from just one approver will not move the workflow forward.

You can set up and use workflows that connect business-process tasks performed by different users. It's also possible to create the same workflow more than once. Each workflow can be triggered by an event using different filters. This is useful if an approval request for one department must be approved by one approver, while requests for other departments must be approved by a different approver. System tasks, such as automatic posting, can be included as steps in workflows, preceded or followed by user tasks. Requesting and granting approval to create new records are typical workflow steps.  

Before you can begin using workflows, you must set up workflow users, create the workflows (potentially preceded by code customization), and specify how users receive notifications. Learn more at [Setting Up Workflows](across-set-up-workflows.md).

> [!NOTE]  
> Typical workflow steps involve users requesting approval of tasks and approvers accepting or rejecting approval requests. That's why many topics about how to use workflows refer to approvals.  

 The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the articles that describe them.

# Handling Lot Sizes in Production
In terms of quantity, the number of items you produce in a production operation might not correlate to how sell them. For example, you might produce hundreds of items in a single lot, but sell each item individually. When you configure your production routes and bills of materials (BOMs), there are few nuances you should consider with regards to lot sizes. This topic describes how lot sizes impact cost calculations and resource planning.

## Units of Measure in Production Bill of Materials
Although you specify the base unit of measure (UOM) for an item, your BOM might use a different UOM for the finished product. For example, the base UOM for an item might be PCS, but your BOM might call for pallet or ton. This comes in handy when your machines or raw components dictate the volume. For example, you probably wouldn't want to bake a single muffin because it is difficult to use a portion of an egg. Instead, you bake a batch of muffins to reduce waste. For more information, see [Create Production BOMs](production-how-to-create-production-boms.md).

## Lot size on routing lines
From a routing perspective, you can specify a lot size on routing lines to align with the capacity of the machines that produce the items. The run time on routing lines is reduced proportionally to the lot size. 

This works well when the quantity on a production order is a factor of the lot size on the route. For example, if your baking sheet can hold 10 muffins, you should bake 10, 20, 30, and so on, and not 5 nor 15.  This is much less of an issue if you are dealing with large quantities.

Lot size is also popular in manufacturing environments where output is measured as quantity you can make during fixed amount of time. Example, if Volume per 9 hour shift is 25000 cubic feet, you can set run time as 9 hours and lot size as 25000.
The production order quantity becomes less important as on the production order the run time gets calculated as the Run time / Lot size to get the run time per piece.
 
> [!NOTE]
> The value defined in Lot size doesn't have impact on time specified in **Setup Time** field of the routing line. The setup will happen only one time, even if there are several lots. For example, so that you don’t need to warm the oven for the second lot of muffins. For more information, see [Create Routings](production-how-to-create-routings.md).

## Lot Sizes for Items and Stockkeeping Units
Lot sizes defined for routings are not the same as lot sizes for items or stockkeeping units. Those values are used for a different purpose, and do not affect production capacity. 

## Lot size on item and stockkeeping units
For items and stockkeeping units, lot sizes have the following effects on cost calculation and supply planning:

* For standard cost calculation, if you enable **Cost Incl Setup** on the **Manufacturing Setup** page, the cost for the setup is added to the standard cost. If you specify a lot size, the setup cost for routing operation will be reduced according to one lot size. For example, if your lot size defined on item card is 10, and it takes 15 minutes to heat the oven, the cost of the fuel will be allocated to the 10 muffins as roughly 1.5 minutes. 

> [!NOTE]
> Setup costs are handled differently from a standard cost and capacity allocation perspectives. If produced quantity doesn't match lot size defined in the item card that will lead to variation. For more information, see [Managing Inventory Costs](finance-manage-inventory-costs.md). <!--not sure that I got this part right seems to repeat the first example.-->

For supply planning, the lot size setting on items works with the **Default Dampener %** on the **Manufacturing Setup** page. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will ignore changes in demand that are below the dampener percentage and will not create planning suggestions. For example, 15 is specified in the Default Dampener % field, and we have a production order for 20 muffins to feed 20 guests, but one guest cannot attend. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will ignore the single missing guest because it's only 10% of the lot size 10 defined on the item. However, if two guests cannot make it, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will suggest that we reduce the order quantity because two is 20% of the lot size. For more information about planning, see [Planning](production-planning.md).

[!INCLUDE [ua-get-help](includes/ua-get-help.md)] These links can also access content from other websites, such as the websites of providers of any apps that are part of your [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

## Help pane

[!INCLUDE [2022_releasewave1](includes/2022_releasewave1.md)]

In [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the Help menu item (the question mark in the top-right corner) gives you access to a Help pane that can help you find answers to your questions. The Help pane has different content, depending on how you access it. The following list describes the cards that are always, or nearly always, present:  

[!INCLUDE [ua-help-pane-links-default](includes/ua-help-pane-links-default.md)]

The following list describes how you can access the Help pane and whether cards are added to it:

- Choose the Help menu item (the question mark in the top-right corner)
- Use the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>F1</kbd> keyboard shortcut from anywhere in Business Central.
- Choose the *Learn more* link on a tooltip for a field, if available. The *Learn more* link is only available in the mobile app or on custom fields (that is, fields from non-Mocrosoft extensions) in the web client.

> [!TIP]
> When you choose a link, the target article opens in a new browser tab. You can choose to un-dock the browser tab, then, so that you can view the relevant information side-by-side with [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The pane remains open while you navigate through [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] so that content you searched for remains visible.  

## Search in the Help pane

[!INCLUDE [2021_releasewave2](includes/2021_releasewave2.md)]

Use the search field at the top of the Help pane to search for guidance about how to use the product, built-in capabilities, and available training modules. Depending on your search terms, the pane shows five or more links with a short description. Choose a link, or refine your search terms. When you choose a link, the target article opens in a new browser tab. You can choose to undock the browser tab so that you can view the relevant information side-by-side with [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The pane remains open while you navigate through [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] so that content you searched for remains visible.

- [Support contacts](#support-contacts)  

> [!TIP]
> [!INCLUDE [ua-get-help](includes/ua-get-help.md)]

### Find answers

The **Find it** section provides links to the most common places to find answers to your questions. The links fall into four categories and are explained in the following subsections. Your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] partner can configure some of the links, and as a result the behavior can be slightly different.  

#### Product Help

The **Find it** section includes two links to product Help:

- Help about the page you were just viewing in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]  

  This link is automatically generated. If [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can't find the relevant link, the [landing page on Microsoft Learn](index.yml) for the default version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is shown. For example, if the page was part of an app that didn't add context-sensitive Help mapping to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the *Learn link* defaults to the landing page.  
  
- Help landing page for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]  

  The functionality in the default version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is described in the [Dynamics 365 Business Central documentation](/dynamics365/business-central) Learn more in the [Learn more using the product documentation](#learn-more-using-the-product-documentation) section. You can also extend and customize [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with apps from AppSource. All apps provide links to the relevant product Help so that you can always find guidance for the different workflows in your version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

#### Community

In the [Business Central community forum](https://community.dynamics.com/forums/thread/?groupid=e78817ab-a926-4d31-96cc-aef040a4eb04), you can submit a question and learn from other [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] community members. Partners and Microsoft employees participate in the conversations.  

If you don't yet have a partner, the Community can also help you get unblocked if you have questions. For example, if you just signed up for a trial, the Community can be a great starting point.  

#### Blog

We talk about new capabilities on [the Dynamics 365 Blog](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics-365/blog/business-leader/product/dynamics-365-business-central/), including any special considerations.  

#### Capabilities coming soon

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is updated with major feature updates every six months, and with monthly service updates. Choose the link to view the latest release plan. You can also get an overview of upcoming and recently released capabilities in [the release plans across Dynamics 365](/dynamics365/release-plans/).  

For the longer term overview, the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] [roadmap page](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/roadmap/business-central/) shows the general priorities for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in the coming years.  

### Do more with your trial

This section gives you shortcuts to the Microsoft commercial marketplace where you can find solutions and services from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] partners.

### Give feedback

Periodically, the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] team gathers feedback from our users about how satisfied they are with the product. In addition to ratings, you can also provide a written comment. By giving us specific and actionable comments, you help our engineering teams to prioritize the product improvements we invest in. You can also consent to be contacted about your comment. If you do, you're invited to a Teams meeting at a time that's convenient for you. You can provide product suggestions at any time on our [Dynamics 365 Ideas](https://aka.ms/bcideas) website.  

### Product suggestions

On the [Dynamics 365 Ideas site](https://aka.ms/bcideas) website, you can provide suggestions for new features and capabilities. Your input goes directly into Business Central's engineering backlog for investigation and prioritization.  

Make sure that you search through the list of submitted suggestions. There's a chance that someone already submitted something similar, and that entry might have already received votes. Vote if an idea already has been submitted to get it prioritized on the engineering backlog.  

### Troubleshooting

The **Troubleshooting** section shows technical information that your administrator or [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] partner can use to unblock users. The section includes information about the latest error message, the current version of your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], and a link to go to the **Page Inspection** page. Learn more in [Inspecting Pages in Business Central](across-inspect-page.md).  

To help you or your supporting partner troubleshoot, you can switch on additional logging in the **Report a Problem** section. You can then analyze the extra telemetry in the admin center or Application Insights, for example.  

As the internal administrator, you have access to the admin center where you can continue the troubleshooting. You can view telemetry, manage environments, and manage user sessions. The following articles in the administration content provide more information:

- [Finding technical information](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/manage-technical-support#finding-technical-information)

As a reslling partner, you set up the preferred support contact details in the admin center. Learn more in [Configuring the support experience](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/technical-support#configuring-the-support-experience) in the administration content.  

To alert your partner to a problem, choose the link to either send an email or open their support site in a new browser tab. You can then add the technical information about your Microsoft Entra tenant from the **Troubleshooting** section and any other information that you find relevant.  

> [!NOTE]
> The support contacts information isn't available with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises.

## Learn more using the product documentation

A large community of partners extend and customize the base version of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Each partner and many customers deploy their own Help to their own website. But you can always go to the [Dynamics 365 Business Central documentation](index.yml) site to learn more. The site hosts different types of content, such as the following content:

- [Conceptual content about business functionality](welcome.md)  
- [Documentation for developers](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-dev-overview)  
- [Free learning paths and e-learning modules across multiple user profiles](/training/dynamics365/business-central?WT.mc_id=dyn365bc_landingpage-docs)  

In this section, you can learn about how to navigate the business functionality content.  

[!INCLUDE [ua-get-help](includes/ua-get-help.md)]

### Content on the site

[This section](welcome.md) of Microsoft Learn hosts content from Microsoft that represents the *Learn more* pillar in the user assistance model. In part, the *Learn more* content intends to answer those questions that the user interface can't answer, such as the following list:

- Where does this page fits into the bigger workflow?  
- What comes next?  
- What would be the alternative?  

From inside the product, you can access this content either through the *Learn more* link in tooltips and teaching tips, or by using the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>F1</kbd> keyboard shortcut.  

The navigation panel shows the table of contents that groups articles by business area. For example, you read the article [Purchase Items for a Sale](purchasing-how-purchase-products-sale.md), and then the table of contents shows you that there's also an article called [Correct or Cancel Unpaid Purchase Invoices](purchasing-how-correct-cancel-unpaid-purchase-invoices.md). Both articles are in the group called *Purchasing*, which bundles articles that are related to the Purchasing module in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

The table of contents includes a group of content that describes [local functionality](about-localization.md) for the countries/regions that Microsoft supports. If you don’t see your country/region listed there, it’s probably because a partner localizes your country/region. Learn more at [Country/regional availability and supported languages](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/compliance/apptest-countries-and-translations).  

The local functionality content describes the capabilities in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] that can help you be compliant in the supported markets, such as tax statements and other reports. In some cases, the difference between the default version and the specific country/region version is invisible to users. In other cases, users must set up reporting or electronic invoicing in a specific way. If you can't find a description of a certain button or action in the general section, you can hopefully find it in the *Local Functionality* section.  

> [!TIP]
> On the learn.microsoft.com site as well as in the in-product search field and in the Help pane, the search results show some context for the target article. The context includes the link that might show the name of a country, or a short description that calls out a certain capability or a country/region, for example.

### Find other content

If you land on an article that doesn't answer your question, you can find other content in two ways on Microsoft Learn:

- Use the **Filter by title** field in the table of contents on the left side of the website

  This way, you can filter by words used in the titles of the various articles. For example, type *invoice*, and then choose one of the offered links, such as [Set Up Invoice Rounding](finance-set-up-invoice-rounding.md) or [Create Prepayment Invoices](finance-how-to-create-prepayment-invoices.md).  

  Underneath each link, you can see where that article is in the table of contents. That way, you can easily see if the article is in the Purchasing section or in the section for Australian local functionality, for example.  
- Use the **Search** field in the top-right corner of the website

  This way, you can search for any term. The site then searches all the content for that term or expression. Search for *invoice* again, and scroll through the list of hundreds of articles in the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] content that uses that word somewhere in the text.  

### Languages

Content about business functionality is published in several languages. When you land on Microsoft Learn from inside the product, you see the content in the same language as you specified in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], unless that language isn't available on Microsoft Learn.  

You can change the language by changing the URL, or you can use the language toggle in the bottom-left corner of the website.  

The content is authored in English and published to URLs with *en-us* as the language code. When new information is published in English, it's then sent off for translation into the supported languages. In some cases, you can't read this new content in your own language for up to four weeks, but in most cases it only takes a week or two. You can always view the latest information by switching the language to *en-us*.  

For each language, the table of contents is translated, but the content in the *Local Functionality* section is in English except for the country or region that corresponds to the current language. For example, in the Danish version of Microsoft Learn (`https://learn.microsoft.com/da-dk/dynamics365/business-central/`), you can see the entries for Australian local functionality in Danish in the table of contents, but the articles are in English. Only the articles for Danish local functionality are translated into Danish.  

### Recommended content

On Microsoft Learn, each article shows a pane with links to other articles. The **Recommended content** section is automatically generated based on how each article is used with the rest of the site. The links aren't static and change over time.

### Tell us what you think

With Microsoft Learn, each article has two buttons at the end of the article. The **This product** button sends you to the Ideas site, and the **This page** button lets you submit feedback about the content through GitHub. In both cases, you must create an account if you don't already have one. For *product feedback*, you must sign in with your work or organizational email account. For *access to GitHub*, you can use any email address when you create an account.  

We welcome your contributions, both as pull requests with suggestions or corrections to the content, and as GitHub Issues with bugs or questions. But be mindful that feedback and contributions to the *dynamics365smb-docs* repo is about the content, not about the product.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Microsoft accepts pull requests to the *dynamics365smb-docs* repo only, not the language-specific repos. If you have feedback about translations, you can report a GitHub issue in the relevant repo.  

### Navigate to other parts of the site

Microsoft Learn hosts content for other products and other types of content. Use the links at the top of the site to navigate to [Microsoft training](/training/dynamics365/business-central?WT.mc_id=dyn365bc_landingpage-docs) site or to the [Dynamics 365 release plans](/dynamics365/release-plans/), for example. You can also find a link to the
[Dynamics 365 Community](https://community.dynamics.com/) site, for example.  

## Apps and other solutions

If your [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes functionality that isn't provided by Microsoft, then the provider of that functionality also provides *Learn more* content on their own website. You can access this content in the same way as in the default version of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], such as by using the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>F1</kbd> keyboard shortcut.  

The same applies if you use [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises.

# Walkthrough: Tracing Serial/Lot Numbers

<!-- [!INCLUDE[complete_sample_data](includes/complete_sample_data.md)]   -->

When product defects occur, the errors must be identified and affected items must be prevented from leaving the company. If defective items have already been shipped, you must trace who received them and, if you need to, recall the items.  

The first task of defects management is to investigate where the defective items came from and where they were used. This investigation is based on historic data and is made easier by searching through item tracking entries using the **Item Tracing** page.  

The second task of defects management is to determine whether the traced items are planned for in open documents, such as non-posted sales orders or consumption journals. This work is performed on the **Find entries** page. You can use the Find Entries feature to search all kinds of database records.  

## About This Walkthrough

This walkthrough demonstrates how to identify which items are defective, which vendor supplied them, and where they are used so that those orders can be stopped or recalled.  

This walkthrough illustrates the following tasks:  

- Tracing usage to origin.  
- Tracing origin to usage.  
- Searching for all current records which hold the traced serial/lot number.  

## Roles

This walkthrough demonstrates tasks that are performed by the following user roles:  

- Quality Controller  
- Warehouse Manager  
- Order Processor  
- Purchasing Agent  

## Prerequisites

To complete this walkthrough, you will need:  

- The [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] company.  
<!-- - To create new items and several business transactions by following the [Prepare Sample Data](walkthrough-tracing-serial-lot-numbers.md#prepare-sample-data).   -->

## Story

Ricardo, the quality controller, is acting on a sales return of item 1002, Racing Bike. The customer, Selangorian Ltd., complained that the frame has cracked welding seams. Quality control engineers have confirmed that the racing frame of the returned bike is defective. The quality controller must now determine:  

- Which lot of racing frames was faulty.  
- On which purchase order the faulty lot was received.  

From the sales department, the quality controller knows that the returned racing bike, item 1002, had the serial number SN1. By using this basic information, they must determine where the finished racing bike was last used, and then they must trace backward to the earliest origin to establish which lot number the faulty component, the racing frame, came from.  

The results of this first item tracking task identify which racing frames were defective and which vendor supplied them. Afterward, but in the same overall tracking process, the quality controller must find all the sold racing bikes that contain racing frames from the faulty lot so that those orders can be stopped or recalled. Lastly, the quality controller must find any open documents where the faulty lot is used so that no additional transactions are made.  

The first two defects-management tasks are performed on the **Item Tracing** page. The last task is performed on the **Find entries** page in integration with the **Item Tracing** page.  

## Prepare Sample Data

You must create the following new items:  

- 2000, Racing Frame: lot-specific tracking, component of 1002  
- 1002, Racing Bike: serial number-specific tracking  

Then you must create various purchase, production, and sales transactions with the two items.  

### To create the items

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  Do not post the last sales order for five racing frames.  

    This completes the preparation of data to demonstrate the Item Tracing and Find Entries features.  

## Tracing from Usage to Origin

 From the sales department, the quality controller knows that the returned racing bike, item 1002, has the serial number SN1. By using this basic information, they can determine where the finished racing bike was last used, in this case, on the sales shipment to Selangorian Ltd.. Then, the quality controller must trace backward to the earliest origin to establish which lot number the faulty racing frame came from and which vendor supplied it.  

### To determine which lot included the faulty frame and who supplied it

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Item Tracing**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  On the **Item Tracing** page, enter **SN1** in the **Serial No. Filter** field, and then enter **1002** in the **Item Filter** field.  
3.  Keep the default setting of **Item-Tracked Only** in the **Show Components** field, and keep the default trace method of **Usage – Origin** in the **Trace Method**.  
4.  Choose the **Trace** action.  

    Note that one sales shipment header matches the search criteria. Before you continue the trace, verify that the shipment is the one that shipped the faulty racing bike to Selangorian Ltd.  

5.  Select the trace line, and then choose the **Show Document** action.  

    Now continue to trace the origin of the sales shipment of the racing bike with number SN1.  
6.  Choose the + icon on the trace lines to gradually expand and trace backward in the chain of transactions that the sales shipment originates from.  

    You can trace the following transaction history:  

    - The first posted document backward in the chain of transactions is the output posting of SN1 from the first released production order.  
    - The next posted document backward after that is the consumption posting from the first released production order. Here the quality controller sees that a racing frame from LOT1 was used.  
    - The lowest posted document in this chain is the posted purchase receipt on which racing frames with LOT1 entered inventory.  

    The quality controller has now established which lot of racing frames was faulty and they can search for the last trace line to see which vendor supplied them, namely Custom Metals Incorporated.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  Do not make any additional modifications to the trace result, as you will use it in the next section.  

     This completes the first defects-management task using the **Item Tracing** page. The quality controller must now determine whether other posted documents have processed racing frames from LOT1.  

## Tracing from Origin to Usage

 The quality controller has established that the faulty racing frames came from LOT1. They must now find any other racing bikes that contain racing frames from the faulty lot so that those bikes can be stopped or recalled.  

 One way to prepare this trace task on the **Item Tracing** page is to manually enter LOT1 in the **Lot No. Filter** field and 2000 in the **Item Filter** field. However, this walkthrough will use the **Trace Opposite - from Line** function.  

### To find all usage of the faulty lot  

1.  On the **Item Tracing** page, select the line of the purchase receipt, the last trace line, and then choose **Trace Opposite – from Line**.  

    The trace result is now based on the filters of the trace line for the purchase receipt, LOT1 and item 2000, and the result is based on trace method **Origin - Usage**.  

    To obtain an overview of all usage of item 2000 with LOT1, continue to expand all trace lines.  

2.  Choose the **Expand All** action.  

    The first four trace lines refer to the sales shipment to Selangorian Ltd., which is already resolved. The last line indicates that one more racing bike, SN2, was produced in the same released production order and then sold and shipped on another sales shipment.  

    The quality controller immediately informs the sales department so that they can initiate a recall of the defective racing bike from the customer, Cannon Group PLC.  

    At the same time, they can see from the last three trace lines that another two items, SN3 and SN4, have been produced based on racing frames from LOT1. They take action to block these end items in inventory.  

    This completes the second defects management task using the **Item Tracing** page for defects management. Since the **Item Tracing** page is based on posted entries only, the quality controller must continue to the **Find entries** page to make sure that LOT1 is not used in non-posted documents.  

## Finding All Records of a Serial/Lot Number

 With the **Item Tracing** page, the quality controller learned that LOT1 contained the faulty racing frames, which vendor supplied them, and in which posted transaction they have been used. They must now determine whether LOT1 is in any open documents by integrating from the trace result to the **Find entries** page where they can perform a search through all database records.  

### To find all occurrences of LOT1 in non-posted records, such as open orders  

1.  On the **Item Tracing** page, select the first trace line, the purchase receipt of LOT1.  
2.  Choose the **Find entries** action.  

    The **Find entries** page is preset with search filters based on the trace result for LOT1. The quality controller recognizes most of the records as pertaining to documents already identified on the **Item Tracing** page. For example, the last Find Entries line of type Production Order refers to the two released production orders that consumed racing frames from LOT1.  

    However, the second Find Entries line of type **Sales Line** is a non-posted document line, so the quality controller proceeds to investigate.  

3.  To open the sales line record, select the second Find Entries line, choose the **Show** action. Alternatively, choose the value in the **No. of Records** field.  

    Here the quality controller sees one open sales line for the faulty racing frames. They immediately suggest to the sales department that this order be canceled and a new production order, based on good racing frames, be initiated.  

 This completes the walkthrough of how to use the **Find entries** page for defects management in integration with the **Item Tracing** page.

# How to use banking and payment formats in Business Central

Banking and payment formats can change over time and vary by country/region and bank. To help you connect to your bank and handle transactions in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], Microsoft works with partners who provide apps that support different formats and integrations. 

In some countries/regions, Microsoft also provides built-in imports and export options. However, these options aren't adapted to newer versions of the formats, unless the bank requires it. Also, there will be no development of new banking and payment-related formats. This affects the country/region localizations of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] that Microsoft releases. For a list of local versions, see [list of localizations here](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/compliance/apptest-countries-and-translations). 

## Frequently Asked Questions about supported banking and payment formats

### Will [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] discontinue these import/export options and the current formats?  

No, there are no plans to remove the current formats and import/export options. You can still use them, and partners, and customers can still build integrations for them.  

### How can I find banking and payment apps for my country/region?

You can find ISV banking solutions that support banking and/or payment-related functionality on the **Banking Apps** page or on [AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com/)

Make sure to check the features of each app to see if they match your business needs and your bank requirements. 

> [!NOTE]
> There's one exception. The Envestnet Yodlee Bank Feeds and AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals apps aren't impacted and still supported. 

### Is there no plan to support banking connectivity in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in the future?  

Yes, Microsoft wants to enable you to connect to your bank and perform fundamental tasks in a modern and secure manner. This is why Microsoft supports partners who create apps for this purpose.

# Use Power Automate flows in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]

With [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you're given a license to Microsoft Power Automate. This license lets you use your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] data as part of a workflow in Microsoft Power Automate. You create flows and connect to your data from internal and external sources through the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] connector.

Power Automate flows are triggered by events, such as a record being created, modified, or deleted. Flows can also be run on a user-defined schedule or on demand.

> [!NOTE]
> Administrators can restrict access to Power Automate. If you find that you don't have access to some or all of the features described in this article, talk to your admin. If you want to learn how you can control Power Automate access as an admin, see [Set Up Power Automate Integration](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/powerplatform/power-automate-setup).

<!-- You must have a valid account with both [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and Power Automate. --> 

> [!TIP]
> In addition to Power Automate, you can use approval workflow templates in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Although they're two separate workflow systems, any approval workflow template you create with Power Automate is added to the list of workflows within [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Learn more at [Workflows](across-workflow.md).

## About Power Automate flows

Power Automate is a service that helps you create automated workflows (or flows) between apps and services, like [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Power Automate flows require little or no coding knowledge. They can be associated with a wide range of events and responses, such as:

- Record changes
- External files updates
- Posted documents
- Different Microsoft and third-party services, like Microsoft Outlook, Excel, Dataverse, Teams, SharePoint, Power Apps, and more.

There are three different cloud flow types that you can work with:

|Flow type|Description|
|---------|-----------|
|Automated flow|This flow type is run automatically by an event. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], an event could be when a record or document is created, modified or deleted. So, for example, a new sales invoice can trigger a flow for an approval request, which can have different events set depending on the approver's reply. A negative response sends a notification and email to the approval requester. A positive reply simultaneously updates an Excel spreadsheet located in a SharePoint folder and sends an update to a Teams chat. Automated flows can be started by both internal and external events in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].|
|Approval flow|Approval flows are also automated flows in Power Automate, but they're designed specifically for requesting approval when changes are made to records and data. You can use approval flows in Power Automate as an alternative to the [approval workflows feature](across-use-workflows.md) that's part of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. |
|Scheduled flow|This type of flow is also automatically run but it runs periodically at a scheduled date and time. |
|Instant flow|This flow type is run on-demand, requiring the user to run it manually from a button or action in another app or device, in this case, the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] client. Instant flows work similarly to batch shortcuts, performing multiple lengthy steps with a few button presses and are launched from specific pages or tables. For example, a flow can add a button to the action menu on the **Vendors** page to block payments to a vendor and, at the same time, send customizable emails to the vendor's contact and your company's purchasers as well as update the contact in Outlook. |

## Power Automate features

You can explore all Power Automate flows currently available to you by signing in to [Power Automate](https://powerautomate.com) and selecting **My flows** from the navigation bar on the left. Here you find any flows you have already created yourself and flows shared with you by an admin or coworker.

- Instant flows are also made available for running directly from most list, card, and document pages in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. You find the instant flows in the **Automate** action group in the action bar of pages. To run a flow, select it, and follow the instructions presented to you. Learn more in the sections that follow.

- With automated flows in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], there's nothing for you to do, unless you want to change them, or turn them off. Otherwise, they just work when triggered. 
<!--

## Automated flows

With Power Automate, you can create business flows directly in-house and rely on citizen developers. Automated workflows can be started by both internal and external events in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], and also be set to run periodically. Learn more and get instructions on how to create flows in the [Set Up Automated Workflows](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/powerplatform/automate-workflows) article in the administration content.

-->

## Run instant flows

Instant flows open inside [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online so you can remain within the context of the business process you were in the middle of doing. You can run an instant flow from most lists, cards, or documents.

1. In the action bar, select **Automate**, then choose a flow from the list of available flows under the **Power Automate** action.

    :::image type="content" source="media/power-automate-instant-menu.svg" alt-text="Shows the Automate action with instant flow actions.":::

    On some pages, **Automate** is nested under **More options (...)**. 
2. In the **Run Flow** pane, fill in any required fields, then select **Continue** to run the flow.

> [!NOTE]
> The first time you use the **Automate** item, you may see only the **Get started with Power Automate** action. You see this action because you haven't agreed to the privacy notice for Microsoft Power Automate. To continue, select **Get started with Power Automate** and follow the instructions to agree or disagree.  
>
> :::image type="content" source="media/power-automate-action.png" alt-text="Shows the Automate item in the action bar.":::

<!--

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can run a Power Automate flow from most list, card, and document pages. Once the admin has connected [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with Power Automate, you'll see any flows your organization has added when you choose the **Automate** action on the relevant pages. Instant flows are run without leaving [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Learn more in the [Set Up Automated Workflows](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/powerplatform/automate-workflows) article in the administration content.

These instant flows open on a page inside [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online so you can remain within the context of the business process you were in the middle of. Choose the **Automate** action—on some pages nested under the **More Options** menu—choose the **Power Automate** menu item, then choose the relevant link to trigger the workflow. The connection to Power Automate is already set up for you.

Most flows require you to fill in a field or two before you choose the **Run flow** action.

> [!TIP]
> If you don't see an **Automate** action, then your [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] probably hasn't yet been set up to use Power Automate. Learn more from your admin.-->

## Create, edit, and manage flows

Creating new flows or modifying and managing existing ones (like turning them on or off) can be done directly in Power Automate. But you can initiate some of these tasks from the Automate action menu in  [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]:

:::image type="content" source="media/power-automate-menu.svg" alt-text="Shows the Automate action in the action bar with expanded actions.":::

- To create an automated flow from a list, card, or document page, select **Automate** > **Create automated flow**.
- To create an approval workflow from a card or document page, select **Automate** > **Create approval flow**.

  > [!TIP]
  > This action is only available on card and document type pages; not lists.
- To create an instant flow from a list, card, or document page, select **Automate** > **Create action based on a flow**.
- To open Power Automate from a list, card, or document page, select **Automate** > **Manage flows**.
<!--- To create new flows or manage existing flows from inside [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], got to the **Manage Power Automate Flows** page.-->

These tasks are typically done by an admin or super user. The tasks require a broader knowledge of the business processes in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. To learn more, go to the following articles in the Business Central Dev and IT Pro help:

- [Power Automate integration](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/powerplatform/power-automate-overview)
- [Create automated flows](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/powerplatform/automate-workflows) (also covers approval flows)
- [Create instant flows](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/powerplatform/instant-flows)
- [Manage Power Automate flows](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/powerplatform/manage-power-automate-flows)
<!-- 

## Add more automated flows and instant flows

You can create flows through the [powerautomate.microsoft.com](https://powerautomate.microsoft.com) website. However, if your admin has switched on the capability to run Power Automate flows from inside [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, you can start the process of building a flow from the **Automate** action on the relevant pages, which can be found under the **More Options** menu depending on the page. Then choose the **Power Automate** menu item, and then choose the **Create a flow** action. Power Automate then opens in a new browser tab, and you're signed in automatically.

You can find sample templates to adapt to your company and all available trigger events, using both [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and external tools, by choosing the **Connectors** menu on the Power Automate website. Learn more about available templates and triggers in the [Set Up Automated Workflows](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/powerplatform/automate-workflows) article in the administration content.

## Create and manage Power Automate flows

You can create new flows or manage existing Power Automate flows in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on the **Manage Power Automate Flows** page. Learn more in the [Manage Power Automate Flows](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/powerplatform/manage-power-automate-flows) article in the administration content.

<!--
You can also manage available Power Automate workflows on the **Workflows** page in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The page lists both the built-in approval and Power Automate workflows, with options for the latter to enable/disable, delete, and view the workflow on the Power Automate website.-->

# Work with payment tolerances and payment discount tolerances

You can set up a payment tolerance to close an invoice when the payment doesn't fully cover the amount on the invoice. For example, payment tolerances are typically for small amounts that would cost more to correct than to just accept. You can set up a payment discount tolerance to grant a payment discount after the payment discount date.  

Use payment tolerances so that every outstanding amount has a set maximum allowed payment tolerance. If the payment tolerance is met, the payment amount is analyzed. If the payment amount is an underpayment, the underpayment fully closes the outstanding amount. A detailed ledger entry is posted to the payment entry so that no remaining amount is left on the applied invoice entry. If the payment amount is an overpayment, then a new detailed ledger entry is posted to the payment entry so that no remaining amount is left on the payment entry.

You can set up payment discount tolerances so that if you accept a discount after the payment discount date, it always posts to a payment discount or payment tolerance account.

## Applying payment tolerance to multiple documents

A single document has the same payment tolerance, regardless of whether you apply it on its own or with other documents. Acceptance of a late payment discount when you're applying payment tolerance to multiple documents automatically occurs for each document where the following rule is true:  

*payment discount date < payment date on the selected entry <= payment tolerance date*  

This rule also determines whether to display warnings when you apply payment tolerance to multiple documents. The payment discount tolerance warning displays for each entry that meets the date criteria. For more information, see [Example 2 - Tolerance Calculations for Multiple Documents](finance-payment-tolerance-and-payment-discount-tolerance.md#example-2---tolerance-calculations-for-multiple-documents).

You can choose to display a warning that is based on different tolerance situations.  

- The first warning is for the payment discount tolerance. You're informed that you can accept a late payment discount. You can then choose whether to accept tolerance on the discount date.  
- The second warning is for the payment tolerance. You're informed that all entries can be closed because the difference is in the sum of the maximum payment tolerance for the applied entries. You can then choose whether to accept tolerance on the payment amount.

> [!NOTE]
> Enabling the warning message will let choose how to process payments that are within tolerance. If you do not enable the message, and a tolerance level is specified, invoices with amounts that are within tolerance will be automatically closed and you cannot choose to leave the remaining amount. 

For more information, see [To enable or disable payment tolerance warning](finance-payment-tolerance-and-payment-discount-tolerance.md#to-enable-or-disable-payment-tolerance-warnings). 

## To set up tolerances

Tolerance on days and amounts allows you to close an invoice even though the payment doesn't fully cover the amount on the invoice. For example, because the due date for the payment discount has past, goods were deducted, or because of a minor error. This principle also applies to refunds and credit memos.  

To set up tolerance you have to set up various tolerance accounts, specify both payment discount tolerance and payment tolerance posting methods and then run the **Change Payment Tolerance** batch job.  
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Posting Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **General Posting Setup** page, set up a debit and a credit sales payment tolerance account and a debit and a credit purchase payment tolerance account.  
3. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customer Posting Groups**, and then choose the related link.    
4. On the **Customer Posting Groups** page, set up a debit and a credit payment tolerance account. For more information, see [Setting Up Posting Groups](finance-posting-groups.md).  
5. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Vendor Posting Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
6. On the **Vendor Posting Groups** page, set up a debit and a credit payment tolerance account.  
7. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Ledger Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
8. Open the **General Ledger Setup** page.  
9. On the **Application** FastTab, fill in the **Payment Disc. Tolerance Posting**, **Payment Discount Grace Period** and **Payment Tolerance Posting** fields.   
10. Choose the **Change Payment Tolerance** action.

    > [!NOTE]
    > When you choose **Apply to Oldest** in the **Application Method** field on a **Customer Card** page, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will not automatically post payment tolerances, even when they're within the thresholds set on the **General Ledger Setup** page. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] assumes that  the Apply to Oldest setting indicates that the customer (or you as a customer of your vendor) has an account with you where they regularly pay the balance. Therefore, remaining amounts shouldn't be removed by posting a payment tolerance entry.

11. On the **Change Payment Tolerance** page, fill in the **Payment Tolerance %** and **Max Pmt. Tolerance Amount** fields, and then choose the **OK** button.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> You have now set up tolerance for local currency only. If you want [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to handle tolerance on payments, credit memos, and refunds in a foreign currency, you must run the **Change Payment Tolerance** batch job with a value in the **Currency Code** field.  

> [!NOTE]  
> To get a payment tolerance warning every time that you post an application in the tolerance, you must activate the payment tolerance warning. For more information, see [To enable or disable payment tolerance warning](finance-payment-tolerance-and-payment-discount-tolerance.md#to-enable-or-disable-payment-tolerance-warnings) section.  
>
> To deactivate tolerance for a customer or vendor, block tolerances on the relevant customer or vendor card. For more information, see [To block payment tolerance for customers](finance-payment-tolerance-and-payment-discount-tolerance.md#to-block-payment-tolerance-for-customers).  
>
> When you set up tolerance, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] also checks if there are any open entries and calculates the tolerance for these entries.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> When you enable the **Adjust for Payment Discount** field on the **VAT Posting Setup** page, the VAT amount is considered as it relates to the **Payment Tolerances** and **Payment Discounts** amounts, and VAT will be reduced for both of transaction amounts if they exist. The system can't be configured to use VAT reducing only for one type of transaction.  

## To enable or disable payment tolerance warnings

The payment tolerance warning appears when you post an application that has a balance in the allowed tolerance. You can then choose how you want to post and document the balance.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Ledger Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **General Ledger Setup** page, on the **Application** FastTab, turn on the **Payment Tolerance Warning** toggle to activate the warning. To deactivate the warning, turn off the toggle.  

> [!NOTE]  
> The default option for the **Payment Tolerance Warning** page is **Leave the Balance as Remaining Amount**. The default option for the **Payment Discount Tolerance Warning** page the is **Do Not Accept the Late Payment Discount**.

## To block payment tolerance for customers

The default setting for payment tolerance is allowed. To disallow a certain customer or vendor payment tolerance, block the tolerance on the respective customer or vendor card. The following steps describe how to do it for a customer. The steps are similar for a vendor.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customer** or **Vendor**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Payments** FastTab, select the **Block Payment Tolerance** check box.  

> [!NOTE]  
> If the customer or vendor has open entries, you must first remove payment tolerance from entries that are currently open.

## Example 1 - Tolerance calculations for a single document

The following are some example scenarios showing the expected tolerance calculations and postings occurring in different situations.  

The **G/L Setup** page contains the following setup:

- Payment Discount Grace Period: 5D  
- Max Payment Tolerance: 5  

Scenarios with alternative A or B represent:  

- **A** In this case, the payment discount tolerance warning is turned off, or the user has the warning on and chose to allow the late payment discount (Post the Balance as Payment Tolerance).  
- **B** In this case, the user has the warning on and chose not to allow the late payment discount (Leave the Balance as Remaining Amount).

### Payment Range Diagrams

In relation to the scenario, the diagrams of payment ranges are as follows:  

#### (1) Payment Date <=01/15/03 (Scenarios 1-3)

Remaining Amount per  

Normal Application Rules  

![Single payment tolerance rules 1.](media/singlePmtTolRules_Pre1503.gif "Single payment tolerance rules 1")  

(1) If payment falls in these ranges, all application entries can be closed with or without tolerance.  

(2) If payment falls in these ranges, all application entries can't be closed, even with tolerance.  

#### (2) Payment Date is between 01/16/03 and 01/20/03 (Scenarios 4-9)

Remaining Amount per  

Normal Application Rules  

![Single payment tolerance rules 2.](media/singlePmtTolRules_GracePeriod.gif "Single payment tolerance rules 2")  

(1) If payment falls in these ranges, all application entries can be closed with or without tolerance.  

(2) If payment falls in these ranges, all application entries can't be closed, even with tolerance.  

#### (3) Payment Date is after 01/20/03 (Scenarios 10-15)

Remaining Amount per  

Normal Application Rules  

![Single payment tolerance rules 3.](media/singlePmtTolRules_Post0120.gif "Single payment tolerance rules 3")  

(1) If payment falls in these ranges, all application entries can be closed with or without tolerance.  

(2) If payment falls in these ranges, all application entries can't be closed even with tolerance.  

## Example 2 - Tolerance calculations for multiple documents

The following are some example scenarios showing the expected tolerance calculations and postings occurring in different situations. The examples are limited to scenarios that result in all entries in the application being closed.  

The **G/L Setup** page contains the following setup:
- Payment Discount Grace Period 5D  
- Max Payment Tolerance 5  

Scenarios with alternative A, B, C, or D represent the following:  

- **A** In this case the payment discount tolerance warning is turned off, or the user has the warning on and chose to allow the late payment discount (Post as Tolerance) in any invoice.  
- **B** In this case, the user has the warning on and chose not to allow the late payment discount on any invoice.  
- **C** - In this case, the user has the warning on and chose to allow the late payment discount on the first invoice but not the second.  
- **D** - In this case, the user has the warning on and chose not to allow the late payment discount on the first invoice but allowed it on the second.

# Get ready to synchronize master data

When two or more companies use some of the same master data, you can synchronize the data rather than add it manually in each company. For example, synchronizing data is useful when you're setting up new subsidiary companies.

Master data includes settings and non-transactional information about business entities. For example, customers, vendors, items, and employees. The data provides context for business transactions. The following are a few examples of master data for a customer:

* Name
* Identification number
* Address
* Payment terms
* Credit limit

You set up synchronization in the subsidiary companies. Using a pull model, subsidiaries pull the data from the source company that they need to do business with them. After you set up synchronization and synchronize data for the first time, you're all set. Job queue entries update coupled records in the subsidiaries when someone changes data in the source company.

## Uni-directional synchronization only

You can synchronize data only from the source company to the subsidiary companies in a pull fashion. Subsidiaries can't push data to the source company.

> [!NOTE]
> Although it's possible, we don't recommend that you set up bi-directional synchronization. That is, synchronizing data from the source company to the subsidiaries, and from the subsidiaries to the source company. Synchronizing data in both directions can lead to conflicts or unwanted overwrites.

## Before you start

The following are requirements for setting up synchronization.

* All companies must be in the same environment.
* The user who sets up the subsidiary must have the **Essential**, **Premium**, or **Basic ISV** license.

> [!NOTE]
> The Team Member and Internal Administrator licenses let you access but not modify records, so they can't be used to set up the synchronization. The Delegated Admin license doesn't let you schedule background tasks, so you won't be able to complete the setup.

## Specify the source company

The first steps are to specify the company that will be the data source and enable synchronization. Subsidiary companies pull data from the source company.

> [!NOTE]
> When you enable synchronization, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates and schedules the job queue entries that synchronize the data. It might look like the entries immediately sync the data, but that isn't the case. The created job queue entries only sync coupled records, and at this point you haven't set that up yet. Synchronization starts after you [Enable or disable tables and fields](#enable-or-disable-tables-and-fields) and [Synchronize for the first time](#synchronize-for-the-first-time).

1. In a subsidiary company, choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Master Data Management Setup**, and then choose the related link.
1. In the **Source Company** field, specify the company that you'll pull changes from.
1. Turn on the **Enable Synchronization** toggle.
1. In the confirmation dialog, choose **OK**. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will find the tables and fields that are available from the source company.

The next step is to enable tables and fields for synchronization.

## Enable or disable tables and fields

To save time, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides a list of tables that businesses often synchronize. By default, these tables are enabled for synchronization. You can modify, disable, or delete them as you see fit. As an extra time-saver, some fields on the tables are already disabled because they probably aren't relevant for the subsidiary.

> [!NOTE]
> If one or more extensions are installed in the source company, when a subsidiary sets up synchronization the **Synchronization Tables** page includes tables from the extensions, and you can access their fields. However, if the source company adds an extension after synchronization is set up, each subsidiary must manually add the tables. To learn more about adding tables, go to [Add or delete tables from the synchronization tables list](#add-or-delete-tables-from-the-synchronization-tables-list). To learn more about extending [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], go to [Developing extensions in Visual Studio Code](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-dev-overview#developing-extensions-in-visual-studio-code).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Master Data Management Setup**, and then choose the related link.
1. Choose the **Synchronization Tables** action.
1. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](../archive/SetupAndAdministration/includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

> [!TIP]
> The **Table Filter** field is helpful for controlling what to synchronize for a table. You can set up filters to synchronize only when certain conditions are met. For example, you can add filters that specify that you synchronize only vendors in a certain region. Or, customers that use a certain currency.
>
> If the subsidiary already has data in their tables, another good way to set criteria for synchronization is to set up match-based coupling. To learn more about matching, go to [Use match-based coupling](#use-match-based-coupling).

1. To enable fields for a table, choose the table, and then choose the **Fields** action.
1. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](../archive/SetupAndAdministration/includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

> [!TIP]
> A fast way to enable or disable multiple fields at the same time is to select them in the list, and then use either the **Enable** or **Disable** actions.

### Use match-based coupling

You can specify the data to synchronize for a table by matching records based on criteria. On the **Master Data Management Setup** page, choose the **Match-Based Coupling** action to open the **Select Coupling Criteria** page. You can define the following criteria for your matching:

* Whether to synchronize after you couple records.
* Whether to create a new record in the subsidiary company if a unique, uncoupled match can be found by using the match criteria. To activate this capability, turn on the **Create New if Unable to Find a Match** action.
* The fields to use to match records, and whether the match is case-sensitive.
* Prioritize the order in which records are searched by specifying a match priority. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will search for a match in ascending order based on the match priority. A blank value equals priority 0, which is the highest priority. Fields with the 0 priority are considered first.

## Synchronize for the first time

When you're ready, on the **Master Data Management Setup** page, choose the **Start Initial Synchronization** action. On the **Master Data Initial Synchronization** page, choose the type of synchronization that you want to use for each table.

* If you already have records in both the source and the subsidiary companies, and you want to match existing records, choose the **Use Match-Based Coupling** action. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] matches records in the subsidiary company with records in the source company. The matches are based on matching criteria that you define. For several default tables, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] has already matched existing records by using their primary key, but you can change that if you want. You can also let the synchronization create new records in the subsidiary for records in the source company that the subsidiary doesn't have. To learn more about matching, go to [Use match-based coupling](#use-match-based-coupling).
* If you choose **Run Full Synchronization**, synchronization creates new records for all records in the source company that aren't coupled yet. For example, this option is useful in the following scenarios:

    * The subsidiary doesn't have data in the table.
    * You want to add records from the source company without matching.  

After you choose the option to use, choose the **Start All** action to start the synchronization.

While synchronization is running, the **Job Status** column on the **Master Data Initial Full Synchronization** page shows the status of each job queue entry. Press **F5** on your keyboard to update the status.

> [!TIP]
> Tables synchronize in a predefined order. If synchronization get's stuck on a table, select the table and then choose the **Restart** action to get it going again.

To access details, such as the number of records that are inserted or modified, choose the value in the **Job Status** column to open the **View - Integration Synchronization Jobs** page. For records that were inserted, you can choose the number in the **Inserted** column to access more details about the new records.

## Add or delete tables from the synchronization tables list

### Add a table

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Although tables that contain transactional data are available in the list, such as tables that contain ledger entries, you shouldn't choose them. Synchronization works only for tables that contain non-transactional data.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Synchronization tables**, and then choose the related link.
1. Choose **New**, and then choose the table to add.
1. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](../archive/SetupAndAdministration/includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

### Delete a table

> [!NOTE]
> If you delete a record in the source company, it isn't also deleted in the subsidiary. This helps prevented unwanted loss of data. The subsidiary can decide to delete the table if they want.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Synchronization tables**, and then choose the related link.
1. Choose the **Delete** action.

## Use export and import to share a synchronization setup

If you're setting up several subsidiaries that use the same or similar synchronization settings, there's a time saver. Set up one subsidiary company and then export its setup to an .xml file. The file contains the entire setup, including table and field mappings and filter criteria. You can then import the file to the next subsidiary. To import or export a setup, on the **Master Data Management Setup** page, use the **Import** or **Export** actions.

# Troubleshoot Financial Reporting

This article provides resolutions to a few typical problems you might encounter within Financial Reporting.

## Balancing reports to the general ledger

When you create new financial reports, you might find that they don't balance to the general ledger. The following are the most likely reasons why.

* A new general ledger account was added to the chart of accounts, but not the financial reporting.
* General ledger accounts are missing from the Totaling accounts.
* General ledger accounts are listed multiple times in the Totaling accounts.
* A formula is missing.
* A formula points to the wrong row number reference.
* A formula doesn't include all the necessary rows.
* A formula includes rows more than one time.
* A formula is making an incorrect calculation.
* A formula incorrectly shows a positive value as negative or a negative value as positive.
* A totaling account is being used on a row instead of a posting account.

## Testing a financial report against Trial Balance reports

After you double-check the possible causes stated in the [Balancing reports to the general ledger](#balancing-reports-to-the-general-ledger) section, if you still have an imbalance, consider running one of the **Trial Balance** reports. These reports can serve as a reference point because they correctly lists all G/L accounts in your chart of accounts and always balance to zero. You can compare this version of the trial balance to the rows of your financial report to identify and correct the error.

When you run the Trial Balance report, fill out the report options as follows for a clean, simple, and balanced report to review.

* In the **Show Comparison** field, choose **Last Year**.
* Turn on the **Actual Balances** toggle.
* In the **Round to** field, choose the lowest value available for your currency.
* Turn on the **Print to Excel** toggle.
* On the **Filter** FastTab, in the **Account Type** field, choose **Posting**.
* In the **Date Filter** field, enter the date for the report. <!--Need a better description here.-->
* Turn off all other toggles and leave all other fields blank.

## Testing a financial report against a data analysis on G/L entries

A different method for testing a financial report than what is described in the [Testing a financial report against Trial Balance reports](#testing-a-financial-report-against-trial-balance-reports) section is to use the data analysis feature on the [General Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=20&layout=analysis) page. This allows you to group and summarize amounts by G/L account or G/L account category, and set filters on relevant data properties, such as G/L account, G/L account category, or posting date.

Learn more in [Ad-hoc analysis on finance data](ad-hoc-analysis-finance.md).

## Adding check figures

One way to quickly identify errors in the design of your financial reporting is to add check figures to your row definitions. You want the figure to calculate to zero, which indicates that the report is correct. When you run financial reporting, a quick glance at the check figure can confirm whether the report is correct.

## When to use net change or balance at date

A typical mistake that financial reporting users make is to incorrectly combine row and column definitions. When column definitions use net change as the row type, the columns are most appropriately combined with income statement reports. When column definitions use balance at date as the row type, the columns are most appropriately combined with balance sheet reports.

An easy way to remember this rule of thumb is to think about what the goal of each report is to the viewer. People use balance sheet reports to find account balances of accounts on a certain date. So, using a Balance at Date column definition makes more sense.

People use income statement reports to explore the activity of each account during a period of time. So, using a Net Change column definition makes more sense.

For experienced accountants, we know that in some cases we can apply either report to analyze accounts. We might want to initially review the balance sheet using Balance at Date, but also use Net Change to see how much activity happened in each account as we review trends over time. We might review the Income Statement initially using Net Change to see the trend of activity over time. But we might also look at the Balance at Date of these accounts to see how much accumulated in them throughout the year.

While there isn't a single correct answer for how to use these different views, there are general conventions accountants use when they design reports for other viewers. These conventions are that the Balance Sheet uses Balance at Date, and the Income Statement uses Net Change.

> [!TIP]
> When you create column definitions, might include **BS** or **IS** in the definition description. Those tags can help report viewers decide which reports should use which column definitions.

# Work with calendar dates and times

You can enter dates and times in multiple ways. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_long.md)] includes powerful features that accelerate data entry, or help you write complex calendar expressions. There are various places throughout the application where you can enter dates and times in fields. For example, on a sales order, you can set the shipment date. When filtering lists or report data, you can enter dates and times to pinpoint only the data that you're interested in.

[!INCLUDE [about-ui-learn](includes/about-ui-learn.md)]

## Check your region and language settings

The **My Settings** page specifies the **Region** and **Language** that you're using in the application. These settings influence how you enter dates and times.

- The **Region** setting determines how dates, times, numbers, and currencies are shown or formatted.

- For date patterns that involve words, the language of the words that you use must correspond to the **Language** setting.

> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_long.md)] uses the Gregorian calendar system.

## Entering dates

In a date field, you can enter a date using the standard format for your region setting. Different regions can use different separators between the days, months, and years. For example, some regions use dashes (mm-dd-yyyy) and others use forward slashes (mm/dd/yyyy).  

> [!TIP]
> You can use any separators, even a space, and the date will automatically be changed to use separators that match your region.

> [!NOTE]
> The format in which dates are displayed on printed reports or emailed documents isn't influenced by your personal choice of region setting.

To work more productively with dates and times, you can use any of the methods or formats that are described in the following sections.

### Picking dates from the calendar

Any field displaying a calendar icon can be set using the calendar date picker. To display the calendar date picker, activate the calendar icon or select the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Home</kbd> keyboard shortcut in the field.

![Date fields.](media/ui-date-field.png "Example of a date field")

See also [Keyboard Shortcuts in the calendar date picker](keyboard-shortcuts.md#calendarshortcuts).

### Day\-week\-year pattern

You can enter a date as a weekday followed by a week number and, optionally, a year. For example, Mon25 or mon25 means Monday in week 25. If you don't enter a year, the year of the work date is used.

Instead of entering the entire word for the day of the week, you can enter part of the word, starting from the beginning. If there were conflicts (such as with s which could be Saturday or Sunday), the days are evaluated according to the region setting. The input is first evaluated against work date and today as well, which you want to keep in mind when abbreviating. For example, _t_ already means today, so it can't mean Tuesday or Thursday.

The week number scheme is always ISO 8601, where week 1 is the week with 4 January in it, or the week with the first Thursday of the year.

### Digit patterns

In a date field you can enter two, four, six, or eight digits:

- Two digits are interpreted as the day, and it adds the month and the year of the work date.

- Four digits are interpreted as the day and the month, and it adds the year of the work date. Your region settings determine the order of the day and month. Even if your region settings have the year before the day and month, four digits are interpreted as the day and month.

- If the date you want to enter is in the range 01/01/1950 through 12/31/2049, you can enter the year with two digits; otherwise, enter the year with four digits.

  > [!NOTE]
  > If you're using [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, the two-digit year range may be different. Administrators can change the range by modifying the **CalendarTwoDigitYearMax** setting of the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] server. For more information, see [Configuring Business Central Server](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/configure-server-instance#General).

### Today

Enter the word for _today_, in the language specified on the **My Settings** page, to set the date on a record to today's date. Instead of entering the entire word, you can enter part of the word, starting from the beginning. For example, in English, you can enter _t_ or _tod_, as long as it isn't also the start of another word.

### Period

To filter on a specific accounting period, in a date field enter the letter p, or the word period, followed by a number that identifies the accounting period, like p2 or period4. The accounting period is relative to the fiscal year of the current work date that set in your Role Center. For example, if the work date is **03/21/22**, then _p1_, or just _p_, filters on the first accounting period of the fiscal year 2022 (such as 01/01/22..01/31/22). _p15_ filters on the 15th accounting period from the start of fiscal year 2022 (such as 03/01/23..03/31/23).

The accounting periods are defined on the **Accounting Periods** page. To view or change the accounting periods, open the page [here](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=100).

### Work Date

Use a work date to specify a date that isn't today's date on records. For example, a work date is useful when you need to set a particular date for multiple records. You specify the work date on the **My Settings** page. 

A fast way to enter the work date on records is to enter some or all of the word _work_. Start from the beginning of the word in the language in which you use [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_long.md)]. For example, in English, you can enter _w_ or _work_. The language is also specified on the **My Settings** page.

If a work date isn't specified, today's date is used. To learn more, go to [Change Basic Settings, such as the Work Date](ui-change-basic-settings.md#work-date).

### Closing date

When you close a fiscal year, you can use closing dates to indicate that an entry is a closing entry. A closing date technically is between two dates, for example between December 31 and January 1.

To specify that a date is a closing date, put C just before the date, such as C123101. Use this format in combination with all the date patterns.

### Examples

The following table contains examples of dates using all the formats. It assumes region settings that format dates according to: **year.month.day.**, a week starting on Monday, and the English language.

|**Entry**      |**Interpretation**      |
|---------------|------------------------|
|2022.12.31.|2022.12.31.|
|221231|2022.12.31.|
|22.12.31.|2022.12.31.|
|22.12.31.|2022.12.31.|
|20221231|2022.12.31.|
|22/12,31|2022.12.31.|
|11|work date year.work date month.11.|
|1112|work date year.11.12.|
|t or today|today's date|
|p4|date range that includes the fourth accounting period, such as 04/01/20..04/30/20|
|w or work date|the working date|
|m or Monday|Monday of the work date week|
|tu or Tuesday|Tuesday of the work date week|
|sa or Saturday|Saturday of the work date week|
|s or Sunday|Sunday of the work date week|
|t23|Tuesday of week 23 of the work date year|
|t 23|Tuesday of week 23 of the work date year|
|t-1|Tuesday of week 1 of the work date year|

##  <a name="BKMK_SettingDateRanges"></a> Setting ranges

To display only the data contained in that range, on lists, totals, and reports you can filter on dates, times, and datetimes with a start value and optionally an end value. The standard rules apply to the way you set date ranges.

|**Meaning**|**Sample expression (Date)**|**Data included in the filter**|
|-----------|---------------------|--------------------|
|Interval|12 15 00..01 15 01<br /><br />..12 15 00<br /><br />p1..p4|Records with dates between and including 12 15 00 and 01 15 01.<br /><br />Records with dates of 12 15 00 or earlier.<br /><br />Date range that includes the second, third, and fourth accounting periods, such as 01/01/20..04/30/20.|
|Either/or|12 15 00\|12 16 00|Records with dates of either 12 15 00 or 12 16 00. If there are records with dates on both days, they all display.|
|Combination|12 15 00\|12 01 00..12 10 00  <br /><br />..12 14 00\|12 30 00..|Records with dates of 12 15 00 or on dates between and including 12 01 00 and 12 10 00.  <br /><br />Records with dates of 12 14 00 or earlier, or dates of 12 30 00 or later, that is, all records except records with dates between and including 12 15 00 and 12 29 00.|

You can use any of the valid formats in date range filters. For example, mon14 3..t 4p applied on a datetime field results in a filter from 3 AM on Monday in week 14 of the current work date year until today at 4PM.

## Use date formulas

A date formula is a short, abbreviated combination of letters and numbers that specifies how to calculate dates. You can enter date formulas in various date calculation fields or filters.

> [!NOTE]
> In all data formula fields, one day is automatically included to cover today as the day when the period starts. Accordingly, for example, if you enter 1W, then the period is actually eight days because today is included. To specify a period of seven days \(one true week\) including the period starting date, then you must enter 6D or 1W-1D.

Here are some examples of how date formulas can be used:

- The date formula in the recurring frequency field in recurring journals determines how often the entry on the journal line posts.
- The date formula in the **Grace Period** field for a specified reminder level determines the period of time that must pass from the due date (or from the date of the previous reminder) before a reminder is created.
- The date formula in the **Due Date Calculation** field determines how to calculate the due date on the reminder.

The date formula can contain a maximum of 20 characters, both numbers and letters. You can use the following letters, which are abbreviations for calendar units.

|  Letter  |  Meaning  |
|----------|----------------------|
|C|Current|
|D|Day\(s\)|
|W|Week\(s\)|
|M|Month\(s\)|
|Q|Quarter\(s\)|
|Y|Year\(s\)|

You can construct a date formula in three ways.

The following example shows how to use C, for current, and a time unit.

|  Expression  |  Meaning  |
|--------------|-----------|
|CW|Current week|
|CM|Current month (last day of the month)|

The following example shows how to use a number and a time unit. A number can't be larger than 9999.

|  Expression  |  Meaning  |
|--------------|-----------|
|10D|10 days from today|
|2W|2 weeks from today|

The following example shows how to use a time unit and a number.

|  Expression  |  Meaning  |
|--------------|-----------|
|D10|The next 10th day of a month|
|WD4|The next 4th day of a week \(Thursday\)|

The following example shows how you can combine these three forms as needed.

|  Expression  |  Meaning  |
|--------------|-----------|
|CM+10D|Current month \+ 10 days|

The following example shows how you can use a minus sign to indicate a date in the past.

|  Expression  |  Meaning  |
|--------------|-----------|
|-1Y|1 year ago from today|

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If the location uses a base calendar, then the date formula that you enter in, for example, the **Shipping Time** field is interpreted according to the calendar working days. For example, 1W  means seven working days.
<!--
# Entering Date Ranges
You can set filters containing a start date and an end date to display only the data contained in that date range or time interval. Special rules apply to the way you set date ranges. Let's take the **Customer Top 10** as an example:

![Setting a date range in the request page for the Customer Top 10 list.](./media/ui-enter-date-ranges/customer-top10-list.png)

Here you can limit the report to a date range such as the past 2 weeks, or a total of 6 weeks, or whatever range you want. To set date ranges, you enter dates and then use either **..** or **|** to set the range. In our example, to show the top 10 customers for the first two weeks of May, you would set the date filter to *05 01 17..05 14 17*.
Here are a couple of other examples:

| Meaning | Example | Entries included |
|---|---|---|
|Equal to| 12 15 16 |Only those posted on December 15 2016.|
|Interval| 12 15 16..01 15 17<br /><br />..12 15 16|Those posted on dates between and including December 15 2016 and January 15 2017.<br /><br />Those posted on December 15 2016 or earlier.|
|Either/or|12 15 16&#124;12 16 16|Those posted on either December 15 or December 16 2016. If there are entries posted on both days, they will all be displayed.|

You can also combine the various format types.

| Example | Entries included |
|---|---|
|12 15 16&#124;12 01 16..05 31 17 | Entries posted either on December 15 2016 or on dates between and including December 01 2016 and May 31 2017. |
|..12 14 16&#124;12 30 16.. | Entries posted on December 14 or earlier, or entries posted on December 30 or later - that is, all entries except those posted on dates between and including December 15 and 29. |

Note that we have used the US date format MMDDYY here. As [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] becomes available in other markets, you'll be able to use the formats that you are used to.

## Use Date Formulas
A date formula is a short, abbreviated combination of letters and numbers that specifies how to calculate dates. You can enter date formulas in various date calculation fields and in recurring frequency fields in recurring journals.

> [!NOTE]
> In all data formula fields, one day is automatically included to cover today as the day when the period starts. Accordingly, for example, if you enter **1W**, then the period is actually eight days because today is included. To specify a period of seven days (one true week) including the period starting date, then you must enter **6D** or **1W\-1D**.

Here are some examples of how date formulas can be used:

- The date formula in the recurring frequency field in recurring journals determines how often the entry on the journal line will be posted.

- The date formula in the **Grace Period** field for a specified reminder level determines the period of time that must pass from the due date (or from the due date of the previous reminder) before a reminder will be created.

- The date formula in the **Due Date Calculation** field determines how to calculate the due date on the reminder.

The date calculation formula can contain a maximum of 20 characters, both numbers and letters. You can use the following letters, which are abbreviations for time specifications.

|  Letter  |  Time specification  |
|----------|----------------------|
|C|Current|
|D|Day\(s\)|
|W|Week\(s\)|
|M|Month\(s\)|
|Q|Quarter\(s\)|
|Y|Year\(s\)|

You can construct a date formula in three ways.

The following example shows how to use **C**, for current, and a time unit.

|  Expression  |  Meaning  |
|--------------|-----------|
|CW|Current week|
|CM|Current month|

The following example shows how to use a number and a time unit. A number cannot be larger than 9999.

|  Expression  |  Meaning  |
|--------------|-----------|

|  Expression  |  Meaning  |
|--------------|-----------|
|D10|The next 10th day of a month|
|WD4|The next 4th day of a week \(Thursday\)|

The following example shows how you can combine these three forms as needed.

|  Expression  |  Meaning  |
|--------------|-----------|
|CM\+10D|Current month \+ 10 days|

The following example shows how you can use a minus sign to indicate a date in the past.

|  Expression  |  Meaning  |
|--------------|-----------|
|-1Y|1 year ago from today|

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If the location uses a base calendar, then the date formula that you enter in, for example, the **Shipping Time** field is interpreted according to the calendar working days. For example, **1W**  means seven working days.

-->

## Entering times

When you enter times, you can insert any nonspace separators that you want between the units. If you use double digits for each unit up to milliseconds, then it isn't required.

You only have to write the largest units that you require; the rest are set to zero. You can also leave out any AM/PM indicator.

The following table lists the various ways in which times can be entered and how they're interpreted. It assumes region settings that format times according to **Hours:Minutes:Seconds.Milliseconds** and use the AM and PM indicators.

|**Entry**      |**Interpretation**      |
|---------------|------------------------|
|05:23:17|05:23:17|
|5|05:00:00|
|5AM|05:00:00|
|5P|17:00:00|
|12|12:00:00|
|12A|00:00:00|
|12P|12:00:00|
|17|17:00:00|
|5:30|05:30:00|
|0530|05:30:00|
|5:30:5|05:30:05|
|053005|05:30:05|
|5:30:5,50|05:30:05.5|
|053005050|05:30:05.05|

> [!NOTE]
> Milliseconds are interpreted as decimal notation. So, for example, 3, 30, and 300 all mean 300 milliseconds, while 03 means 30 and 003 means 3 milliseconds.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You can't use 24:00 to mean midnight, or use any value greater than 24:00.

The word for *time* in the language used by [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_long.md)] is the current time on your computer or mobile device. You can enter a part of the word starting from the beginning, such as **t** or **TIM**.

## Entering combined dates and times

[!INCLUDE [datetimes](includes/datetimes.md)]

## Entering duration

Some fields in the application represent a duration, or amount of elapsed time, instead of a specific date or time. You enter a duration as a number followed by its unit of measure.

Here are some examples.

|**Duration**|**Unit of measure**|
|------------|-------------------|
|2h|2 hrs|
|6h 30 m|6 hrs 30 mins|
|6.5h|6 hrs 30 mins|
|90m|1 hr 30 mins|
|2d 6h 30m|2 days 6 hrs 30 mins|
|2d 6h 30m 56s 600ms|2 days 6 hrs 30 mins 56 secs 600 msecs|

You can also enter a number that automatically converts to a duration. The number converts according to the default unit of measure that is specified for the duration field.

It's easy to find out which unit of measure a duration field uses. Enter a number, and then look at the unit of measure it converts to.

For example, if the unit of measure is hours, the number 5 converts to 5 hrs.

# Work with Intrastat reporting

All companies in the European Union (EU) must report their trade with other EU countries/regions. You must report the movement of goods to the statistics authorities in your country/region every month, and the report must be delivered to the tax authorities. Intrastat is the system for collecting trade statistics of goods within these countries/regions. You use **Intrastat Report** to complete periodic Intrastat reporting (typically monthly), collecting, recording, and reporting trade of goods as per local government legislation.

Intrastat reporting is based on basic EU regulations that apply to all countries/regions; however, in practice, there are some differences within the individual countries/regions. Each country/region has its rules of what exactly and how to report.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This article describes the new Intrastat experience available in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] starting in the 2022 release wave 2, which includes extended features, but if you didn't upgrade your solution, read the previous version's Intrastat setup and usage article at [Set Up and Report Intrastat](finance-how-setup-report-intrastat-v20.md).

> [!NOTE]  
> Intrastat information doesn't apply to the movement of services between countries/regions, but only goods (Items and Fixed Assets). If the local government requires registering  the movement of services between countries/regions, it can be done using the **Service Declaration** feature.
>
> This features is available as an app at [AppSource](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2081646). At that time, to use it, you must first install it on the **Extension Management** page. Learn more about this functionality [here](finance-how-setup-use-service-declaration.md).  

## Fill in the Intrastat report

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Intrastat Report List**, and choose the related link.
2. Choose **New** action to create a new **Intrastat Report**.
3. If you need to enter some internal information about the **Intrastat Report**, fill in this information in the **Description** field.
4. In the **Statistic Period** field, specify the month to report data for. Enter the period as a four-digit number with no spaces or symbols. Depending on your country/region, enter either the month first and then the year, or vice versa. For example, enter either *2206* or *0622* for June 2022.
5. Choose the **Suggest Lines** action. The **Starting Date** and **Ending Date** fields will already contain the dates specified for the statistics period on the Intrastat report header.
6. In the **Cost Regulation %** field, you can enter a percentage to cover transport and insurance. If you enter a percentage, the content of the **Statistical Value** field in the journal is proportionally higher. But if you want to use this feature, you must switch the **Amount incl. Item Charges** field to **Yes**.
7. You can eventually set up extra configurations on the **Additional** FastTab:
   1. **Skip Recalculation for Zero Amounts** to specify that lines without amounts won't be recalculated during the batch job.
   2. **Skip Zero Amounts** to specify that item ledger entries without amounts won't be included in the batch job.
   3. **Skip Non-Invoiced Entries** to specify if item ledger entries that are shipped or received but not yet invoiced must be excluded from the process.
8. Choose **OK** to start the batch job.

The batch job retrieves all the item entries in the statistics period and inserts them as lines in the **Intrastat Report** lines. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

## Modify the Intrastat report

If needed, you can modify the lines, but whenever you change a value in the Intrastat report line, the **Correction** field will be automatically marked as **Yes**. Eventually, you can add a new line manually if there's a reason for that. To add a new line manually:

1. On the **Intrastat Report** page, choose the **New Line** action in the **Lines** FastTab.
2. Choose the **Receipt** or **Shipment** option in the **Type** field.
3. In the **Source Type** field, choose one of the sources: **Item Entry**, **FA Entry**, or **Job Entry**.
4. Based on the **Source Type** in the **Item No.** field, you can choose an **Item** (in both cases, **Item Entry** or **Job Entry**) or **Fixed Assets**.
5. Fill in other fields as you need for the Intrastat reporting.

> [!NOTE]  
> When you manually add a new line to the Intrastat report, the **Date** field in the line must be inside the **Statistic Period** range you added on the header.

## Validate Intrastat lines

After you fill in the **Intrastat Report**, you can run the **Checklist Report** action to ensure that all information in the **Intrastat Report** is correct. Mandatory fields you have set on Intrastat Report Checklist page that is missing values will be shown in **Errors and warning** FactBox on the **Intrastat Report** page.

Run the **Intrastat Report Checklist** report to check Intrastat lines before they're exported to the required format. The check is run inside the **Intrastat Report**.

## Recalculate weight or supplementary unit of measure

If you got the error message *'Total Weight' in Intrastat Report Line must not be blank*, it's probably because you didn't set the **Net Weight** field on the used source, item, or fixed asset. In this case, search for the item or fixed asset card and add the required value. After that, you just need to reopen the **Intrastat Report** and follow these steps:

1. Choose the **Recalc. Weight/Suppl. UOM** action to recalculate the **Total Weight** and/or **Supplementary Quantity**.
2. Choose one of the options:

    1. **Weight** – to recalculate only the **Total Weight**, based on the current information about **Net Weight** on the item and fixed asset cards.
    2. **Supplemental UOM Qty** – to recalculate only the **Supplementary Quantity** on the **Intrastat Report** line if it exists, based on the current information about **Supplementary UOM** on the item and fixed asset cards.
    3. **Both** – to recalculate both **Total Weight** and **Supplementary Quantity**, based on the current information on the item and fixed asset cards.
3. Choose **OK** to start the batch job.

## Report Intrastat in a file

You can submit the Intrastat report as a file based on different local authorities' requirements. Before creating the file, you should run the **Checklist Report** to check if all lines contain all necessary and valid information. To create a file:

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Intrastat List**, then choose the related link.
2. Choose **Intrastat Report** you want to report as a file.
3. If you haven't already done this, fill in the **Intrastat Report** manually or choose the **Suggest Lines** action.
4. Choose the **Create File** action.
5. The Intrastat file will be saved in the required format.

Once you create the file, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will automatically fill in the following details about reporting:

* The **Export Date** to specify the date when the report has been exported.
* The **Export Time** to specify the time when the report has been exported.

> [!NOTE]  
> Next time you create a file, the **Export Date** and **Export Time** fields will only keep information about the last file you created.

## Intrastat rules

### Grouping lines

In **Intrastat Report** lines, there's no grouping by any fields. All entries are copied from the original source, so you can quickly locate them based on the combination of **Source Type** and **Source Entry No**.

Grouping required by authorities will be provided in the exported file. You need to configure this in the **Data Exchange Definition**, which is fully configurable. Learn more at [Set Up Data Exchange Definitions](across-how-to-set-up-data-exchange-definitions.md).

### Fixed assets reporting

Fixed assets will be shown in the Intrastat lines only if:

* The **FA Posting Type** in the **FA Ledger Entry** field is **Acquisition Cost** and if the **Document Type** is **Invoice** in the case of purchases, and
* The **FA Posting Type** in the **FA Ledger Entry** field is **Proceeds on Disposal** and if the **Document Type** is **Invoice** in the case of sales.

### Intrastat report statuses

When you work with the **Intrastat Report** you'll see a **Status** field on the document header. You can find the following statuses together with related rules:

* **Open**: This status is created automatically when you create a new Intrastat report and you can make all operations in this status.
* **Released**: [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically changes the status to *Released* when you create a file. From that moment, you can't modify your **Intrastat Report**. If you need to change something and report again, you can use the **Reopen** action to reopen the Intrastat report. Once the document is reopened, you can use the **Release** action to release the document again.
* **Reported**: Specifies whether the entry has already been reported to the tax authorities. This isn't a regular status but an independent field, and even if you reopened the Intrastat report, it would still show that the file is already created for this report.

### Locations in Intrastat reporting 

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] always uses the information in the **Country/Region Code** field on the **Location Card** page as the country for **send from** or for **receive to** goods. When this information doesn't exist or location wasn't used, the system uses the information from the **Company Information** page.   

> [!NOTE]  
> If the company operates from more than one country, Intrastat reporting desn't work for all countries where locations are configured. Reporting is based only for the main country, as it's not currently possible to use multi-country reporting.  

### Triangular trade in Intrastat

Triangular trade involves trade between three countries or regions where goods bypass the reporting company's country. In Business Central, this can be facilitated through the [Drop Shipment](sales-how-drop-shipment.md) functionality. To enable this option, activate the **Include Drop Shipment** field in the **Intrastat Report Setup**.  

When you enable this option, the system uses the following rules, but only if you have the **Drop Shipment** marked in the **Sales Order**: 

| Receiving from | Delivering to | Expected Intrastat Result |
|----------|------------|----------------------|
| Country as in the **Company Information** | Country as in the **Company Information** | No Intrastat lines |  
| Country as in the **Company Information** | EU country different from the country in the **Company Information** | Intrastat shipping line | 
| Country as in the **Company Information** | Non-EU country | No Intrastat lines |   
| EU country different from the country in the **Company Information** | Country as in the **Company Information** | Intrastat receiving line | 
| EU country different from the country in the **Company Information** | EU country different from the country in the **Company Information** | No Intrastat lines |
| EU country different from the country in the **Company Information** | Non-EU country | No Intrastat lines | 
| Non-EU country | Country as in the **Company Information** | No Intrastat lines |  
| Non-EU country | EU country different from the country in the **Company Information** | No Intrastat lines |
| Non-EU country | Non-EU country | No Intrastat lines |

# Create a demand forecast

You can create sales and production forecasts with the **Demand Forecasts** list page. Then, for each forecast, you specify various settings for that forecast in the **Demand Forecast Overview** page.  

Forecasting functionality is used to create anticipated demand; actual demand is created from sales and production orders. During creation of the Master Production Schedule (MPS), the forecast is netted against the sales and production orders. The **Forecast Type** field on the forecast determines which type of requirements to take into consideration in the netting process. If the forecast is for a *sales item*, only sales orders net the forecast. If it is for *components*, only dependent demand from production order components net the forecast.  

Forecasting allows your company to create "what if" scenarios and efficiently and cost-effectively plan for and meet demand. Accurate forecasting can make a critical difference in customer satisfaction levels with regard to order promising dates and on-time delivery.  

You can also define the right level of details in the **Forecast by Location** and **Forecast by Variant** fields in the **Demand Forecast Overview** page. Filters and other settings are stored in the **Demand Forecast Name** table, so you can easily stop and continue your work later. 

## Sales forecasts and production forecasts

The forecasting functionality in application can be used to create sales or production forecasts, in combination or independently. For example, most make-to-order companies do not carry finished goods inventory, because each item is produced when it is ordered. Anticipating orders (sales forecasting) is critical for a reasonable turnaround time on the finished goods (production forecasting). As an example, component parts with lengthy delivery times, if not on order or on inventory, can delay production.  

- The sales forecast is the sales department's best guess at what will be sold in the future, and is specified by item and by period. However, the sales forecast is not always adequate for production.  
- The production forecast is the production planner's projection of how many end items and derived subassemblies to produce in specific periods to meet the forecasted sales.  

In most cases, then, the production planner modifies the sales forecast to fit the conditions of production, yet still satisfies the sales forecast.  

You create forecasts manually on the **Demand Forecast** page. Multiple forecasts can exist in the system, and are differentiated by name and type. Forecasts can be copied and edited as necessary. 

> [!NOTE]
> Only one forecast is valid for planning purposes at any time.

The forecast consists of a number of records each stating item number, forecast date, and forecasted quantity. The forecast of an item covers a period, which is defined by the forecast date and the forecast date of the next (later) forecast record. From a planning point of view, the forecasted quantity should be available at the start of the demand period.  

You must designate a forecast as *Sales Item*, *Component*, or *Both*. The forecast type *Sales Item* is used for sales forecasting. The production forecast is created using the *Component* type. The forecast type *Both* is only used to give the planner an overview of both the sales forecast and the production forecast. With this option, the forecast entries are not editable. By designating these forecast types here, you can use the same worksheet to enter a sales forecast as you do a production forecast, and use the same sheet to view both forecasts simultaneously. Note that the system treats the different inputs (sales and production) differently when calculating planning, based on item, manufacturing, and production setup.  

## Component forecast

The component forecast can be seen as an option forecast in relation to a parent item. This can, for example, be useful if the planner can estimate the demand for the component.  

Because the component forecast is designed to define options for a parent item, the component forecast should be less than or equal to the sales item forecast quantity. If the component forecast is higher than the sales item forecast, the system treats the difference between these two types of forecasts as independent demand.  

## Forecasting periods

The forecast period is valid from its starting date until the date the next forecast starts. The time interval page gives you multiple choices to insert the demand at a specific date in a period. It is therefore recommended not to change the forecast period scope unless you want to move all forecast entries to the starting date of this period.  

## Forecast by locations

On the **Manufacturing Setup** page you can specify whether you want to consider the locations that are defined on forecasts when you calculate plans. 

### Use forecast by locations

If you turn on the **Use Forecast by Location** toggle, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] respects any location codes that are specified for each demand forecast entry and calculate the remaining forecast for each location.  

Consider this example: Your company purchases and sells items on two locations: EAST and WEST. For both locations, you have configured a lot-to-lot reordering policy. You create a forecast for the two locations:

- 10 pieces for location EAST
- 4 pieces for location WEST

Then, you create a sales order with a quantity of 12 on location WEST. The planning system will suggest that you do the following:

- Replenish 10 pieces for location EAST, based on data from the forecast.  
- Replenish 12 pieces for location WEST, based on the sales order. The four pieces that were specified in the forecast are fully consumed by the actual demand of the sales order. For more information, see [Forecast Demand is Reduced by Sales Orders](design-details-balancing-demand-and-supply.md#forecast-demand-is-reduced-by-sales-orders).  

> [!NOTE]  
> If location-based forecasts are viewed in isolation, the overall forecast might not be representative.

### If you don't use forecast by locations

If you turn off the **Use Forecast by Location** toggle, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] ignores the location codes that are specified for each demand forecast entry and aggregate the forecasts into a forecast for empty locations.  

Consider this example: Your company purchases and sells items on two locations: EAST and WEST. For both locations, you configured a lot-to-lot reordering policy. You create a forecast for the two locations:

- 10 pieces for location EAST
- 4 pieces for location WEST

Then, you create a sales order with a quantity of 12 on location WEST. The planning system suggests that you do the following:

- Replenish 12 pieces for location WEST, based on the sales order.  
- Replenish 2 pieces for the empty location. The 10 and 4 pieces that were specified in the forecast are partially consumed by the actual demand of the sales order. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] ignored the location codes that were specified by the user and uses a blank location instead.  

> [!NOTE]  
> You can set a filter by locations, but location-based results might not match planning results without filters.

## To create a demand forecast

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Demand Forecast**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **General** FastTab, select a forecast in the **Demand Forecast Name** field. Multiple forecasts can exist and are differentiated by name and forecast type.  
3. In the **Location Filter** field, select the location to which this forecast will apply.
4. In the **View by** field to change the period that is displayed in each column. You can select from the following intervals: **Day**, **Week**, **Month**, **Quarter**, **Year**, or the **Accounting Period** as set up in your finance area.

> [!NOTE]  
> You should consider which time interval that you want to use for future forecasts so that the time interval is consistent throughout. When you enter a forecast quantity, it is valid on the first day of the time interval that you select. For example, if you select a month, enter the forecast quantity on the first day of the month. If you select a quarter, enter the forecast quantity on the first day of the first month in the quarter.

5. In the **View as** field, select how the forecast quantities are shown for the time interval. If you select **Net Change**, then the net change in balance is displayed for the time interval. If you select **Balance at Date**, then the page displays the balance as of the last day in the time interval.  
6. In the **Forecast Type** field, select **Sales Item**,  **Component**, or **Both**. If you select **Sales Item** or **Component**, then you can edit the quantity by period. If you select **Both**, then you cannot edit the quantity, but you can choose the drop-down arrow button and view the demand forecast entries.  
7. Specify a **Date Filter** if you want to limit the amount of data displayed.  
8. On the **Demand Forecast Matrix** FastTab, enter the forecasted quantities by typing a quantity in the cell representing an item on a particular date or period. Note that in empty cells, the lookup button opens an empty page indicating that you must enter a value manually.   

> [!NOTE]  
> You can also edit an existing forecast. On the **Demand Forecast Matrix** page, choose the **Copy Demand Forecast** action and populate the **Demand Forecast** page with an existing forecast. You can then edit quantities as appropriate.

# Set up general inventory information

You specify your general inventory setup on the **Inventory Setup** page.

## To set up general inventory information

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Inventory Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Inventory Setup** page, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

### To set up inventory valuation and costing

To record inventory costs correctly, you must set up various fields and pages before you make transactions that include item. Typically, businesses choose a specific costing method and apply that to inventory items, for example, to help them track the value of items on stock.  

|**Field**|**Details**|  
|------------|-------------|
|**Automatic Cost Posting**|Ensure that the cost is automatically posted to the general ledger whenever an inventory transaction is posted. The field is turned on by default to ensure that inventory values are always correct in the general ledger. Alternatively, you can manually post costs at regular intervals with the **Post Inventory Cost to G/L** batch job. You can also turn off automatic cost posting. A notification displays from which you can start an assisted setup guide to help you schedule tasks for the job queue. To learn more, go to [Reconcile Inventory Costs with the General Ledger](finance-how-to-post-inventory-costs-to-the-general-ledger.md).|
|**Automatic Cost Adjustment**| Specifies if item value entries are automatically adjusted when an item transaction is posted. The field is set to **Always** by default to ensure that inventory values are always correct, which in turn keeps your sales and profit statistics up to date. Cost adjustment forwards cost changes from inbound entries, such as purchases or production output, to the related outbound entries, such as sales or transfers. The adjustment is helpful for new [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] customers and small businesses with relatively low inventory transaction levels. However, as a business grows and inventory levels increase, adjustments can slow down system performance. To minimize reduced performance during posting, select a time option to define how far back in time from the work date an inbound transaction can occur to potentially trigger adjustment of related outbound value entries. Alternatively, you can manually adjust costs at regular intervals with the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job. You can also set the **Automatic Cost Adjustment** field to **Never**. A notification displays from which you can start an assisted setup guide to help you schedule tasks for the job queue. To learn more, go to [Adjust Item Costs](inventory-how-adjust-item-costs.md).|
|**Expected Cost Posting to G/L**|Ensure that you post expected costs to the general ledger. The interim G/L accounts show an estimate of the amounts due and the cost of the traded items before you invoice them. To learn more, go to [Design Details: Expected Cost Posting](design-details-expected-cost-posting.md) and [Reconcile Inventory Costs with the General Ledger](finance-how-to-post-inventory-costs-to-the-general-ledger.md).|
|**Average Cost Calc. Type**|Define if the average cost is to be calculated per item only or per item for each stockkeeping unit and for each variant of the item. To learn more, go to [Design details: average cost](design-details-average-cost.md).|
|**Average Cost Period**|Select the period of time you would like application to use for calculating the weighted average cost of items that use the average costing method. To learn more, go to [Design details: average cost](design-details-average-cost.md).|
|**Default Costing Method**|Select the default costing method that determines whether an actual or a budgeted value is capitalized and used in the cost calculation. You can select a different costing method for a specific item either by selecting item template where costing method is defined or by manually selecting a different value on the **Item Card** page. To learn more, go to [Design details: costing methods](design-details-costing-methods.md).|

To learn more about costing in general, go to [Managing Inventory Costs](finance-manage-inventory-costs.md).  

If you want to include warehouse handling times in the order promising calculation on purchase lines, you can set it up as a default for inventory on the **Inventory Setup** page, and for your location. To learn more, go to [Calculate Order Promising Dates](sales-how-to-calculate-order-promising-dates.md).  

## Allow workers to post transactions at the same time

To allow people to post inventory transactions at the same time, you can enable the **Enable multiple users to post item ledger entries and value entries at the same time** feature on the **Feature Management** page. By default, the feature isn’t enabled.

> [!NOTE]
> Similar features are available for project, resource, and warehouse entries. To learn more, go to:
>
> * [Allow multiple people to post project transactions at the same time](projects-how-setup-jobs.md#allow-multiple-people-to-post-project-transactions-at-the-same-time)
> * [Allow multiple people to post resource transactions at the same time](projects-how-setup-resources.md#allow-multiple-people-to-post-resource-transactions-at-the-same-time)
> * [Design details: Creating warehouse entries](design-details-warehouse-entries.md)

If you enable the feature, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] assigns entry numbers for each table from `SequenceNumbers` in the database, which allows more people to post transactions at the same time. The result can be that sometimes inventory entries from two or more transactions are interleaved. For example, an item register might contain any or all of the entry tables, as shown in the following image.

:::image type="content" source="media/interleaved inventory tables.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the item register with several entry tables." lightbox="media/interleaved inventory tables.png":::

If you don’t enable the feature, when someone posts an inventory transaction the tables are locked and other users can’t post inventory transactions. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] finds the last entry in each table and assigns a number that’s one higher. This numbering ensures that entries that belong to the same register are consecutive, but prevents other people from posting at the same time.

> [!NOTE]
> You might not want to enable the feature if you have a feature or extension that:
>
> - Relies on consecutive entry numbers.
> - Requires that tables are locked throughout the posting process.

# The Payments and Reconciliations (DK) Extension

Make fast, error-free payments by exporting files that are formatted specifically for exchanges with your vendor or bank. These files speed up the payment and reconciliation processes, and eliminate errors that can happen when you manually enter the information on a bank website.  

This extension supports file formats for several Danish banks. When you export payment information to a file, the extension packages the data into the format that your bank requires. For example, the formats include Bankdata-V3, BEC, SDC, and FIK, which many different banks use, and some that are more specialized for certain banks, for example, Danske Bank and Nordea. The extension also includes some formats for importing and reconciling bank statements.  

> [!Note]
> To use the extension, you must know the format that your bank or vendor requires. Some banks or vendors provide this information on their websites; however, you might need to contact their customer service to get the information.  

## Supported Bank Formats
This extension can apply the following file formats for payment files:  

* BANKDATA-V3  
* BEC-INDLAND  
* BEC-CSV  
* DANSKEBANK-CMKV  
* DANSKEBANK-CMKXKSX  
* DANSKEBANK  
* FIK71  
* NORDEA-ERHVERV-CSV  
* NORDEA  
* NORDEA-UNITEL-V3  
* SDC  
* SDC-CSV  

## To set up the extension

There are a few steps to get started.  

* Allow payment data exports. To help protect your data, this is not readily available.  
* Set up purchase and payables so that you do not require external document numbers on invoices. If needed, you can use the reference number to refer to a specific invoice.  
* Specify the payment method for each vendor. Payment methods define how you pay invoices from the vendor. For example, Bank, Cash, Check, or Account.  
* Specify the type of format to use for each of your bank accounts. For example, NORDEA, DANSKEBANK, SDC, and so on.  

Additionally, you must assign vendors to a domestic **Gen. Bus. Posting Group** and a **Vendor Posting Group**. The Country/Region setting for the vendor must be Denmark (DK). For more information, see [Setting Up Posting Groups](finance-posting-groups.md).

# Troubleshooting: Accessing Camera and Location

You might come across some issues when trying to access the camera and location information of a device from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. You can find the possible causes behind these problems and how to work around them listed below.

## Device must have Camera and Location Capabilities

In order to access the camera or a user's location from a device, the device must have a physical camera or the capability to retrieve location information, respectively.

If your device has camera and location capabilities but you still encounter problems, it is possible that some drivers need updating or reinstalling. Even if you are unsure, we always recommend you update your device operating system, drivers, and browser to the latest version for the best experience.

## Access Permissions not Enabled

You must enable general access to camera and location from your device's privacy settings and explicitly give permission to  [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to access them. For example, to see or change permissions for a device running on Windows, go to **Settings**, choose **Privacy**, and then **App permissions**. 

For mobile devices, you must give camera and location access permissions to the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Mobile App. To do so for an iOS device, go to **Settings**, choose **Privacy**, and then **Camera** or **Location**. For Android devices go to **Settings**, choose **Apps & Notifications**, **Advanced**, **Permission Manager**, and then **Camera** or **Location**.

In addition, if you are using [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in a browser, you must also grant the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] site permission to access the camera or location information. To see or change a site's permissions in the Microsoft Edge browser, go to **Settings**, choose **Site Permissions**, and then **Camera** or **Location**. Note that this might be different for other browsers.

By default, the device or browser will pop up a request to access these capabilities when the user activates them for the first time.

> [!NOTE]  
> Some old browsers do not grant access to camera and location. For example, camera is not available in Internet Explorer or the legacy Edge browser.

## Web Client Connection not Secure

The camera and location capabilities are only available when accessing the Web Client through SSL secured HTTP connections, using the `https://` URI scheme. 

The only exception is connecting to `http://localhost`, used for development and test purposes.


## Work with Virtualization Technologies

When connecting to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] through Remote Desktop or another virtualization, the access to camera or location might not be available. If this is the case, use the physical system instead.

## Antivirus Software
Some antivirus software block access to camera and location by default. Remember to check your antivirus software settings.

# Financial Reporting frequently asked questions (FAQ)

This article provides answers to frequently asked questions about the Financial Reporting feature in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## New report, row, or column definitions aren't available after an upgrade. How do I get access to them?

Financial report, row, and column definitions are stored as data in the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] database. To make sure your definitions aren't overwritten or changed during upgrade, new definitions are only available in new [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] tenants.

To make new report, row, or column definitions available in existing companies, follow these steps:

1. Create a new tenant.
1. Export the definitions you would like as configuration packages.
1. Sign in to your tenant, and switch to the company where you want the new definitions.
1. Import the configuration packages with the new definitions.

To learn more, go to [Import or export financial report definitions](bi-how-work-account-schedule.md#import-or-export-financial-report-definitions).

## Why don't the numbers in my report balance with the general ledger?

When you create new financial reports, you might find that they don't balance with the general ledger. To learn more about possible reasons and ways to fix these issues, go to [Balancing reports to the general ledger](bi-troubleshoot-financial-reports.md#balancing-reports-to-the-general-ledger).

## How can I test my report?

One way to quickly identify errors in the design of your financial reporting is to add check figures to your row definitions. To learn more, go to [Adding check figures](bi-troubleshoot-financial-reports.md#adding-check-figures).

## When should I use net change vs. balance at date?

A typical mistake that financial reporting users make is to incorrectly combine row and column definitions. When column definitions use net change as the row type, the columns are most appropriately combined with income statement reports. When column definitions use balance at date as the row type, the columns are most appropriately combined with balance sheet reports. To learn more, go to [When to use net change or balance at date](bi-troubleshoot-financial-reports.md#when-to-use-net-change-or-balance-at-date).

## Which users can run or modify financial reports?

To learn more, go to [Permissions to view or edit financial reports](finance-financial-reporting-auditing.md#permissions-to-view-or-edit-financial-reports).

## How can I setup auditing on changes to financial reports?

To learn more, go to [Set up the Change Log for financial report definitions](finance-financial-reporting-auditing.md#set-up-the-change-log-for-financial-report-definitions).

## How can I get notified when financial report definitions change?

To learn more, go to [Get notified when financial report definitions change](finance-financial-reporting-auditing.md#get-notified-when-financial-report-definitions-change).

## How can I analyze changes to financial reports?

To learn more, go to [Analyze changes to financial report definitions](finance-financial-reporting-auditing.md#analyze-changes-to-financial-report-definitions).

# Sustainability value chain in purchasing

The requirement for enabling the us of the sustainability value chain in the purchase process is to enable the following fields on the **Sustainability Setup** page:

- **Enable Value Chain tracking** to enable value chain capabilities in all processes.  
- **Use Emissions In Purchase Documents** to enable emission fields in the purchase document lines.

To do so, follow next steps:

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sustainability Setup**, and then select the related link.
2. Check whether the basic setup already exists. If it doesn't, follow [these instructions](finance-sustainability-setup.md) to set it up.  
3. On the **Procurement** FastTab, fill in the fields that are related to the sustainability value chain features.  
   1. Select the **Use Emissions In Purchase Documents** field.
   2. Select the **Enable Value Chain tracking** field.
4. Close the page.

## Work with purchase documents

To learn how to work with purchase documents in sustainability, go to [How to record emissions with purchase documents](finance-sustainability-journal.md#purchase-documents).  

If you enabled the value chain on the **Sustainability Setup** page, and created a purchase document with the **Sustainability Accounts** and emissions (minimum one emission), [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically starts the sustainability value chain and posts details to the **Sustainability Value Entries** page.  

> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] only creates sustainability value entries for items. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't support emissions from item charges.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Because the sustainability value chain works only with the carbon equivalent (CO2e), before you start, configure carbon equivalent factors on the Emission Fees page. To learn more, go to [Emission fees](value-chain-howto-setup.md#emission-fees).  

After you post the purchase documents, the results display on the **Posted Purchase Invoice** or **Posted Purchase Credit Memo** pages. To review the results, use the **Find entries** action. In the list of entries, find the sustainability value entry. To open a list of value chain transactions related to your purchase documents, select the entry.  

When you post the document, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] also updates the **CO2e per Unit** field for all items in your purchase document. If the purchase document was the first for this item, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses the value from document. If you already had documents, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses the average model to calculate the **CO2e per Unit** value for your item.

# Manage storage by deleting documents or compressing data

A central role, such as the application administrator, must regularly deal with accumulating historic documents by deleting or compressing them.  

> [!TIP]
> Learn more about other ways to reduce the amount of data stored in a database by reading [Reducing Data Stored in Business Central Databases](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/database-reduce-data) in our Developer and IT pro documentation.

## Delete documents

In certain situations, you might need to delete invoiced purchase orders. However, you can't delete them unless you fully invoice and received the items in the purchase orders. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] helps you out by checking for that.

Businesses usually delete return orders after they're invoiced. When you post an invoice, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] transfers it to the **Posted Purchase Credit Memo** page. If you selected the **Return Shipment on Credit Memo** check box on the **Purchases & Payable Setup** page, the invoice is transferred to the **Posted Return Shipment** page. You can delete the documents using the **Delete Invd Purch. Ret. Orders** batch job. Before it deletes documents, the batch job checks whether the purchase return orders are fully shipped and invoiced.  

Blanket purchase orders aren't automatically deleted after you process and invoice all the related purchase orders. Instead, you can delete them with the **Delete Invoiced Blanket Purchase Orders** batch job.  

Businesses typically delete invoiced service orders automatically after they're fully invoiced. When an invoice is posted, a corresponding entry is created and can then be viewed on the **Posted Service Invoices** page.  

Service orders aren't deleted automatically, however, if the total quantity on the order was posted from the **Service Invoice** page rather than from service order itself. You might need to manually delete such invoiced orders by running the **Delete Invoiced Service Orders** batch job.  

## Compress data with date compression

You can compress data in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to save space in the database&mdash;which in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online can even save you money. The compression, based on dates and functions, combines several old entries into one new entry.

You can compress entries that meet all of the following conditions:

* They're from closed fiscal years.
* The **Open** field is set to **No**.
* They're at least five years old. If you want to compress data less than five years old, contact your Microsoft partner.

So, for example, vendor ledger entries from previous fiscal years can be compressed so there's only one credit and one debit entry per account per month. The amount in the new entry is the sum of all the compressed entries. The date assigned is the starting date for the compressed period, such as the first day of the month (if you compress entries by month). After compression, you can still see the net change for each account in the previous fiscal year.

The number of entries that result from a date compression depends on how many filters you set, which fields are combined, and which period length you choose. There's always at least one entry. When the batch job is finished, you can see the result on the **Date Compr. Registers** page.

You can compress the following data types using batch jobs.

* Finance entries - general ledger (G/L) entries, value added tax (VAT) entries, bank account ledger entries, G/L budget entries, customer ledger entries, and vendor ledger entries.
* Warehouse entries
* Resource entries
* Item budget entries
* Fixed asset (FA) ledger entries, FA maintenance ledger entries, and FA insurance ledger entries.

When you're defining criteria for the compression, you can keep the contents of certain fields using the options under **Retain Field Contents**. The available fields depend on the data you're compressing.

> [!NOTE]
> Before you can run date compression, your analysis views must be current. Learn more in the [Update an analysis view](bi-how-analyze-data-dimension.md#update-an-analysis-view) section.

After the compression, the contents of the following fields are always retained: **Posting Date**, **Vendor No.**, **Document Type**, **Currency Code**, **Posting Group**, **Amount**, **Remaining Amount**, **Original Amt. (LCY)**, **Remaining Amt. (LCY)**, **Amount (LCY)**, **Purchase (LCY)**, **Inv. Discount (LCY)**, **Pmt. Disc. Given (LCY)**, and **Pmt. Disc. Possible**.

## Posting compressed entries

Compressed entries are posted a little differently than standard posting. This difference is to reduce the number of new general ledger entries created by date compression, and is especially important when you keep information such as dimensions and document numbers. Date compression creates new entries as follows:

* On the **General Ledger Entries** page, new entries are created for the compressed entries. The **Description** field contains **Date Compressed** so the compressed entries are easy to identify. 
* On ledger pages, such as the **Customer Ledger Entries** page, one or more new entries are created. 

The posting process creates gaps in the number series for entries on the **General Ledger Entries** page. Those numbers are assigned to the entries on the ledger pages only. The number range assigned to the entries is available on the **G/L Register** page in the **From Entry No.** and **To Entry No.** fields. 

> [!NOTE]
> After you run date compression, you can't reverse vendor or bank ledger entries for any transactions that are affected by the compression.

The number of entries that result from a date compression depends on how many filters you set, which fields are combined, and the length of the time period you choose. There's always at least one entry.

> [!WARNING]
> Date compression deletes entries, so you should always make a backup copy of the database before you run the batch job.

### To run a date compression

1. Choose the ![Search for Page or Report](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Data Administration**, then choose the related link.
2. Do one of the following, depending on your needs:
    * To use an assisted guide to set up date compression for one or more types of data, choose **Data Administration Guide**.
    * To set up compression for an individual type of data, choose **Data Compression**, **Compress Entries**, then choose the data to compress.

   > [!NOTE]
   > You can only compress data more than five years old. If you want to compress data less than five years old, contact your Microsoft partner. They need to use the `OnSetMinimumNumberOfYearsToKeep` event in the "Date Compression" codeunit to set the threshold.

# The QuickBooks Online Data Migration Extension

This extension is included in the **Data Migration** assisted setup guide to help you migrate important business data from QuickBooks Online to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For example, this is useful when your business is growing, and you've decided to upgrade your business management app by starting to use [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## What data can I import from QuickBooks Online?

You can import the following data from QuickBooks Online to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]:  

* Customers
* Vendors
* Items
* Chart of accounts
* Beginning balance transaction in the general ledger
* On-hand quantities for inventory items
* Open documents for customers and vendors, such as invoices, credit memos, and payments

We migrate only full amounts on sales and purchase documents. We do not update partially paid amounts. For example, if a customer has paid 300 of a total of 500 dollars on a sales invoice, we migrate the full 500. If you have received partial payments, you must update these manually, either before or after you migrate data. We recommend that you apply outstanding transactions before you migrate, just to make things easier afterward.

> [!NOTE]  
> We do not migrate purchase orders or sales orders.

## Before you start

An important part of the migration process is to specify the accounts to migrate transactions to. It's a good idea to plan this mapping before you migrate data. For example, the accounts where you post transactions for:  

* The sale of items or services to customers.
* The purchase of items or services from vendors.  
* Adjustments in the general ledger.  

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] requires that general ledger accounts have account numbers assigned to them. Make sure that account numbers are assigned to your accounts in QuickBooks Online.

If transactions in QuickBooks Online have tax amounts, you must set up a tax account for your tax jurisdictions in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] before you can post transactions.

## How do I start using the extension?

Getting started is easy. All you need to do is run the **Data Migration** assisted setup guide. Here's how:

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Assisted Setup**, and then choose **Migrate business data**.
2. Follow the instructions on each step in the assisted setup guide.

## What do I do after I migrate data?

After you migrate data, transactions have the status **Unposted**, so you can review them and make adjustments. To review the transactions, go to the page where you would normally find them. For example, to review unposted sales invoices, go to the **Sales Invoices** page. To review payment journals, go to the **Payment Journals** page.  

There are a few things in particular that you should do:

* If the transactions in QuickBooks Online had markup or discount amounts, you must manually add the amounts to the related transactions in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] before you post them.
* If you are using value added tax (VAT), you may need to add a business posting group and a product posting group to the posting setup so that you can post VAT amounts.
* Verify the beginning balances for accounts in the general ledger. QuickBooks Online does not store the current balance for all accounts, so you might need to correct beginning balances.

# Connect to Microsoft Dataverse

[!INCLUDE[azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id](~/../shared-content/shared/azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id.md)]

This article describes how to set up a connection between [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)]. Typically, businesses create the connection to integrate and synchronize data with another Dynamics 365 business app, such as [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)].  

## Before you start

There are a few pieces of information to have ready before you create the connection:  

* The URL for the [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] environment that you want to connect to. If you use the **Dataverse Connection Setup** assisted setup guide to create the connection we'll find your environments. You can also enter the URL of another environment in your tenant.  
* The user name and password of an account that has administrator permissions in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)].  
* If you have an on-premises [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] 2020 release wave 1, version 16.5, read the [Some Known Issues](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/upgrade/known-issues#wrong-net-assemblies-for-external-connected-services) article. You'll have to complete the described workaround before you can create your connection to [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)].
* The local currencies that each company uses. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] companies can connect to a [!INCLUDE [cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] environment that has a base currency that's different than their local currency. To learn more about how to handle multi-currency setups, go to [Allow for different currencies](#allow-for-different-currencies).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Your [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] environment must not be in Administration mode. Administration mode will cause the connection to fail because the integration user account for the connection does not have administrator permissions. For more information, see [Administration mode](/power-platform/admin/admin-mode).

> [!Note]
> These steps describe the procedure for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online.
> If you're using [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises and aren't using a Microsoft Entra account to connect to [!INCLUDE [cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)], you must also specify a user name and password of a user account for the integration. This account is referred to as the "integration user" account. If you're using a Microsoft Entra account, the integration user account is not required or displayed. The integration user will be set up automatically and does not require a license.

## Link your Business Central and Dataverse environments

Businesses want to keep their data safe and secure within their privacy boundary, and especially when their business management application integrates with other apps. By linking [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] environments, you’ll not only achieve those considerations, but also give your administrators an easier way to create and maintain your integrations with other Dynamics 365 apps.

In the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] admin center, you can link your [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] environment to your [!INCLUDE [cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] environment. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can use the information from the link to make it easier, and more secure, to integrate with other Dynamics 365 apps, such as Sales and Field Service. For example, the linked [!INCLUDE [cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] environment URL is available by default on the **Dataverse Connection Setup** page and when you run the **Dataverse Connection Setup** assisted setup guide.

## Allow for different currencies

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] companies can connect to a [!INCLUDE [cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] environment that has a base currency that's different than their local currency.

> [!NOTE]
> Synchronizing multiple currencies requires that you're using a unidirectional synchronization, from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to [!INCLUDE [cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)].

To learn more about the base currency in [!INCLUDE [cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)], go to [Transaction Currency (currency) entity](/powerapps/developer/data-platform/transaction-currency-currency-entity). 

To learn more about currencies in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], go to [Currencies in Business Central](finance-currencies.md).

To allow for different currencies, before you connect, be sure that you've specified the following settings:

* The base transaction currency setting in [!INCLUDE [cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] has the currency code that's specified on the **Currencies** page in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].
* There's at least one exchange rate specified for the currency in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on the **Currency Exchange Rates** page.

When you enable the connection to [!INCLUDE [cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)], [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] adds its local currency to the **Currency** entity in [!INCLUDE [cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)]. The local currency uses the exchange rate from the **Currency Factor** field on the **Currency Exchange Rates** page.

Because currency synchronization is unidirectional, from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to [!INCLUDE [cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)], monetary amounts convert and synchronize as follows:

* If in the [!INCLUDE [cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] base currency, amounts convert to the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] local currency based on the latest exchange rate synchronized from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].
* If in the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] local currency, amounts synchronize with the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] local currency in one of the additional, non-base currencies in [!INCLUDE [cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)].

## Set up a connection to [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)]

For all authentication types other than Microsoft 365 authentication, you set up your connection to [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] on the **Dataverse Connection Setup** page. For Microsoft 365 authentication, we recommend that you use the **Dataverse Connection Setup** assisted setup guide. The guide makes it easier to set up the connection and specify advanced features, such as the ownership model and initial synchronization.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> During the setup of the connection to [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)], the administrator will be asked to give following permissions to a registered Azure application named [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Integration to [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)]:
>
> * **Access [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] as you** permission is needed so [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can, on behalf of administrator, automatically create non-licensed non-interactive [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Integration application user, assign security roles to this user and to deploy [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Integration Solution to [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)]. This permission is used only once during set up of connection to [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)].  
> * **Have full access to Dynamics 365 [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]** permission is needed so automatically created [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Integration application user can access [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] data that will be synchronized.  
> * **Sign in and read your profile** permission is needed to verify user logging in actually has System Administrator security role assigned in [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)].  
>
> By giving consent on behalf of organization, the administrator is entitling the registered Azure application called [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Integration to [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] to synchronize data using automatically created [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Integration application user's credentials.

### To use the Dataverse Connection Setup assisted setup guide

The Dataverse Connection Setup guide can make it easier to connect the applications, and can even help you run an initial synchronization. If you choose to run initial synchronization, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will review the data in both applications and provide recommendations for how to approach initial synchronization. The following table describes the recommendations.

|Recommendation  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|**Full synchronization**|Data exists only in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], or only in [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)]. The recommendation is to synchronize all data from the service that has it to the other service.|
|**No synchronization**|Data exists in both applications, and running full synchronization would duplicate the data. The recommendation is to couple records.|
|**Dependency not satisfied**|Data exists in both applications, but the row or table can't be synchronized because it depends on a row or table that has the No synchronization recommendation. For example, if customers can't be synchronized, then data for contacts that depends on the customer data can't be synchronized either.|

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Typically, you only use full synchronization when you're integrating the applications for the first time, and only one application contains data. Full synchronization can be useful in a demonstration environment because it automatically creates and couples records in each application, which makes it faster to start working with synchronized data. However, you should only run full synchronization if you want one row in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] for each row in [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] for the table mappings. Otherwise, the result can be duplicate records.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Assisted Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose **Set up a connection to Microsoft Dataverse** to start the assisted setup guide.
3. Fill in the fields as necessary.

> [!NOTE]
> If you aren't prompted to sign in with your administrator account, it's probably because pop-ups are blocked. To sign in, allow pop-ups from `https://login.microsoftonline.com`.

### To create or maintain the connection manually

The following procedure describes how to set up the connection manually on the **Dataverse Connection Setup** page. The **Dataverse Connection Setup** page is where you manage integration settings.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Dataverse Connection Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. Enter the following information for the connection from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)].

    |Field|Description|
    |-----|-----|
    |**Environment URL**|If you own environments in [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)], we'll find them for you when you run the setup guide. If you want to connect to a different environment in another tenant, you can enter the administrator credentials for the environment and we'll find it. |
    |**Enabled**|Start using the integration. If you don't enable the connection now, the connection settings will be saved but users won't be able to access [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] data from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. You can return to this page and enable the connection later.  |

3. In the **Ownership Model** field, choose whether you want a team table in [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] to own new records, or one or more specific users. If you choose **Person**, you must specify each user. If you choose **Team**, the default business unit will display in the **Coupled Business Unit** field.

    <!--Need to verify the details in this table, are these specific to Sales maybe?  IK: No they are not and no longer relevant 
    Enter the following advanced settings.-->

## Customize the match-based coupling

Starting in 2021 release wave 2, an administrator can enter criteria to couple records based on matches. You can start the algorithm for matching records from the following places in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]:

* List pages that show records that are synchronized with [!INCLUDE [cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)], such as the Customers and Items pages.  

    Select multiple records, and then choose the **Related** action, choose **Dataverse**, choose **Coupling**, and then choose **Match-Based Coupling**.

    When you start the match-based coupling process from a master data list, a coupling job is scheduled after you specify the coupling criteria.  
* The **Dataverse Full Synch. Review** page.  

    When the full synchronization process detects uncoupled records in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and [!INCLUDE [cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)], a **Select Coupling Criteria** link appears for the integration table.  

    You can start the **Run Full Synchronization** process from the **Dataverse Connection Setup** and **Dynamics 365 Connection Setup** pages. You can also start it in the **Set up a connection to Dataverse** assisted setup guide when you complete your setup.  

    When you start the match-based coupling process from the **Dataverse Full Synch. Review** page, a coupling job is scheduled after you complete the setup.  
* The **Integration Table Mappings** list.  

    Select a mapping, choose the **Coupling** action, and then choose **Match-Based Coupling**.

    When you start the match-based coupling process from an integration table mapping, a coupling job runs for all uncoupled records in the mapping. You can also select uncoupled records in the list to run the job only for those records.

In all three cases, the **Select Coupling Criteria** page opens so that you can define the relevant coupling criteria. In this page, customize the coupling with the following tasks:

* Choose the fields to use to match [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] records with [!INCLUDE [cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] entities. You can specify whether the match is case-sensitive.  

* Specify whether to synchronize after you couple records. If records use bidirectional mapping, you can also specify what happens if conflicts are listed in the **Resolve Update Conflicts** page.  

* Prioritize the order in which records are searched by specifying a *match priority* for the relevant mapping fields. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will search for a match in ascending order based on the value in the **Match Priority** field. A blank value in the **Match Priority** field equals priority 0, which is the highest priority. Fields with the 0 priority are considered first.  

* Specify whether to create a new entity instance in [!INCLUDE [cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] in case no unique uncoupled match can be found by using the match criteria. To activate this capability, choose the **Create New if Unable to Find a Match** action.  

### View the results of the coupling job

To view the results of the coupling job, open the **Integration Table Mappings** page, select the relevant mapping, choose the **Coupling** action, and then choose the **Integration Coupling Job Log** action.  

If records failed to couple, you can choose the value in the **Failed** column to open a list of errors that describe why that happened.  

Typically, coupling fails for the following reasons:

* No matching criteria was defined

    Run the match-based coupling again, but remember to define coupling criteria.

* No match was found for the fields specified in the matching criteria

    Repeat the coupling using different fields.

* Multiple matches were found for several records based on the the fields specified in the matching criteria  

    Repeat the coupling using different fields.

* A match was found, but the record is already coupled to a record in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]  

    Repeat the coupling using different fields, or investigate why that [!INCLUDE [cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] entity is coupled to the record in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

> [!TIP]
> To help you get an overview over the progress of the coupling, the **Coupled to Dataverse** field shows whether a record is coupled to a [!INCLUDE [cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] entity. You can use the **Coupled to Dataverse** field to filter the list of records you're synchronizing.

## Upgrade connections from Business Central online to use certificate-based authentication

> [!NOTE]
> This section is relevant only for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online tenants that are hosted by Microsoft. Online tenants hosted by ISVs, and on-premises installations, are not affected.

In April 2022, [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] is deprecating the Office365 authentication type (username/password). For more information, see [Deprecation of Office365 authentication type](/power-platform/important-changes-coming#deprecation-of-office365-authentication-type-and-organizationserviceproxy-class-for-connecting-to-dataverse). Additionally, in March 2022, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is deprecating the use of client secret based service-to-service authentication for online tenants. You must use certificate-based service-to-service authentication for connections to [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)]. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online tenants that are hosted by ISVs, and on-premises installations can continue to use client secrets for authentication.

To avoid disrupting integrations, _you must upgrade_ the connection to use certificate-based authentication. Although the change is scheduled for March 2022, we strongly recommend that you upgrade as soon as possible. The following steps describe how to upgrade to certificate-based authentication. 

### To upgrade your Business Central online connection to use certificate-based authentication

1. Depending on whether you integrate with Dynamics 365 Sales, do one of the following:
   * If you do, open the **Microsoft Dynamics 365 Connection Setup** page.
   * If you don't, open the **Dataverse Connection Setup** page.
2. Choose **Connection**, and then **Use Certificate Authentication** to upgrade the connection to use certificate based authentication.
3. Sign in with administrator credentials for Dataverse. It should take less than a minute to sign in.

> [!NOTE]
> You must repeat these steps in each [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] environment, including both production and sandbox environments, and in each company where you have a connection to [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)].

## Connecting on-premises versions

To connect [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises to [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)], you must specify some information on the **Dataverse Connection Setup** page.

To connect using a Microsoft Entra account, you must register an application in Microsoft Entra ID. You'll have to provide the application ID, key vault secret, and the redirect URL to use. The redirect URL is pre-populated and should work for most installations. You must set up your installation to use HTTPS. For more information, see [Configuring SSL to Secure the Business Central Web Client Connection](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/deployment/configure-ssl-web-client-connection). If you're setting up your server to have a different home page, you can change the URL. The client secret will be saved as an encrypted string in your database. 

### To register an application in Microsoft Entra ID for connecting from Business Central to Dataverse

The following steps assume that you use Microsoft Entra ID to manage identities and access. For more information about registering an application in Microsoft Entra ID, see [Quickstart: Register an application with the Microsoft identity platform](/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app). 

1. In the Azure Portal, under **Manage** on the Navigation Pane, choose **Authentication**.  
2. Under **Redirect URLs**, add the redirect URL that is suggested on the **Dataverse Connection Setup** page in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].
3. Under **Manage**, choose **API permissions**.
4. Under **Configured permissions**, choose **Add a permission**, and then add delegated permissions on the **Microsoft APIs** tab as follows:
    * For Business Central, add the **Financials.ReadWrite.All** permissions.
    * For Dynamics CRM, add the **user_impersonation** permissions.  

    > [!NOTE]
    > The name of the Dynamics CRM API might change.

5. Under **Manage**, choose **Certificates & Secrets**, and then create a new secret for your app. You will use the secret either in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], in the **Client Secret** field on the **Dataverse Connection Setup** page, or store in a secure storage and provide it in an event subscriber as described earlier in this topic.
6. Choose **Overview**, and then find the **Application (client) ID** value. This ID is the Client ID of your application. You must enter it either on the **Dataverse Connection Setup** page in the **Client ID** field, or store it in a secure storage and provide it in an event subscriber.
7. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], on the **Dataverse Connection Setup** page, in the **Environment URL** field, enter the URL for your [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] environment.
8. To enable the connection to [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)], turn on the **Enabled** toggle.
9. Sign in with your administrator account for Microsoft Entra ID (this account must have a valid license for [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] and be an administrator in your [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] environment). After you sign in, you will be prompted to allow your registered application to sign in to [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] on behalf of the organization. You must give consent to complete the setup.

   > [!NOTE]
   > If you aren't prompted to sign in with your administrator account, it is probably because pop ups are blocked. To sign in, allow pop-ups from `https://login.microsoftonline.com`.

### To disconnect from [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)]

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Dataverse Connection Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Dataverse Connection Setup** page, turn off the **Enabled** toggle.

# Set Up Fault Reporting
Fault reporting lets you establish standards for recording fault information for service items. For example, you can specify what the problem is, the symptoms you see, the reason for the problem, and how to resolve it.  

Fault codes describe the typical service item faults or the actions taken on service items. Depending on the level of fault reporting in your company, you might need to set up fault area codes and symptom codes before you set up fault codes. Fault areas describe areas of service item faults. Fault reason codes describe the reason for service item faults and, if needed, whether to exclude warranty and contract discounts. For example, you might want to exclude warranty and contract discounts if the customer was somehow responsible for the fault in the service item. You assign fault reason codes to service orders. For more information, see [Work on Service Tasks](service-how-to-work-on-service-tasks.md).  

## To specify the overall level of fault reporting
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. In the **Fault Reporting Level** field, choose one of the options described in the following table.  

    |**Fault Level**|**Description**|  
    |------------|-------------|  
    |None | No reporting codes are used.|  
    |Fault | Codes are listed in the **Fault Codes** table. These codes identify service item faults or actions to take on service items. You can cluster related codes into **Fault Area Code** groupings.|  
    |Fault + Symptom | You provide a combination of codes in the **Fault Codes** and **Symptom Codes** tables. Typical symptom codes include indicators that a customer might use to describe a problem, such as a noise or a quality.|  
    |Fault + Symptom + Area | You use fault, symptom, and fault area codes as an implementation of the International Repair Coding System (IRIS).|  

To complete the setup of fault reporting, you can also specify what repairs or resolutions are associated with a fault or defect. You set that up on the **Fault/Resolution Code Relationships** page, where you set up combinations of codes for the service item group of the service item from which you accessed the window and the number of occurrences for each one.

## To create fault and resolution code relationships
<!--this needs to go in a working with topic-->
To be able to see the most common methods of repair for particular item faults when you are servicing the items, you need to build up information on fault/resolution codes relationships. Use the **Insert Fault/Resol. Codes Relationships** batch job to find all the combination of fault and resolution codes in posted service orders and record them on the **Fault/Resol. Codes Relationships** page.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Insert Fault/Resol. Codes Relationships**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Enter dates to define the period you want to include in the batch job.  
3. To group the relationships by service item group, choose the **Relation Based on Service Item Group** check box.  
4. To retain the records that you have already inserted manually on the **Fault/Resol. Codes Relationships** page, choose the **Retain Manually Inserted Rec.** check box.

# Design Details: Reconciliation with the General Ledger
When you post inventory transactions, such as sales shipments, production output, or negative adjustments, the quantity and value changes to the inventory are recorded in the item ledger entries and the value entries, respectively. The next step in the process is to post the inventory values to the inventory accounts in the general ledger.  

There are two ways to reconcile the inventory ledger with the general ledger:  

* Manually, by running the **Post Inventory Cost to G/L** batch job.  
* Automatically, every time that you post an inventory transaction.  

## Post Inventory Cost to G/L Batch Job  
When you run the **Post Inventory Cost to G/L** batch job, the general ledger entries are created based on value entries. You have the option to summarize general ledger entries for each value entry, or create general ledger entries for each combination of posting date, location code, inventory posting group, general business posting group, and general product posting group.  

The posting dates of the general ledger entries are set to the posting date of the corresponding value entry, except when the value entry falls in a closed accounting period. In this case, the value entry is skipped, and you must change either the general ledger setup or the user setup to enable posting in the date range.  

When you run the **Post Inventory Cost to G/L** batch job, you might receive errors because of missing setup or incompatible dimension setup. If the batch job encounters errors in the dimension setup, it overrides these errors and uses the dimensions of the value entry. For other errors, the batch job does not post the value entries and lists them at the end of the report in a section titled, **Skipped Entries**. To post these entries, you must first fix the errors. To see a list of errors before you run the batch job, you can run the **Post Invt. Cost to G/L - Test** report. This report lists all of the errors that are encountered during a test posting. You can fix the errors, and then run the inventory cost posting batch job without skipping any entries.  

## Automatic Cost Posting  
To set up cost posting to the general ledger to run automatically when you post an inventory transaction, select the **Automatic Cost Posting** check box on the **Inventory Setup** page. The posting date of the general ledger entry is the same as the posting date of the item ledger entry.  

## Account Types  
During reconciliation, inventory values are posted to the inventory account in the balance sheet. The same amount, but with the reverse sign, is posted to the relevant balancing account. Usually the balancing account is an income statement account. However, when you post direct cost related to consumption or output, the balancing account is a balance sheet account. The type of the item ledger entry and value entry determines which general ledger account to post to.  

The entry type indicates which general ledger account to post to. This is determined either by the sign of the quantity on the item ledger entry or the valued quantity on the value entry, since the quantities always have the same sign. For example, a sales entry with a positive quantity describes an inventory decrease caused by a sale, and a sales entry with a negative quantity describes an inventory increase caused by a sales return.  

### Example  
The following example shows a bike chain that is manufactured from purchased links. This example shows how the various general ledger account types are used in a typical scenario.  

The **Expected Cost Posting to G/L** check box on the **Inventory Setup** page is selected, and the following setup is defined.  

The following table shows how the link is set up on the item card.  

|Setup Field|Value|  
|-----------------|-----------|  
|**Costing Method**|Standard|  
|**Standard Cost**|LCY 1.00|  
|**Overhead Rate**|LCY 0.02|  

The following table shows how the chain is set up on the item card.  

|Setup Field|Value|  
|-----------------|-----------|  
|**Costing Method**|Standard|  
|**Standard Cost**|LCY 150.00|  
|**Overhead Rate**|LCY 25.00|  

The following table shows how the work center is set up on the work center card.  

|Setup Field|Value|  
|-----------------|-----------|  
|**Direct Unit Cost**|LCY 2.00|  
|**Indirect Cost Percentage**|10|  

##### Scenario  
1. The user purchases 150 links and posts the purchase order as received. (Purchase)  
2. The user posts the purchase order as invoiced. This creates an overhead amount of LCY 3.00 to be allocated and a variance amount of LCY 18.00. (Purchase)  

    1. The interim accounts are cleared. (Purchase)  
    2. The direct cost is posted. (Purchase)  
    3. The indirect cost is calculated and posted. (Purchase)  
    4. The purchase variance is calculated and posted (only for standard-cost items). (Purchase)  
3. The user sells one chain and posts the sales order as shipped. (Sale)  
4. The user posts the sales order as invoiced. (Sale)  

    1. The interim accounts are cleared. (Sale)  
    2. Cost of goods sold (COGS) is posted. (Sale)  

        ![Results of sales posting to GL accounts.](media/design_details_inventory_costing_3_gl_posting_sales.png "Results of sales posting to GL accounts")  
5. The user posts consumption of 150 links, which is the number of links used to produce one chain. (Consumption, Material)  

    ![Results of material posting to GL accounts.](media/design_details_inventory_costing_3_gl_posting_material.png "Results of material posting to GL accounts")  
6. The work center used 60 minutes to produce the chain. The user posts the conversion cost. (Consumption, Capacity)  

    1. The direct costs are posted. (Consumption, Capacity)  
    2. The indirect costs are calculated and posted. (Consumption, Capacity)  

        ![Results of capacity posting to GL accounts.](media/design_details_inventory_costing_3_gl_posting_capacity.png "Results of capacity posting to GL accounts")  
7. The user posts the expected cost of one chain. (Output)  
8. The user finishes the production order and runs the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job. (Output)  

    1. The interim accounts are cleared. (Output)  
    2. The direct cost is transferred from the WIP account to the inventory account. (Output)  
    3. The indirect cost (overhead) is transferred from the indirect cost account to the inventory account. (Output)  
    4. This results in a variance amount of LCY 157.00. Variances are only calculated for standard-cost items. (Output)  

        ![Results of output posting to GL accounts.](media/design_details_inventory_costing_3_gl_posting_output.png "Results of output posting to GL accounts")  

        > [!NOTE]  
        >  For the sake of simplicity, only one variance account is shown. In reality, five different accounts exist:  
        >   
        >  * Material Variance  
        >  * Capacity Variance  
        >  * Capacity Overhead Variance  
        >  * Subcontracting Variance  
        >  * Manufacturing Overhead Variance  

9. The user revalues the chain from LCY 150.00 to LCY 140.00. (Adjustment/Revaluation/Rounding/Transfer)  

    ![Results of adjustment posting to GL accounts.](media/design_details_inventory_costing_3_gl_posting_adjustment.png "Results of adjustment posting to GL accounts")  

For more information about the relationship between the account types and the different types of value entries, see [Design Details: Accounts in the General Ledger](design-details-accounts-in-the-general-ledger.md).

# Ad-hoc analysis of inventory data

This article explains how to use the **Data Analysis** feature to analyze inventory data directly from list pages and queries. You don't have to run a report or switch to another application, such as Excel. The feature provides an interactive and versatile way to calculate, summarize, and examine data. Instead of running reports using options and filters, you can add multiple tabs that represent different tasks or views on the data. Some examples are "expiring stock" or "top sellers," or any other view you can imagine. To learn more about how to use the **Data Analysis** feature, go to [Analyze list and query data with analysis mode](analysis-mode.md).

Use the following list pages for ad-hoc analysis of inventory processes:

- [Item Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=38&layout=analysis)

## Inventory ad-hoc analysis scenarios

Use the **Data Analysis** feature for quick fact checking and ad-hoc analysis:

- If you don't want to run a report.
- If a report for your specific need doesn't exist.
- If you want to quickly iterate to get a good overview on a part of your business.

The following sections provide examples of inventory scenarios in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

   > [!TIP]
   > If you add the Posting Date field, you can also track movements over time.

## Data foundation for ad-hoc analysis on inventory

When you post a sales order, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] updates the customer's account, general ledger, and item ledger entries.

- For each sales order line, an item ledger entry is created in the **Item Ledger Entry** table (if the sales lines contain item numbers). In addition, sales orders are always recorded in the **Sales Shipment Header** and **Sales Invoice Header** tables. To learn more about posting sales, go to [Posting sales](ui-post-sales.md).

When you post a purchase document, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] updates the vendor's account, general ledger (G/L), item ledger entries, and resource ledger entries.

- For each purchase line, as applicable, entries are created in the **Item Ledger Entry** table (if the purchase line is of the Item type). In addition, purchase documents are always recorded in the **Purch. Recpt. Header** and **Purch. Inv. Header** tables. To learn more, go to [Posting purchases](purchasing-how-record-purchases.md#posting-purchases).

# Displaying Lists in Different Ways
In the right corner of any list in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] you will find icons that let you choose how the list of records is displayed. A list can be displayed as detailed rows, which is ideal when you need to work with many fields or edit fields in the list. But you can also switch to display records as tiles, which is more compact and shows less fields on the specific record. This is very useful to gain an overview of several entries and is in particular useful on smaller devices, because it is compact and easier to tap.

## Item List
On the **Items** page, having pictures helps you get a quick overview of what you sell and switching to the tiles gives you an item catalogue to browse through. For lists that include pictures, such as the **Items** page, you have a third option to display as large tiles. This displays large pictures for each record but also shows few fields.

You can import item pictures, either one by one or for multiple items in one go. For more information, see [Import Multiple Item Pictures](inventory-how-import-item-pictures.md).

# Suggest lines on sales documents with Copilot (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]

This article explains how to create sales documents faster by letting Copilot suggest the items to add to lines on sales documents for your customers.

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/production-ready-preview-dynamics365.md)]

## Sales line suggestions

Sales line suggestion can assist with creating lines on sales documents such as sales quotes, orders, and invoices based on structured input or natural language. The feature isn't a general-purpose chat, but a highly specific and integrated experience that you can use on sales documents. The feature offers two distinct skills that help you find data about individual products or entire documents.

- Find products

  Information that describes products is stored in multiple places in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For example, item numbers and descriptions are stored in the **Item** table, multiple barcodes are stored in the **Item Reference** table, and product properties are stored in the **Item Attributes** table. While you might prompt for *Red bicycle*, the actual product might be *Crimson tourer*, where *Bicycle* is a product category and *red* is an attribute.

- Find documents by reference

  People often repeat a previous order, or at least use it as a starting point. But it might be tricky to find the right order in a stack of orders. You might remember some of the order's ID, which can be a company-assigned number or a reference number received from a customer. Being able to use prompts such as *Need last invoice from April* should help you find an order faster.

## Supported languages

[!INCLUDE[copilot-language-support-en-only](includes/copilot-language-support-en-only.md)]

## Prerequisites

- Your administrator activates the **Sales Line Suggestions** capability on the **Copilot & agents capabilities** page. Learn more at [Configure Copilot and agent capabilities](enable-ai.md).

## Examples of prompts

Suggest sales lines with Copilot can handle a wide variety of prompt input. This section offers examples of prompts for various scenarios we tested.

### Sample inquiry to repeat a document

Prompt: *Need all the products from invoice 103031*

### During a phone call, you quickly type a list of required products and quantities, but aren't always exact and sometimes use internal product names

Prompt: *2 Red Kids Biicycle*

The prompt works, even with multiple typos.

### A user copies an inquiry from an inbound communication and pastes it onto the Sales Lines Suggestions page

Prompt: *Hello, I'm interested in buying some accessories for my XXXX Laptop, such as a wireless mouse, a keyboard cover, and a laptop bag. I wonder if you have any recommendations or suggestions for these items. Do you have any special offers or discounts for loyal customers like me? Kind regards, M*

Note that XXXX Laptop isn't included in search.

## Options for matching keywords in prompts

When you search for an item using a FullText index, we extract both primary and extra keywords. For example, we break down the search term "Red Coffee Table" into primary keywords "Coffee" and "Table," and some synonyms and other keywords, such as "Red."

When you enter your prompt in the **Suggest Sales Lines** window, the **Matching** field offers the following options for matching criteria:

- [Permissive](#permissive-matching-criteria) means that all keywords are optional. This option typically generates the most suggestions.
- [Balanced](#balanced-matching-criteria) is a blend of required and optional keywords. This option typically generates fewer suggestions.
- [Precise](#precise-matching-criteria) means that all keywords are required. This option typically generates the fewest suggestions.

The following sections provide examples of how matching works. The examples are based on a prompt for "Red Coffee Table" and you have the following fictitious items:

- Red Coffee Table
- Blue Coffee Table
- Green Coffee Table
- Red Side Table
- Dining Table

### Permissive matching criteria

The primary keywords "Coffee" and "Table" are optional. The extra keyword "Red" is optional. This search returns items such as:

- Red Coffee Table
- Blue Coffee Table
- Green Coffee Table
- Red Side Table
- Dining Table

### Balanced matching criteria

The primary keywords "Coffee" and "Table" are required. The extra keyword "Red" is optional. This search returns items such as:

- Red Coffee Table
- Blue Coffee Table
- Green Coffee Table

### Precise matching criteria

The primary keywords "Coffee" and "Table" are required. The extra keyword "Red" is required. This search returns items such as:

- Red Coffee Table

## Suggest lines on a sales document

This process describes how to suggest lines on a sales order. The steps are the same for sales quotes and invoices.

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Order**, and then choose the related link.
1. Open a sales order or create a new one.
1. On the **Lines** FastTab, choose **Suggest sales lines**.
1. In the **Suggested sales lines** window, enter your prompt or select one from the prompt guides.

## Review, save, discard, or regenerate suggestions

After Copilot suggests the items to add to lines, review its suggestions and decide whether they're what you want:

- To discard a single proposed line, select it in the list, and then choose the **Delete Line** action.
- To discard all proposed lines and close the Copilot window, choose the Discard button (trash can) next to the **Keep it** button.
- To transfer the lines shown in the Copilot window, choose **Keep it**. 

There's a **Reliability** field that displays **High (80+)**, **Medium (60-80)**, and **Low (60-)** scores and points you to lines that need attention.

This step confirms that you want to transfer the lines to a sales document. You can delete or edit the transferred lines there as well, or delete the whole document.

# Troubleshoot Microsoft Teams Integration with [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]

[!INCLUDE[azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id](~/../shared-content/shared/azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id.md)]

[!INCLUDE [online_only](includes/online_only.md)]

This article provides information on how to identify and fix problems you might experience when using Microsoft Teams with [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], as a typical user or administrator.

## The sign-in link doesn't work

If you try to sign in to the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams immediately after installing the app, and the sign-in link doesn't react, the app might not be fully installed. To try to fix the issue, sign out of your Teams client and then sign in again.

## The Settings page is empty

You must first sign in to reach your settings. To sign into the app, either paste a link to a [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] record, or try to search for contacts. Both of these actions will lead you through a sign-up experience, after which you can use the **Settings** page.

## I changed company but it didn't seem to work

After you change the company on the **Settings** page, you might notice that the command box drop-down indicates you're still searching the previous company. This issue happens when you open the **Settings** page directly from the command box. In this case, the company was successfully changed, and you'll in fact search the company you switched to. The problem is that the command box drop-down hasn't updated yet. Close or unpin [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] from the command box, and then open the app again to ensure that the drop-down accurately reflects the company you're searching for. 

## "Something went wrong" error when searching for contacts

You might experience this error when you search in a company that isn't initialized or is in an unresponsive state. For example, you can't search in a new trial company that hasn't yet accepted the terms of use. To resolve this issue, try to sign in to the [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)] Web client, and act on or dismiss any initial dialogs that appear.

## "Cannot find the contact/contact summary API" error when searching for contacts

This problem can be caused by customizations or industry solutions that affect or modify [!INCLUDE [prod_short.md](includes/prod_short.md)], or they don't provide a contact or contact summary API. If the problem continues, contact your administrator or supporting partner.

## None of my links expand into a card 

If you're experiencing this problem, here are a few things to try:

1. First, make sure that the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams is installed.

    To check, sign in to the Teams desktop app or Teams in the browser. Then, on the left side, select **Apps**, and search for **[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]**. When you find the **[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]** app, select it to open the app details page. If the **Add** button is shown, then the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app isn't installed. Learn more in [Install the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] App for Microsoft Teams](across-install-app-for-teams.md).

    > [!NOTE]
    > Guest users can't immediately install apps. Learn more in [FAQ about collaborating with guests](teams-faq.md?tabs=collaborating#language). 

2. Next, check that you've signed in with the correct identity.

    In Teams, go to any chat, and under the message compose box, right-click the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] icon, then choose **Settings**. The window that appears states the user account that you’re signed in as. Verify that it’s the correct user account.

3. Make sure codeunit 2718 **Page Summary Provider** is published as a web service.

    Teams connects to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] using an endpoint to this codeunit on the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] service. Learn more in [Publish a Web Service](across-how-publish-web-service.md).

4. Your organization can also restrict you from pasting links that expand into cards. Contact your administrator to understand the Teams organizational policies that apply to you.

## My link sometimes doesn’t expand into a card 

A link won't expand into a card in the following situations:

- The link targets a page that (at a technical level) isn't connected to a source table in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. You can check whether a page has a source table by using the page inspection pane in the Web client in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Learn more about page inspection Learn more in [Inspecting Pages](across-inspect-page.md).
- Teams doesn't support link previews in some of its features. For example, when you pop out a chat, or you're a guest to another organization.
- Network issues cause Teams to silently abandon trying to display the card after 15 seconds, for example.
- Teams might not expand the link if you've already pasted a link into the same message compose box and deleted the card.
- When using Teams in some browsers such as Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox, the link isn't automatically detected as soon as you paste it into the compose box. You might need to add a space after the link or press <kbd>Enter</kbd> for Teams to recognize the link and expand it into a card.

The link must also contain all the necessary information to locate the record and display the corresponding card. This information includes:

- The environment name, by including it in the URL path. If you don't specify the environment name, Teams assumes you're attempting to reach the environment named "Production".
- The company name, by using the *company=* parameter
- The page identifier, by using the *page=* parameter
- The bookmark to the record, by using the *bookmark=* parameter

For example:

`https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?environmentname=Production&company=CRONUS%20USA%2C%20Inc.&page=21&dc=0&bookmark=21%3bEgAAAAJ7BTEAMAAwADAAMA%3d%3d`

Learn more about [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] URLs in [Web Client URL](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-web-client-urls) in the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Developer and IT Pro Help.

## The details window opens, but shows an error before details are shown

This problem can be caused by a couple of things: lack of permissions in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] or browser settings (when using Teams in the browser).

1. Verify your permissions in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

    To view details for a card, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] checks your license and permissions to view that specific record and page in the specific company and environment. If you aren't authorized for any of these things, standard [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] error messages about permissions appear in the details window. 

    Learn more in [Assign Permissions to Users and Groups](ui-define-granular-permissions.md).

2. Check your browser settings if using Teams in the browser.

    - Your browser's pop-up blocker must be either turned off or set to allow pop-ups from the *businesscentral.dynamics.com* or *bc.dynamics.com* domains. Learn more in about allowing pop-ups for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in [Setting Up Your Browser](across-browser-settings.md#popup).
    - Your browser must have access to local browser storage for cookies and preferences as you work.
    - Avoid using guest or private browsing unless necessary, because they discard or block certain content in some browsers.

   Learn more about minimum browser requirements in [Minimum Requirements for Using [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]](product-requirements.md#browsers).

## I'm having problems with the camera or location in Teams

When using [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] features in the details window that require access to your location or device camera, you must first give your consent for Teams to access these device capabilities.  

- For Teams in the browser, make sure that your browser settings allow access to camera and location for [https://teams.microsoft.com](https://teams.microsoft.com).

- For Teams for iOS or Android, make sure that your device settings allow access to camera and location for the Teams mobile app. 

Learn more about changing these settings at [My camera isn't working in Teams](https://support.microsoft.com/office/my-camera-isn-t-working-in-teams-9581983b-c6f9-40e3-b0d8-122857972ade?ns=msftteams&version=16&ui=en-us&rs=en-us&ad=us) on Microsoft Support.

The [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app doesn't support location in the Teams desktop app. Learn more in [Teams FAQ](teams-faq.md#location).

Some browsers, such as the new Microsoft Edge, allow you to choose which device camera to use when your device supports multiple cameras. 

## Teams displays mixed languages for my cards and card details

For cards and card details to display consistently in the same language in Teams, the language of your Teams client and the language you use in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Web client must match.

- Learn more about changing the language in Teams in [Change settings in Teams](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/change-settings-in-teams-b506e8f1-1a96-4cf1-8c6b-b6ed4f424bc7) on Microsoft Support. 

- Learn more about changing the language in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] [Change Basic Settings - Language](ui-change-basic-settings.md#language).

Learn more about how languages work between Teams and [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in [Teams FAQ](teams-faq.md#language).

## I edited a field in the details window, but my change wasn't saved

Changes you make to a field in the details windows are automatically saved when you leave the field. Before you close the window after changing a field, be sure to select the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key or click/tap outside the field.

## A new tile appeared in the App Launcher. How do I remove it?

When you view your apps on the Office 365 home page (https://home.office.com) or in the app launcher, a new tile named "Business Central Teams Integration Service Connector" will appear after installing the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams. This tile provides no value in itself and can be safely hidden.

As an administrator, who has Microsoft Entra admin permissions, you can hide the tile by doing the following steps:

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com/).
2. Select **Enterprise apps**, then select **Business Central Teams Integration Service Connector**.
3. Select **Properties**, then set the **Visible To Users** switch to **No**.
4. Select **Save**.

> [!NOTE]
> It will be a while before this change takes effect.

## Duplicate text in the Share to Teams window

When you paste text into the message box in the **Share to Teams** window, the text is duplicated. This problem is known to Microsoft and will be addressed in a later update. 

## Unable to sign in to the Share to Teams window 

This problem can be caused by a various reasons. For example, the identity you are using to sign in must have access to Microsoft Teams, such as through a Microsoft 365 subscription.

## Can't pin a card to tab

Pinning is no longer available in Microsoft Teams.

## Someone added a tab, but the tab doesn’t show up for me

This problem is because you don’t have the BC app for Teams installed. Only those with the app installed will see Business Central tabs.

## Others see a different sorting or column layout than what the tab author sees

This problem is likely because you shared a list view that is a personal view. In this case, work with your administrator to create either role-specific list views that covers the different roles in the channel/chat, or create this view for the whole organization so that everyone can get a consistent view.

# The WorldPay Payments Standard extension

> [!CAUTION]
> The WorldPay Payments Standard extension will be deprecated. The code is marked as obsolete starting in 2023 release wave 2. The app will be active for the next three major releases and then it will be removed.

The WorldPay Payments Standard extension lets you offer customers a convenient alternative to making payments through bank transfers or credit cards. Not only that, payments made through payment services will typically land in your bank account more quickly.

If you enable the extension, when you send a sales invoice by email the document includes a link to the payment service in the email body and in the attached PDF document. A customer can choose the link, and then use the payment service to make the payment.

Enabling payment service extensions is free in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], however, you'll need to contact the payment service to get an account. For more information, see [Enable Customer Payment Through Payment Services](sales-how-enable-payment-service-extensions.md).

# The Ceridian Payroll Extension

To account for salary payments and related transactions, you must import and post financial transactions made by your payroll provider to the general ledger.

To do this, you first import a file that you receive from the payroll provider into the **General Journal** page. Then you map the external accounts in the payroll file to the relevant G/L accounts. Lastly, you post the payroll transactions according to the account mapping. For more information, see [Import Payroll Transactions](finance-how-import-payroll-transactions.md).

The Ceridian Payroll extension allows you to import payroll transactions from the Ceridian HR/Payroll (US) and Ceridian PowerPay (Canada) services.

# Working with Microsoft Excel layouts

Microsoft Excel report layouts are based on Excel workbooks (.xlsx files). With them, you can create reports that include familiar Excel features for summarizing, analyzing, and presenting data such as formulas, PivotTables, and PivotCharts.

![Shows an example of an Excel layout.](media/excel-layout-2.png)

This article explains some important things you need to know to get started with Excel layouts.

## Why use Excel layouts?

Benefits of using Excel layouts:

- You can create your own report layouts with Excel, either from scratch or based on an existing layout.
- An Excel report layout can contain multiple worksheets, be interactive and use visualizations, pivot tables, and slicers.
- View raw data from the report dataset, which helps you understand how the report works and where the data in visuals comes from.
- Use built-in Microsoft Office features to do post-processing on rendered reports, including:
  - [Protecting worksheets](https://support.microsoft.com/office/protect-a-worksheet-3179efdb-1285-4d49-a9c3-f4ca36276de6)
  - [Applying sensitivity labels](https://support.microsoft.com/office/apply-sensitivity-labels-to-your-files-and-email-in-office-2f96e7cd-d5a4-403b-8bd7-4cc636bae0f9)
  - [Adding comments and notes](https://support.microsoft.com/office/insert-comments-and-notes-in-excel-65f504d8-160b-4a05-ac30-46fbd5227a52)
  - [Forecasting and analysis](https://support.microsoft.com/office/introduction-to-what-if-analysis-22bffa5f-e891-4acc-bf7a-e4645c446fb4)
- Use installed add-ins and app integrations, such as Power Automate flows or OneDrive.

> [!TIP]
> With OneDrive integration set up, when you run a report with an Excel layout, the Excel workbook file is copied to OneDrive and then opened in Excel online. For more information, see [Save Excel workbooks and report files in OneDrive](./across-onedrive-overview.md#save-excel-workbooks-and-report-files-in-onedrive)

## Get started

There are basically two tasks involved in setting up an Excel layout for a report:

1. Create the new Excel layout file.
2. Add the new layout to the report.

## Task 1: Create the Excel layout file

There are several ways to create an Excel layout file for a report:

* From any report.
* From an existing Excel report layout.
* From Visual Studio Code.

### [From any report](#tab/any-report)

Follow these steps to create an Excel layout from any report, regardless of the current layout type. The Excel layout contains the required **Data** sheet and table, and a **Report Metadata** sheet.

1. [!INCLUDE[open-report-layouts-page](includes/open-report-layouts-page.md)]
2. On the **Report Layouts** page, choose any layout for the report, then choose the **Run Report** action.
3. On the report's request page, choose **Send to**, then **Microsoft Excel Document (data only)**, and then **OK**.

   This step downloads an Excel workbook that contains the report dataset.
4. Open the downloaded file in Excel, make your changes, and then save the file.

### [From another Excel report layout](#tab/other-layout)

If there's already an Excel layout for a report, you can use the existing layout as a starting point. There are two approaches to getting a copy of the layout. You can either export the existing layout from the **Report Layouts** page or download the layout from the report's request page. Both ways download an Excel layout file that includes all the sheets of the existing file. The difference is when you download it from the request page, the layout includes actual data. The data isn't required, but it helps when you design the layout.

**Approach 1: Export the layout from the Report Layouts page**

1. [!INCLUDE[open-report-layouts-page](includes/open-report-layouts-page.md)]
2. Select the Excel layout from the list, and then choose the **Export Layout** action.
3. Open the file in Excel, make your changes, and then save the file.

**Approach 2: Download the layout from the report's request page**

1. [!INCLUDE[open-report-layouts-page](includes/open-report-layouts-page.md)]
2. On the **Report Layouts** page, choose any layout for the report, and then choose the **Run Report** action.
3. On the report's request page, choose **Download**.
4. Open the file in Excel, make your changes, and then save the file.

### [From Visual Studio Code](#tab/from-code)

Using Visual Studio Code is the most advanced way to create an Excel report layout. It requires knowledge of AL code and is intended for programmers. In this approach, the Excel layouts are part of an extension package you install. Learn more at [Creating an Excel Layout Report](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-howto-excel-report-layout) in the Developer and IT Pro help.

---

## Task 2: Add the Excel layout to the report

When you have the Excel layout file, the next task is to add it as a new layout for the report.

1. [!INCLUDE[open-report-layouts-page](includes/open-report-layouts-page.md)]
2. Choose **New Layout**.
3. Set **Report ID** to **Report**.
4. In the **Layout Name** field, enter a name.
5. In the **Format Options** field, choose **Excel**.
6. Select **OK**, and then do one of the following steps to upload the layout file for the report:

   [!INCLUDE[file-upload](includes/file-upload.md)]

   The selected file is uploaded to the layout, and the **Report Layouts** page opens.
8. To review the report in the new layout, choose the layout from the list, and then select **Run Report**.

<!--

**Data** sheet
  - An Excel layout must contain a sheet named **Data**.
  - The **Data** sheet must include a table named **Data**.

**Data** table
  - The **Data** sheet must include a table named **Data**.
  - The table must have at least one column and can only include columns that are also in the report dataset.
  - The table must start in the first cell **A1** of the **Data** sheet.

3. Report metadata 
-->

## Understanding Excel layouts

There are a few things you need to know or consider when you create or change Excel layouts. Every Excel layout must have a **Data** sheet and a **Data** table. These elements define the business data that you can work with from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The **Data** sheet links the layout to the business data, which is the basis for the calculations and visualizations that you present on other sheets.

For the layout to work, there are some requirements to the structure of the Excel workbook that must be met. The following diagram and table outline the elements of an Excel layout and the requirements.

[![Shows the different elements of an Excel layout.](media/excel-layout-callouts-2.png)](media/excel-layout-callouts-2.png#lightbox)

|No.|Element|Description|Mandatory|
|---|-------|----|---|
|1|**Data** sheet|<ul><li>Must have the name **Data**.</li><li>Can only include one table, which must be named **Data**.</li></ul>|![Is mandatory](media/check.png) | 
|2|**Data** table|<ul><li>Must have the name **Data**.</li><li>Must have at least one column.</li><li>Can only include columns that are in the report dataset.</li><li>Must start in the first cell **A1** of the **Data** sheet.</li></ul>|![Is mandatory](media/check.png)|
|3|Presentation sheets|<ul><li>Used to present data.</li><li>Data comes from the **Data** sheet. </li></ul>||
|4|**Report Metadata** sheet|<ul><li>Automatically included if the layout was created by exporting another Excel report.</li><li>Contains general information about the report.</li><li>Can be deleted.</li></ul>|

In summary, you can or shouldn't do the following things on the **Data** sheet:

- You can delete or hide columns.
- You can place the sheets in any order, with the **Data** sheet first or last.
- Don't change the name of **Data** sheet, **Data** table, or columns.
- Don't add any columns unless they're included in the report dataset.

# Install and Uninstall Extensions (Apps) in Business Central

You can change [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] by installing apps that, for example, add functionality, change behavior, or give you access to new online services. For more information, see [Customizing Business Central Using Extensions](ui-extensions.md).

> [!NOTE]
> To install or uninstall apps from AppSource or add per-tenant apps, you must have the right permissions. You must either be a member of the D365 Extension MGT user group or you must have the EXTEND. MGT. - ADMIN permission set. If you're an administrator, you can assign user groups and permissions to other users in your company. To learn more about user groups and permissions, go to [Assign Permissions to Users and Groups](ui-define-granular-permissions.md).
>
> To use the functionality that is provided by an extension, such as opening pages, running reports, selecting actions, and so on, you must be assigned the permission sets that are installed as part of the extension.

To use an extension, you must be assigned the permission sets that come with it.

## <a name="install"></a>Install an extension

You manage apps and extensions on the **Extension Management** page. You can access this page from Home. Alternatively, choose the **Search for Page or Report** icon ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") in the top-right corner, enter **Extension**, and then choose the related link.  

You can get new apps from the marketplace at [AppSource.microsoft.com](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2081646). The marketplace offers all available apps for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], plus apps and content packs for other Microsoft products. Set the relevant filters, take a look at the information for each extension, and get an extension for your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

> [!NOTE]  
> Sign in to [AppSource.microsoft.com](https://appsource.microsoft.com/) using the email account that you use for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Use the same email account for other services and products for a smooth experience.  

You can also get to AppSource from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. On the **Extension Management** page, you can see the apps that are currently installed, and you can open the **Microsoft AppSource Apps** page that shows the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] apps that are currently available in AppSource. If you choose the **View AppSource** action, you're taken to [AppSource.microsoft.com](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2081646). For more information, see [Manage AppSource apps](admin-manage-appsource-apps.md).  

Choose an app to learn about what it does, and you can access Help for the app to learn more. When you choose to get an app, you must agree to its terms of use. If you get the app from the AppSource website, you'll be signed in to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to complete the installation.  

After you install an app, you might have to set it up. Some apps require that you provide some information before you can use them. For example, after you install the **PayPal Payments Standard** app, you must specify the email or the Merchant account ID for your PayPal account. To set up an app, or to find out what information you'll need, on the **Installed Extensions** page, choose the **Set up** action.  

Other apps simply add fields to an existing page, or they add a new page, for example.

If you uninstall an app, and you then change your mind, you can install it again. When you uninstall an app that you've been using your data isn't deleted. The data is available if you install the app again.

Some apps are provided by Microsoft, and other apps are provided by [other companies](ui-extensions-other.md). We recommend that you learn more about the app before you choose to install it.

Microsoft provides the following apps:

* [AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals Extension](ui-extensions-amc-banking.md)
* [Ceridian Payroll](ui-extensions-ceridian-payroll.md)
* [Company Hub](ui-extensions-company-hub.md)

## Set up an app

After you install an app, you might have to set it up. For example, for the **PayPal Payments Standard for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]** app you must specify the PayPal account to use. If that's the case, when installation completes [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will ask whether you want to set up the app right away. Setups can be required for the app to work, or optional.

If you choose to set up your app right away, and it has a required setup, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will open the required setup. The setup can be either a page where you enter information, or an assisted setup guide that helps you through the steps. If you don't complete the setup in one go, you can use the **Setups for _name of app_** page, which lists all setups for the app. Required setups indicated by **bold letters**.

## Upload a per-tenant extension (PTE)

You upload a PTE by using the **Extension Management** page. On the **Extension Management** page, go to **Manage**, then choose **Upload Extension**. On the **Upload and Deploy Extension** page, specify the .app file to upload. To proceed, choose the **Accept** button, and then the **Deploy** button, which will start the process of deploying the PTE.

If the PTE contains breaking schema changes, it's possible to *force* an upload of it. To do that, in **Schema Sync Mode** choose the **Force** option. You'll get a confirmation dialog to accept before proceeding.  

## Uninstall an app

You uninstall an app by using the **Extension Management** page. To uninstall an app, select it on the page, then select the **Uninstall** action. If you uninstall an app, and you then change your mind, you can install the app again.

By default, when you uninstall an app that you've been using your data isn't deleted. If you're sure you won't install the app again, and you can delete the data when you uninstall it. To delete data when you uninstall an app, turn on the **Delete Extension Data** toggle. You'll get a confirmation dialog, and you must choose **Yes** to turn it on. After the **Delete Extension Data** switch is turned on, you can uninstall the app, and you'll be asked to reconfirm that you want to uninstall the app and delete the data.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> * There might be apps that require or depend on the app that you want to uninstall. These apps are referred to as *dependents*. You can't uninstall an app unless you also uninstall its dependents. When you uninstall an app that has dependents, a dialog lists the dependents. To continue, you'll have to select **Yes** to uninstall the app and its dependents.
> * If you turn on the **Delete Extension Data** toggle, uninstalling the app will delete all data for the app *plus* data for all dependent apps. The action can't be undone.
> * Some apps are required and you can't delete them on the **Extension Management** page.  

If you want to keep the data for an uninstalled app, you can delete the data later. The **Delete Orphaned Extension Data** page lists the apps that you still have data for. To delete the data, choose the app, and then choose **Delete Data**.
