# Set Up Shipment Methods

Shipment methods often depend on the items, the customers, and the vendors. For example, if the customer lives on an island, they can choose to have items always shipped by air or always by sea. Some customers may require next day delivery. Some may want to pick up the order. On the customer and vendor cards, you can specify what sort of delivery is desired.

You set up the description and code for each shipment method on the **Shipment Methods** page. For example, you can set up the code FOB, and enter Free on Board in the **Description** field. You can then enter the code in **Shipment Method Code** fields elsewhere in the system, such as on a customer card. Then when you create new orders, invoices, credit memos, and so on, the system will enter the description represented by the code. You can change it on the document as needed.

## To set up a shipment method

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Shipment Methods**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Shipment Methods** page, choose the **New** action.
3. On the new line, specify a code and description for the shipment method.

> [!TIP]
> If you use Incoterms, set up shipment methods to represent the relevant Incoterms rules.

# Specify the languages that are available in your Business Central environment

To let people work in their preferred language, the user interface (UI) in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is translated by apps that Microsoft provides, or by language apps that our partners provide on AppSource. Administrators install the language apps in their [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] environment. Afterward, on the **My Settings** page, people can choose the language in which they want to use [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

The **Languages** page lists all languages that [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports. However, to use [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in a selected language, the language app must be installed in the environment. If someone chooses a language that a language app isn't installed for, they might be confused when the UI doesn't change.

To avoid confusion and make it easier for people to select a language they can use, administrators can use the **Allowed Languages** page to list the languages that they installed language apps for. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] filters the list of languages on the **My Settings** page to show only the allowed languages.

## Create a list of allowed languages

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Allowed Languages**, and choose the related link.
1. In the **Language ID** field, choose the language to allow.
1. Repeat step 2 for each language that you installed a language app for.

# Understand the general ledger and Chart of Accounts

The general ledger (G/L) stores your financial data, and the chart of accounts (COA) shows the accounts that you post general ledger entries to. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes a standard chart of accounts that's ready to support your business.

## General ledger setup and general posting setup

The setup of the general ledger is at the core of financial processes because it defines how you post data. Two pages in particular play an important part in configuring your finance processes:  

* **General Ledger Setup**
* **General Posting Setup**

### The **General Ledger Setup** page

Use the **General Ledger Setup** page to specify how to handle certain accounting issues in your company, such as:  

* Invoice rounding details  
* Address formats  
* Financial reporting

> [!TIP]
> The **General Ledger Setup** page includes generic fields, and fields that are particular to your country or region. If you're unsure of the meaning of a field, we suggest you work with your accountant to determine whether it's relevant to your organization. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  

To open the page now, use the following link [General Ledger Setup](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=118).

### The **General Posting Setup** page

Use the **General Posting Setup** page to set up combinations of general business and general product posting groups. Posting groups map entities such as customers, vendors, items, resources, and sales and purchase documents to general ledger accounts. You fill in a line for each combination of business posting group and product posting group. But you can also open each line in its own posting setup card. Learn more at [Posting Group Setups](finance-posting-groups.md).  

> [!TIP]
> If you can't see the fields you're looking for in the **General Posting Setup** page, use the horizontal scroll bar at the bottom of the page to scroll to the right.  

To open the page now, use the following link [General Posting Setup](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=314).

## The chart of accounts

The **Chart of Accounts** page shows all general ledger accounts. From the chart of accounts, you can do things like:  

* View reports that show general ledger entries and balances.  
* Close your income statement.  
* Open the general ledger (G/L) account card to add or change settings.  
* See a list of posting groups for that account.
* View separate debit and credit balances for a single account.

To learn more, go to [Understanding the Chart of Accounts](finance-chart-of-accounts.md).

## Account categories

You can personalize the structure of your financial statements by mapping general ledger accounts to account categories.  

The **G/L Account Categories** page shows your categories and subcategories, and the general ledger accounts assigned to them. You can create new subcategories and assign those categories to existing accounts.  

You can create a category group by indenting other subcategories under a line on the **G/L Account Categories** page. Category groups make it easy to get an overview because each grouping shows a total balance. For example, you can create subcategories for different types of assets, then create category groups for fixed assets versus current assets.  

You can define whether specific types of reports must include the accounts in each subcategory. The account categories help define the layout of your financial statements.  

### Example

For example, the default balance statement has a subcategory for *Cash* under *Current Assets*. If you want the balance statement to consider petty cash and checking, take the following steps:

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **G/L Account Categories**, then choose the related link.
   1. Alternatively, [open the page here](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=790).
2. Choose the **Edit List** action.
3. Add two new subcategories: One for petty cash, and one for your checking account:
   1. Select the **Current Assets** category.
   2. Choose the **New** action.
   3. Enter the subcategory name on the **Description** field.
   4. On the **G/L Accounts in Category** field, select the appropriate G/L account.
   5. On the **Additional Report Definition** field, select the **Cash Accounts** option.
4. Indent them under the **Cash** subcategory.
   1. Select the subcategory created in step 3.
   2. Choose the **Indent** action.
   3. Choose the **Move Down** action.
   4. Choose the **Indent** action to indent under the **Cash** subcategory.

When you choose the **Generate Financial Reports** action, or the next time the report is generated, your balance statement shows the following lines:

* Total balance for cash.
* Lines with balances for petty cash and the checking account.  

> [!NOTE]
> If you create a G/L account without assigning an account category, when you assign the account to a posting group [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically assigns the account category from the G/L account immediately above the account in your chart of accounts. However, to include the new account in your financial reports, you must choose the **Generate Financial Reports** action on the **G/L Account Categories** page. Alternatively, open the G/L Account Card page, specify the account category, and then regenerate your financial report.

## Access to create and edit G/L accounts and account categories

In a small organization, such as the CRONUS demonstration company, most users can edit financial entities such as G/L accounts, account categories, and the chart of accounts, except those users with a TEAM MEMBER license. However, larger organizations typically use roles and permissions to limit access to editing these entities. If you're an administrator, or have the *Business Manager* or *Accountant* role, you can control user permissions to give the right people access to the relevant tables. To learn more, go to [Get an overview of a user's permissions](ui-define-granular-permissions.md#get-an-overview-of-a-users-permissions).  

## Use dimensions to simplify your chart of accounts

Dimensions are values that categorize entries so you can track and analyze them on documents, such as sales orders. Dimensions can, for example, indicate the project or department an entry came from. So, instead of setting up separate general ledger accounts for each department and project, you can use dimensions as a basis for analysis and avoid having to create a complicated chart of accounts.

To learn more about dimensions, go to [Set up default dimensions for customers, vendors, and other accounts](finance-dimensions.md#to-set-up-default-dimensions-for-customers-vendors-and-other-accounts).

# Create Production Orders from Sales Orders

You can create production orders for produced items directly from sales orders.  

## To create a production order from a sales order  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the sales order you want to create a production order for.  
3. Choose the **Planning** action. The **Sales Order Planning** page shows the availability of the item.  
4. Choose the **Create Prod. Order** action.  
5. Select the status and order type.  
6. Choose the **Yes** button to create one or more production orders for the lines that have **Prod. Order** in their **Replenishment System** field.

    > [!NOTE]  
    > Demand lines that have **Prod. Order** in the **Replenishment System** field represent underlying production orders. After you generate these production orders, remember to identify any unfulfilled component demand for them. Use the **Order Planning** page or the **Replan** action to identify unfulfilled demand.
    >
    > When you create production orders for sales orders with the Sales Order Planning page, order-to-order links are applied between demand and supply. When order-to-order links exist, the planning system doesn't include linked supply or inventory in the balancing procedure. To learn more about balancing, go to [Order-to-order links](design-details-central-concepts-of-the-planning-system.md#order-to-order-links).

## Order type  

The following table describes two ways to create production orders.

|Option|Description|
|------|-----------|
|Item Order|One production order is created for each item represented by a line in the **Sales Order Planning** page.|
|Project Order|One multiline production order is created for all items represented by lines on the **Sales Order Planning** page. When you use project orders, the **Source Type** field of the production order contains **Sales Header**. The order has one line for each sales line item that must be produced.|

# Post the Year-End Closing entry

After you use the **Close Income Statement** batch job to generate the year-end closing entry or entries, you must open the journal you specified in the batch job, and then review and post the entries.  

> [!TIP]
> Depending on your organizations work processes, you can choose to close or not close accounting periods and fiscal years in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The following procedure assumes that you have closed the fiscal year using the *Accounting Periods* option, generated a year-end closing entry using the **Close Income Statement** batch job, and are now ready to post the year-end closing entry along with the offsetting equity account entries. Your organization can choose to work differently, such as post the year-end closing entry as part of closing the fiscal year.

## To post the year end closing entry

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **General Journals** page, in the **Batch Name** field, select the batch that contains the closing entries.
3. Review the entries.
4. To post the journal, choose the **Post** action.

> [!NOTE]  
> If an error is detected, an error message is displayed. If the posting is successful, the posted entries are removed from the journal. After posting is complete, an entry is posted to each income statement account so that its balance becomes zero and the year's result is transferred to the balance sheet.

# Use the AMC banking 365 fundamentals extension

The AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals extension makes it easier, and more accurate, to send data to your banks. The extension connects [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with the AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central service, which can convert bank data from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] into formats that are required by over 600 banks around the world. For example, this makes it easier to transfer payments and credits to vendors by entering the payments in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], and then uploading them to your bank. The formats can also smooth out bank reconciliation processes. For more information, see [AMC Banking for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central](https://www.amcbanking.com/bc-fundamentals/).

> [!NOTE]
> AMC Banking has built additional extensions that work with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. This topic describes only the Fundamental extension.

> [!NOTE]
> In the generic version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], a global provider of services to convert bank data to any file format that your bank requires is set up and connected. In North American versions, the same service can be used to send payment files as electronic funds transfer (EFT), for example the commonly used Automated Clearing House (ACH) network, however with a slightly different process.

## Use our demonstration account

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] comes with a demonstration account that lets you try out the AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals extension. We provide default settings for connecting to AMC Banking, specifying the bank accounts to get data from in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], plus a few data exchange definitions. You can view the connection settings on the **AMC Banking Setup** page. For bank accounts, the extension applies values in the **Bank Name**, **Credit Transfer Msg. Nos.**, **Bank Statement Import Format**, and **Payment Export Format** fields on bank account cards.

We provide the settings, but to try out the extension you must run the assisted setup guide to apply them. To run the guide, on the **AMC Banking Setup** page, choose the **Assisted Setup** action.

> [!NOTE]
> There are some limitations on the demo account. For example, when you convert payments, the amount in the converted file will not match the actual amount. Instead, the amount will always be five units of the currency that you use for payments.  

## Setting up the extension

Getting started with the extension involves just a few easy steps, and an assisted setup guide will make the connection and turn on the extension. The guide helps you things like install the data exchange definitions for bank statement export/import setups and initiate the number series used for credit transfer messages.  

### To set up the required permission sets

Before people can use this extension, your administrator must copy the following permission sets, edit them, and then assign the new permission sets to users instead of original:

* **D365 Basic**
* **D365 Team Member**
* **D365 Read**
* **IntelligentCloudBC**

For more information, see [To copy a permission set](ui-define-granular-permissions.md#copy-a-permission-set).

For each new permission set, grant only the **Read** permission for the **AMC Banking Setup table (20101)**. For more information, see [To create or modify permissions manually](ui-define-granular-permissions.md#create-a-permission-set).

### To connect the extension to AMC Banking

1. Get a module and a service plan for AMC Banking. To do that, visit the [AMC License](https://license.amcbanking.com/register) page.
2. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **AMC Banking Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
3. On the **AMC Banking Setup** page, choose the **Assisted Setup** action.
4. Complete the steps in the assisted setup guide.

### To connect bank accounts to the extension

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Bank Accounts**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the card for the bank account that you want to connect to the service.
3. In the **Name** field, choose the format that your bank requires.  

   The formats are filtered to show only those that are relevant for the country/region that is specified for the bank account.
4. In the **Credit Transfer Msg. Nos.** field, choose the number series to use for messages that accompany payments.
5. In the **Bank Statement Import Format** and **Payment Export Format** fields, choose the data exchange definitions that your bank requires.

## Use the extension

Using this extension is just a matter of exporting data on the **Payment Journals** page, and then uploading it to your bank's web service. For more information, see [Making Payments with Bank Data Conversion or SEPA Credit Transfer](finance-make-payments-with-bank-data-conversion-service-or-sepa-credit-transfer.md).

> [!NOTE]
> You must fill in the **SWIFT Code** and **IBAN** fields for each bank account.

### To export data and submit it to your bank

> [!CAUTION]  
> When you export data by using the AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals extension, some of your business data will be exposed to the provider of the service. The service provider, AMC Consult A/S, is responsible for the privacy of this data. For more information, see [AMC Privacy Policy](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=510158).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Payment Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. Create the journal lines that you want to export.  

   > [!NOTE]
   > For each line, remember to choose **Electronic Payment** in the **Bank Payment Type** field.
3. Choose the **Export** action.

### To import and apply the converted file

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Payment Reconciliation Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **Import Bank Transaction** action, and then choose the converted file.  

   [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will create a new payment reconciliation journal that contains the data in the file. For more information, see [Applying Payments Automatically and Reconciling Bank Accounts](receivables-apply-payments-auto-reconcile-bank-accounts.md).

# Send Electronic Documents

> [!NOTE]
> The content in this article is only applicable for versions of Dynamics 365 Business Central that were released before 2023 release wave 2. In 2023 release wave 2, new functionality for E-Documents is included. To learn more, see [Set up e-documents](finance-how-setup-edocuments.md).  

The generic version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports sending electronic invoices and credit memos in the PEPPOL format, a format that the largest document exchange service providers support. A document exchange service provider dispatches electronic documents between trading partners. To provide support for other electronic document formats, you use the data exchange framework.  

 In the generic version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], a document exchange service is preconfigured and ready to be set up for your company. For more information, see [Set Up a Document Exchange Service](across-how-to-set-up-a-document-exchange-service.md). However, in some cases, you must install an app. For more information, see [Electronic Invoicing FAQ](faq-electronic-invoicing.yml).  

 To send a sales invoice as an electronic PEPPOL document, you select the **Electronic Document** option in the **Post and Send** dialog box. You can also set up the customer's default document sending profile from that dialog box. First, you must set up various master data, such as company information, customers, items, and units of measure. These are used to identify the business partners and items when converting data in fields in [Set Up Electronic Document Sending and Receiving](across-how-to-set-up-electronic-document-sending-and-receiving.md).  

### To send an electronic sales invoice

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Invoices**, and then choose the related link.  

2. Create a new sales invoice.  

3. When the sales invoice is ready to be invoiced, choose the **Post and Send** action.  

     If the customer's default sending profile is **Electronic Document**, then it will be shown in the **Post and Send Confirmation** dialog box. This way, you just have to choose the **Yes** button to post and send the invoice electronically in the selected format.  

4. In the **Post and Send Confirmation** dialog box, choose the AssistEdit button to the right of the **Send Document to** field.  

5. In the **Send Document to** dialog box, in the **Electronic Document** field, choose **Through Document Exchange Service**.  

6. In the **Format** field, choose **PEPPOL**.  

7. Choose the **OK** button. The **Post and Send Confirmation** dialog box appears. **Electronic Document (PEPPOL)** is added to the **Send Document to** field.  

8. Choose the **Yes** button.  

     The sales invoice is posted and sent to the customer in the PEPPOL format.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  You can also send a posted sales invoice as an electronic document. The procedure is the same as described in this topic for non-posted sales documents. On the **Posted Sales Invoice** page, choose the **Activity Log** action to view the status of the electronic document.

# Consolidate Balances for a Company that is a Customer and a Vendor
A company that you do business with might be both a customer and a vendor. When that's the case, you can avoid making unnecessary payments or receipts, and perhaps save on transaction fees, by consolidating the company's customer and vendor balances. Consolidation compares the company's balances as a vendor and as a customer, and then nets the amount so that that either the customer or vendor balance remains, depending on which amount was higher. 

To consolidate the balances, you must first link the customer and vendor companies through a contact that has the type **Company**. A customer or vendor can only have one contact of the type **Company**. For more information, see [Create Contacts](marketing-create-contact-companies.md).

After you link the companies, the **Customer Card** page offers the **Balance as Vendor** field, and the **Vendor Card** page includes the **Balance as Customer** field.

Though it's not a requirement, the customer and vendor companies are typically the same legal entity. 

## Before you start
Before you consolidate balances, specify a few settings on the **Marketing Setup** page. 

* On the **Interactions** FastTab, you must specify business relation codes in the **Customers** and **Vendors** fields. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses this information to determine the type of relation to display for contacts. 
* Optional: On the **Duplicates** FastTab, turn duplicate search on or off. By default, duplicate search is turned on. For more information, see [Handling duplicates](#handling-duplicates). 

## Link an existing customer and vendor company through a contact
The following steps describe how to link a customer and a vendor through a contact.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customer** or **Vendor**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the customer or vendor, and then choose the **Contact** action.   
3. Choose the contact, and then choose the **Link with existing** action.
4. Choose the type of entity to create a business relation with.
5. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

## Create a vendor from a customer, or vice versa
You can create a new vendor from an existing customer, or a new customer from a vendor. From the **Customer** or **Vendor** pages, open the **Contact** page. Choose the **Create as** action, and then either the **Customer** or **Vendor** options. 

## Create a new customer or vendor and link them through a vendor or customer contact
1. Create a new customer or vendor. For more information, see [Register New Customers](sales-how-register-new-customers.md).
2. After you set up the customer or vendor, choose the **Create** action, and then choose either the **Customer** or **Vendor** options. 

## To consolidate the customer and vendor balances for a contact company
On the **Payment Journal** page, use the **Net Customer/Vendor Balances** action to consolidate the customer and vendor balances into a single net amount. The action creates, but doesn't post, payment journal lines that contain the net balances.

> [!NOTE]
> If the customer or vendor balances contain amounts that are in different currencies, a line is created for the amount in each currency.

## Handling duplicates
If you turn on duplicate search on the **Duplicates** FastTab on the **Marketing Setup** page, a warning will display when you change the values of fields that are part of the setup for duplicate search strings. When a duplicate is found, you can take the following actions:

* Combine the duplicate contacts into a single contact that is the same for both the customer and vendor by using the **Merge With** capability on the **Contact Card** page. Typically, merging contacts is done only when the customer and vendor are the same legal entity. For more information, see [Merge Duplicate Records](sales-how-merge-duplicate-records.md). 
* Delete the vendor business relation for the vendor or customer contact, and then use the **Link to Existing** action to link to a different contact.

# Production Order Overview (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2025w1](includes/applies-to-2025w1.md)]

The **Production Order Overview** report provides a high-level summary of your organization's production order activities. This report filters out finished production orders so that it includes only current production order data. The report showcases key performance indicators (KPIs), such as:

- The number of production orders
- Completion rate measured as Finished %
- Actual Total Cost
- Total Expected Cost
- Total Standard Cost

:::image type="content" source="media/manufacturing/production-order-overview-v26.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Production Order Overview Power BI Report" lightbox="media/manufacturing/production-order-overview-v26.png":::

The **No. of Production Orders by Status** chart arranges productions orders by status, allowing you to quickly explore the volume of documents at different stages of production.

The **Completion Ratios by Source No** chart shows the completion rate of each source item by showing the percentage of quantity finished versus remaining. Each bar represents a source item, making it easy to determine which source items are fully complete, partially complete, or yet to start. This helps you monitor progress at a glance and prioritize follow-ups for delayed or underperforming orders.

The **Total Actual Cost Breakdown** pie chart divides total actual cost into its sub-components:

- Actual Capacity Cost Overhead
- Actual Material Cost
- Actual Capacity Cost
- Actual Subcontracted Cost
- Actual Manufacturing Overhead Cost

This visualization helps manufacturing managers quickly understand where costs are concentrated for more informed cost control decisions.

The **Current Production Orders** table lists detailed information for each production order, including: 

- Production Order Number
- Status
- Source No.
- Planned Quantity
- Finished Quantity
- Starting Date

The table provides more context when interacting with other visuals in the report, helping you examine specific orders for deeper analysis.

## Use the report

Manufacturing managers and supervisors use this report to monitor the progress, cost, and status of production orders to ensure efficient and balanced operations.

Manufacturing managers rely on this report to track production order completion rates, evaluate actual production costs, and identify potential delays or cost overruns. The **Completion Ratios by Source Number** chart highlights which orders are progressing as expected and which might require follow-up. The **Total Actual Cost Breakdown** chart provides a clear view of cost distribution, helping you pinpoint major cost drivers and make informed decisions to control expenses.

Production supervisors use the **Number of Production Orders by Status** chart to track order volumes across stages of production, helping you identify workflow bottlenecks. The **Current Production Orders** table serves as a detailed reference for ongoing orders, allowing you to provide updates to management, verify progress, and support production scheduling.

Cross-highlighting between visuals provides additional context and insight. For example, selecting a specific status or production order updates the related charts and tables. This interactive capability allows you to drill down into specific areas of interest and better understand how individual orders contribute to overall performance.

Together, these visuals offer a comprehensive snapshot of production health, empowering teams to maintain output targets, control costs, and ensure timely delivery.

## Key performance indicators (KPIs)

The Machine Center Load report includes the following KPIs and measures:

- [Actual Capacity Cost](manufacturing-powerbi-kpis.md#actual-capacity-cost)

# Handle vendor payment disputes

You can mark a vendor ledger entry as **On hold** if there's a dispute about a supplier document. The on hold status helps you maintain transparency and efficiency while you manage and resolve the issue.

## To set a vendor ledger entry on hold

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Vendor ledger entries**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the entry that you want to mark.
3. Choose **Edit List**. You can now enter up to 3 characters (likely your initials) in the **On Hold** field to indicate the document is on hold. 

## On hold entries, and the Suggest Vendor Payments batch job

The **Suggest Vendor Payments** batch job excludes vendor ledger entries that are **On Hold**. To learn more, go to [Suggest vendor payments](payables-how-suggest-vendor-payments.md).


## Analyzing On hold vendor ledger entries 

There are multiple other options for analyzing entries on hold. 

For instance, on the **Vendor ledger entries** page you can set a filter on the **On Hold** field to this value
``` Filter
<>''
```


You can also take the vendor ledger entries list page into analysis mode and define an analysis tab. To learn more, go to
[Using data analysis to show vendor ledger entries on hold](ad-hoc-analysis-purchasing.md#example-finance-accounts-payable---vendor-ledger-entries-on-hold)


Or you can run the [Payments on Hold](reports/report-319.md) report.

## Block vendors

You can also block a vendor, for example because of insolvency, so that people can't select the vendor for purchase documents, or so that they can't post payments to the vendor.

To learn more, go to [Block vendors](payables-how-block-vendors.md).

# Enable picking items by FEFO

First-Expired-First-Out (FEFO) is a sorting method that ensures that items with the earliest expiration dates are picked first.  

 This functionality only works when the following criteria are met:

- The item must be assigned an item tracking code where the **SN Warehouse Tracking**, **Lot Warehouse Tracking**, or **Package Warehouse Tracking** fields are selected. The item must be posted to inventory with an expiration date.
- On the location, the **Pick According to FEFO** toggle must be turned on.

Depending on which document you plan to use, make some more settings:

- **Inventory Pick**. You can use picking by FEFO for locations with and without bins.
- **Warehouse Pick**. On the location, the **Bin Mandatory** toggles must be turned on.

When all the criteria are met, the serial/lot-numbered items to pick are sorted with the oldest first in all picks and movements.  

> [!NOTE]  
> If some serial or lot-numbered items have specific tracking defined in the source document, such as sales order, then those are respected first and under them, the remaining, non-specific, serial/lot numbers are listed according to FEFO.
<br /><br />
If two serial or lot-numbered items have the same expiration date, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] selects the item with the lowest serial or lot number.
<br /><br />
When picking serial or lot-numbered items in locations set up for directed put-away and pick, only quantities in bins of the type *Pick* are picked according to FEFO.  
<br /><br />
To enable movements according to FEFO, leave the **From Bin** field empty on the **Inventory Movement** or **Movement Worksheet** pages.  
<br /><br />
If the **Strict Expiration Posting** field is selected on the **Item Tracking Code Card**, only items that aren't expired are included in the pick, and the lines are sorted according to the FEFO principle.
<br /><br />
> If you posted the item to inventory without an expiration date, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] populates the serial or lot number as a warehouse pick, but not an inventory pick.

# The QuickBooks Payroll file import extension
Use the QuickBooks Payroll File Import extension to import payroll transactions from QuickBooks to general ledger accounts in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For example, this is useful when you're transitioning from QuickBooks to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], or if you outsource your payroll but also want to keep track of it in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## Steps to import payroll data
The first step is for you, or maybe your accountant, to use the export features in QuickBooks to export the payroll data to an .IIF file. The second step is to open the **General Journals** page in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and use the **Import Payroll Transactions** action to import the file. During the import process, you map the general ledger accounts from QuickBooks to corresponding accounts in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The final step is to post the payroll transactions in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] according to the account mapping. 

For more information, see [Import Payroll Transactions](finance-how-import-payroll-transactions.md).

# Customizing Business Central online using apps

You can change [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online by installing apps that add functionality, changes behavior, or gives you access to new online services, for example. These apps are also called *extensions* because they *extend* [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## Manage apps

When you first launch [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], some apps are already installed for you. Over time, more apps will be made available to you, and you can then choose if you want to use the app or not.

For example, Microsoft provides an app that lets you integrate with PayPal Payments Standard. This extension is installed by default. But, an extension that offers integration with another payment service might come along. In that case, you can install the new extension and then choose which to use.  

To use an app, you must have the permissions to the installed objects.

To install or uninstall apps from AppSource or add per-tenant extensions, you must have the right permissions. You must either be a member of the **D365 Extension Mgt.** user group, or you must have the **EXTEN. MGT. - ADMIN** permission set explicitly. If you're an administrator, you can assign user groups and permissions to other users in your company. Learn more in [Create Users According to Licenses](ui-how-users-permissions.md).  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> For [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, you cannot upload per-tenant extensions or install AppSource apps through the **Extension Management** page. You cannot install AppSource apps on-premises, including in Docker-based deployments.

You manage the apps on the **Extension Management** page. You can access this page from Home. Alternatively, choose the **Search for Page or Report** icon ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") in the top right corner, enter **Extension**, and then choose the related link. Learn more in [Install and Uninstall apps](ui-extensions-install-uninstall.md).

> [!NOTE]  
> If you think you should have access to an app but you cannot find its functionality, check the **Extension Management** page - if the app is not listed there, you can install it as described in the following section.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Sign in to [AppSource.microsoft.com](https://appsource.microsoft.com/) using the email account that you use for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online. Use the same email account for other services and products for a smooth experience.  

You can also get to AppSource from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. On the **Extension Management** page, you can see the apps that are currently installed, and you can open the **Microsoft AppSource Apps** page that shows the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] apps that are currently available in AppSource. If you choose the **View AppSource** action, you're taken to [AppSource.microsoft.com](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2081646). Learn more in [Manage AppSource apps](admin-manage-appsource-apps.md).

If you choose an app, you can read about what the app does, and you can access Help for the app to learn more. When you choose to get an app, you must agree to the terms of use. If you get the app from the AppSource website, sign in to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to complete the installation.  

When you install an app, you might have to set it up, such as specifying an account for use with the **PayPal Payments Standard for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]** extension. Other apps add fields to an existing page, or they add a new page, for example.

If you uninstall an app, and you then change your mind, you can install it again. When you uninstall an app, your data is preserved. If you install the app again, it's still available. There are some apps that are required, and you can't uninstall them from the **Extension Management** page.

> [!NOTE]  
> You can keep an eye out for new apps from Microsoft and other suppliers at [AppSource.microsoft.com](https://appsource.microsoft.com/marketplace/apps?product=dynamics-365%3Bdynamics-365-business-central&page=1).

## Understanding the risks of installing apps

[!INCLUDE [ui-extensions-risk-install-apps](includes/ui-extensions-risk-install-apps.md)]

## Apps and data transfer

When apps communicate with other services, they might transfer data out of the geography of the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] environment. Examples of such apps include banking, payment, payroll, and forecasting services.

The same is true for the base application, such as the following capabilities:

* Cash Flow Forecast
* Document Exchange Service
* Dataverse connections
* OCR Service
* Online Map
* EU VAT Reg. No. Service

## Connect your business

Starting in 2022 release wave 2, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online environments can list one or more apps on the **Connectivity Apps** and **Banking Apps** pages. These apps can connect your business to external services that increase productivity by automating processes. For example, you can connect to your banks and automatically import bank transactions. The apps are easy to install and set up directly from this page. Choose an app to learn more about capabilities and pricing.  

View the list of suggested apps by choosing the **Connectivity Apps** action in the **Extension Management** page.  

> [!NOTE]
> The first person to open the **Connectivity Apps** page must allow the extension to connect to an external service. Allow the connection once or always. If you choose to block the connection, you must find the relevant apps on AppSource. If you allow the connection once or always, be aware that your information might be shared with third parties. Learn more in the section [Understanding the risks of installing apps](#understanding-the-risks-of-installing-apps).

This external service generates a list of relevant apps based on your country or region

## Recommended apps

Microsoft partners and resellers can create an app that they can use to compile lists of apps that they often recommend to their customers. If they do, and they deployed the app to your tenant, the apps are available on the **Recommended Apps** page. There you can read about each app and decide whether to install them.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are a Microsoft partner or reseller, and you're interested in providing a list of recommended apps, see [Recommend Apps from AppSource](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/recommend-apps) in the administration content.

# Set Up Resource Allocation
To ensure that a service task is performed well, it's important to find a resource who is qualified to do the work. You can set up [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] so that it's easy to allocate someone who has the right skills for the job. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], we call this _resource allocation_. You can allocate resources based on their skill, availability, or whether they are in the same service zone as the customer. 

To use resource allocation, you must set up:  
  
* The skills required to repair and maintain service items. You assign these to service items and resources.  
* Geographic regions, called zones, that you define for your market. For example, East, West, Central, and so on. You assign these to customers and resources.  
* Whether to display resource skills and zones, and whether to display a warning if someone chooses unqualified resource, or a resource that is not in the customer zone.  

## To set up skills
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Skills**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  

## To assign skills to service items and resources
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Items** or **Resources**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the card for the service item or resource, and then choose one of the following:  
  
    * For service items, choose **Resource Skills**.  
    * For resources, choose **Skills**.  

## To set up zones
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Zones**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  

## To assign zones to customers and resources 
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customers** or **Resources**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the card for the service item or resource, and then choose one of the following:  
  
    * For customers, choose a zone in the **Service Zone Code** field.  
    * For resources, choose the **Service Zones** action.  

## To specify what to show when a resource is chosen
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Management Setup**, and then choose the related link. 
2. In the **Resource Skills Option** field, choose one of the options described in the following table.  
  
    |**Option**|**Description**|  
    |------------|-------------|  
    |Code Shown | Displays the code only.|  
    |Warning Displayed | Shows the information and displays a warning if you choose a resource that is not qualified.|  
    |Not Used | Does not show this information.|  

## To update resource capacity  
You may need to change the capacity of resources.  
  
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Resource Capacity**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the resource, and then choose the **Set Capacity** action.  
3. Make the changes, and then choose **Update Capacity**.  

## To update skills for items, service items, or service item groups
If you want to change the skill codes assigned to items, for example from **PC** to **PCS**, you can do so either for an item, service item, or for all items in a service item group.  
  
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items** or **Service Item**, or **Service Item Group**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the entity to update, and then choose the **Resource Skills** action.  
3. On the line with the code to be changed, in the **Skill Code** field, choose the relevant skill code.  
4.  If the item has associated service items, a dialog box opens with the following two options:  
  
    * Change the skill codes to the selected value: Select this option if you want to replace the old skill code with the new one on all the related service items.  
    * Delete the skill codes or update their relation: Select this option if you want to change the skill code on this item only. The skill code on the related service items will be reassigned, that is, the **Assigned From** field will be updated.

# Modify planning suggestions in a graphical view

A typical planning activity is to change or add planning worksheet lines to modify the suggested supply orders before you commit them by running the **Carry out Action Message** function. An alternative to doing this in the planning worksheet is to use a graphical view. However, this is currently not supported in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

<!--On the **Item Availability by Timeline** page, you can modify certain supply orders and suggestions by dragging elements on the x-axis to change quantity or dragging elements on the y-axis to change due date.  

When you open the **Item Availability by Timeline** page from the **Planning Worksheet** page, you can make the following changes:  

- Modify a suggested supply order that only exists as a planning line.  
- Modify an existing supply order that the planning system suggests to change.  
- Create a new suggested supply order and modify it.  

For more information about the planning line types that are shown, see the Description field on the **Event Changes** FastTab.  

When you choose **Save Changes** on the **Item Availability by Timeline** page, the modifications that you have made are copied to the planning or requisition worksheet. You can now implement them using the **Carry Out Action Msg.-Plan.** function.  

The following procedure shows how to modify supply suggestions by drag and drop. As an alternative, you can change the **Due Date** and **Quantity** fields on the **Event Changes** FastTab and immediately see the changes graphically on the **Timeline** FastTab on the **Planning Worksheet** page.  

## To modify suggested supply orders in the graphical view

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Planning Worksheet**, and then choose the related link.  

2. Choose the line that you want to see item availability for, choose **Item Availability by**, and then choose **Timeline**.

    The **Item Availability by Timeline** page opens with the item number, location, and variant of the item on the selected planning line prefilled in the **Options** FastTab. The **Timeline** FastTab shows a graphical representation of the item’s projected inventory, including planning suggestions.  

<!--3. Make sure that the **Include Planning Suggestions** field is selected.  
3. Find the suggested supply order that you want to modify. You can identify modifiable elements by the green circle and the disk icon. For more information about the different symbols, see [Symbols and Icons on the Timeline FastTab](#symbols-and-icons-on-the-timeline-fasttab).  
4. Place the pointer over the green circle until it enlarges and the pointer changes to Move shape (four arrows).  
5. Press and hold the mouse button while you drag the pointer up or down to modify the quantity. Press and hold the mouse button while you drag the pointer left or right to modify the due date.  
6. In addition to moving elements by drag and drop, you can modify planning suggestions by using a number of drop-down menu functions. Access the drop-down menu for the green circle of a suggested supply element and select one the following functions  

    |Function|Description|  
    |--------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Create New Supply**|Creates a new element point where you access the drop-down menu, which represents a new suggested supply order. It becomes a new line in the planning worksheet when you choose **Save Changes**.<br /><br /> **NOTE:** If the **Location Filter** or **Variant Filter** fields on the **Options** FastTab are empty or have more than one filter value, then the new supply is created and later saved to the planning or requisition worksheet with the following codes:<br /><br /> * If the filter field is empty, then the new supply is created without a location or variant code.<br /><br /> * If more than one filter value is defined, then the new supply is created for the first filter value according to the sorting method.<br /><br /> If you want another variant or location code, then you must manually change it on the new planning line.|  
    |**Auto-Adjust Supply**|Optimizes a new supply that you have created in the graph by making sure that it results in zero inventory before the next supply.|  
    |**Delete Supply**|Deletes the element in the **Timeline** FastTab and deletes the planning line when you choose **Save Changes**. The icon changes to a disk that has a red cross when the supply has been deleted.<br /><br /> **NOTE:** You can only delete a supply of action message type **New**. After you choose **Save Changes**, you must manually delete the planning line in question in the planning or requisition worksheet.|  

7. Choose the **Reload** action if you want to reset all the changes that you have made after you last opened the **Item Availability by Timeline** page or selected **Reload**.  
8. When the elements are placed where you want them in the diagram, choose **Save Changes** to copy modified quantity and date changes to the planning or requisition lines that represent the graphical elements.  

To implement the supply plan changes, you must follow the resulting action messages from the planning or requisition worksheet. For more information, see Carry Out Action Msg.-Plan..

## Symbols and Icons on the Timeline FastTab
 |Symbol/Icon|Description|  
 |------------------|---------------------------------------|  
 |Black cross|Orders (both supply and demand).<br /><br /> -   Cannot be modified.<br />-   Visible when the **Show Projected Inventory** field is selected (orange graph).|  
 |Red circle|Existing supply orders that are not in planning suggestions.<br /><br /> -   Cannot be modified.<br />-   Visible when the **Show Projected Inventory** field is selected (orange graph).|  
 |Yellow star|Forecast demand.<br /><br /> -   Cannot be modified.<br />-   Visible when the **Forecast Name** field has a value.<br /><br /> When both the **Show Projected Inventory** and the **Include Planning Suggestions** fields are selected, then each yellow star has a linked counterpart in the opposite graph. This illustrates how a suggested supply fulfills the forecasted demand.|  
 |Green circle with an icon shaped as a disk that has a red cross|Suggested supply order with action message *Cancel*.<br /><br /> -   Cannot be modified.<br />-   Visible when the **Include Planning Suggestions** field is selected (green graph).|  
 |Green circle with an icon shaped as a disk that has a star|Suggested supply orders with action message *New*.<br /><br /> -   Can be modified.<br />-   Visible when the **Include Planning Suggestions** field is selected (green graph).|  
 |Green circle with an icon shaped as a disk that has one or two arrows|Suggested supply orders with action message *Reschedule*, *Change Qty.*, or *Resched. and Chg. Qty.*<br /><br /> -   Can be modified.<br />-   Visible when the **Include Planning Suggestions** field is selected (green graph).<br /><br /> The arrows reflect the direction of the planning suggestion. For example, a left arrow together with an up arrow reflects a *Resched. and Chg. Qty.* action message that consists of a backward rescheduling and a quantity increase.|  
-->
<!--When you access the drop-down menu for the **Timeline** FastTab, the following functions appear depending what you choose  

 |Function|Description|  
 |--------------|---------------------------------------|  
 |**Create New Supply**|Creates a new element on the point where you access the drop-down menu, which represents a new suggested supply order. It becomes a new line in the planning worksheet when you choose **Save Changes** on the **Process** tab.<br /><br /> Any filter values that are defined in the **Location Filter** or **Variant Filter** fields on the **Options** FastTab will be applied to the new supply order. **Note:**  If the filter fields are empty or have more than one filter value, then the new supply order is created by using the following codes: <ul><li>If the filter field is empty, then the new supply is created without a location or variant code.</li><li>If more than one filter value is defined, then the new supply is created by using the first filter value according to the sorting order.</li></ul> If you want another variant or location code in the new supply order, then you must manually change it on the new planning line.|  
 |**Auto-Adjust Supply**|Optimizes a new supply that you have created in the graph by making sure that it creates zero inventory before the next supply.|  
 |**Delete Supply**|Deletes the element in the **Timeline** FastTab and deletes the planning line when you choose **Save Changes** on the **Process** tab. The icon changes to a disk that has a red cross when the supply has been deleted. **Note:**  You can only delete a supply of action message type *New*. After you choose **Save Changes** on the **Process** tab, you must manually delete the planning line in question in the planning or requisition worksheet.|  
 |**Show Document**|Opens the order, planning line, or forecast that the element represents.|  
 |**Zoom Out (Ctrl++)**|Makes the scale of the x-axis larger, so that fewer days are shown. **Note:**  You can also do this by pressing Ctrl + scroll mouse wheel.|  
 |**Zoom In (Ctrl+-)**|Makes the scale of the x-axis smaller, so that more days are shown. **Note:**  You can also do this by pressing Ctrl + scroll mouse wheel.|  
 |**Reset Zoom (Ctrl+0)**|Reverts the scale of the x-axis to what was used before you zoomed.|  
-->
<!--In addition to the keyboard actions that were mentioned earlier, you can also use the following keyboard actions in the **TimeLine** FastTab.  

 |Keyboard Action|Description|

# Use the same Microsoft 365 Account in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_long.md)] and Microsoft Invoicing
When you sign up for a trial with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can move to a 30-day evaluation phase, you can start a subscription, or you can stop using [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. In all cases, you may at some point have seen something called **Microsoft Invoicing** and clicked it. This was an app that was part of what is now Microsoft 365 Business Standard and was formerly known as Microsoft 365 Business Premium subscription, so not everyone will have seen that tile in their Microsoft 365 experience.  

Microsoft Invoicing is no longer available, but if you need to sign into Invoicing to retrieve your data, you might see a message that you cannot access Microsoft Invoicing because your account is used in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

You see a similar message if you install the mobile app for Invoicing.  

## Workaround
Invoicing and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] have a shared platform. That means that you are recognized as an existing user of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] when you click Invoicing in the Microsoft 365 admin center. The reason is that Invoicing cannot use the same company as [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

So you will have to sign in to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and rename your existing company, and then create a new company that you can then use in Invoicing. No data is moved or overwritten during this workaround.

### To rename your company
1. Sign in to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].
2. In the top right corner, choose the **Settings** icon ![Settings.](media/ui-experience/settings_icon_small.png "Settings icon for role center"), and then choose **My Settings**.
3. In the **Company** field, choose a different company.
4. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Companies**, and then choose the related link.  
5. On the **Companies** page, choose **Edit List**.  
6. Change the name of the *My Company* entry to something else.  

    Wait a number of minutes. We’ll be making a number of changes in the underlying database, and that takes a while.
7.	When the system is ready again, choose the **Create New Company** button.  
8.  In the dialog that appears, specify the name as *My Company*, and choose the **Production – Setup Data Only** option.  

This again takes a number of minutes. When the process completes, you will be able to access Invoicing as part of your Microsoft 365 Business Standard experience. but only to export data since the Invoicing app is deprecated.  

### What about my data?
When you rename the original My Company, the database tables that store your existing [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] data are renamed, but the data itself is not touched.  

If you use both Invoicing and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the data is stored in two different containers (the two companies). Nothing is shared, so you'll have to manage customers and items in both companies.

# Set Up Items and Locations for Directed Put-away and Pick

When you set up a warehouse location for directed put-away and pick, you have new functionality available to you to help run the warehouse in the most efficient way possible. In order to make full use of this functionality, you provide additional information about the items, which in turn helps to make the calculations necessary to suggest the most efficient and effective ways to conduct warehouse activities. 

## To set up an item for directed put-away and pick  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the card for the item that you want to set up for directed put-away and pick.
3. On the **Warehouse** FastTab of the item card, fill in the fields to define how the item should be handled in the warehouse.  
4. Choose the **Units of Measure** action.
5. On the **Item Units of Measure** page, define the units of measure in which the item may be transacted by specifying the item's height, width, length, cubage, and weight.
6. Choose the **Bin Contents** action.
7. On the **Bin Contents** page, define the location and bin to which the item should be associated. The **Default** field is not used when the location is set up for directed put-away and pick.  

## To start using directed put-away and pick

Directed put-away and pick gives you access to advanced warehouse configuration features that can greatly enhance your efficiency and data reliability. In order to use this functionality, you must first set up a number of parameters in your warehouse location.  

To use the directed put-away and pick functionality, you must activate the functionality on the location card.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Locations**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the location where you want to use directed put-away and pick, and then choose the **Edit** action.  
3. On the **Warehouse** FastTab, select the **Directed Put-away and Pick** checkbox.  

You do not need to fill in any other fields on the location card until later in the setup process.  

> [!NOTE]  
> You can't set up the warehouse to use bins when the location has open item ledger entries.  

The next step is to define the type of bins you want to operate. For more information, see [Set Up Bin Types](warehouse-how-to-set-up-bin-types.md). The bin type defines how to use a given bin when processing the flow of items through the warehouse. You can assign a bin type to both a zone and to a bin.  

You can also define warehouse class codes, if the warehouse carries items that need specific storage conditions. Warehouse class codes are used when suggesting item placement in bins. You assign the warehouse class codes to product groups, which are then assigned to items and SKUs, or to zones and bins that can accommodate the storage conditions required by the warehouse class codes.  

You're now ready to set up zones, if you want. Using zones reduces the number of fields you need to fill in when you set up your bins, because bins created within zones inherit several properties from the zone. Zones can also make it easier for new or temporary employees to orient themselves in your warehouse. Note that flow is controlled by bins, therefore it is possible to operate with bins and only one zone.  

## To set up a zone in your warehouse  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Locations**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the location where you want to set up zone and open the location card, and then choose the **Zones** action.  
3. On the **Zones** page, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  

When you change a zone parameter, all bins created thereafter in that zone will have the new characteristics, but the original bins will not be changed.  

> [!NOTE]  
> If you want to operate without zones, you must still create one zone code that is undefined except for the code.  

The next step is to define bins. Learn more at [Set Up Locations to Use Bins](warehouse-how-to-set-up-locations-to-use-bins.md).  

In addition, you must create put-away templates and counting periods. Learn more at [Set Up Put-away Templates](warehouse-how-to-set-up-put-away-templates.md).

description: Learn about the different factors that affect item availability in your warehouse.

# Design Details: Availability in the Warehouse

Stay on top of item availability to ensure that outbound orders flow efficiently, and that your delivery times are optimal.  

Availability can vary, depending on several factors. Fr example:

* Allocations at the bin level when warehouse activities such as picks and movements happen.
* When the inventory reservation system imposes restrictions to comply with.

Before allocating quantities to picks for outbound flows, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] verifies that all conditions are met.

When conditions aren't met, error messages are shown. One typical message is the generic "Nothing to handle." message. The message can be shown for many different reasons in outbound and inbound flows where a document line contains the **Qty. to Handle** field.

## Bin content and reservations  

Item quantities exist both as warehouse entries and as item ledger entries in inventory. These two types of entries contain different information about where items are and whether they're available. Warehouse entries define an item’s availability by bin and bin type, which is called bin content. Item ledger entries define an item’s availability by its reservation for outbound documents.  

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates the quantity that's available to pick when bin content is coupled with reservations.  

## Quantity available to pick  

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] reserves items for pending sales order shipments so that they aren't picked for other sales orders that ship earlier. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] subtracts quantities of items that are already being processed, as follows:

* Quantities reserved for other outbound documents.
* Quantities on existing pick documents.
* Quantities picked but not yet shipped or consumed.  

The result is calculated dynamically and displayed in the **Available Qty. to Pick** field on the **Pick Worksheet** page. The value is also calculated when users create warehouse picks directly for outbound documents. The following are examples of outbound documents:

* Sales orders
* Production consumption
* Outbound transfers

The result is available in these documents in the quantity fields, such as the **Qty. to Handle** field.  

> [!NOTE]  
> For the priority of reservations, the quantity to reserve is subtracted from the quantity available to pick. For example, if the quantity available in pick bins is 5 units, but 100 units are in put-away bins, when you reserve more than 5 units for another order, an error message is displayed because the additional quantity must be available in pick bins.  

### Calculating the quantity available to pick  

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates the quantity available to pick as follows:  

quantity available to pick = quantity in pick bins - quantity on picks and movements – (reserved quantity in pick bins + reserved quantity on picks and movements)  

The following diagram shows the different elements of the calculation.  

![Available to pick with reservation overlap.](media/design_details_warehouse_management_availability_2.png "Available to pick with reservation overlap")  

## Quantity available to reserve

Because the concepts of bin content and reservation coexist, the quantity of items that are available to reserve must align with allocations to outbound warehouse documents.  

You can reserve all inventory items, except items for which outbound processing has started. The quantity that's available to reserve is defined as the quantity on all documents and bin types. The following outbound quantities are exceptions:  

* Quantity on unregistered pick documents  
* Quantity in shipment bins  
* Quantity in to-production bins  
* Quantity in open shop floor bins  
* Quantity in to-assembly bins  
* Quantity in adjustment bins  

The result is displayed in the **Total Available Quantity** field on the **Reservation** page.  

On a reservation line, the quantity that can't be reserved because it's allocated in the warehouse is displayed in the **Qty. Allocated in Warehouse** field on the **Reservation** page.  

## Check whether items are available for picking

[!INCLUDE [inventory-availability-overview](includes/inventory-availability-overview.md)]

### Calculating the quantity available to reserve

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates the quantity available to reserve as follows:  

quantity available to reserve = total quantity in inventory - quantity on picks and movements for source documents - reserved quantity - quantity in outbound bins  

The following diagram shows the different elements of the calculation.  

![Avaliable to reserve per warehouse allocation.](media/design_details_warehouse_management_availability_3.png "Avaliable to reserve per warehouse allocation")

# The tax file formats (DK) extension
If you engage in trade with companies, or internal branches or subsidiaries, in other EU countries/regions you must report information about the activities to SKAT and to Statistics Denmark. If you use the VAT and Intrastat reporting features in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], this extension can ensure that the file you export is compatible with requirements from these organizations. The extension adds the MS-ECSL Report Export File and Intrastat Export Lines submission codeunits to your VAT Report configuration, so you can export data in the new format right away.

The extension is free, you just need to install it.

# The Late Payment Prediction extension

Effectively managing receivables is important to the overall financial health of a business. To reduce outstanding receivables and help you fine-tune your collections strategy, the extension predicts whether to expect late payments. For example, if a payment is predicted to be late, you might decide to adjust the terms of payment or the payment method for the customer.

## Get started

When you open a posted sales document, a notification displays at the top of the page. To use the Late Payment Prediction Extension, opt in by choosing **Enable** in the notification. Alternatively, you can set up the extension manually. For example, if you regret dismissing the notification.

To enable the extension manually, follow these steps:

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Late Payment Prediction Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary.

> [!NOTE]
> If you decide to enable the extension manually, be aware that [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will not allow you to do so if the quality of the model is low. The quality of the model indicates how accurate the model's predictions are likely to be. Several factors can impact the quality of a model. For example, there might not have been enough data, or there wasn't enough variation in the data. You can view the quality of the model you're currently using on the **Late Payment Prediction Setup** page. You can also specify a minimum threshold for the model quality.

## View all payment predictions

If you enable the extension, a **Payments Predicted to be Late** tile is available in the **Business Manager** Role Center. The tile displays the number of payments that are predicted to be late, and lets you open the **Customer Ledger Entries** page where you can dig deeper into the posted invoices. There are three columns to pay attention to:  

* **Late Payment** - Indicates whether the payment for the invoice is predicted to be late.
* **Prediction Confidence** - Indicates how reliable you should consider the prediction to be. **High** means that the prediction is at least 90% sure, **Medium** is between 80% and 90%, and **Low** is below 80%.
* **Prediction Confidence %** - Shows the actual percentage behind the confidence rating. By default, this column is hidden, but you can add it if you want. For more information, see [Personalize Your Workspace](ui-personalization-user.md).

> [!TIP]
> The Customer Ledger Entries page shows a FactBox. While you're reviewing predictions, the information in the **Customer Details** section can be helpful. When you choose the invoice in the list, the section shows information about the customer. It also lets you take immediate action. For example, if a customer frequently misplaces their wallet, you can open the Customer card from the FactBox and block the customer for future sales.  

## Design details

Microsoft deploys and operates predictive web services in all regions where [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is available. Access to these web services is included in your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] subscription. For more information, see the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central Licensing Guide. The guide is available for download on the [Business Central](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/business-central/overview/) website.

The web services work in three modes:

* Train model. The web service trains the model based on the provided dataset.
* Evaluate model. The web service checks whether the model returns reliable data for the provided dataset.
* Predict. Web-service applies the model to the provided dataset to make a prediction.

These web services are stateless, meaning they use data only to calculate predictions on demand. They don't store data.

> [!NOTE]  
> You can use your own predictive web service instead of ours. For more information, see [Create and use your own predictive web service late payment prediction](#AnchorText).

### Data required to train and evaluate the model

For each **Customer ledger entry** that has a related **Posted Sales Invoice**:

* Amount in local currency, including tax
* Payment terms in days are calculated as **Due Date** minus **Posting Date**
* Whether there's an applied credit memo

Additionally, the record has aggregated data from other invoices that are related to the same customer.

- Total number and amounts on paid invoices
- Total number and amounts on invoices that were paid late
- Total number and amounts on outstanding invoices
- Total number and amounts on outstanding invoices that are already late
- Average days late
- Ratio: Number of paid late/paid invoices
- Ratio: Amount paid late/paid invoices
- Ratio: Number of outstanding late/outstanding invoices
- Ratio: Amounts on outstanding late/outstanding invoices

> [!NOTE]
> The information about the customer isn't included in the dataset.

### Standard model and My model

The Late Payment Prediction extension's predictive model is trained on data that represents a range of small to medium-sized businesses. When you start posting invoices and receiving payments, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] evaluates whether the standard model fits your business flow.

If your processes don't match the standard model, you can use the extension but you need to get more data. Just continue to use [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

> [!NOTE]
> We use a bit of your compute time each week when we evaluate and re-train the model.

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] runs training and evaluation automatically when enough paid and late invoices are available. However, you can run it manually whenever you want.

#### To train and use your model

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Late Payment Prediction Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. In the **Selected Model** field, choose **My Model**.
3. Choose the **Create My Model** action, to train model on your data.  

## <a name="AnchorText"> </a>Create and use your own predictive web service for late payment prediction

For [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, the model is published by Microsoft and connected to the Microsoft subscription. For other deployment options, you have to create Machine Learning resources in your own Azure subscription. You can find sample steps in the [sample repo](https://github.com/microsoft/BCTech/tree/master/samples/MachineLearning). The purpose of this task is to get the API URI and API key.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Late Payment Prediction Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **Use My Azure Subscription** check box.
3. On the **Use My Azure Subscription** FastTab, enter the API URL and API key for your model.

# Project analytics

Businesses capture lots of data during daily activities that supports business intelligence (BI) for project managers, such as:

- Cost performance for projects
- Completion rates for projects
- Financial data for projects

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides features to help you gather, analyze, and share your organization's project data:

- Power BI reports for projects
- Ad-hoc analysis on lists
- Ad-hoc analysis of data in Excel (using Open in Excel)
- Built-in project analytics tools
- Built-in project reports

Each of these features has its advantages and disadvantages, depending on the type of data analysis and the role of the user. To learn more, go to [Analytics, business intelligence, and reporting overview](reports-bi-reporting.md).

This article introduces how you can use these analytical features to gain insights into your projects.

## Analytics needs in projects

When you think about the analytics needs in projects management, it might help to use a persona-based model that describes different analytics needs at a high-level.

:::image type="content" source="/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/media/analytics-personas.svg" alt-text="Illustration of different personas for analytics" lightbox="/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/media/analytics-personas.svg":::

People in different roles have different needs when it comes to data, and they use the data in different ways. For example, people in project management interact with data differently than people in finance.

:::image type="content" source="/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/media/analytics-personas-scenarios.svg" alt-text="Illustration of how different personas have different analytics needs." lightbox="/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/media/analytics-personas-scenarios.svg":::

| Role  | Data aggregation | Typical ways to consume data          | 
|------------------- |-------------------| ---------------------- |
|COO / CFO / CEO | Performance data  | KPIs, dashboards, financial reports               |
|Project Manager     | Trends, summaries | Built-in managerial reports, ad-hoc analysis      |
|Project participant | Detailed data     | Built-in operational reports, on-screen task data |

## Using Power BI to monitor project KPIs

A key performance indicator (KPI) is a measurable value that shows how effectively you’re meeting your goals. In project management, people often use the following KPIs to monitor project performance:

- % Complete
- % Invoiced
- Realization %
- Actual Profit
- Actual Profit Margin %
- Actual (Total Cost)
- Budget (Total Cost)

:::image type="content" source="media/projects/project-overview.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Projects Overview Power BI Report" lightbox="media/projects/project-overview.png":::

These KPIs (and more) are available for projects in the Project Power BI app for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

To learn more, go to [Power BI Projects app](projects-powerbi-app.md).

### Reports in the Power BI Projects app

[!INCLUDE [power-bi-projects-app](includes/power-bi-projects-app.md)]

To learn more, go to [Power BI Projects app](projects-powerbi-app.md).

## Ad-hoc analysis of project data

Sometimes, you just need to check whether the numbers add up correctly, or quickly confirm a figure. The following features are great for ad-hoc analyses:

- Data analysis on ledger list pages
- Open in Excel

The Data Analysis feature lets you open almost any list page, such as **Project Ledger Entries**, enter analysis mode, and then group, filter, and pivot data as you see fit.

Similarly, you can use the **Open in Excel** action to open a list page, optionally filter the list to a subset of the data, and then use Excel to work with the data. For example, by using features such as Analyze Data, What-If Analysis, or Forecast Sheet.

> [!TIP]
> If you configure OneDrive for system features, the Excel workbook opens in your browser.

## Built-in reports for projects

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes several built-in reports to help project organizations report on their data.

[!INCLUDE [report-explorer-projects](includes/report-explorer-projects.md)]

To learn more about reports that are relevant for project management, go to [Built-in project reports](project-reports.md).

## On-screen project analytics

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] has several pages that give you project overviews and tasks to do, such as:

- [Monitor project progress and performance](projects-how-monitor-progress-performance.md)

# Inventory analytics

Businesses capture lots of data during daily activities that supports business intelligence (BI) for inventory managers:

- Shipping of goods when sales orders are fulfilled.
- Receipts of items when purchase orders are fulfilled.
- Movements of items between locations.

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides features to help you gather, analyze, and share your organization's inventory data:

- Power BI reports for inventory
- Ad-hoc analysis on lists
- Ad-hoc analysis of data in Excel (using Open in Excel)
- Built-in inventory analytics tools
- Built-in inventory reports

Each of these features has its advantages and disadvantages, depending on the type of data analysis and the role of the user. To learn more, go to [Analytics, business intelligence, and reporting overview](reports-bi-reporting.md).

This article introduces how you can use these analytical features to gain insights into your inventory.

## Analytics needs in inventory

When you think about the analytics needs in inventory management, it might help to use a persona-based model that describes different analytics needs at a high-level.

:::image type="content" source="/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/media/analytics-personas.svg" alt-text="Illustration of different personas for analytics" lightbox="/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/media/analytics-personas.svg":::

People in different roles have different needs when it comes to data, and they use the data in different ways. For example, people in asset management and finance interact with data differently than people in sales.

:::image type="content" source="/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/media/analytics-personas-scenarios.svg" alt-text="Illustration of how different personas have different analytics needs." lightbox="/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/media/analytics-personas-scenarios.svg":::

| Role              | Data aggregation  | Typical ways to consume data                          | 
|-------------------|-------------------| ----------------------------------------------------- |
|COO / CFO / CEO    | Performance data  | KPIs, dashboards, financial reports           |
|Inventory Manager  | Trends, summaries | Built-in managerial reports, ad-hoc analysis      | 
|Warehouse worker   | Detailed data     | Built-in operational reports, on-screen task data |

<!-- 
## Inventory KPIs

A key performance indicator (KPI) is a measurable value that shows how effectively you’re meeting your goals. In inventory management, people often use the following KPIs to monitor their organization's sales performance:

- TODO  
-->

## Using Power BI to monitor inventory KPIs

A key performance indicator (KPI) is a measurable value that shows how effectively you’re meeting your goals. In inventory management, people often use the following KPIs to monitor their core inventory performance:

- Number of Scheduled Receipt
- Number of Planned Order Receipt
- Gross Requirement
- Projected Available Balance
- Quantity on Sales Orders, Purchase Returns, Service Orders, Projects, Production Orders, or Assemply Component
- Inventory by Item/Location/Lot/Serial No.

:::image type="content" source="media/inventory/inventory-overview.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Inventory Overview Power BI Report" lightbox="media/inventory/inventory-overview.png":::

For inventory valuation, you can use the following KPIs to monitor the value kept in your inventory:

- Ending balance inventory value
- Variance by item/location
- Invoiced Quantity
- Increases/Decreases in quantity (by item/location)

:::image type="content" source="media/inventory-valuation/inventory-valuation-by-location.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Inventory Valuation by Location Power BI Report" lightbox="media/inventory-valuation/inventory-valuation-by-Location.png":::

All of these purchasing KPIs (and more) are available in the Inventory Power BI apps for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

To learn more, go to:

- [Power BI Inventory app](inventory-powerbi-app.md)
- [Power BI Inventory Valuation app](inventory-valuation-powerbi-app.md)

### Reports in the Power BI Inventory app

[!INCLUDE [power-bi-inventory-app](includes/power-bi-inventory-app.md)]

To learn more, go to [Power BI Inventory app](inventory-powerbi-app.md).

### Reports in the Power BI Inventory Valuation app

[!INCLUDE [power-bi-inventory-valuation-app](includes/power-bi-inventory-valuation-app.md)]

To learn more, go to [Power BI Inventory Valuation app](inventory-valuation-powerbi-app.md).

## Use financial reporting to produce financial statements and KPIs related to inventory

The **Financial Reporting** feature gives you insights into the financial data shown on your chart of accounts (COA). You can set up financial reports to analyze figures in general ledger (G/L) accounts, and compare general ledger entries with budget entries. Specifically for inventory management, you can set up financial reports on the general ledger (G/L) accounts that you use to track inventory postings.

Dimensions play an important role in business intelligence. A dimension is data that you add to an entry as a parameter. Dimensions let you group entries that have similar characteristics, such as customers, regions, products, and salesperson. Among other purposes, use dimensions when you define analysis views and create financial reports. To learn more, go to [Work with Dimensions](finance-dimensions.md).

To learn more about financial reports, go to [Prepare Financial Reports with Financial Data and Account Categories](bi-how-work-account-schedule.md).

## Finance reporting across business units or legal entities (related to inventory)

Some organizations use [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in multiple business units or legal entities. Others use [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in subsidiaries that report to parent organizations. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] gives accountants tools that help them transfer general ledger entries from two or more companies (subsidiaries) into a consolidated company. Specifically for inventory management, you might want to consolidate general ledger entries for your inventory accounts to be able to track sales KPIs across business units or legal entities.

To learn more, go to [Company consolidation](finance-consolidated-company-reporting.md).

## Ad-hoc analysis of inventory data

Sometimes, you just need to check whether the numbers add up correctly, or quickly confirm a figure. The following features are great for ad-hoc analyses:

- Data analysis on ledger list pages
- Open in Excel

The Data Analysis feature lets you open almost any list page, such as **Item Ledger Entries**, enter analysis mode, and then group, filter, and pivot data as you see fit.

:::image type="content" source="media/data-analysis-inventory-dead-stock.png" alt-text="Example of how to do a old stock data analysis on the Item Ledger Entries page." lightbox="media/data-analysis-inventory-dead-stock.png":::

Similarly, you can use the **Open in Excel** action to open a list page, optionally filter the list to a subset of the data, and then use Excel to work with the data. For example, by using features such as Analyze Data, What-If Analysis, or Forecast Sheet.

<!-- :::image type="content" source="media/open-in-excel-item-ledger-entries.png" alt-text="Example of how to do data analysis on the Item Ledger Entries data using Excel." lightbox="media/open-in-excel-item-ledger-entries.png"::: -->

> [!TIP]
> If you configure OneDrive for system features, the Excel workbook opens in your browser.

To learn more about how to do ad-hoc analysis on inventory data, go to [Ad hoc analysis of inventory data](ad-hoc-analysis-inventory.md).

## Built-in reports for inventory

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes several built-in reports, tracing functions, and tools to help inventory organizations report on their data.

[!INCLUDE [inventory_reports_report_explorer](includes/inventory-reports-report-explorer-include.md)]

To learn more about reports that are relevant for inventory, go to [Built-in inventory and warehouse reports](inventory-WMS-reports.md).

## On-screen inventory analytics

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] has several pages that give you inventory overviews and tasks to do. Here are some examples to get you started:

- [View the Availability of Items](inventory-how-availability-overview.md)
- [Track items with serial, lot, and package numbers](inventory-how-work-item-tracking.md)
- [Trace item-tracked items](inventory-how-to-trace-item-tracked-items.md)
- [Audit the reconciliation between the inventory ledger and the general ledger](finance-how-to-post-inventory-costs-to-the-general-ledger.md#to-audit-the-reconciliation-between-the-inventory-ledger-and-the-general-ledger)
- [View cross-docked items in a shipment or pick worksheet](warehouse-how-to-cross-dock-items.md#to-view-cross-docked-items-in-a-shipment-or-pick-worksheet)

The sales module also include analytics pages related to inventory:

- [Calculate order promising dates](sales-how-to-calculate-order-promising-dates.md)
- [Calculate delivery dates for sales orders](sales-date-calculation-for-sales.md)
- [Track packages](sales-how-track-packages.md)

### Show inventory-related general ledger entries and balances from the Chart of Accounts page

The **Chart of Accounts** page shows all general ledger accounts with aggregated numbers posted to the general ledger. From this page, you can do things like:  

- View reports that show general ledger entries and balances.  
- Review a list of posting groups for that account.
- View separate debit and credit balances for a single account.

Specifically for inventory management, you can create a view on the Chart of Accounts page that only shows the accounts you use to post inventory entries.

:::image type="content" source="media/chart-of-accounts-page.png" alt-text="Example of how the Chart of Accounts page shows finance insights" lightbox="media/chart-of-accounts-page.png":::

To learn more, go to [Understand the Chart of Accounts](finance-general-ledger.md#the-chart-of-accounts).

### Analyze inventory data by dimensions

Dimensions are values that categorize entries so you can track and analyze them on documents, such as sales orders. Dimensions can, for example, indicate the project or department an entry came from.  

So, instead of setting up separate general ledger accounts for each department or location, you can use dimensions as a basis for analysis and avoid having to create a complicated chart of accounts structure.

To learn more, go to [Analyze Data by Dimensions](bi-how-analyze-data-dimension.md).

# About production orders

Use production orders to manage the conversion of purchased materials into manufactured items. Production orders route work through various work or machine centers on the shop floor.  

Before they start production, most companies do supply planning, typically once a week, to calculate how many production orders and purchase orders they need fulfill sales demand. Purchase orders supply the required components according to the end item's bill of materials (BOM).

Production orders are central components in manufacturing, and contain the following information:  

- Products planned for manufacturing  
- Materials required for the planned production orders  
- Materials that are already selected  
- Products that were manufactured in the past  
- Materials that were used in previous manufacturing operations  

Production orders are the starting points for:  

- Planning future manufacturing  
- Controlling current manufacturing  
- Tracking of finished manufacturing  

## Production order creation  

You can create production orders on an order-by-order basis manually on the **Production Order** page, or generate them from the **Sales Order Planning** or **Order Planning** pages. You can also create multiple orders from the **Planning Worksheet** page.  

You create production orders using information from:  

- Items  
- Production BOMs
- Routings  
- Machine centers  
- Work centers  

## Reserving and tracking production orders to their source

Production orders are automatically reserved and tracked to their source when you create them from:  

- The [Planning Worksheet](production-how-to-run-mps-and-mrp.md) page.
- The [Sales Order Planning](production-how-to-create-production-orders-from-sales-orders.md) page.
- The [Order Planning](production-how-to-plan-for-new-demand.md) page.  
- The [Replan](production-how-to-replan-refresh-production-orders.md) action on production orders.  

To learn more, go to [Track Relations Between Demand and Supply](production-how-track-demand-supply.md).

If you create production orders by other means, they aren't automatically reserved and tracked.

## Production order status  

A production order can have one of the following statuses:

- Simulated
- Planned
- Firm Planned
- Released
- Finished

The status of a production order controls what you can do with it, and the form and content of the production. Production orders display on different pages according to their status. You can't change the status of a production order manually. To change the status of an order, use the **Change Status** action on the production order or use the **Change Production Order Status** page to change the status of one or orders in one go.

The **Change Status** action is available for the following types of orders:

- Simulated production orders
- Planned production orders
- Firm planned production orders
- Released production orders

> [!TIP]
> A confirmation dialog with additional questions displays for each order individually. If there are multiple orders with partial output or consumption, confirm each one separately.

If the status of orders can't change, they're skipped. The **Error Message** page shows the orders that were skipped and the reasons.  

### Simulated production order  

A simulated production order is unique because of the following characteristics:  

- It's a simulation you can use for quotes and costing. For example, when the Research and Development department wants a cost estimate for a proposed item. A simulated production order serves as an example of a production order.  
- They don't influence the planning of orders. MPS and MRP don't consider and aren't affected by simulated production orders. Also, you can't use a simulated production order as a template because it disappears when you change its status.  

### Planned production order  

A planned production order is unique because of the following characteristics:  

- You can automatically create a planned production order from a sales order.  
- Planned production orders are like released production orders and provide input to planning by showing the total capacity requirements by work center or machine center.  
- A planned production order represents the best estimate of the future load for the work center or machine center load based on available information. Typically, they're generated from planning, but you can also manually create them. However, they're erased the next time you run planning so it isn't practical to create them manually.  
- Their generation in planning results in a suggested "planned order release" that includes the quantity, release date, and due date. The planning system logic is based on the replenishment system, reorder policies, and order modifiers that it encounters in the net requirement planning process.  
- The load for each work center or machine center on the planned production order's routing shows their effect.  

### Firm planned production order  

A firm planned production order is unique because of the following characteristics:  

- You can automatically create a firm planned production order from a sales order.  
- A firm planned production order acts as a placeholder in the planning schedule for a future project released to the floor.  
- You can generate them during planning, create them manually, or create them from sales orders. They aren't erased during subsequent planning.  
- Their generation in planning results in a suggested "planned order release" that includes the quantity, release date, and due date. The planning system logic is based on the replenishment system, reorder policies, and order modifiers that it encounters in the net requirement planning process.  
- The load for each work center or machine center on the firm planned production order's routing show their effect.  

### Released production order  

The released production order is unique, based on the following characteristics:  

- You can automatically create a released production order from a sales order.  
- A released production order doesn't necessarily mean that materials are picked or the project moves to its first operation.  
- People typically create a released production order immediately after they enter the sales order in make-to-order (MTO) environments.  
- You can use a released production order to record the actual material consumption and product output. In addition, automatic flushing of consumption and product output only occur for released production orders.  

### Finished production order  

A finished production order is unique, based on the following characteristics:  

- A finished production order is typically one that is manufactured.  
- Finishing the production order is an important task in completing the costing lifecycle of the produced item. After you finish a production order, you can adjust and reconcile costing.  
- Finished production orders are used for reporting and to support the ability to track back to other orders (for example, sales, production, and purchases). The ability to track back to a finished production order allows you to review the detailed history.  
- You can't change finished production orders.  

#### Reopen a finished production order to make corrections

After you complete a production order and set its status to **Finished**, you might discover a mistake. For example, you might find that consumption is missing or the item tracking information is incorrect. To make sure that your inventory and cost transactions are correct, use the **Reopen** action on the **Finished Production Orders** page to make adjustments. However, to protect your data there are a few restrictions:

- You can only reopen an order one time.
- You can't reopen an order that has no output and cost was written off to an adjustment account.

## Production order execution  

After you create and schedule a production order, you must release it to the shop floor so that work can start. While you work on an order, you record:  

- The materials that were picked or consumed.  
- The time spent working on the order.
- The quantity of the item produced.

You can record this information manually or through automatic reporting. The method depends on the selection in the **Flushing Method** field on the item and work center.  

### Material consumption  

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers options for how to record material consumption. For example, you can record material consumption manually, which can be useful if you often substitute components or generate more scrap than you expected.  

Consumption of materials can be processed through the [consumption journal](production-how-to-post-consumption.md), or [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can record it automatically, which is known as automatic reporting (flushing). The **Manual**, **Forward**, and **Backward** reporting methods are available.

Manual consumption reporting uses consumption journals to specify material picking.  

Forward consumption reporting assumes the expected quantity of all materials for the entire order is consumed at the release of a production order, unless you use routing link codes. When you use routing link codes, the material consumed after the start of the operational step is recorded in the output journal. To forward flush the entire production order, you need to do two things:  

- All items in the top-level production BOM need to have forward flushing selected on their respective item card.  
- All routing link codes on the production BOM must be removed.  

Backward consumption reporting records the actual quantity of all material picked or consumed when the status of a production order is changed to *Finished,* unless using routing link codes. When you use routing link codes, the material is consumed after a quantity of the parent item is recorded for the operational step in the output journal.  

When you refresh the production order, the flushing method is copied from the item card. The flushing method for each production order component controls how and when you record consumption. Therefore, it's important to note that you can change flushing method for specific items directly on the production order. To learn more, go to [Flush Components According to Operation Output](production-how-to-flush-components-according-to-operation-output.md).

### Production output  

You can track the time spent working on a production order and the quantity produced. This information can help you determine the costs of production. Also, manufacturers who use a standard costing system might want to record actual information in order to help them develop better standards.  

Output can be processed through [output journals](production-how-to-post-output-quantity.md), but can also be recorded automatically. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] copies the flushing method from the machine center or work center card to the production order routing when refreshing. As with material consumption, there are **Manual**, **Forward**, and **Backward** reporting methods for output.

The Manual method uses the output journal to specify time consumed and quantity produced.  

The Forward method records the expected output (and time), which is automatically recorded at the release of a production order. Routing link codes aren't a factor in the forward flushing of the output.  

Backward method records the expected output (and time), which is automatically recorded at the finish of a production order. Routing link codes aren't a factor in the back flushing of the output.  

### Posting consumption and output  

You can use any combination of automatic flushing and manually recorded information for both consumption and output. For example, you might want to automatically forward flush components, but still use a consumption journal to record scrap. Similarly, you might want to automatically record output, but use an output journal to record scrap of the parent item or extra time spent on the order.  

Finally, if you enter consumption and output manually, you need to determine the sequence in which you're going to record this information. You can record consumption first and use a shortcut method to enter the information, which is based on expected quantity of output. Or, you can enter output first, using the **Explode Routing** action. You would then record consumption based on actual quantity of output.  

### Production journals  

The [Production Journal](production-how-to-register-consumption-and-output.md) combines the functions of a consumption journal and output journals into one journal, which is accessed directly from the released production order.  

The purpose of a production journal is to provide a single interface for you to register consumption and output from a production order.  

Production journals have a simple view and provide you with the ability to:  

- Easily record output and consumption related to a production order  
- Relate the components to operations  
- Relate actual operation data with the standard estimates on a production order routing and component lines  
- Post and print an overview of registered operation data for a production order  

Production journals do many of the same things as consumption and output journals. Dimensions, item tracking, and bin contents are handled in the same way.  

However, production journals differ from the consumption and output journals in the following ways:  

- You open them directly from a released production order line and they're preset with the relevant data.
- They let you define which types of components to handle based on a flushing method filter on the journal.  
- Quantities and times already posted for the order display at the bottom of the journal as actual entries.  
- Fields where data entry is irrelevant are blank and noneditable.  
- You can specify how output quantities are preset in the journal. For example, that the last operation must have zero as the output quantity.  
- A confirmation message displays if you exit a journal without posting your changes.  
- They display operations and components together in a structure that provides an overview of the production process.  

In the production journal, consumption quantities are posted as negative item ledger entries, output quantities are posted as positive ledger entries, and times spent are posted as capacity ledger entries.

# Create Bin Contents

After you have set up your bins, you can set up the bin contents. In other words, you can set up the items you want to store in any given bin and set the rules that govern filling the bin with a particular item. You can do this manually on the **Bin Contents** page or automatically with the **Create Bin Content Worksheet** page.

## To create bin content manually

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Locations**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the location where you want to set up bin contents,  and then choose the **Bins** action.  
3. Select the bin where you want to set up contents, and then choose the **Contents** action.  
4. For each item that you want to store in the bin, fill in a line on the **Bin Contents** page with the appropriate information. Some of the fields are filled in already with information about the bin.  
5. First fill in the **Item No.** field, and then, if you are using directed put-away and pick, fill in the other fields such as the **Unit of Measure Code**, **Max. Qty.**, and **Min. Qty.** fields.  

Select the **Fixed** field if necessary. If the bin is to be used as the default bin for the item, select the **Default Bin** field.  

If you are using directed put-away and pick, and if you have entered the correct dimensional information on the item card about each item's units of measure, the maximum quantity that you enter on the **Bin Contents** page is verified against the physical capabilities of the bin. The minimum and maximum quantities are used when calculating bin replenishment and suggested put-aways.  

If you select the **Fixed** field, you are fixing the item to the bin, meaning that [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will try to put this item in the bin if there is space for it, and it will preserve the record fixing the item to the bin even when the quantity in the bin is 0. Other items can be put into the bin, even though a particular item has been fixed to the bin.  

> [!NOTE]  
> You can set up several bin contents at the same time on the **Bin Content Creation Worksheet** page.  

## To create bin content with a worksheet

When you have created your bins, you can create the bin content that you want for each bin in the bin content creation worksheet.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Bin Content Creation Worksheet**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the worksheet header, in the **Name** field, select the worksheet of the location where you want to create bin contents.  
3. In the **Bin Code** field, select the code of the bin for which you want to define bin content.  

    If you are using directed put-away and pick in this location, the fields relating to that particular bin, such as **Bin Type**, **Warehouse Class Code**, and **Bin Ranking**, will be filled in automatically. This is information that you need to consider as you define the bin content.  
4. Select the item that you want to assign to the bin, and fill in the fields related to the bin content. If you are using directed put-away and pick, and you want to use the **Calculate Bin Replenishment** function, fill in the **Max. Qty.** and **Min. Qty.** fields.  

    To set this bin as the preferred bin for the item even if the bin quantity is **0** and all other put-away criteria equal, select the **Fixed** field.  
5. Repeat steps 3 through 4 for each item you want to assign to a bin.  
6. Choose the **Print** action to preview and print the bin content you have entered in the worksheet. Continue to revise the bin content until you are satisfied.  
7. When you are ready, choose the **Create Bin Content** action.  

In this worksheet, you can work with a number of bin content lines for a number of bins and thereby obtain a good overview of what you are putting into various bins in a given zone, aisle, or rack.

# Acquire fixed assets

Use the **Fixed Asset Card** page to enter information about an asset. You can set up buildings or production equipment as a main asset with a component list, and you can group them in various ways, such as by class, department, or location. You must set up and assign a depreciation book to each fixed asset before you can acquire it.

After you set up a fixed asset and assign a depreciation book, you must acquire the fixed asset. To acquire a fixed asset, you record its acquisition cost in the relevant G/L account, bank account, or vendor by posting an acquisition transaction from the **Fixed Asset G/L Journal** page. You can use the **Assisted Fixed Asset Acquisition** page to create and post the required general journal lines automatically.

Use indexation to adjust values for general price-level changes. Use the **Index Fixed Assets** batch job to calculate the acquisition costs and replacement costs.

## Add a fixed asset to your list of fixed assets

Before you can acquire a fixed asset, you must add it to your list of assets. There are several ways to add fixed assets to your list:

* Enter information about the assets on the **Fixed Asset Card** page.
* Use the **Edit in Excel** action to download your list of assets to a worksheet, add new assets to the list, and then publish the update to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].
* Use a purchase order to add assets.
* Use the **Copy fixed asset** action.

After you add fixed assets to your list, the next step is to acquire them so you can use them in transactions. Learn more at [Acquire a fixed asset](#acquire-fixed-assets).

### Add a fixed asset on the Fixed Asset Card page

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Fixed Assets**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action, and then fill in the fields on the **General** FastTab as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
3. On the **Depreciation Book** FastTab, fill in the fields as necessary. This step assigns a depreciation book to the fixed asset.  
4. If you need to assign more than one depreciation book to the fixed asset, choose the **Add More Depreciation Books** action. To learn more, go to [To assign a depreciation book to a fixed asset](fa-how-setup-depreciation.md#to-assign-a-depreciation-book-to-a-fixed-asset).

    After you fill in the required fields, the **You are ready to acquire the fixed asset.** notification appears at the top of the page. If you're ready to acquire the asset now, choose the **Acquire** action. Follow the steps on the **Assisted Fixed Asset Acquisition** page to complete the acquisition. If you aren't ready, you can always acquire the asset later.

### Use Edit in Excel to add assets

If you want to add numerous fixed assets, Edit in Excel is a great tool to use. The tool downloads your current list of assets in a worksheet that includes most of the fields available on the Fixed Asset Card page. You can fill in some or all of fields on a row for each asset, and publish your changes to add them to your list in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. If you can't fill in all required field, that's ok. You can update them in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] when you're ready.

> [!NOTE]
> To use the Edit in Excel action, you must have the Microsoft Dynamics Office Add-in installed. The add-in creates the connection between Excel and [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. To learn more, go to [Get the Business Central Add-in for Excel](admin-deploy-excel-addin.md).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Fixed Assets**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the :::image type="content" source="media/share-icon.png" alt-text="Share this page with other users or apps icon."::: icon, and then choose **Edit in Excel**.
3. Open the downloaded file, and enter information about the new fixed assets.

   > [!TIP]
   > You don't need to enter an identifier in the **No.** column. When you publish your update, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] assigns an identifier based on the number series you use for fixed assets.

4. To update [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], on the **Microsoft Dynamics** pane, choose **Publish**.

### Add a fixed asset from a purchase order or invoice

The following steps describe how to add a fixed asset from a purchase order. The steps are similar for a purchase invoice.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Orders**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose **New** to create a new purchase order.
3. On the **General** FastTab, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](../archive/SetupAndAdministration/includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
4. On the **Lines** FastTab, in the **Type** field, choose **Fixed Asset**.
5. In the **No.** field, either choose an existing fixed asset to add an expense, or choose **New** to add a new asset.
6. After you enter the information for the new asset and the purchase order, choose **Post**.

## Acquire a fixed asset by using a fixed asset G/L journal

The following procedure describes how to acquire by creating and posting the required fixed asset G/L journal lines. You can also create and post the journal lines manually. To learn more, go to [Acquire a fixed asset by using a fixed asset G/L journal](#acquire-a-fixed-asset-by-using-a-fixed-asset-gl-journal).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Fixed Assets**, and then choose the related link.
1. Choose the asset you want to acquire, and then choose the **Acquire** action.
1. Follow the steps on the **Assisted Fixed Asset Acquisition** page to complete the acquisition.

> [!NOTE]  
> You can also post acquisition cost as credits. In that case, remember that the value in the **Acquisition Cost Incl. VAT** field must be with a minus sign to indicate a credit.

When you choose **Finish**, the **Book Value** field on the **Fixed Asset Card** page is filled in, which indicates that the fixed asset was acquired at the specified acquisition cost.  

## To post a fixed asset acquisition manually with a fixed asset G/L journal

The following procedure describes how to acquire a fixed asset manually by creating and posting lines on the **Fixed Asset G/L Journal** page. You can also acquire a fixed asset automatically on the **Fixed Asset Card** page by choosing the **Acquire fixed asset** action. To learn more, go to [Acquire a fixed asset](#acquire-fixed-assets).

> [!NOTE]  
> You can also post acquisition cost as credits. In that case, remember that the value in the **Amount** field must be with a minus sign to indicate a credit.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Fixed Asset G/L Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Fixed Asset G/L Journal** page, in the **FA Posting Type** field, select **Acquisition Cost**.
3. Fill in the remaining fields as necessary.
4. Choose the **Post** action.  

> [!TIP]  
> If you fill in the **Insurance No.** field, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] also posts the acquisition cost of the fixed asset to the insurance coverage ledger. To learn more, go to [Insure Fixed Assets](fa-how-insure.md).

## To set up a component list for a main asset

You can group your fixed assets into main assets and their components. For example, you might have a production machine that consists of several parts that you want to group in this manner.  

You must set up the main asset and all its components as individual fixed asset. After you set up a component list, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically fills in the **Main Assets/Component** and **Components of Main Asset** fields on the fixed assets.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Fixed Assets**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the fixed asset that is the main asset, and then choose the **Main Asset Components** action.
3. On the **Main Asset Components** page, choose the **FA No**. field, and then select the fixed asset that you want to add as a component of the main asset.
4. Close the page.
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 for each component asset that you want to add.
6. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Fixed Asset Setup**, and then choose the related link.
7. Turn on the **Allow Posting to Main Assets** toggle.

## To cancel an acquisition cost posting for one fixed asset

If you make an error when posting an acquisition cost, you can remove the entry with the **Cancel FA Entries** batch job and then post the correct acquisition entry. The erroneous entries are transferred to the **FA Error Ledger Entries** page.

For example, if you post an acquisition with the wrong date, you must correct it as soon as possible because the fixed asset posting date is used for many calculations.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> You can't use the **Reverse Transactions** action for fixed asset entries.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **FA Ledger Entries**, and then choose the related link.  
2. In the **FA Ledger Entries** page, select the entry or entries that you want to cancel.  
3. Choose the **Actions** menu, and then choose the **Cancel Entries** action.
4. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
5. Choose the **OK** button to run the batch job.
6. When the incorrect entry or entries are canceled, proceed to post the correct acquisition cost.

## To post the salvage value together with the acquisition cost

The salvage value is the residual value of a fixed asset when it can no longer be used. You can post the salvage value at the same time as you post the acquisition cost. To learn more, go to [Depreciate or Amortize Fixed Assets](fa-how-depreciate-amortize.md).

You can post the salvage value together with the acquisition cost from a fixed asset journal.

> [!NOTE]
> This process might require that you personalize the Fixed Asset Journals page by adding the Salvage Value field. By default, the field is not displayed on the page. To learn more, go to [Personalize Your Workspace](ui-personalization-user.md).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Fixed Asset Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Fixed Asset Journals** page, create the acquisition line. To learn more, go to [To post a fixed asset acquisition manually with a fixed asset G/L journal](#to-post-a-fixed-asset-acquisition-manually-with-a-fixed-asset-gl-journal).
3. In the **Salvage Value** field on the journal line, enter the salvage value amount as a credit (prefix the amount with a minus sign, for example, **-**100).
4. Choose the **Post** action.

> [!NOTE]
> If a salvage value exists for a fixed asset, that value is used in depreciation posting instead of the value in the **Ending Book Value** field on the **FA Depreciation Books** page. To learn more, go to [To manage the ending book value](fa-how-depreciate-amortize.md#to-manage-the-ending-book-value).

# Sustainability Power BI app

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2025w2](includes/2025_releasewave1.md)]

The Sustainability Power BI app provides detailed insight into the emission usage of an organization to support Environment Social Governance (ESG) reporting. The report helps identify key areas to change. The app provides various reports that focus on areas that organizations want to track, such as [Water and Waste Analysis](sustainability-powerbi-water-and-waste-analysis.md), [Journey to Net Zero Carbon](sustainability-powerbi-journey-to-net-zero-carbon.md) and [Social Analysis](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com?page=37091).

## Sustainability analytics

To fit into this category, you might have a role such as:

- Sustainability Manager
- Data Analyst

### Example scenario: The sustainability team needs to review their water and waste usage over a period

As someone on the Sustainability team, you want to consistently review your water and waste usage at specific facilities. Using the [Water and Waste Analysis](sustainability-powerbi-water-and-waste-analysis.md) report, you can review the capacity at each facility and location to understand the available capacity, should you need it in the future.

:::image type="content" source="media\sustainability\water-waste-by-loc-fac.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Water and Waste Analysis Snippet Power BI" lightbox="media\sustainability\water-waste-by-loc-fac.png":::

The report also allows the team to track different water and waste types along with the YOY and DOD change to ensure they're moving in the right direction.

## Sustainability analytics for the Executive team

To fit into this category, you might have a role such as:

- CEO
- Chief Operating Officer
- Chief Sustainability Officer

### Example scenario: Ensure targets are being met

For someone on the executive team, you need to ensure targets you put in place for the organization are being met. The [Realized Emissions vs. Target](sustainability-powerbi-realized-emissions-vs-target.md) report can quickly and efficiently compare your actual emissions with your target and make informed decisions about where to make changes.

:::image type="content" source="media\sustainability\co2e-comparision.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Realized Emissions vs Target Snippet Power BI" lightbox="media\sustainability\co2e-comparision.png":::

You can compare the data in this report with the [Journey to Net Zero Carbon](sustainability-powerbi-journey-to-net-zero-carbon.md) report to ensure your organization is on the right track.

:::image type="content" source="media\sustainability\journey-to-net-zero-snip.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Journey To Net Zero Carbon Snippet Power BI" lightbox="media\sustainability\journey-to-net-zero-snip.png":::

For an executive looking for a quick, high-level view for their organization, you can use the [Sustainability Overview](sustainability-powerbi-sustainability-overview.md) report.

## Alternative use cases

While the reports benefit these examples, in some scenarios other roles can also use this report pack. For example, a Procurement Manager might use the [Emissions by Category and Scope](sustainability-powerbi-emissions-by-category-and-scope.md) report to review Scope 3 so they can identify better vendors. Or, a member of the Human Resources team can use the [Social Analysis](sustainability-powerbi-social-analysis.md) report to get a view of employee activities.

# Report VAT to tax authorities

This article describes the reports in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] that you can use to submit information about value-added tax (VAT) amounts for sales and purchases to tax authorities in your region. Depending on the specific country/region, the reports might include specific information, or there might be additional reports that you must submit. Check the articles for your country/region in the [Local Functionality](about-localization.md) section.  

You can use the following built-in reports:

* The **EC Sales List** report  

    The European Community (EC) Sales List report lists the value added tax (VAT) amounts that you have collected for sales to VAT-registered customers in the European Union (EU) countries/regioins.  
* The **VAT Return** report  

    The VAT Return report includes VAT for sales and purchases to customers and from vendors in all countries/regions that use VAT.  

In both cases (as in other VAT-related reports), VAT is calculated based on the VAT posting setup and the VAT posting groups that you have set up. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] shows VAT entries always based on their **VAT Date** as a primary reporting date.  

> [!NOTE]
> All VAT related reports now run using the **VAT Date** to filter relevant records. Even if you set up **VAT Date Usage** as **Do not use VAT Date functionallity** [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will hide all instances of the **VAT Date** across the application. However, the **VAT Date** is still used in all reportings and is auto-populated with the **Posting Date**.

If you want to view a complete history of VAT entries, every posting that involves VAT creates an entry on the **VAT Entries** page. These entries are used to calculate your VAT settlement amount, such as your payment and refund, for a specific period. To view VAT entries, choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Entries**, and then choose the related link.

> [!NOTE]
> Each [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] environment is meant to handle regulatory reporting in one single country/region. For example, the Dutch version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] handles VAT reporting in The Netherlands but not in other countries/regions. Similarly, the United States version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] handles 1099 reporting in the United States and does not support claiming VAT reporting in other countries/regions, unless brought by an extension delivered by our partner ecosystem or a customer-specific code modification.

## <a name="ecsaleslist"></a>About the EC Sales List report

In the European Union (EU) and in the UK, all companies that sell goods and services to VAT-registered customers, including customers in other European Union (EU) countries/regions, must submit an electronic version of the European Community (EC) Sales List report to their customs and tax authorities. The **EC Sales List** report works only for countries/regions in the EU.

The report includes one line for each type of transaction with the customer, and displays the total amount for each type of transactions. There are three types of transactions that the report can include:  

* B2B Goods  
* B2B Services  
* B2B Triangulated Goods  

*B2B* goods and services specify whether you sold a good or a service, and are controlled by the **EU Service** setting in the VAT posting setup. *B2B Triangulated Goods* indicate whether you engaged in trade with a 3rd party, and are controlled by the **EU 3-Party Trade** setting on sales documents, such as sales orders, invoices, credit memos, and so on.  

After the tax authority reviews your report, they'll send an email to the contact person for your company. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the contact person is specified on the **Company Information** page. Before you submit the report, make sure that a contact person is chosen.  

### Submit an EC sales list report

[!INCLUDE [finance-ecsaleslist](includes/finance-ecsaleslist.md)]

## <a name="vatreturn"></a>About the VAT Return report

Use this report to submit VAT for sales and purchase documents, such as purchase and sales orders, invoices, and credit memos. The information in the report is in the same format as on the declaration form from the customs and tax authorities.  

For the VAT return, you can specify the entries to include:

* Submit open transactions only, or open and closed. For example, this is useful when you prepare your final annual VAT return.
* Submit only entries from the specified periods, or also include entries from previous periods. This is useful for updating a VAT return that you have already submitted, for example, if a vendor sends you a late invoice.    

## To connect to your tax authority's web service
[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides service connections to tax authority websites. For example, if you are in the UK, you can enable the **GovTalk** service connection to submit the EC Sales List and VAT Return reports electronically. If you want to submit the report manually, for example by entering your data on the tax authority's website, this isn't required.   

To report VAT to a tax authority electronically, you need to connect [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to the tax authority's web service. This requires that you set up an account with your tax authority. When you have an account, you can enable a service connection that we provide in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 2.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Connections**, and then choose appropriate link.
2. Fill in the required fields. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > It is a good idea to test your connection. To do this, choose the **Test Mode** check box, then prepare and submit your VAT report as described in the [To prepare and submit a VAT report](#to-prepare-and-submit-a-vat-report) section. While in Test Mode, the service tests whether the tax authority can receive your report, and the status of the report will indicate whether the test submission was successful. It is important to remember that this is not an actual submission. To submit the report for real, you must clear the **Test Mode** check box, and then repeat the submission process.

## To set up VAT reports in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]

[!INCLUDE [vat-report-setup](includes/vat-report-setup.md)]

### To set up VAT return periods

Optionally, if your business isn't located in the UK, use the **VAT Returns Periods** page to set up scheduled VAT returns. If your business is located in the UK, see [Making Tax Digital in the United Kingdom](LocalFunctionality/UnitedKingdom/making-tax-digital-submit-vat-return.md).  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Return Periods**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **VAT Return Periods** page, fill in the fields to set up the first period. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)].  
3. Repeat step 2 for any additional periods that you want to add.  

Now, when the time has come to submit a VAT report for a VAT return period, choose the period in  the **VAT Return Periods** page, and then choose the **Create VAR Return** action. Then, in the **VAT Return** card, choose the **Suggest Lines** action as described in step 3 in the following procedure.  

## To prepare and submit a VAT report

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 3.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **EC Sales List** or **VAT Returns**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose **New**, and then fill in the required fields. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
3. To generate the content of the report, choose the **Suggest Lines** action.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  For the EC Sales List report, you can review the transactions included in the report lines before you submit the report. To do that, choose the line, and then choose the **Show VAT Entries** action.  

4. To validate and prepare the report for submission, choose the **Release** action.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] validates whether the report is set up correctly. If the validation fails, the errors display under **Errors and Warnings** so that you know what to fix. Typically, if the message is about a missing setting in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can click the message to open the page that contains the information to correct.  
5. To submit the report, choose the **Submit** action.  

After you submit the report, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] monitors the service and keeps a record of your communications. The **Status** field indicates where the report is in the process. For example, when the authorities process your report, the status of the report changes to **Succeeded**. If the tax authority found mistakes in the report you submitted, the status of the report will be **Failed**. You can view the errors under **Errors and Warnings**, correct them, and then submit the report again. To view a list of all your EC Sales List reports, go to the **EC Sales List Reports** page.  

### VAT return statuses

VAT returns can have different statuses, as described in the following table.

| Status | Description |
|------------|-------------------------|
| Open | When you create a new VAT return. You can run the **Suggest Lines** action. If you need to correct values, you can run the **Suggest Lines** action again. You can't submit a VAT return that has this status. |
| Released | Status will be changed when you use the **Release** action. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will show the **Errors and Warnings** FastTab. You can't make changes or use the **Suggest Lines** action. To make changes, you must reopen the VAT return. |
| Rejected | If your submission wasn't successful (for example, if authentication failed), the status will change to **Rejected**. You can't reopen a VAT Return that has this status. |
| Submitted | The VAT return is submitted using the **Submit** action, or it's marked as submitted by using the **Mark as Submitted** action. |
| Accepted | The VAT return has this status if the report is marked as accepted by using the **Mark as Accepted** action. If the **VAT Return** report is marked as **Accepted**, you can run the **Calculate and Post VAT Settlement** action. |

## Viewing communications with your tax authority

In some countries/regions, you exchange messages with the tax authority when you submit reports. You can view the first and the last message you sent or received by choosing the **Download Submission Message** and **Download Response Message** actions.  

## Submitting VAT reports manually
If you use another method to submit the report, for example by exporting the XML and uploading it to a tax authority website, afterward you can choose **Mark as Submitted** to close the reporting period. When you mark the report as released, it becomes non-editable. If you must change the report after you mark it as released, you must reopen it.

## VAT settlement
Periodically, you must remit the net VAT to the tax authorities. If you need to settle VAT frequently, you can run the **Calc. and Post VAT Settlement** batch job to close the open VAT entries and transfer purchase and sales VAT amounts to the VAT settlement account.

When you transfer VAT amounts to the settlement account, the purchase VAT account is credited, and the sales VAT account is debited with the amounts calculated for the specified period. The net amount is credited or debited, if the purchase VAT amount is larger, to the VAT settlement account. You can post the settlement immediately or print a test report first.  

> [!Note]
> When you use the **Calc. and Post VAT Settlement** batch job, if you do not specify a **VAT Bus. Posting Group** and a **VAT Prod. Posting group**, entries with all business posting groups and product posting group codes are included.

## Configuring your own VAT reports

You can use the **EC Sales List** report out-of-the-box. However, you can also create your own reports, if you have a development license so that you can create codeunits. If you need assistance, contact a Microsoft Partner.  

The following table describes the codeunits that you must create for your report.  

| Codeunit | What it must do |
|----|-----|
|Suggest Lines| Fetch information from the **VAT Entries** table, and display it in lines on the VAT report.|
|Content | Control the format of the report. For example, whether it's XML or JSON. The format to use depends on the requirements of your tax authority's web service. |
|Submission | Control how, and when, you submit the report based on the requirements of your tax authority. |
|Response Handler | Handle the return from the tax authority. For example, it might send an email message to your company's contact person. |
|Cancel | Send a cancellation of a VAT report that was submitted earlier to your tax authority. |  

> [!Note]
> When you create codeunits for the report, pay attention to the value in the **VAT Report Version** field. This field must reflect the version of the report that is, or was, required by the tax authority. For example, you might enter **2021** in the field to indicate that the report conforms to the requirements that were in place that year. To find the current version, contact your tax authority.

# Record interactions with contacts

Recording interactions with business contacts consists of these tasks:

* Setting up interaction templates  
* Creating interactions on contacts or segments  
* View and manage recorded interactions  

## Set up interaction templates

Before you can record interactions, you must set up interaction templates. An interaction template is a model that defines the basic characteristics of an interaction. When you record an interaction, you specify the interaction templates it's based on. Settings such as the mode of communication that was used, who initiated the interaction, and its cost, transfer to the interaction.

You set up an interaction template on the **Interaction Templates** page.

When you set up an interaction template, you can add an attachment. For example, you might attach a Microsoft Word document that contains notes from a meeting. To learn more about attachments, go to [Attachments for interactions](marketing-interaction-attachments.md). Repeat the steps to set up as many interaction templates as you want.  

## Create interactions

There are two ways to record interactions:

* You can manually create interactions that are linked to a single contact or to a segment. For more information, see [Create Interactions on Contacts and Segments](marketing-how-create-interactions.md).  
* You can automatically record interactions when you perform actions in the application—for example, when you print an invoice or quote. For more information, see [Automatically Record Interactions with Contacts](marketing-auto-record-interactions.md).

## View and manage recorded interactions

You can view all the recorded interactions that have not been deleted on the **Interaction Log Entries** page. You can open this page by:

* Using the **Search for Page or Report** icon to search on **Interaction Log Entries**.
* Choosing the **Interaction Log Entries** action on a contact or segment.

  The **Interaction Log Entry** page contains the interactions you create manually and the interactions that [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] records automatically.

Use the Interaction Log Entries page to view the status of interactions and cancel interactions.

You can delete interaction log entries that have been canceled. To delete interaction log entries, choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Delete Canceled Interaction Log Entries**, choose the related link, and then fill in the information.

# Process partial shipments

In a partial shipment, an order isn't all shipped at once. For example, from an order for 100 units, you ship 40 units immediately and 60 units later. There are no limits on the number of shipments that can be made for an order.

However, before you can use partial shipments in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you must specify that the customer accepts partial shipments by setting the **Shipping Advice** field on the **Customer Card** page. Alternatively, if the customer only accepts complete shipments but then requests or agrees with a partial shipment for a specific sales order, you can change the **Shipping Advice** field before posting.

By default, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] sets the field in the **Customer Card** page as **Partial**, which allows partial shipments. However, if the field is set to specify **Complete**, the **Qty. to Ship** field appears blocked in sales orders for that customer.

# Manage fixed assets

The fixed assets functionality in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides an overview of your fixed assets and helps ensure that their depreciation is correct. It also helps you track maintenance costs, manage insurance policies, post fixed asset transactions, and generate various reports and statistics.

## What is a fixed asset?

Fixed assets differ from other items in your warehouse. A fixed asset, also known as a capital asset, is a tangible piece of property, plant, or equipment (PP&E) that you own or manage with the expectation that it will continue to help generate income. An asset is fixed when it’s an item that your business won’t consume, sell, or convert to cash within the next calendar year. Fixed assets are different than current assets, which are in cash or slated to be converted to cash within the next 12 months. Fixed assets also differ from your inventory, because inventory is typically consumed within a short time.

## Types of fixed assets

Businesses typically invest in a few types of fixed assets. Some examples are:

- Buildings and facilities
- Computer equipment and software
- Furniture and fixtures
- Machinery
- Vehicles

## Understanding fixed asset accounting

Fixed asset accounting means keeping precise financial records about your capital assets. These records include details about the five stages in an asset's lifecycle. After your initial purchase, each fixed asset’s lifecycle includes at least three of the following stages:

- Acquisition: You add a new fixed asset to your books.
- Depreciation: You record an asset's periodic decline in value, which you use a depreciation method to calculate. To learn more, go to [FA Depreciation Calculation](LocalFunctionality/India/FA_Depreciation.md).
- Revaluation: You record an assessment of the current fair market value of an asset. To learn more, go to [Revalue Fixed Assets](fa-how-revalue.md).
- Impairment: You record a reduction in value due to events or circumstances.
- Disposal: You sell, scrap, or use another way dispose of an asset at the end of its service life.

Audits are also included in the detailed checks of your company’s accounting records after closing the books for the financial year. Whether internal or external, audits are where you might notice inconsistencies or differences between your notes and the actual state of your assets. Audits promote transparency in your assets and accounting if you’re losing more money than anticipated.

## Video overview

The following video covers the basics of fixed assets:

> [!Video https://learn-video.azurefd.net/vod/player?id=32fa27be-9e9a-4637-bc9b-87eb994f5ae0]

## Initial setup of fixed assets

Before you can manage fixed assets, you must complete the following setups:

- Default values
- Fixed asset accounting
- Posting groups and types
- Allocation keys
- Fixed asset journals

To learn more, go to [Setting Up Fixed Assets](fa-setup.md).

| View projected disposal values. | [View projected disposal values](fa-how-manage-budgets.md#to-view-projected-disposal-values) |

## Register fixed assets

For each fixed asset, you must set up a card that contains information about them. For example, you can set up buildings or production equipment as main assets with a component list. You can group assets in various ways, such as by class, department, or location. Then you can acquire, maintain, and sell the fixed assets. You can also set up budgeted assets. Budgeting lets you include any anticipated acquisitions and sales in reports.

| Create fixed assets, assign depreciation methods, post acquisitions, salvage values, and print fixed asset lists. |[Acquire Fixed Assets](fa-how-acquire.md) |

## Set up depreciations for your fixed assets

To track fixed asset depreciations and other financial transactions for fixed assets, set up one or more depreciation books for each one. There are a few steps to depreciate assets:

1. Run a report that calculates periodic depreciation.
1. Fill in a journal with the resulting entries.
1. Post the journal.

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports several depreciation methods. To learn more, go to [Depreciation Methods](fa-depreciation-methods.md). You can set up multiple depreciation books for each fixed asset for different purposes, such as one for tax reporting and another for internal reporting.

| Manually record fixed asset transactions on the **Fixed Asset G/L Journal** page or on the **Fixed Asset Journal** page, depending on whether the transactions are for financial reporting or for internal management. | [Set Up Fixed Asset Depreciation](fa-how-setup-depreciation.md) |

## Fixed assets maintenance and insurance

You can record maintenance costs and the next service date for each asset. Tracking maintenance expenses can be important for budgeting purposes and deciding whether to replace a fixed asset. You can attach each fixed asset to one or more insurance policies, and verify that policy premiums align with the value of the assets.

## Tips for improving your fixed asset accounting

There are a few things you can implement in your accounting strategy for fixed assets that can help ensure you’re maximizing your earnings.

- Establish a threshold for capitalization. When you purchase an item, determine a fixed amount for capitalization. The amount helps ensure your accounting books are consistent, and makes it easier for you and your team to spot accounting errors.
- Reevaluate equipment lifecycle. It's important to correctly estimate the length of time you can use your fixed assets for their original purpose. Because accounting and depreciation rely on accurate lifecycle estimates, reevaluate when necessary because it might change over time.
- Tag your assets. It’s essential to track and tag your assets throughout their lifecycle because many factors can affect their value. Tagging helps track your items throughout the stages of their lifecycle, and help prevent theft, eliminate misplacement, and support financial statistics.
- Automate insight with fixed asset accounting software. Automating manual activities to track your data with fixed asset accounting software make processes easier to complete. Password protection can help provide access only to the people who need it and are trained for it.

# Schedule jobs to adjust and reconcile inventory cost

Schedule Jobs for automatic cost adjustment with the general ledger, posting to the general ledger are turned on by default.
However, as data accumulates over time that might impact performance. To reduce the load on the application, it's often helpful to use job queue entries to move tasks to run in the background.

## Move the task of adjusting item costs to the background with the help of assisted setup

Creating the job queue entries can be tricky, even for an experienced consultant, so we have an assisted setup guide to make the process easier for adjusting item costs.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Inventory Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Inventory Setup** page, toggle the **Automatic Cost Posting** field, or specify **Never** in the **Automatic Cost Adjustment** field.  
3. In the notification that now displays at the top of the page, choose the **Schedule Job Queue Entry** link. This opens the **Schedule Cost Adjustment and Posting** assisted setup guide.  
4. Specify the task that you want to schedule.  

  > [!NOTE]
  > You cannot create a new job queue entry if a job queue entry for the specified task already exists.

5. Select the **View job queue entries when finished** field to review and adjust settings. For more information, see [Use Job Queues to Schedule Tasks](admin-job-queues-schedule-tasks.md).  

## To create a job queue entry for adjusting and reconciling inventory cost manually

Alternatively, you can create job queue entries manually. The following procedure shows how to set the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job to automatically run daily, but the same steps apply to the **Post Inventory Cost to G/L** batch job.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Job Queue Entries**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. In the **Object Type to Run** field, choose *Report*.  
4. In the **Object ID to Run** field, choose *795*, **Adjust Cost - Item Entries**.  
5. In the **Next Run Date Formula** field, enter *1D*.
6. In the **Starting Time** field, enter *2 AM*.
7. Choose the **Set Status to Ready** action.

Now, inventory cost will be updated every night.  

To schedule a task for reconciling inventory with the general ledger, choose Codeunit 2846 **Post Inventory Cost to G/L**.

> [!TIP]
> To avoid locking, do not schedule tasks for the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job, the **Post Inventory Cost to G/L** codeunit, and tasks for posting sales or purchasing transactions at the same time. Also, make sure that they use same job queue category.

# About planning functionality

The planning system takes all demand and supply data into account, nets the results, and creates suggestions for balancing supply to meet demand. To learn more, go to [Design Details: Supply Planning](design-details-supply-planning.md).  

> [!TIP]  
> To understand the fields that this article mentions, read their tooltip in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

## Supply and demand

Planning has two elements, supply and demand. These must balance to ensure that the demand is met.  

- Demand is any kind of gross requirement, such as a sales order, service order, or a component need for assembly or production orders, outbound transfer, blanket order, or forecast. Additionally, there other technical types of demand, such as a negative production or purchase order, negative inventory, and purchase return.  
- Supply refers to any kind of replenishment such as inventory, a purchase order, assembly order, production order, or inbound transfer. Correspondingly, there can be a negative sales or service order, negative component need or sales return that also represent supply.  

Another goal of the planning system is to ensure that the inventory does not grow unnecessarily. In the case of decreasing demand, the planning system will suggest that you postpone, decrease in quantity, or cancel existing replenishment orders.  

## Planning calculation

The planning system is driven by anticipated and actual customer demand, as well as inventory reordering parameters. Running the planning calculation will result in application suggesting specific actions ([Action Messages](production-how-to-run-mps-and-mrp.md#action-messages)) to take concerning possible replenishment from vendors, transfers between warehouses, or production. If replenishment orders already exist, the suggested actions could be to increase or expedite the orders to meet the changes in demand.  

The basis of the planning routine is in the gross-to-net calculation. Net requirements drive planned order releases, which are scheduled based on the routing information (manufactured items) or the item card lead time (purchased items). Planned order release quantities are based on the planning calculation, and are affected by the parameters set on the individual item cards.  

> [!TIP]
> The planning system relies on how your organization uses locations. To learn more, go to [Planning With or Without Locations](production-planning-with-without-locations.md).

## Planning with manual transfer orders

In the **Replenishment System** field on a SKU card, you can set up the planning system to create transfer orders to balance supply and demand across locations.  

In addition to such automatic transfer orders, you may sometimes need to perform a general move of inventory quantities to another location, irrespective of existing demand. For this purpose you would manually create a transfer order for the quantity to move. To ensure that the planning system does not try to manipulate this manual transfer order, you must set the **Planning Flexibility** on the transfer line(s) to None.  

Contrarily, if you do want the planning system to adjust the transfer order quantities and dates to existing demand, you must set the **Planning Flexibility** field to the default value, Unlimited.

## Planning parameters

The planning parameters control when, how much, and how to replenish based on the various settings on the item card (or stockkeeping unit - SKU), and the manufacturing setup.  

The following planning parameters exist on the item or SKU card:  

- Dampener Period  
- Dampener Quantity  
- Reordering Policy  
- Reorder Point
- Maximum Inventory  
- Overflow Level  
- Time Bucket  
- Lot Accumulation Period  
- Rescheduling Period  
- Reorder Quantity  
- Safety Lead Time  
- Safety Stock Quantity  
- Assembly Policy  
- Manufacturing Policy  

The following order modifiers exist on the item or SKU card:  

- Minimum Order Quantity  
- Maximum Order Quantity  
- Order Multiple  

Global planning setup fields on the **Manufacturing Setup** page include:  

- Dynamic Low-Level Code  
- Current Demand Forecast  
- Use Forecast on Locations  
- Default Safety Lead Time  
- Blank Overflow Level  
- Combined MPS/MRP Calculation
- Components at Location  
- Default Dampener Period  
- Default Dampener Quantity  
- Default General Business Posting Group

To learn more, go to [Design Details: Planning Parameters](design-details-planning-parameters.md)  

## Other important planning fields

### Planning Flexibility

On most supply orders, such as production orders, you can select **Unlimited** or **None** in the **Planning Flexibility** field on the lines.

This specifies whether the supply represented by the production order line is considered by the planning system when calculating action messages.
If the field contains **Unlimited**, then the planning system includes the line when calculating action messages. If the field contains **None**, then the line is firm and unchangeable, and the planning system does not include the line when calculating action messages.

### Warnings

The **Warning** information field on the **Planning Worksheet** page informs you of any planning line created for an unusual situation with a text, which the user can choose to read additional information. The following warning types exist:

- Emergency
- Exception
- Attention

#### Emergency

The emergency warning displays in two situations:

- The inventory is negative on the planning starting date.
- Back-dated supply or demand events exist.

If an item's inventory is negative on the planning starting date, the planning system suggests an emergency supply order for the negative quantity to arrive on the planning starting date. The warning text states the starting date and the quantity of the emergency order.

Any document lines with due dates before the planning starting date are consolidated into one emergency supply order for the item to arrive on the planning starting date.

#### Exception

The exception warning displays if the projected available inventory drops below the safety stock quantity.

The planning system will suggest a supply order to meet the demand on its due date. The warning text states the item's safety stock quantity and the date on which it is violated.

Violating the safety stock level is considered an exception because it shouldn't occur if the reorder point has been set correctly.

> [!NOTE]
> Supply on planning lines with Exception warnings is normally not modified according to planning parameters. Instead, the planning system only suggests a supply to cover the exact demand quantity. However, you can set the planning run up to respect certain planning parameters for planning lines with certain warnings. To learn more, go to the description for the **Respect Planning Parameters for Exception Warnings** field in the [Run Full Planning, MPS or MRP](production-how-to-run-mps-and-mrp.md) article.

#### Attention

The attention warning displays in two situations:

- The planning starting date is earlier than the work date.
- The planning line suggests to change a released purchase or production order.

> [!NOTE]
> In planning lines with warnings, the **Accept Action Message** field is not selected, because the planner is expected to further investigate these lines before carrying out the plan.

## Planning worksheets and requisition worksheets

As described in [Planning](production-planning.md), you can choose between two worksheets for most planning activities, the planning worksheet and the requisition worksheet. Most processes are described based on the planning worksheet, but there are a couple of scenarios where the requisition worksheet is preferred.

[!INCLUDE [edit-in-excel](includes/edit-in-excel.md)]

> [!TIP]
> When you process lines in a planning worksheet, you can print more than one firm planned orders. The **Prod. Order** option in the **Report Selection - Production Order** page determines which report to print. The default report is **99000762 Prod. Order - Job Card**. If your production orders lack routing lines or you prefer a more compact report, consider switching to the **5500 Prod. Order Comp. and Routing** report.

### Requisition worksheet

The **Requisition Worksheet** page lists items that you want to order. You can enter items in the worksheet in the following ways:

- Enter the items manually in the worksheet and fill in the relevant fields.
- Use the **Calculate Plan** batch job. This calculates a replenishment plan for items and stockkeeping units that have been set up with a replenishment system of **Purchase** or **Transfer**. When you use this batch job, the program automatically fills in the **Action Message** field with a suggestion for an action you can take to replenish the item. This could be increasing the item quantity on an existing order or creating a new order, for example.
- If you have used the **Calculate Plan** batch job from the **Planning Worksheet** page to calculate a replenishment plan, you can use the **Carry Out Action Message** batch job to copy purchase and transfer order proposals from the planning worksheet to the requisition worksheet. This is practical if separate users are responsible for handling production orders and purchase/transfer orders.
- You can use the **Drop Shipment** action to fill in the requisition worksheet lines. This action uses the **Get Sales Orders** batch job to determine the sales order lines that you want to designate for a drop shipment.
- You can use the **Special Order** action to fill in the requisition worksheet lines. This action uses the **Get Sales Orders** batch job to determine the sales order lines that you want to designate for a special order.

Requisition worksheet lines contain detailed information about the items that need to be reordered. You can edit and delete the lines to adjust your replenishment plan, and you can further process the lines by using the **Carry Out Action Message** batch job.

To learn more about planning with locations and transfers, go to [Planning With or Without Locations](production-planning-with-without-locations.md).

> [!TIP]
> When you're working on the **Requisition Worksheet** or **Planning Worksheet** pages, you can organize the lines by sorting on a column name. This is especially useful on the Planning Worksheet page because they it can be used for multilevel production orders. By default, lines are sorted by the **Item No.** field. To group lines for a multilevel order, sort by the **Ref. Order No.** field. Also, the **MPS Order** and **Planning Level** fields can help show the hierarchy of the lines.

# Process sales quotes and orders with Sales Order Agent (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]

This article explains how to use Sales Order Agent to automate taking sales orders based on customer inquiries about products/items received via email.

Sales Order Agent monitors a designated mailbox for incoming customer emails about item inquiries. When it identifies a potential request, it starts converting the request into an order. For example, it verifies the customer, checks item availability, creates a sales quote, and prepares an email response to the customer with the quote as a PDF attachment.

Some steps require your intervention, such as reviewing email correspondence and assisting the agent as needed. Until an order is created, the agent handles email exchanges with the customer to resolve any missing details and allow for modifications to the original request if necessary.

Learn more about Sales Order Agent and its process flow in [How the agent processes requests](sales-order-agent.md#how-the-agent-processes-requests).

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/production-ready-preview-dynamics365.md)]
<!--[!INCLUDE [limited-public-preview](includes/limited-public-preview.md)]-->

## Supported languages

[!INCLUDE[soa-language-support](includes/soa-language-support.md)]

## Prerequisites

Sales Order Agent is activated, and you have permission to use it. Learn more in [Set up Sales Order Agent](sales-order-agent-setup.md).

## Get started

You collaborate with Sales Order Agent to review and convert quotes into orders using the **Tasks** tab in the **Copilot** pane.

To access this view, select ![Shows Sales Order Agent icon.](media/soa-activated-number-icon.png) **Sales Order Agent** on the upper right of the navigation menu. A red circle with a number on the icon indicates the tasks that need attention.

![Shows the task view with steps](media/soa-task-view-callouts.png "Shows the task view with steps")

The ![Shows the task view icon](media/sot-task-view-icon.png) **Tasks** tab opens in the **Copilot** pane to display tasks recently created by Sales Order Agent. Tasks that require attention&mdash;like reviewing an incoming or outgoing email&mdash;are at the top of the list.  

For each sales quote request, Sales Order Agent adds a task to track, review, and follow up on updates, eventually processing the quote into an order. Tasks can consist of multiple steps that form a timeline of the process.

> [!TIP]
> Hover over the ![Shows Sales Order Agent icon with an open action.](media/soa-activated-icon.png) **Sales Order Agent** icon in the role or select the ![Show summary for Sales Order Agent icon](media/soa-summary-icon.png) **Show summary for Sales Order Agent** in the **Task** tab to get an overview of the agent's key performance indicators (KPIs) summarizing the impact of the agent's work in your organization. For example, view the number of sales quotes or orders created by the agent, the time saved by your team, and the total number of sales orders created.

## Review and assist

While the agent does the bulk of work autonomously, it asks for user intervention when required for various steps to move through the process, such as:

- Reviewing and confirming incoming email requests from customers.
- Reviewing and confirming the sales quotes and orders if an admin configured Sales Order Agent to do so.
- Reviewing outgoing emails created by Sales Order Agent for the customer.
- Providing assistance to Sales Order Agent when it needs to get unblocked—for example, to provide missing data.

Steps requiring intervention are listed under **Needs Attention** in the **Tasks** tab. To review a step:

1. In the **Task** tab, select the step requesting review or assistance.

   The task *timeline* opens, focused on the selected step. The timeline displays each step of a task, past and present, in chronological order.

1. Select **Review** for the step.

   The **Tasks** tab switches to **Review** mode, and the Agent Task Message window opens to display the email contents or quote or order, depending on the task.

1. Review the email contents or the quote or order and make changes as needed. You can't edit incoming emails from the customer.

1. When you're satisfied with the content and want the process to continue, select **Confirm** in the **Review** pane. If you want to complete the task yourself, select **Stop** to halt the agent's processing of this task.

After confirmation, Sales Order Agent continues processing the task. When a new notification appears on the Sales Order Agent icon after some time, follow the same flow to verify and approve the results.

## Modify sales quotes and orders

You might need to modify sales quotes or orders created by the agent during a review step or when the agent requests assistance, based on its configuration. When you select **Review**, the quote or order opens for inspection. Make changes as needed, then select **Confirm** in the **Review** pane. The agent processes the document, creating a PDF for the outgoing email to the customer.

You also have the opportunity to modify a quote or order during the review step for an outgoing email. In this case, select **...** (More options) > **Discard step** on the step. This action stops the task temporarily to allow you to open the quote or order and makes changes and then resume the step.

![Shows the discard step action on a Sales Order Agent task.](media/soa-discard-step.png "Shows the discard step action on a Sales Order Agent task.")

> [!NOTE]
> **Discard step** is available only on review steps for outgoing emails.

After you make the changes, return to the **Tasks** tab, select one of the following options for resuming the task, and then select **Send**:

- **I have updated the quote** or **I have updated the order**: Select one of these options if you made changes to the quote or order. The agent generates a new PDF and email for the customer.
- **Just resume**: Select this option if you didn't change the quote or order. The agent doesn't generate a new quote or order and keeps the original email as before.  

![Shows the resume step action on a Sales Order Agent task.](media/soa-resume-step.png "Shows the resume step action on a Sales Order Agent task.")

If you change your mind while reviewing the outgoing message and decide to make more changes to the sales document, use the **Discard step** action to discard the email message generated by the agent. Then, update the sales document as needed and instruct the agent to create a new outgoing email with the updated attachment.

## Assist with item availability

Depending on the agent's setup, it can check item availability in the requested quantity before adding them to a quote or order. You can't change the items and quantities at this point, but you can review and confirm the step so the agent creates a reply email to the customer.

<!--
1. Select **Review** to open the **Items availability** page.
1. Use the page to verify that the item isn't available in the requested quantity.
1. Select **Confirm**.

   The agent creates the reply email for review.-->

Learn more in [Item availability in Sales Order Agent (preview)](sales-order-agent-item-availability.md).

## Stop a task

Most steps of a task include a **Stop** button that lets you terminate the process. When you select **Stop**, a task isn't terminated immediately—you're asked to confirm before the task is stopped.

Before you stop a task, consider the following behavior:

- Stopped tasks can't be restarted.
- Stopping the task might leave some results incomplete or unwanted, and it might require follow-up actions with the customers. Follow up actions depend on where in the process the task was stopped.

  For example, suppose you stopped a task after a sales quote was created. Although the process stopped, the sales quote is still stored in the system as open. You might have to manually edit the state depending on your company policy and then update the customer.
- Stopped tasks aren't deleted immediately. You can still explore a task's timeline until it's deleted, typically by an administrator.

<!--
## Discard and resume a task to modify a quote or order

## View timeline and details of steps

From the ![Shows the task view icon](media/sot-task-view-icon.png) **Tasks** view, you can view the details of each step of a task in chronological order. Click on the task or select **...** (More options) > **Show Details**.-->

## Scenarios impacting reliability in handling customer requests

- You might need to correct the quantities in the created document when non-base units of measurement differ from the standard ones.  

  For example, if the system treats 1 kilogram as 900 grams and a customer requests 2 kilograms, the system might generate a document showing 2,000 grams instead of 1,800 grams or 2 kilograms.

- Reliability decreases if you significantly change the email the agent drafts about item availability before sending it to the customer.

  This issue is more apparent when the external customer follows up with an email using pronouns like "them" or "it" and other words instead of repeating specific quantities and names. For example, the customer replies, "I want them all."

- The agent searches for items using item attributes, but the attributes aren't shown to the agent on the item availability page. This condition decreases reliability for customer requests that depend specifically on the attributes.

  Consider the following example:

  1. Items in the database:
  
     `[{no: ITEM-1, description: Shirt, attributes: Linen}, {no: ITEM-2, description: Shirt, attributes: Cotton}]`

  2. Customer's initial request email:

     `I want a quote for nice shirts`

  3. Agent's reply email:
  
     `We have X quantity of ITEM-1 Shirt and ITEM-2 Shirt`

  4. Customer's response email:
  
     `I want the ones with linen material`

# Convert service contracts that include VAT amounts

Because the VAT rate change tool can't convert service contracts, these contracts must be converted manually. This article describes several alternative methods that you can use for service contract conversion.  

> [!NOTE]  
> This article provides a high-level workflow.  

 The following procedure describes how to correct an invoice for a prepaid service contract that has been created a year in advance.  

> [!NOTE]  
> For this example, you must change your work date to 01.01.2017.  

## To correct an invoice for a prepaid service contract  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Contract Management**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Under **Lists**, choose **Service Contracts**.  
3. Create a new prepaid service contract. Enter a start date of **01.01.2017** and an invoice period year for customer **20000**.  
4. To sign the contract, choose the **Sign Contract** action.  
5. Create a service invoice.
6. The invoice is listed as an unposted service invoice. To view the service invoice, choose the **Service** action, choose the **Contract Management** action, and then choose the **Service Invoices** action.  
7. Post the service invoice.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Don't change the unposted service invoice. Since the service ledger entries are created when the invoice is created, a change in the unposted invoice will not change the already created service ledger entries. However, the VAT entries are created when the invoice is posted. This lets you change the general product posting group and the GSP product posting group on the unposted service invoice.  

### To create a credit memo for VAT difference 
 
The following procedure describes how to create a credit memo that only includes the VAT difference for the already invoiced period starting on **01.07.2017**. In this example, the VAT amount is only posted to the Financial Management module, not to the Service Management module. The VAT entries that are linked to the service ledger entry won't be corrected.  

1. Create a new general ledger account for the VAT difference. This account is used for direct posting of the VAT correction.  
2. Add a new line to the VAT posting setup.  

## To create contract expiration dates in contract lines  

The following procedure describes how to create new contracts by working with contract expiration dates in service contract lines.  

1. On the **Service Contract** page, set the contract expiration date to **30.06.2017**.  
2. Choose the **Create Credit Memo** action to automatically create a credit memo for July 2017 to December 2017.  
3. Because the contract has expired, you need to create a new contract for the period with the new VAT rate for July 1, 2017 to December 31, 2017.  

### To create a new credit memo  

The following procedure describes how to create a new credit memo using the **Get Prepaid Contract Entries** batch job. Entries that you don't want to correct from January 2017 to June 2017 will be deleted.  

1. Run the VAT rate change tool on July 1, 2017. The general product posting group or the VAT product posting group is changed. For more information, see [Work with VAT on Sales and Purchases](finance-work-with-vat.md).  
2. After running the VAT rate change tool, enter a contract expiration date for the service contract. You can now delete the service contract line and create a new line that is identical to the old one.  
3. Create a new invoice for the period of January 2017 to December 2012 using the new VAT rate.  
4. To create another credit memo, on the **Service Credit Memos** page, choose the **New** action to create a new service credit memo.  
5. Choose the **Get Prepaid Contract Entries** action.  
6. After the conversion is complete, VAT and service ledger entries will be correct.

# Define user tasks

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can create tasks to remind you of work to be done. You can create tasks for yourself, but you can also assign tasks to others or be assigned a task by someone else in your organization.  

Some usage scenarios for User Tasks are 

| If you work with... | Set up user tasks to track or follow-up on... |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Finance             | Month-end checklist activities, such as:<br><br>* Adjust cost<br>* Set a posting date range<br>* Close an inventory period<br>* Reconcile accounts payable (AP)<br>* Reconcile accounts receivable (AR)<br>* Recurring journals<br>* Bank reconciliation |
| Finance             | Year-close checklist activities, such as:<br><br>* Financial reporting (prepare and finalize annual financial statements)<br>* Audit preparation (gather necessary documents and information for external auditors)<br>* Budget review (compare actual performance against budget and analyze variances)<br>* Budget planning (develop the budget for the next fiscal year)<br>* Accounts receivable (follow up on outstanding invoices for the fiscal year and write off bad debts if necessary)<br>* Accounts payable (ensure all bills and expenses for the fiscal year are recorded and paid)<br>* Check whether fixed assets depreciations for the fiscal year are posted |

The list of sample user tasks for sales in the table was generated by AI using Microsoft Copilot. If you want to generate similar lists for your work domain, consider copying and modifying the following prompt:

```Copilot prompt
Come up with a list of common tasks for people working in a sales team that would be useful to track in a system. 

Format the list in bullet form
```

## Managing user task groups

You can use **User Task Groups** to group related tasks and assign them to a group of users instead of individual users. For example, you could create a group for "Month-end" activities and then assign membership to users in the accounting department. This way, anyone in the team can pick up tasks.

## Managing user tasks

The **User Tasks** page shows all tasks, and you can easily create and assign new tasks. When you create a task, you can specify the start date and due date, and you can add a link to the page or report in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] where the user must do the work.  

For example, you can create a task for yourself or a coworker to view all posted sales invoices. In that case, you link the task to page 143, **Posted Sales Invoices**. In the following screenshot, someone is creating a task for MeganB to review the posted sales invoices.  

:::image type="content" source="media/across-user-tasks/sample-user-task.png" alt-text="Example of a user task.":::

> [!TIP]  
> Use the look-up in the **Page** field and then use the **Search** field to find the page that you want.  
>
> You can link to any page, but you can't link to individual entries, so make the description as explicit as possible. For example, write "Please take a look at customer no. 10000 and make sure they don't have overdue payments.".

### Picking up user tasks

In the Business Manager, Bookkeeper, and Accountant Role Centers, a tile shows pending tasks that are assigned to that user. To pick up a task, choose it from the list of pending user tasks. In the ribbon, the link **Go to Task Item** opens the page where you can do the work.  

After you complete a task, mark it as completed.  

### Deleting user tasks

If you want to bulk delete all or some user tasks, use the **Delete User Tasks** report. In the request page, you can set filters to determine which tasks to delete.

# User Access Flow for Microsoft 365 Licenses

[!INCLUDE [2023rw1-sec-group-short](includes/2023rw1-sec-group-short.md)]

This article describes what happens when a user accesses Business Central data using their Microsoft 365 license for the first time. Understanding this flow allows administrators to plan their approach and configure Business Central to match their business needs.

1. First, the user’s identity is authenticated 
2. Business Central verifies that all the [minimum requirements](admin-access-with-m365-license.md#minimum-requirements) are met.
3. Business Central verifies that this user does not have a greater license, such as a Business Central license or an administrative role such as a delegated admin role. 
4. Business Central verifies whether the user is accessing data that belongs to an environment that has enabled access with Microsoft 365 licenses. 
5. The user record is provisioned in Business Central, assigning the User Group, Profile and Permission Sets defined in the Microsoft 365 license configuration page. By default, the Teams Users user group is assigned, the Employee profile is assigned, and only the Login permission set is assigned. Any other defaulting of user settings is also applied, just like a licensed Business Central user. 
6. The full Business Central security model is applied, to determine whether the user should be able to access the record, page, in the specified company and specified environment. 

If all steps succeed, the user can now view this Business Central data in Teams. The Business Central service automatically ensures read-only access and simplifies the UI. 

The user account is now registered in Business Central and can be managed like any Business Central user.

> [!NOTE]
> Steps may vary depending on any additional security configuration that you have specified in Microsoft 365 or Business Central.

# Design Details: Planning Assignment Table
All items should be planned for, however, there is no reason to calculate a plan for an item unless there has been a change in the demand or supply pattern since the last time a plan was calculated.  

If the user has entered a new sales order or changed an existing one, there is reason to recalculate the plan. Other reasons include a change in forecast or the desired safety stock quantity. Changing a bill of material by adding or removing a component would most likely indicate a change, but for the component item only.  

For multiple locations, the assignment takes place at the level of item per location combination. If, for example, a sales order has been created at only one location, application will assign the item at that specific location for planning.  

The reason for selecting items for planning is a matter of system performance. If no change in an item’s demand-supply pattern has occurred, the planning system will not suggest any actions to be taken. Without the planning assignment, the system would have to perform the calculations for all items in order to find out what to plan for, and that would drain system resources.  

The **Planning Assignment** table monitors demand and supply events and assigns the appropriate items for planning. The following events are monitored:  

* A new sales order, forecast, component, purchase order, production order, assembly order, or transfer order.  
* Change of item, quantity, location, variant, or date on a sales order, forecast, component, purchase order, production order, assembly order, or transfer order.  
* Cancellation of a sales order, forecast, component, purchase order, production order, assembly order, or transfer order.  
* Consumption of items other than planned.  
* Output of items other than planned.  
* Unplanned changes in inventory.  

For these direct supply-demand displacements, the order tracking and action messaging system maintains the Planning Assignment table and states a planning reason as an action message.  

The following changes in master data can also cause a planning imbalance:  

* Change of status to Certified in the production BOM header (for all items using that header).  
* Deleted line (child item).  
* Change of status to Certified in the routing header (for all items using that routing).  
* Changes in the following item card fields.  
* Safety Stock Quantity or Safety Lead Time.  
* Lead Time Calculation.  
* Reorder Point.  
* Production BOM No. (and all children of old BOM reference).  
* Routing No.  
* Reordering Policy.  

In these cases, a new function, Planning Assignment Management, maintains the table and states the planning reason as Net Change.  

The following changes do not cause a planning assignment:  

* Calendars  
* Other planning parameters on the item card  

When calculating an MPS or an MRP, the following restrictions apply:  

* MPS: The planning system checks that the item carries a demand forecast or a sales order. If not, the item is not included in the plan.  
* MRP: If the planning system detects that the item is being replenished by an MPS planning line or MPS supply order, the item will be left out of the planning. However, any demand from relevant components is included.

# Change the Annual Amount on Service Contracts or Contract Quotes
You can change the annual amount of the service contract or contract quote to correct the amount that will be invoiced annually.  

## To change the annual amount of the service contract or contract quote  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Contracts** or **Service Contract Quotes**,and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the contract or contract quote.  
3. Choose the **Open Contract** action to open the contract or contract quote for editing.  
4. Choose the **Allow Unbalanced Amounts** check box if you want to change the annual amount and distribute the annual amount difference manually on the contract lines. Otherwise, clear the check box to automatically distribute the annual amount difference on the contract lines after you change the annual amount.  
5. Change the contents of the **Annual Amount** field. You cannot sign, that is, convert into a service contract if you are working on a contract quote, or lock a service contract that has a negative annual amount. If you set the annual amount to zero, the contents of the **Invoice Period** field must be **None** when either signing or locking the service contract.  
6. Depending on whether the **Allow Unbalanced Amounts** check box is selected, run either the manual or automatic distribution of the annual amount difference. The contract lines will be updated so that the **Calcd. Annual Amount** field value is equal to the new annual amount.  

## Distributing Differences Between New and Calculated Annual Amounts
If you change the annual amount of a service contract or contract quote, you may want to distribute the difference between its new and calculated annual amounts on the contract lines. There are three ways to distribute amounts:

* Even distribution  
* Distribution based on line amounts  
* Distribution based on Profit

### Even Distribution
If you change the annual amount of the service contract or contract quote, you may want to distribute the difference between its new and calculated annual amounts on the contract lines. Even distribution is one of the automatic distribution methods that can help you spread equally the new and calculated annual amounts difference between line amounts on the contract lines. The following list of distribution procedure steps describe the main idea of this method:  

1. The difference between the new **Annual Amount** and **Calcd. Annual Amount** field values is divided by the number of the contract lines in the service contract or contract quote.  
2. The **Line Amount** field value is updated by adding the result of the previous operation.  
3. The contents in the **Line Discount Amount**, **Line Discount %**, and **Profit** fields are updated with regard to the new value in the **Line Amount** field in the following way:   
    * Line Discount Amount = Line Value - Line Amount.  
    * Line Discount % = Line Discount Amount / Line Value * 100.  
    * Profit = Line Amount - Line Cost.  

 The steps are repeated for each contract line.  

#### Example  
The **Allow Unbalanced Amounts** check box is not selected in the service contract that contains three contract lines with such information.  

|Item|Line Cost|Line Value|Line Discount %|Line Discount Amount|Line Amount|Profit|  
|----------|---------------|----------------|---------------------|--------------------------|-----------------|------------|  
|Item 1|30.00|40.00|0.00|0.00|40.00|10.00|  
|Item 2|40.00|50.00|10.00|5.00|45.00|5.00|  
|Item 3|50.00|70.00|10.00|7.00|63.00|13.00|  

The **Annual Amount** field value is equal to the contents of the **Calcd. Annual Amount** field, which is always set to the sum of the line amounts. In this case, it is equal to the following:  40 + 45 + 63 = 148.  

If you change the **Annual Amount** to 139, the amount is calculated that should be added to each **Line Amount** field value. This amount is calculated by subtracting the **Calcd. Annual Amount** from the new **Annual Amount** field value and dividing the result by the number of the contract lines in the service contract. In this case, it will be equal to the following: (139 - 148) / 3 = -3. Then, the last calculated figure is added to each **Line Amount** field value and the **Line Discount %**, **Line Discount Amount**, and **Profit** field values are updated using the formulas in the procedure described above.  

Finally, the contract lines will contain this data.  

|Item|Line Cost|Line Value|Line Discount %|Line Discount Amount|Line Amount|Profit|  
|----------|---------------|----------------|---------------------|--------------------------|-----------------|------------|  
|Item 1|30.00|40.00|7.50|3.00|37.00|7.00|  
|Item 2|40.00|50.00|16.00|8.00|42.00|2.00|  
|Item 3|50.00|70.00|14.29|10.00|60.00|10.00|  

### Distribution Based on Line Amount
If you change the annual amount of the service contract or contract quote, you may want to distribute the difference between its new and calculated annual amounts on the contract lines. Distribution Based on Line Amount is an automatic method that can help you spread the new and calculated annual amounts difference between the line amounts on the contract lines. This distribution will be performed proportionally to their line amount shares in the calculated annual amount. The following list of distribution procedure steps for each contract line describe the main idea of this method:  

1. The line amount percentage contribution is calculated as follows: the contents of the **Line Amount** field is divided by the **Calcd. Annual Amount** field values on all contract lines.  
2. The **Line Amount** field value is updated by adding to it the difference between the new and calculated annual amounts, which is multiplied by the line amount percentage contribution.  
3. The contents in the **Line Discount Amount**, **Line Discount %**, and **Profit** fields are updated with regard to the new value in the **Line Discount Amount** field in the following way:  

    * Line Discount Amount = Line Value - Line Amount  
    * Line Discount % = Line Discount Amount / Line Value * 100  
    * Profit = Line Amount - Line Cost  

The steps are repeated for each contract line.  

#### Example  
The **Allow Unbalanced Amounts** check box is not selected in the service contract that contains three contract lines with such information.  

|Item|Line Cost|Line Value|Line Discount %|Line Discount Amount|Line Amount|Profit|  
|----------|---------------|----------------|---------------------|--------------------------|-----------------|------------|  
|Item 1|15.00|17.00|3.00|0.51|25.00|1.49|  
|Item 2|20.00|23.00|None|0.00|55.10|3.00|  
|Item 3|24.00|27.00|3.00|0.81|112.70|2.19|  

The **Annual Amount** field value is equal to the contents of the **Calcd. Annual Amount** field which is always set to the sum of the line amounts. In this case, it is equal to the following: 16.49 + 23.00 + 26.19 = 65.68.  

If you change the **Annual Amount** to 60, the profit percentage contributions for each contract line is calculated:  

* Item 1 – 5 / (5 + 5.1 +12.7) = 0.2193 %  
* Item 2 – 5.1 / (5 + 5.1 + 12.7) = 0.2237  
* Item 3 – 12.7 / (5 + 5.1 + 12.7) = 0.557  

The **Line Amount** field value is updated on each contract line using the following formula: Line Amount = Line Amount + difference between the new and calculated annual amounts * Percentage Contribution. After that, the **Line Discount Amount**, **Line Discount %**, and **Profit** field values are updated using the formulas described in the procedure above.  

Finally, the contract lines will contain this data.  

|Item|Line Cost|Line Value|Line Discount %|Line Discount Amount|Line Amount|Profit|  
|----------|---------------|----------------|---------------------|--------------------------|-----------------|------------|  
|Item 1|15.00|17.00|11.41|1.94|15.06|0.06|  
|Item 2|20.00|23.00|8.65|1.99|21.01|1.01|  
|Item 3|24.00|27.00|11.37|3.07|23.93|-0.07|  

### Distribution Based on Profit
If you change the annual amount of the service contract or contract quote, you may want to distribute the difference between its new and calculated annual amounts on the contract lines. Distribution Based on Profit is one of the automatic methods that can help you spread the new and calculated annual amounts difference between the line amounts on the contract lines. This distribution will be performed proportionally to their profit shares in the total contract or contract quote profit. The following list of distribution procedure steps for each contract line describe the main idea of this method:  

1. The profit percentage contribution is calculated as follows: the contents of the **Profit** field is divided by the sum of **Profit** field values on all contract lines.  
2. The **Line Amount** field value is updated by adding to it the difference between the new and calculated annual amounts, which is multiplied by the profit percentage contribution.  
3. The contents in the Line Discount Amount, Line Discount %, and Profit fields are updated with regard to the new value in the **Line Amount** field in the following way:  

    * Line Discount Amount = Line Value - Line Amount  
    * Line Discount % = Line Discount Amount / Line Value * 100  
    * Profit = Line Amount - Line Cost  

#### Example  
The **Allow Unbalanced Amounts** check box is not selected in the service contract that contains three contract lines with such information.  

|Item|Line Cost|Line Value|Line Discount %|Line Discount Amount|Line Amount|Profit|  
|----------|---------------|----------------|---------------------|--------------------------|-----------------|------------|  
|Item 1|20.00|25.00|0.00|0.00|25.00|5.00|  
|Item 2|50.00|58.00|5.00|2.90|55.10|5.10|  
|Item 3|100.00|115.00|2.00|2.30|112.70|12.70|  

The **Annual Amount** field value is equal to the contents of the **Calcd. Annual Amount** field, which is always set to the sum of the line amounts. In this case, it is equal to the following:  25.00 + 55.10 + 112.70 = 192.80.  

 If you change the **Annual Amount** to 180, the profit percentage contributions for each contract line are calculated:  

* Item 1 – 5 / (5 + 5.1 +1 2.7) = 0.2193 %  
* Item 2 – 5.1 / (5 + 5.1 + 12.7) = 0.2237  
* Item 3 – 12.7 / (5 + 5.1 + 12.7) = 0.557  

The **Line Amount** field value is updated on each contract line using the following formula: Line Amount = Line Amount + difference between the new and calculated annual amounts * Percentage Contribution. After that, the **Line Discount Amount**, **Line Discount %**, and **Profit** field values are updated using the formulas in the step 3 of the procedure described above.  

Finally, the contract lines will contain this data.  

|Item|Line Cost|Line Value|Line Discount %|Line Discount Amount|Line Amount|Profit|  
|----------|---------------|----------------|---------------------|--------------------------|-----------------|------------|  
|Item 1|20.00|25.00|11.24|2.81|22.19|2.19|  
|Item 2|50.00|58.00|9.93|5.76|52.24|2.24|  
|Item 3|100.00|115.00|8.20|9.43|105.57|5.57|

# Sales

You create a sales invoice or sales order to record your agreement with a customer to sell certain products on certain delivery and payment terms.

You must use sales orders if your sales process requires you to ship parts of an order quantity, for example, because the full quantity isn't available right away. If you sell items by delivering directly from your vendor to your customer, as a drop shipment, then you must also use sales orders. In all other respects, sales orders work the same way as sales invoices. With sales orders, you can also use the order promising functionality to communicate certain delivery dates to your customers.  

You can negotiate with the customer by first creating a sales quote, which you can convert to a sales invoice or sales order when you agree on the sale. After the customer confirms the agreement, you can send an order confirmation to record your obligation to deliver the products as agreed.

You can easily correct or cancel a posted sales invoice before the customer pays it. For example, to correct a typing mistake or if the customer requests a change early in the order process. If the posted sales invoice is paid, then you must create a sales credit memo or a sales return order to reverse the sale.

Good sales and marketing practices are all about how to make the best decisions at the right time. Marketing functionality in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides a precise and timely overview of your contact information so you can serve your prospective customers more efficiently and increase customer satisfaction. Learn more at [Relationship Management](marketing-relationship-management.md).

If you use Microsoft Dynamics 365 Sales for customer engagement, you can enjoy seamless integration in the lead-to-cash process by using [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] for backend activities. For example, to process orders, manage inventory, and do your finances. Learn more at [Use Dynamics 365 Sales from Business Central](marketing-integrate-dynamicscrm.md).

In business environments where the customer must pay before products are delivered, such as in retail, you must wait for the receipt of payment before you deliver the products. In most cases, you process incoming payments some weeks after delivery by applying the payments to their related posted, unpaid sales invoices. Learn more at [Reconcile Payments Using Automatic Application](receivables-how-reconcile-payments-auto-application.md).

Sales documents can be sent as PDF files attached to email. The email body contains an extract of the sales document, such as products, total amount, and a link to the PayPal site. Learn more at [Send Documents by Email](ui-how-send-documents-email.md).

For all sales processes, you can incorporate an approval workflow. For example, an approval workflow can require that a manager approves large sales to certain customers. Learn more at [Use Workflows](across-use-workflows.md).

The following sections describe a sequence of tasks, with links to the articles that cover them.

# Finance Power BI app

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

This article explains how to use embedded Power BI reports in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to analyze finance data. You don't have to run a report or switch to another application, such as Excel. The feature provides an interactive and versatile way to calculate, summarize, and examine data in curated reports with predefined KPIs.

The Power BI reports on finance data support many analytics scenarios for finance processes.

Executives and the leadership team consume the data through high-level dashboards that present key performance indicators (KPIs) for finance. The KPIs aggregate data to provide a clear and concise overview of overall financial health, and highlight important performance metrics. This approach helps business leaders quickly assess performance toward strategic goals and make informed decisions without getting lost in granular details.

Managers and team leaders engage with the data through detailed managerial reports that showcase trends and summaries. Data is aggregated over time to reveal patterns and highlight areas that need attention. These reports provide context through charts, visualizations, and comparisons that help you understand underlying trends, identify risks, and make data-driven tactical adjustments.

Finance staff accesses operational reports that offer detailed, granular-level data. These reports offer task-specific information for daily functions. Staff can mine the data for specific transactions, process monitoring, and operational insights, ensuring effective day-to-day management of financial activities.

You can use the various reports in the Power BI Finance app for different things, depending on your role. This article describes some examples of use cases for different roles in an organization.

## Finance analytics for the leadership team

To fit this category, you might have a role such as:

- Executive
- Director
- Other high-level decision maker

### Sample scenario for a CFO

As the CFO, you're preparing for an upcoming board meeting and need an analysis of your company's financial position for the current fiscal quarter.

Using the [Financial Overview (Power BI report)](finance-powerbi-financial-overview.md), you begin with a comparative analysis of revenues. This quarter's revenue of $281,000 represents a significant increase compared to the same period last year of $242,000, marking a growth of $39,000, or approximately 16.1%. This positive trend indicates strong performance and suggests that current strategies are effectively increasing revenue.

:::image type="content" source="media/finance/financial-overview-app-page.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Finance Overview report" lightbox="media/finance/financial-overview-app-page.png":::

You want to compare the net profit margin for the current quarter to the same period in the previous year. You quickly identify that net profit margins are slightly lower, but you need more information to determine why.

:::image type="content" source="media/finance/net-profit-margin-by-fiscal-year-and-month.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Net Profit Margin visual" lightbox="media/finance/net-profit-margin-by-fiscal-year-and-month.png":::

By analyzing the [Profitability](finance-powerbi-profitability.md) report, you can easily see that expenses are up from 3.60 K to 11.85 K for the same period. Although revenue is up by approximately 16.1%, the increase in expenses suppressed growth and produced a marginal increase in profits.

:::image type="content" source="media/finance/profitability-snapshot.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Profitability report" lightbox="media/finance/profitability-snapshot.png":::

To ensure the company is able to cover its short-term obligations, fund new initiatives, and maintain operational stability you review the liquidity report and cash reserves.

The cash ratio of 1.0 indicates that the company has enough cash and cash equivalents (1.02M) to pay off all current liabilities (1.02M) immediately, if needed. The quick ratio of 1.15 indicates that without including inventory in current assets, the company can still cover its short-term debts without relying on sales of inventory. Overall, the current ratio of 1.21 indicates the company is in a balanced but cautious liquidity position with current assets of $1.24M to current liabilities of 1.02M.

:::image type="content" source="media/finance/liquidity-kpi-snapshot.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Liquidity report" lightbox="media/finance/liquidity-kpi-snapshot.png":::

## Finance analytics for the management team

As the Operations Manager, you oversee service delivery across various customer segments. These customer groups are tracked as dimensions values (Large, Medium, and Small) by the **Customer Group** global dimension.

By filtering the [Budget Comparison (Power BI report)](finance-powerbi-budget-comparison.md) by **Global Dimension 2** and **G/L Account Category** to **Income** and **Expense**, you can easily track budget performance. This data lets you allocate resources effectively, control the budget, and make data-driven decisions when you forecast.

:::image type="content" source="media/finance/budget-comparison-snapshot.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Budget Comparison report" lightbox="media/finance/budget-comparison-snapshot.png":::

## Finance analytics for daily finance work

As a member of the accounts receivable team, you manage the inflow of cash by ensuring timely and efficient collection of payments from customers. To monitor and prioritize your efforts, you use the [Aged Receivables (Back Dating) (Power BI report)](finance-powerbi-aged-receivables-back-dating.md).

Analyzing by payment terms code allows you to quickly identify customers who have outstanding balances in aging buckets beyond 30 days. You can now prioritize not only customers, but the invoices those customers should pay first.

# Record purchases with purchase invoices and orders

You create a purchase invoice or purchase order to record the cost of purchases and to track accounts payable. Purchase invoices and purchase orders are also used to dynamically update inventory levels, meaning you can minimize inventory costs and provide better customer service. The purchasing costs, including service expenses, and inventory values that result from posting purchase invoices or orders contribute to profit figures and financial key performance indicators (KPIs).

## Record purchases with purchase invoices

When you receive the inventory items or the purchased service is complete, post the purchase invoice to update inventory and financial records and to activate payment to the vendor according to the payment terms. [Making Payments](payables-make-payments.md).

> [!CAUTION]  
> Don't post a purchase invoice for physical items until you receive the items and know the final cost of the purchase, including any extra charges. Otherwise, your inventory value and profit figures might be skewed.

### Create and post a purchase invoice

The following steps describe how to create a purchase invoice. The steps for creating a purchase order are similar. The main difference is that purchase orders have some extra fields and actions for physical handling of items.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Invoices**,  then choose the related link.  
2. In the **Vendor Name** field, enter the name of an existing vendor.

    Other fields on the **Purchase Invoice** page are now filled with standard information for the selected vendor. If the vendor isn't registered, follow these steps:

    1. In the **Vendor Name** field, enter the name of the new vendor.
    2. In the dialog box about registering the new vendor, choose **Yes**.
    3. To learn more on how to fill in the vendor card, go to [Register New Vendors](purchasing-how-register-new-vendors.md).  
    4. When you complete the vendor card, choose **OK** to return to the **Purchase Invoice** page.

3. Fill in the remaining fields on the **Purchase Invoice** page as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

    You're now ready to fill in the purchase invoice lines with items or resources purchased from the vendor.

    > [!NOTE]  
    > If you set up recurring purchase lines for the vendor, such as a monthly replenishment order, you can add these lines on the invoice by choosing the **Get Recurring Purchase Lines** action.
4. On the **Lines** FastTab, in the **Item No.** field, enter the number of an inventory item or a service.
5. In the **Quantity** field, enter the number of items to purchase.

    The **Line Amount** field is updated to show the value in the **Direct Unit Cost** field multiplied by the value in the **Quantity** field.

    The price and line amount are shown with or without sales tax depending on what you select in the **Prices Including Tax** field on the vendor card.

    The totals fields under the lines are automatically updated as you create or modify lines to display the amounts posted to the ledgers.

6. In the **Inv. Discount Amount** field, enter an amount that should be deducted from the value shown in the **Total Incl. Tax** field at the bottom of the invoice.

    > [!NOTE]  
    > If you set up invoice discounts for the vendor, the percentage value is automatically inserted in the **Vendor Invoice Discount %** field if the criteria are met. The related amount is inserted in the **Inv. Discount Amount** field.
7. When you receive the purchased items or services, choose **Post**.

The purchase is now reflected in inventory, resource ledgers, and financial records, and the vendor payment is activated. The purchase invoice is removed from the list of purchase invoices and replaced with a new document in the list of posted purchase invoices. For more information on what happens when you post purchase documents, see [Posting Purchases](purchasing-how-record-purchases.md#posting-purchases).

> [!NOTE]
> In rare cases, the posted amounts might differ from what is displayed in the totals fields. Typically, the difference is due to rounding calculations for value-added tax (VAT) or sales tax.
>
> To check the amounts before you post, go to the **Statistics** page, which takes the rounding calculations into account. Also, if you choose the **Release** action, the totals fields update to include rounding calculations.

## Posted invoices

[!INCLUDE [posted-invoices](includes/posted-invoices.md)]

You can easily correct or cancel a posted purchase invoice before you pay the vendor. For example, if you need to correct a typo or change the purchase early in the order process. Learn more at [Correct or Cancel Unpaid Purchase Invoices](purchasing-how-correct-cancel-unpaid-purchase-invoices.md). To reverse a purchase for items or services on a posted purchase invoice for which the payment is processed, create a purchase credit memo. Learn more at [Process Purchase Returns or Cancellations](purchasing-how-process-purchase-returns-cancellations.md).

[Open the **Posted Purchase Invoices** list](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=146) in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## Purchasing noninventory items

The lines on a purchase invoice can be of the **Resource** or **Item** type. Item cards can be further classified as of the **Inventory**, **Service**, or **Non-Inventory** type, which specifies if the item is a physical inventory unit, a labor time unit (also applicable for resources), or a physical unit that isn't kept in inventory. Learn more at [Register New Items](inventory-how-register-new-items.md). The purchase invoice process is the same for all mentioned types.

> [!NOTE]
> With the **Resource** purchase line type, you can also purchase external resources, for example, to invoice a vendor for work delivered. Learn more at [Set Up Resources](projects-how-setup-resources.md).
>
> To use a purchased resource, you might need to set the resource's capacity, and manually assign it to a project. Purchasing a resource creates a resource ledger entry; however, resource ledger entries aren't tracked for quantity and value as, for example, items are. If quantity and value tracking is required, then consider using other line item types.

## When to use purchase orders

Use purchase orders if you need to record partial receipts of an order quantity. For example, because the full quantity isn't available at the vendor. If you deliver sold items directly from your vendor to your customer as a drop shipment, you must also use purchase orders. Learn more at [Make Drop Shipments](sales-how-drop-shipment.md).

In all other aspects, purchase orders work the same as purchase invoices. The following procedure is based on a purchase invoice. The steps are similar for a purchase order.

<br><br>

## Receive items with a purchase order

The following steps describe how to receive items with a purchase order. 

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Orders**, then choose the related link.
2. Open an existing purchase order, or create a new one.
3. In the **Qty. to Receive** field, enter the received quantity.

   > [!NOTE]
   > If the received quantity is more than the quantity on the purchase order, and the vendor is set up to allow over-receipts, use the **Over-Receive** field to handle the excess quantity. Learn more in the [To receive more items than you ordered](purchasing-how-record-purchases.md#receive-more-items-than-you-ordered) section.
4. Choose the **Post** action.

  The value in the **Qty. Received** field is updated. If this receipt is partial, the value is lower than the value in the **Quantity** field.

> [!NOTE]
> If you use warehouse handling, you can't use the **Post** action on the purchase order to register the receipt. A warehouse employee already posted the purchase order quantity as received. Learn more at [Design Details - Inbound Warehouse Flow](design-details-inbound-warehouse-flow.md).

## Receive more items than you ordered

When more goods arrive than were ordered, you might want to receive them instead of canceling the receipt. For example, it might be cheaper to keep the excess items in inventory than return them, or your vendor might offer a discount for keeping them.

The following video shows how to work with over-receipts.

> [!VIDEO https://learn-video.azurefd.net/vod/player?id=61ce06f8-b3e7-42fd-b332-85f09d65a4e1]

<!--move the over-receipt setup info to an article about purchasing. Keep the concept info here and link to the steps-->
### Set up over-receipts

Create over-receipt codes to define a percentage by which a received quantity can exceed the ordered quantity. Specify the percentage in the **Over-Receipt Tolerance %** field. You then assign the code on the Item Card or Vendor Card pages for items and vendors.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Over-Receipt Codes**, then choose the related link.
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

### Assign the over-receipt code to an item

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, then choose the related link.
2. Open the **Item Card** page for the item.
3. In the **Over-Receipt Code** field, choose the code that contains the percentage you want to allow for over-receipts.

The over-receipt code is assigned to the item. Purchase orders or warehouse receipts for the item now allow you to receive more than the ordered quantity within the over-receipt tolerance percentage.

> [!NOTE]
> You can set up an approval workflow requiring over-receipts to be approved before they can be handled. Select the **Approval Required** checkbox on the **Over-Receipt Codes** page. Learn more at [Create Workflows](across-how-to-create-workflows.md).

### Over-receive an order

On purchase lines and warehouse receipt lines, the **Over-Receipt Quantity** field is used to record over-received quantities, meaning quantities exceeding the ordered-quantity value in the **Quantity** field.

When you handle an over-receipt, you can increase the value in the **Qty. to Receive** field to the quantity received. The **Over-Receipt Quantity** field updates to show the excess quantity. Alternatively, you can enter the excess quantity in the **Over-Receipt Quantity** field. The **Qty. to Receive** field updates to show the ordered quantity plus the excess quantity. The following procedure described how to fill in the **Qty. to Receive** field.  

1. On a purchase order or a warehouse receipt document where the received quantity is higher than ordered, enter the quantity received in the **Qty. to Receive** field.

    If the increase is within the tolerance specified by an assigned over-receipt code, the **Over-Receipt Quantity** field updates to show the quantity by which the value in the **Quantity** field is exceeded.

    If the increase is over the tolerance, the over-receipt isn't allowed. Investigate whether another over-receipt code allows it. Otherwise, only the ordered quantity can be received, and the excess quantity must be handled another way, such as returning it to the vendor.

2. Post the receipt as you would any other receipt.

> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't automatically handle financial aspects of over-receipts. You must manually handle over-receipts in agreement with the vendor, for example, by the vendor forwarding a new or updated invoice.

## External document number

[!INCLUDE [ext-doc-no-purch](includes/ext-doc-no-purch.md)]

## Posting purchases

On a purchase document, you can choose between the following posting actions:

* **Post**
* **Preview Posting**
* **Post and Print**
<!--* **Test Report**-->
* **Post Batch**

When a purchase document is posted, the vendor's account, the general ledger (G/L), the item ledger entries, and the resource ledger entries are updated.

For each purchase document, a purchase entry is created in the **G/L Entry** table. An entry is also created in the vendor's account in the **Vendor Ledger Entry** table and a G/L entry is created in the relevant payables account. In addition, posting the purchase can result in a value-added tax (VAT) entry and a G/L entry for the discount amount. Whether an entry for the discount is posted depends on the contents of the **Discount Posting** field on the **Purchases & Payables Setup** page.

For each purchase line, as applicable, entries are created in the:

* **Item Ledger Entry** table if the purchase line is of the **Item** type.
* **G/L Entry** table if the purchase line is of the **G/L Account** type.
* **Resource Ledger Entry** table if the purchase line is of the **Resource** type.

In addition, purchase documents are always recorded in the **Purch. Recpt. Header** and **Purch. Inv. Header** tables.

You can always review various ledger entries that are created as a result of postings. Choose **Preview Posting** to validate document and inspect expected ledger entries.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> When you post a purchase order for items, you can create both a receipt and an invoice simultaneously or independently. You can also create a partial receipt and a partial invoice by completing the **Qty. to Receive** and **Qty. to Invoice** fields on the individual purchase order lines before you post. You can't create a purchase invoice from a purchase order for products or services that aren't received. That is, before you can invoice, you must record a receipt, or you must choose to receive and invoice at the same time.

You can either post or post and print. If you choose to post and print, a report is printed when the order is posted. You can also choose the **Post Batch** action to post several orders at the same time. Learn more at [Post Multiple Documents at the Same Time](ui-batch-posting.md).

## Viewing ledger entries

When the posting is completed, the posted purchase lines are removed from the order. A message tells you when the posting is completed. Afterward, the posted entries are available on various pages, including the **Vendor Ledger Entries**, **G/L Entries**, **Item Ledger Entries**, **Resource Ledger Entries**, **Purchase Receipts**, and **Posted Purchase Invoices** pages.

In most cases, you can open ledger entries from the affected card or document. For example, on the **Vendor Card** page, choose the **Entries** action.

## Editing ledger entries

You can edit certain fields on posted purchase documents, such as the **Payment Reference** field. Learn more at [Edit Posted Documents](across-edit-posted-document.md). For more critical fields that affect the auditing trail, you must reverse or undo posting. Learn more at [Reverse Journal Postings and Undo Receipts/Shipments](finance-how-reverse-journal-posting.md).

# Monitor project progress and performance

The work in process (WIP) feature lets you estimate the financial value of ongoing projects in the general ledger.

As a project progresses, materials and resources are consumed and expenses incurred that you must post to the project. In many cases, you might post expenses for a project before invoicing. But if you only post expenses, your financial statement is inaccurate. To track the actual value of the project, calculate WIP and post it to the general ledger. The following are the standard WIP methods:

* Cost value
* Sales value
* Recognizable cost
* Percentage of completion
* Completed contract

You can also create a WIP method that meets the needs of your organization and set it as the default. Learn more at [Understanding WIP Methods](projects-understanding-wip.md).

If you want to view the result using a different method, change the method and recalculate WIP. You can recalculate WIP as often as you like. The value isn't automatically posted to the general ledger. After you calculate WIP using the method you prefer, you can post to the general ledger.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Project WIP Methods**, then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action, and then fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  
3. Close the page.
4. To make this new method the default, choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Projects Setup**, then choose the related link.  
5. In the **Default WIP Method** field, choose the method from the list.

## Define a WIP method for a project

When you create a new project, you must specify which project WIP method applies. In some cases, the project WIP method you use is already set as the default.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Projects**, then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action. Learn more at [Create Projects](projects-how-create-jobs.md).  
3. On the **Project Card** page, in the **WIP Method** field from the **Posting** FastTab, select a WIP method from the list. If a default method is defined, you can select another option if needed.  

### Define a WIP method for a project task

You can define a WIP method for a project task, exclude project tasks from WIP calculation, or group tasks to be calculated together.

If you want to calculate WIP for each project task individually, WIP posting provides defined dimensions for the specific tasks.

The **WIP-Total** specifies project tasks you want to group together when calculating WIP and recognition. In any group of tasks, there needs to be one task that satisfies two conditions:
<!--But doesn't the parenthetical below contradict this -* if there is no total, the application sets the total for you, meaning the condition does not HAVE to be satisfied, right? Or am I missing something?-->

* **WIP-Total** is set to **Total**. If there are no project tasks with **WIP-Total** set to Total, Total is set automatically on the last project task line when WIP is calculated for the first time.
* The number in the **Project Task No.** field is the final one in the group or range of project tasks.

The following table describes the options:

| Field | Description |
|--|--|
| **\<blank\>** | Leave blank if the project task is part of a group of tasks. |
| **Total** | Defines the range or group of tasks included in the WIP and recognition calculation. Within the group, any project task with **Project Task Type** set to **Posting** is included in the WIP total, unless the task's **WIP-Total** field is set to **Excluded**. |
| **Excluded** | Applies only to a task with **Project Task Type** of **Posting**, in which case the task isn't included when WIP and recognition are calculated. |

In the following example, project tasks are divided into two WIP total groupings, demonstrating how the **WIP-Total** field works:

|Project task no.|Description|Project task type|**WIP-Total** field|  
|------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|  
|1000|Preparation|Begin-Total|\<blank\>|
|1010|.    Cleaning|Posting|**Excluded**|
|1099|Total preparation|End-Total|\<blank\>|
|1100|Carpeting|Begin-Total|\<blank\>|
|1110|.    Gluing floor|Posting|**Excluded**|
|1120|.    Laying out carpet|Posting|\<blank\>|
|1199|Total carpeting|End-Total|\<blank\>|
|1200|Finish|Begin-Total|\<blank\>|
|1210|.    Vacuum cleaning carpet|Posting|\<blank\>|
|1299|Total finish|End-Total|**Total**|
|1300|Error correction|Begin-Total|\<blank\>|
|1310|.    Error correction|Posting|\<blank\>|
|1399|Total error correction|End-Total|**Total**|

You notice:

* For *1000* through *1299*, WIP is calculated separately for this group of project tasks. Note, however, that two of the tasks, 1010 and 1110, are excluded from the WIP calculation because their project task type is **Posting**.
* For *1300* through *1399*, WIP is calculated separately for this group of project tasks.

## Calculate WIP

You can determine the WIP amount to post to balance sheet accounts for the period end reporting by using the **Project Calculate WIP** batch job.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Project Calculate WIP**, then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **Calculate WIP** action.
3. On the **Project Calculate WIP** page, fill in the fields as necessary.
4. Choose the **OK** button.  

> [!NOTE]  
> The batch job only calculates the WIP, it doesn't post it to the general ledger. To post WIP, run the **Post WIP to G/L** batch job after you've calculated the WIP. Learn more in the following procedure.

### Review warnings

If your WIP calculation results in a *WIP was calculated with warnings* message, you might want to review the warnings.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Project WIP Cockpit**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the project for which you want to review warnings. The **WIP Warnings** toggle is enabled for projects that have WIP warnings.
3. Choose the **Show Warning** action.

### Delete WIP entries

If you want to try different WIP methods, you might get a *The Project Task cannot be modified because the project has associated project WIP entries* error. To be able to check WIP method, delete existing WIP entries.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Project WIP Cockpit**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the project for which you want to delete WIP entries.
3. Choose the **Delete WIP Entries** action.

## Post WIP

When you calculate WIP, you can post it to balance sheet accounts for the period end reporting. Use the **Project Post WIP to G/L** batch job.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Project Post WIP to G/L**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Project Post WIP to G/L** page, fill in the fields as necessary.  
3. Choose the **OK** button.

## Calculate and post project completion entries

After you complete all activities for a project, including posting usage and invoicing, you must update the project's status to **Completed**. Then, you must reverse any WIP that was posted to the general ledger.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Projects**, then choose the related link.  
2. Select an open project, and then choose the **Edit** action.
3. On the **Posting** FastTab, in the **Status** field, select **Completed**.
4. Follow the assistance steps to calculate and post the WIP, or follow steps 5 and 6 to do so manually.  
5. Choose the **Calculate WIP** action.
6. On the **Project Calculate WIP** page, fill in the fields as necessary.  

     The project WIP entries created by running the batch job have the **Project Complete** checkbox selected to show that they're completion entries.  
7. Choose the **Post WIP to G/L** action.
8. On the **Project Post WIP to G/L** page, fill in the fields as necessary.  

     The project WIP general ledger entries created by running the batch project have the **Project Complete** checkbox selected to show that they're completion entries.

## View project ledger entries

All project-related entries are recorded in project registers and sequentially numbered, starting with 1. From the project register, you can get an overview of all project ledger entries.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Project Registers**, and choose the related link.
2. Select a relevant register, and then choose **Project Ledger** action.

On the **Project Ledger Entries** page, you can review the entries that are associated with any project.

# Create projects

When you start a new project, you must create a project card with integrated project tasks and project planning lines, structured in two layers.  

The first layer consists of project tasks. You must create at least one project task per project because all posting refers to a project task. Having at least one project task in your project enables you to set up project planning lines and to post consumption to the project.

The second layer consists of project planning lines, which specify the detailed use of resources, items and various general ledger expenses.

The layer structure enables you to divide the project into smaller tasks, and therefore use more specific details in budgeting, quotes, and registration. In addition, it gives you insight into how a project is progressing. For example, you can track whether you're meeting designated milestones or if you're on target to meet budget expectations.

> [!TIP]
> Choose the **New Project** action on the **Project Manager** Role Center to launch an assisted setup guide that takes you through the steps of creating a project with integrated tasks and planning lines. The following procedure describes how to perform the steps manually. <!-- For an example of how to create a project manually, go to [Video: How to create a project in Dynamics 365 Business Central](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqaPWr7BWmw).-->

## To create a project card

You create a project card and then create project task lines and project planning lines for it.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Projects**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action, and then fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
3. To base the project on information from another project, choose the **Copy Project** action, fill in the fields as necessary, and then choose the **OK** button.

> [!NOTE]  
> If you're using time sheets with your project, you must also designate a person responsible. This person can approve time sheets for the employee tasks associated with the project. For more information, see [Set Up Time Sheets](projects-how-setup-time-sheets.md).

> [!NOTE]  
> The **Apply Usage Link** toggle indicates whether project ledger entries are linked to project planning lines. The **Apply Usage Link** toggle also activates warehouse handling, planning, assembly-to-order, item tracking, and reservation capabilities for a project.

Optionally, mark actions on project as blocked using the **Blocked** field. The following table describes the effect of the options for this field.

|Option  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|Blank |All actions are allowed.|
|Posting    |You can work with planning lines, but the project is blocked for posting. You can't post usage or sales for the project.|
|All  |All actions are blocked.|

## To create tasks for a project

A key part of creating a project is to specify the various tasks involved in the project. You specify tasks by creating one line per task on the **Tasks** FastTab on the **Project Card** page. Every project must have at least one task.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Projects**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the project card for a relevant project.
3. On the **Tasks** FastTab, fill in the fields as necessary on a new line.
4. To indent tasks and create a hierarchy, Choose the **Tasks** action, the then choose **Indent Project Tasks** action.
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 for all the tasks that you need for the project.
6. To specify the project tasks with information on other project tasks, choose the **Copy Project Tasks from** action, fill in the fields as necessary, and then choose the **OK** button.

## Invoice one or more customers for project tasks

Sometimes the party that is receiving a service is different from the party that pays the bill. Also, sometimes you might need to invoice multiple customers for tasks in the project. On the **Project Card** page, use the **Task Billing Method** field to specify whether you're billing one customer, or multiple customers.

If the customer who is receiving the service also pays the bill, in the **Bill-to** and **Ship-to** fields, choose **Default (Customer)** and **Default (Sell-to Address)**.

If you're billing multiple customers, you can specify the customer who receives the service and the customer to invoice for each task in the project. You can also provide the following information:

* Select the ship-to address for the customer where the work happens.
* Add information about external references to simplify communication about the project.
* Overwrite the standard financial terms of the project.

## Specify a default location for project items

You can save time on data entry by specifying a default location and bin for projects on the **Project Card** page. When you create tasks, project planning lines, and project journal lines for the project, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] assigns the default location. You can, however, change the location code and bin on tasks and lines if needed.

If you define a **To-Project Bin Code** on the location, the bin code is populated when you select the location code. If your warehouse flow requires warehouse picks, you can also define other bins from which to consume items.

These fields are the defaults when you create project tasks. Existing project tasks don't change.

There are a few things to know about using default locations:

* For project tasks, if you define a **To-Project Bin Code** on the location, the bin code is assigned when you select the location code. If your warehouse flow requires warehouse picks, you can also define other bins from which to consume items.
* For project planning lines, the **Location Code** is based on the value selected on the project planning line when you select an item. If a bin code isn't defined for the project task, the bin from the default bin content is selected. You can change both values manually.
* For project journal lines, the **Location Code** is based on the value selected on the job journal line when you select an item. If a bin code isn't defined for the project task, the bin from default bin content is selected. You can change both values manually.

> [!NOTE]
> The processes businesses use to pick items in their warehouses differ, depending on whether they use basic or advanced warehouse configurations. To learn more about the options for warehouse configuration, go to [Overview of different configuration options](design-details-warehouse-management.md#overview-of-different-configuration-options).

## To create planning lines for a project

You can refine your new project tasks on project planning lines. A planning line can capture the information that you want to track for a project. For example, you can track the resources the project requires, or the items that are needed. For example, you have a task to get a customer to approve a project. You associate the task with planning lines for items such as meeting the customer and assigning a resource.  

A project planning line can have one of the types described in the following table.  

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Budget** |Provides estimated usage and costs for the project, typically in a time and materials type project. You can't invoice planning lines of this type. |
| **Billable** |Provides estimated invoicing to the customer, typically in a fixed price project. |
| **Both Budget and Billable** |Provides budgeted usage equal to what you want to invoice. |

> [!NOTE]
> While you enter information on project planning lines, cost information is automatically filled in. For example, the cost, price, and discount for resources and items are based on information from the resource and item.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Projects**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open a relevant project card.
3. Select a project task for which the **Project Task Type** field contains **Posting**, and then choose the **Project Planning Lines** action.  
4. On the **Project Planning Lines** page, on a new line, fill in the fields as necessary.
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 for all planning lines that you need for the project task.

> [!TIP]
> If the line is for an item, you can use the **Item Availability by** action to explore the item's availability by location, event, or period.

## Avoid document number errors when you post project journals

If you use a number series for project journal batches, you can't post the journal if the document numbers aren't consecutive. If needed, you can correct the order of document numbers when you post project journals.

On the **Project Journals** page, the **Document No.** field is editable so that you can specify different document numbers for different journal lines, or the same document number for related journal lines.

If a number series is specified in the **No. Series** field on the project journal batch, document numbers for individual or grouped lines must be sequential when you post a project journal. If they aren't, you can't post the journal. To avoid getting stuck, use the **Renumber Document Numbers** action on the **Project Journals** page before you post the journal. If you group journal lines by document number before you use the action, they stay grouped but might be assigned a different document number.

> [!TIP]
> The **Renumber Document Numbers** action also works on filtered views.

# Edit Posted Documents

Sometimes you have to update a posted document because information that is relevant to the document has changed. On a posted sales document, this can be the shipping agent's package tracking number, for example. On a posted purchase document, this can be a payment reference text.

You perform the change on an editable version of the original document, indicated by "**- Update**" in the page title. The page contains a subset of the fields on the original document, of which some are non-editable fields that are shown for information only.

The functionality is available for the following documents across all supported markets:

- Posted Sales Shipment
- Posted Purchase Invoice
- Posted Return Shipment
- Posted Return Receipt

The following additional documents can be edited in the specified countries or regions:

- ES: Posted Sales Invoice, Posted Sales Credit Memo, Posted Purchase Credit Memo
- APAC: Posted Sales Credit Memo, Posted Purchase Credit Memo
- RU: Posted Sales Credit Memo
- IT: Posted Transfer Shipment, Posted Service Shipment

## To edit a posted sales shipment

The following explains how to edit a posted sales shipment. The steps are similar for the other supported documents.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Posted Sales Shipments**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the document that you want to edit, and then choose the **Update Document** action. Alternatively, open the document and then choose the action.
3. On the **Posted Sales Shipment - Update** page, edit the **Package Tracking No.** field, for example.
4. Choose the **OK** button.

The posted sales shipment is updated.

# Where is personalization stored?

When you interact with the Business Central web client to optimize your workspace, some user interface (UI) adjustments are automatically saved and roam with you across devices and browsers. Others are local and only affect your current browser.

- *Roaming personalization* is stored in the Business Central service and affects your experience no matter which device or browser you sign in to. Personalizing in one browser or device immediately affects other browsers or devices that you use. Roaming personalization is typically infrequent, more permanent, or time-consuming to recreate. Roaming settings can only be reset by clearing personalization from the Business Central web client.
- *Local personalization* is stored in your browser and only affects your experience when using different browser tabs in that same browser. It doesn't affect your Business Central experience on other devices, browsers, or browser profiles. UI adjustments that are saved locally are typically those adjustments that users frequently do and redo as they work in Business Central.  

  > [!NOTE]
  > If you delete the browsing data in your browser, specifically cookies and site data, you also delete any local personalization that you've done. To avoid deleting local personalization, make sure that the browser isn't set up to clear cookies and site data every time you close the browser. For example, in Microsoft Edge, you turn off the **Cookies and other site data** toggle in the **Privacy, search, and services** settings. Learn more at [Manage cookies in Microsoft Edge](https://support.microsoft.com/windows/manage-cookies-in-microsoft-edge-view-allow-block-delete-and-use-168dab11-0753-043d-7c16-ede5947fc64d#bkmk_deletecookieseverytimeyouclosethebrowser) or consult the documentation for your browser.

## Roaming versus local UI adjustments

The following table indicates which UI adjustments are roaming, local, or both. An \* indicates that the roaming personalization can be made without entering the personalization mode.

# Set up company consolidation

Before you can consolidate the general ledger entries of two or more companies (subsidiaries) into a consolidated company, you must prepare the charts of accounts and the consolidation company.  

Depending on the complexity of your businesses, there are two ways to set up consolidation:

* If you don't need advanced settings, such as including a company that you only own part of, you can use the **Company Consolidation** setup guide to quickly set-up a consolidation. The guide helps you through the basic steps.
* If you need more advanced settings, you can set up the consolidated company and business units yourself.
  * In each business unit, specify the general ledger accounts to include in the consolidation and the translation method for each account.
  * In the consolidated company, set up a business unit card for each company to include in the consolidation. The business unit card includes information such as the dates of the business unit's fiscal year, and the percentage of each account to include in the consolidation.

## Simple consolidation setup

If your consolidation is straightforward, for example because you wholly own the business units to consolidate, the **Company Consolidation** guide helps you through the following steps:

* Create a new consolidated company, or consolidate a company you already created. The company shouldn't contain transactions.
* Preview the results. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] verifies that you can successfully transfer the master data and transactions to the consolidated company.

To use the assisted setup guide, follow these steps:

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Assisted Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose **Process Consolidations**, and then complete each step in the Company Consolidation assisted setup guide.

## Advanced consolidation setup

If you need more advanced settings for your consolidation, you can set up consolidation manually. For example, if you have companies that you partially own, or you have companies that you don't want to include.  

### Set up the consolidated company

First, you must set up the consolidated company. You set up the consolidated company in the same way that you set up other companies. To learn more about setting up a company, go to [Getting Ready for Doing Business](ui-get-ready-business.md).  

The following list illustrates key aspects of the consolidated company.

1. Set up the chart of accounts.

    To learn more about setting up a chart of accounts, go to [Setting Up or Changing the Chart of Accounts](finance-setup-chart-accounts.md).  

    The charts of accounts can be identical across a business unit and the consolidated company, or the consolidated company can have a different chart of account. If a business unit's chart of accounts differs from the consolidated company's, you must map the accounts to the accounts in the business unit. To learn more, go to the [Prepare general ledger accounts for consolidation](#glacc) section.

2. Add business units.

    To consolidate several companies' data, you must set up the subsidiaries as business units and specify how much of their balances to include. To learn more about business units, to go the [Add business units](#busunit) section.

3. Specify exchange rates, if needed.

    Specify exchange rates if you consolidate data for business units that use different currencies. The exchange rates you can use are **Average Rate (Manual)** and **Closing Rate**. To learn more about exchange rates, go to [Specify exchange rates for consolidations](#exchrates).

4. Consolidate dimension information and general ledger accounts.

    To learn more, go to the [Include or exclude dimensions](#dim) section.

### <a name="busunit"></a>Add business units

In the consolidated company, set up each company that you want to consolidate data from as a business unit. Before you run a consolidation and generate your consolidation report, it's a good idea to verify the financial data in each business unit.

A significant part of setting up the business unit is to specify how the unit shares it's financial data with the consolidated company. There are manual and automated options:

* To use a manual process, for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online and on-premises, you can export an .xml file that contains the unit's general ledger entries. Then import the file in the consolidated company.
* To automate the data exchange, for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online you can use an API that [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides to share data across environments. If your companies are in the same environment, you can use the **Database** option.

> [!NOTE]
> The API option also lets you share general ledger entries from other [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] environments. To use the API option, the user who configures the consolidation must have permission to access G/L entries. For example, the D365 Basic and D365 Read permission sets provide access.

#### Set up business unit currencies

When you run consolidation for business units in a foreign currency, pay attention to the exchange rates that various parts of the process use. This is especially true when you rerun consolidation. Use the **Set Up Business Unit Currencies** page to easily keep track of the rates.

The **Set Up Business Unit Currencies** page gives you the last rates for average and closing. You can look up the exchange rates in the currency exchange rate table, which makes it easier to validate rates. You can change the rates for the current run by entering the values or copying them from previous runs. To copy rates, choose **Select from previous consolidation**. This page is valuable when you want to rerun a previous consolidation and use a previous closing rate. This step helps to correctly revaluate your balance sheet items. The **Select from previous consolidation** page is also useful if you just want to view the rates that were used, for example, when you're troubleshooting. The page is filtered to runs that included the selected business unit.

You start the **Run Consolidation** batch job from the **Business Units** list page. You can also find the **Set Up Business Unit Currencies** page by choosing the **Exchange Rates** action.

> [!NOTE]
> The exchange rate setup pages for average and closing that are currently available on the **Business Unit** card will be deprecated in a future version. However, you can still maintain these rates if you have business units that you import through files.

#### Create a business unit

1. Sign in to the consolidated company.
2. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Business Units**, and then choose the related link.  
3. Choose **New**, and then fill in the required fields on the **General** and **G/L Accounts** FastTabs. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > When you fill in the **Starting Date** and **Ending Date** fields, make sure you comply with GAAP rules concerning the fiscal periods of the business unit versus the parent company.
4. On the **Data Import** FastTab, in the **Default Data Import** field, specify how you share general ledger entries with the consolidated company:

   * To share data between companies in the same environment, choose **Database**.
   * To share data between companies in different environments, choose **API**, and then fill in the **API's Endpoint** field.
        
        To get the endpoint URL, in the business unit company's [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], open the **Consolidation Setup Page** and check the Current environment's API Endpoint field value. 
   * To export an .xml file and manually share it, choose **File Format**.

### <a name="glacc"></a>Prepare general ledger accounts for consolidation

The chart of accounts for a company that you will consolidate must specify accounts for consolidation. For each posting general ledger account in each company, you must specify the general ledger account in the consolidated company to transfer the balance to. This mapping lets you consolidate companies that have different charts of accounts.

If the chart of accounts in the business unit differs from the consolidated company, you must prepare general ledger accounts for consolidation. You can specify the accounts to post debits and credits to, and the method to use to translate currencies in the consolidated company.

1. In each business unit's [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Chart of Accounts**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the card for the account, and then fill in the fields on the **Consolidation** FastTab. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> If you don't fill in the **Consol. Debit Acc.** and **Consol. Credit Acc.** fields, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] assumes they're mapped to the same accounts in the consolidated company.

> [!TIP]
> There might be scenarios where you don't want to include an account in a consolidation. For example, if you want your consolidation company to reflect only the balance sheets from the subsidiary companies. To exclude an account from consolidation, turn on the **Exclude from Consolidation** toggle for the account.

### <a name="exchrates"></a>Specify exchange rates for consolidations

If a business unit uses a different currency than the consolidated company, you must specify exchange rate methods for each account before you consolidate. For each account, the content of the **Consol. Translation Method** field determines the exchange rate. In the consolidated company, on each business unit card, in the **Currency Exchange Rate Table** field you specify whether consolidation uses exchange rates from the business unit or the consolidated company. If you use exchange rates from the consolidated company, you can change the exchange rates for a business unit. For business units, if the **Currency Exchange Rate Table** field on the business unit card contains **Local**, you can change the exchange rate from the business unit card. The exchange rates are copied from the **Currency Exchange Rate** table, but you can change them before consolidating.

The following table describes the exchange rate methods you can use for accounts.

|Exchange rate | Typical use |
|---|---|
|Average Rate (Manual) | You manually calculate the average rate for the period to consolidate. Calculate the average either as an arithmetic average or as a best estimate, and specify the result for each business unit. Use for income statement accounts.|
|Closing Rate | Used for balance sheet accounts.|
|Historical Rate | The exchange rate that was valid when the transaction occurred.|
|Composite Rate | The current period amounts are translated at the average rate and added to the previously recorded balance in the consolidated company. You typically use this method for retained earnings accounts. Those accounts include amounts from different periods, so they contain amounts translated with different exchange rates.|
|Equity Rate | This option is similar to **Composite**. Differences post to separate general ledger accounts.|

To specify exchange rates for a business unit, follow these steps:

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Business Units**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Business Unit List** page, choose the business unit, and then choose the **Exchange Rates** action.  
3. On the **Setup Business Unit Currencies** page, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

### <a name="dim"></a>Include or exclude dimensions

You can consolidate dimension information and general ledger accounts.

* On the dimensions, specify the **Consolidation Code** field, or leave it blank.
  * To exclude a dimension in the consolidation, leave the **Consolidation Code** field blank on the dimension, and don't choose dimensions in the **Copy Dimensions** fields in any consolidation functions or reports.
  * To include dimension information in the consolidation, leave the **Consolidation Code** field blank. However, the consolidation works only if the dimension values in the business unit are the same as the consolidated company.
  * To consolidate the dimension value code in the business unit with a different dimension value code in the consolidated company, fill in the **Consolidation Code** field on the dimensions.  
* Add the dimensions to the general ledger accounts.

### <a name="exclude"></a>Exclude a company from consolidation

If you don't want to include a business unit in the consolidation, you can exclude it. To do that, go to the business unit card, and clear the **Consolidate** checkbox.

### <a name="include"></a>Include a partially owned company in consolidation

If you own only part of a company, you can include a percentage of each transaction that reflects the percentage you own. For example, if you own 70% of the company, consolidation includes $70 of an invoice for $100. To specify the percentage of the company you own, go to the business unit card and enter the percentage in the **Consolidation %** field.

# Track Relations Between Demand and Supply

From any supply or demand document in the so-called order network, you can track the order demand (tracked quantity), forecast, blanket sales order, or planning parameter (untracked quantity) that has given rise to the planning line in question.

The planning worksheets also offers supporting planning information about non-order entities to help the planner obtain an optimal supply plan. For more information, see [Untracked Planning Elements](production-how-track-demand-supply.md#untracked-planning-elements).

## To track linked items
Order tracking shows how sales orders, production orders, and purchase orders are related to the manufacturing order through the planning and reservation systems.

The following describes how to track linked items on a firm planned production order. The steps are similar for all other order types, and from planning worksheet lines.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Firm Planned Prod. Order**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the relevant firm planned production order from the list.
3. On the **Lines** FastTab, choose the **Functions** action, and then choose the **Order Tracking** action.

The lines in the **Order Tracking** display the documents that are related to the current production order line.

## Untracked Planning Elements
The **Untracked Planning Elements** page opens when you choose the **Untracked Qty.** field on the **order Planning** page. It serves two purposes:

1. To hold information about untracked quantities displayed when the user looks up from the Order Tracking page to see untracked quantities.
2. To hold warning messages displayed when the user chooses the **Warning** icon on the **Planning Worksheet** page.

The page contains entries which account for an untracked surplus quantity in order tracking network. These entries are generated during the planning run and explain where the untracked surplus quantity in the order tracking lines came from. This untracked surplus can come from:

- Production forecast
- Blanket orders
- Safety stock quantity
- Reorder point
- Maximum inventory
- Reorder quantity
- Maximum order quantity
- Minimum order quantity
- Order multiple
- Dampener (% of lot size)

# Setup best practices: Reordering policies

The **Reordering Policy** field on item cards has planning methods that determine how the individual planning parameters interact.  

One best-practice foundation for selecting a reordering policy is the item’s ABC classification. When you use ABC classification, you manage items according to three classes. The class you use depends on the item's value and volume relative to the total stock. The following table shows the value-volume distribution of the three classes.

|Class|Percent of total stock volume|Percent of total stock value|
|-----|-----------------------------|----------------------------|
|A|10-20|50-70|
|B|20|20|
|C|60-70|10-30|

The ABC classification states that effort and money can be saved by applying looser control to items of low value-volume than to items of high value-volume. The following illustration shows which reordering policy in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is best suited for A, B, and C items respectively.

![ABC Classification.](media/abc_classification.png "abc_classification")

The following table provides best practices for selecting between the four policies.  

|Setup option|Best practice|Comment|  
|------------------|-------------------|-------------|  
|**Order**|Use for A items.<br /><br /> Use for make-to-order items.<br /><br /> In manufacturing, use for top-level items and for expensive components and subassemblies.<br /><br /> Use for items that are purchased as drop shipments and special orders.<br /><br /> Don't use if you don't accept automatic reservation.|A items, such as leather couches in a furniture store, are high-value items with low and irregular order velocity where inventory is unacceptable, or the required attributes vary. The best reordering policy is therefore one that plans specifically for each demand.|  
|**Lot-for-Lot**|Use for B items.<br /><br /> In manufacturing, use for components that occur in multiple BOMs. This policy ensures that purchase orders are combined for the same vendor, so better prices can be negotiated.<br /><br /> Use if you aren't sure about which reordering policy to select.|B items, such as dining chairs, have a regular and fairly high order velocity, but also high carrying costs. The best reordering policy for B items is therefore one that is economical by bundling demand in the reorder cycle.<br /><br /> 80 percent of items can use this policy.<br /><br /> Can be used successfully without planning parameters.|  
|**Fixed Reorder Qty.**|Use for C items.<br /><br /> Combine with reorder-point parameters.<br /><br /> In manufacturing, use for lowest-level components.<br /><br /> Don't use if the item is often reserved.|C items, such as tea cups, are low-value items with high and regular order velocity. The best reordering policy for C items is therefore one that guarantees constant availability by always staying above a reorder point.<br /><br /> If the user reserves a quantity for a distant demand, the planning foundation is disturbed. Even if the projected inventory level is acceptable regarding the reorder point, the quantities might not be available because of the reservation.|  
|**Maximum Qty.**|Use for C items with high carrying costs or storing limitations.<br /><br /> Combine with one or more order modifiers (Minimum/Maximum Order Quantity or Order Multiple).|C items, such as tea cups, are low-value items with high and regular order velocity. The best reordering policy for C items is therefore one that guarantees constant availability by always staying above a reorder point, but below a maximum inventory quantity.<br /><br /> To modify the suggested order, you might want the order quantity to be decreased to a specified maximum order quantity, increased to a specified minimum order quantity, or rounded up to meet a specified order multiple. **Note:**  If used with a reorder point, then inventory stays between the reorder point and the maximum quantity.|

# Set up prepayments

You use prepayments when:

* You require your customers to submit payment before you ship an order to them.
* Your vendor requires that you submit payment before they ship an order to you.

Prepayments let you invoice and collect deposits from customers or to remit deposits to vendors, to ensure that all partial payments are posted against an invoice. For more information, see [Create Prepayment Invoices](finance-how-to-create-prepayment-invoices.md).

Before you can post prepayment invoices, you have to set up the posting accounts in the general ledger, and you have to set up number series for prepayment documents. You must specify an account for prepayments related to sales and an account for prepayments related to purchasing. You can specify the same posting accounts for all prepayments related to all general business posting groups or general product posting groups. You can also specify specific accounts for specific posting groups for sales and purchasing, respectively. The best method to use depends on your company's requirements for tracking prepayments.  

You can define the percentage of the line amount to invoice for prepayment for a customer or vendor, and for all or selected items. After you complete the setup, you can generate prepayment invoices from sales and purchase orders. You can use the default percentages for each sales or purchase line, or you can change the amounts on the invoice as needed. For example, you can specify a total amount for the entire order.  

> [!NOTE]
> We recommend that you don't use a prepayment percentage of 100 in the following cases:
>
> * You're located in North America. Due to how taxes are calculated, a prepayment percentage of 100 can lead to issues with prepayment invoices.
> * In all regions, if you manually deduct a payment discount from the invoice. A prepayment percentage of 100 doesn't automatically leave an amount from which to deduct the discount.
>
> Also, when you're using prepayment percentage of 100, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] might need to create off-setting rounding entries. When that happens, choose a G/L account in the **Invoice Rounding Account** field on the **Customer Posting Groups** page. This account is required even if you don't turn on the **Invoice Rounding** toggle on the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page. If you don't specify an account, you can't post prepayment invoices.

The prepaid amount belongs to the buyer until they receive the goods or services. You must set up general ledger accounts to hold the prepayment amounts until you post the final invoice. Sales prepayments must be recorded in an account for liabilities until the items ship. Purchase prepayments must be recorded in an account for assets until the items are received. In addition, you must set up a separate general ledger account for each VAT identifier.  

[!INCLUDE[local-func-setup-link](includes/local-func-setup-link.md)]

## To add prepayment accounts to the general posting setup  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Posting Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **General Posting Setup** page, for the relevant lines, fill in the following fields:  

    * **Sales Prepayments Account**  
    * **Purch. Prepayments Account**  

If you don't already have general ledger accounts for prepayments, you can open the **G/L Account List** page from the relevant account field.  

## To set up number series for prepayment documents  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales & Receivables Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page, on the **Number Series** FastTab, fill in the following fields:  

   * **Posted Prepmt. Inv. Nos.**
   * **Posted Prepmt. Cr. Memo Nos.**

3. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchases & Payables Setup**, and then choose the related link.
4. On the **Purchases & Payables Setup** page, on the **Number Series** FastTab, fill in the following fields:

    * **Posted Prepmt. Inv. Nos.**
    * **Posted Prepmt. Cr. Memo Nos.**

> [!NOTE]  
> You can use the same number series for prepayment invoices and regular invoices, or you can use different number series. If you use different series, they must not overlap because there must not be any numbers that exist in both series.  

## To set up prepayment percentages for items, customers, and vendors

For an item, you can set up a default prepayment percentage for all customers, a specific customer, or a customer price group. If you don't want to apply the same prepayment percentage to all customers, you must specify which customers or which customer price groups the prepayment percentage applies to.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select an item, and then choose the **Sales Prepayment Percentages** action.  
3. On the **Sales Prepayment Percentages** page, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

For a customer or vendor, you can set up one default prepayment percentage for all items and all types of sales lines. You enter the percentage on the customer or vendor card. The following procedure shows how to specify a prepayment percentage for a customer, but similar steps apply to vendors.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customers**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the card for a customer.
3. On the **Payments** FastTab, fill in the **Prepayment %** field.
4. Repeat the steps for other customers or for vendors.  

> [!TIP]
> You can also access the **Sales Prepayment Percentages** page from the customer or vendor card.

### To determine which prepayment percentage has first priority  

An order might have a prepayment percentage on the sales header, and a different percentage for the items on the lines. To determine which prepayment percentage applies to each sale line, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] looks for and applies the first default percentage in the following order:  

1. A prepayment percentage for the item on the line and the customer that the order is for.  
2. A prepayment percentage for the item on the line and the customer price group that the customer belongs to.  
3. A prepayment percentage for the item on the line for all customers.  
4. The prepayment percentage on the sales or purchase header.  

In other words, the prepayment percentage on the customer card only applies if no prepayment percentage is set for the item. However, if you change the contents of the **Prepayment Percentage** field on the sales or purchase header after you create the lines, the prepayment percentage on all of the lines update. The update makes it easy to create an order with a fixed prepayment percentage, regardless of the percentage set on items.

## To automatically release sales orders when prepayments are applied

You can save time by setting up a job queue entry that will automatically release sales orders that require prepayment after payments are applied. Automating the process saves you the step of releasing the sales order.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales & Receivables Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. In the **Prepmt. Auto Update Frequency** field, specify how often you want the job queue entry to run.

> [!TIP]
> While you're here, consider adding a safeguard against shipping or invoicing sales orders that have unpaid prepayment amounts. If you turn on the **Check Prepmt. when Posting** toggle, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] prevents people from posting orders with outstanding prepayment amounts.

3. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Job Queue Entries**, and then choose the related link.
4. Set up the **Upd. Pending Prepmt. Sales** job queue entry, for example, by using the settings on the **Recurrence** FastTab to schedule how often you want it to run. For more information, see [Use Job Queues to Schedule Tasks](admin-job-queues-schedule-tasks.md).

# EBITDA (Power BI report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **EBITDA** report provides an overview of your company's performance from the perspective of both earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA). You can review EBIT and EBITDA over time to identify trends in operational performance and inform decisions about cost management and pricing strategies.

:::image type="content" source="media/finance/ebitda-report.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the EBITDA report" lightbox="media/finance/ebitda-report.png":::

## Use the report

The audiences for the report are:

- Executives
- Directors
- Other high-level decision makers

Executives use the report to evaluate cash flow potential before making strategic decisions. By analyzing EBIT, you can gauge the efficiency with which your core business generates profits from operations. EBITDA excludes both nonoperational costs and noncash expenses, such as depreciation and amortization. Use EBITDA when you compare your business to your peers in the industry.

EBITDA is good for comparing cash flow potential across similar businesses. EBIT offers a fuller picture of profit by including asset-related costs, which is essential for assessing long-term operational efficiency.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The *EBITDA* report includes the following KPIs and measures: 

- [**Operating Profit - EBIT**](finance-powerbi-kpis.md#-change-in-operating-profit---ebit)
- [**EBITDA**](finance-powerbi-kpis.md#ebitda)
- [**Revenue**](finance-powerbi-kpis.md#revenue)

# Track your business KPIs with Power BI metrics

If you use Power BI on [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] data, it's easy to track KPIs or metrics that are important to you.

With metrics in Power BI, you can curate your own metrics and track them against key business objectives, in a single pane. This feature enhances data culture by promoting accountability, alignment, and visibility for teams and initiatives within organizations.

Follow this four-step process to set up Power BI metrics:

1. Create a scorecard in Power BI. Learn more at [Create scorecards in Power BI](/power-bi/create-reports/service-goals-create).  
2. Add the metrics you want to track by connecting to your Power BI report on telemetry. Learn more at [Create connected metrics](/power-bi/create-reports/service-goals-create-connected).  
3. Add alerting, if needed, to define status rules for your metrics. Learn more at [Create automated status rules for metrics](/power-bi/create-reports/service-metrics-status-rules).  

    This step automates status updates based on rules that govern the metric. Rules trigger changes based on value, percentage of target met, date conditions, or a combination of the three, making the rules versatile. For connected metrics, these status rules refresh every time the data in your scorecard refreshes.
4. Follow metrics to get alerts in Teams or by email. Learn more at [Follow your metrics](/power-bi/create-reports/service-metrics-follow).  

Learn more about Power BI metrics at [Get started with metrics in Power BI](/power-bi/create-reports/service-goals-introduction).

> [!NOTE]
> Starting with Business Central 2023 release wave 2, it's possible to embed scorecards from Power BI metrics in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

# Add Business Central tab in Microsoft Teams

[!INCLUDE [online_only](includes/online_only.md)]

In Teams, tabs appear at the top of channels and chats, giving participants quick access to pertinent information. This article explains different ways to add a tab that displays [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] data.

![Tabs in Teams](media/teams-tab-border-2.png)

## About Business Central tabs

A [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] tab provides a focused view of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] list and card pages. The tab doesn't display the full [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] web client. There's no browser border, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] banner (for example with Tell Me, search, help) or top navigation menu&mdash;just page content and its actions. The content is interactive, meaning that you can select actions and links, change data, and more. You're limited to what you see and can do by the same permissions assigned to your account in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

Learn more about who can view the content of a [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] tab in [Who can see the content of a tab?](/dynamics365/business-central/teams-faq?tabs=tabs#who-can-view).

> [!TIP]
> Are you a developer? You can also add tabs programmatically using the Microsoft Graph API. Learn more in [Add Business Central Tabs to Teams](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-develop-for-teams-tabs).  

## Prerequisites

To add a [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] tab, the following requirements must be met:

- You have access to Microsoft Teams.
- You have a [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] license.
- You've installed the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app in Teams. Learn more in [Install the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] App for Microsoft Teams](across-install-app-for-teams.md).

To view [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] tab that was added by another participant in the channel or chat, the following requirements must be met:

- You have access to Microsoft Teams.
- You have a [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] license or limited access to Business Central with a Microsoft 365 license only. Learn more in [Business Central Access with Microsoft 365 Licenses](admin-access-with-m365-license.md).
- You've installed the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app in Teams.

## Add tab using recommended content

Use these steps to add a tab by choosing what to display from a readily available list of recommended content that's based your role center&mdash;without leaving Teams. Learn more about the content that you can choose from in [Where does the recommended content come from?](/dynamics365/business-central/teams-faq?tabs=tabs#where-does-the-recommended-content-come-from).

1. At the top of a channel or chat in Teams, select **+ Add a tab**.
2. In the **Search** box, type *business central*, then select the **[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]** icon and wait for the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] tab configuration window to appear.

   ![Shows the Business Central tab configuration window in Teams](media/teams-bc-tab-config-window.png)

3. The **Choose from content recommended for** option shows the company in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] that you working with. If you want to show content from another company, select the current company, then use the **Environment** and **Company** options to specify company you want to work with.
4. Select down arrow in the **Tab content** option and choose the content that you want to display.

   <!-- The list shows all pages that are bookmarked on your role center in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. To learn more about the content that you can choose from, see [Where does the recommended content come from?](teams-faq.md#recommended-content).-->
5. Some pages may include different views, which are variations of the page that's filtered to show specific data. To change the view for the content, select the down arrow for the **Preferred view** option and choose the view from the list.

   Learn more in [Save and Personalize Views](ui-views.md).
6. Select **Post to the channel about this tab** to automatically post an announcement in the Teams channel or chat to let participants know that you've added this tab.
7. Select **Save**.

## Add tab using a page link

Another way to add a tab by using a link (URL) to the page that you want to show. This way is useful when you want to display a specific [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] record or a list page that isn't bookmarked on your role center.

1. At the top of a channel or chat in Teams, select **+ Add a tab**.
2. In the **Search** box, type *business central*, then select the **[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]** icon.
3. Wait for the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] tab configuration window to appear, then select **Paste a [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] link instead** option.

   ![Shows the Business Central tab configuration window in Teams and highlights the link option](media/teams-bc-tab-config-window-page-link.png)
4. Go to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], and open the page that you want to display in the tab.
5. Copy the link to the page.

   There are two ways to copy the link. The easiest and preferred way is to select **Share** ![Share icon in Business Central](media/share-icon.png) > **Copy Link**. The other way is to copy the entire URL from the browser's address bar. Learn more in [Sharing Business Central Records and Page Links](across-working-with-teams.md).

6. Go back to Teams and paste the link in the **URL** box.
7. In the **Tab name** box, enter a name that displays on the tab.
8. Select **Post to the channel about this tab** to automatically post an announcement in the Teams channel or chat to let participants know that you've added this tab.
9. Select **Save**.

## Change a tab and its content

After a tab has been added, you can make certain changes to the tab. For example, you can rename the tab, move it, and remove it. You find these actions in the tab options that are available by selecting the down arrow on the tab.

![Shows the Business Central tab configuration window in Teams and the tab options menu](media/teams-bc-tab-config-window-options-2.png)

As for the content of a tab, you can modify the data, if you have permission. If you change the data, others won't see the changes until they leave the tab and come back. The same is true for you if someone else makes changes to data. You can't change the page that displays on the tab, so just remove the tab and add another one the suits.

You can also change your view of the page and its data, like sorting and switching the layout between list and tile views. When you make these kinds of changes, they won't affect what others see. They see what you originally posted, until they make similar changes themselves.

# Capacity Variance (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Capacity Variance** report gives an overview of the variance between expected and actual capacity costs on a monthly basis. This report helps you identify areas where costs are overrunning. You can optimize production processes, reduce costs, and improve overall performance.

:::image type="content" source="media/manufacturing/capacity-variance-v26.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Capacity Variance Power BI Report" lightbox="media/manufacturing/capacity-variance-v26.png":::

## Use the report

The report is meant for manufacturing managers and supervisors.

Manufacturing managers use the report to track and manage capacity costs for production operations. By analyzing the variance between expected and actual capacity costs on a monthly basis, you can find areas where costs are overrunning and take corrective action.

Production supervisors use this report to monitor the performance of production lines and ensure they operate within budget. By tracking the actual capacity costs against the expected costs, you can quickly uncover deviations. For example, the report might show that the cost of raw materials increased significantly. You can investigate whether the issue is due to supplier pricing or production inefficiencies.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The *Capacity Variance* report includes the following KPIs and measures:

- [Actual Capacity Cost](manufacturing-powerbi-kpis.md#actual-capacity-cost)
- [Expected Capacity Cost](manufacturing-powerbi-kpis.md#expected-capacity-cost)
- [Standard Capacity Cost](manufacturing-powerbi-kpis.md#standard-capacity-cost)
- [Expected Capacity Cost Variance](manufacturing-powerbi-kpis.md#expected-capacity-cost-variance)
- [Standard Capacity Cost Variance](manufacturing-powerbi-kpis.md#standard-capacity-cost-variance)
- [Expected Capacity Cost Dev %](manufacturing-powerbi-kpis.md#expected-capacity-cost-dev-percent)
- [Standard Capacity Cost Dev %](manufacturing-powerbi-kpis.md#standard-capacity-cost-dev-percent)
- [Prod Order Actual Capacity Need](manufacturing-powerbi-kpis.md#prod-order-actual-capacity-need)
- [Prod Order Expected Capacity Need](manufacturing-powerbi-kpis.md#prod-order-expected-capacity-need)
- [Prod Order Need Variance](manufacturing-powerbi-kpis.md#prod-order-capacity-need-variance)

# Enable Automatic Breaking Bulk with Directed Put-away and Pick

For locations that use directed put-away and pick, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can break larger units of measure into smaller units of measure when it creates warehouse instructions for source documents, production orders, or internal picks and put-aways. To breakbulk can also mean gathering items in smaller units of measure to equal the quantity of a larger unit of measure on a source document or production order.

## Breakbulk in picks  

If you want to store items in several different units of measure in a location and allow them to be automatically combined in the picking process, turn on the **Allow Breakbulk** toggle on the Location Card page. Afterward, to fulfill a task [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will look for an item in the same unit of measure. If it doesn't find one, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will suggest that you break a larger unit of measure into the unit of measure that is needed.  

If only smaller units of measure are available, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will suggest that you gather items to fulfill the quantity on the shipment or production order. In effect, it breaks the larger unit of measure on the source document into smaller units for picking.  

## Breakbulk in put-aways  

In warehouse put-aways, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] suggests Place action lines in the put-away unit of measure. For example, it might suggest pieces even though the items arrive in a different unit of measure.  

## Breakbulk in movements  

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can also breakbulk in replenishment movements if the **Allow Breakbulk** toggle on the **Calculate Bin Replenishment** page is turned on.  

You can view the results of the conversion process from one unit of measure to another as intermediate breakbulk lines in the put-away, pick, or movement instructions.  

> [!NOTE]  
> If you select the **Set Breakbulk Filter** field on the warehouse instruction header, application will hide the breakbulk lines whenever the larger unit of measure is going to be completely used. For example, if a pallet is 12 pieces and you'll use all 12 pieces, the pick will then direct you to take 1 pallet and place 12 pieces. However, if you must pick only 9 pieces the breakbulk lines aren't hidden, even if you've selected the **Breakbulk Filter** field. The lines aren't hidden because you must put the remaining three pieces somewhere in the warehouse.  

> [!NOTE]  
> If you want your units of measure to perform optimally in the warehouse, also in connection with breakbulk, you should try to:  
>
> - Set up the base unit of measure for an item as the smallest unit of measure that you expect to handle in your warehouse processes.  
> - Set up your alternative units of measure for the item as multiples of the base unit of measure.

# Set up or change the chart of accounts

The chart of accounts (COA) shows the ledger accounts that store your financial data. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes a standard COA that is ready to support your business. You can, however, change the default accounts, and you can add new accounts.
<br><br>  

> [!Video https://learn-video.azurefd.net/vod/player?id=944c65b0-9b0f-4d35-b330-de2fad57143a]

## Add or change accounts

From the COA, you can open each general ledger (G/L) account and add or change settings. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

If necessary, you can use more than one line for a general ledger account name. On the **G/L Account Card** page, in the **Account** group, choose **Extended Texts**, and then fill in one or more lines with the account name and copied text.  

For accounts of the **Total** account type, you must fill in the **Totaling** field. For **End-Total** accounts, this field is filled in automatically by the Indent function. After you set up the accounts, choose the **Process** action, then choose **Indent Chart of Accounts**.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you entered definitions in the **Totaling** fields for **End-Total** accounts before using the indent function, you must enter them again because the function overwrites the values in all **End-Total** fields.

## Delete accounts

You can delete a general ledger account. However, before you delete it, the following conditions must be true:  

* The balance on the account must be zero.  
* The **Allow G/L Acc. Deletion Before** field must be set on the **General Ledger Setup** page, and the account must not have ledger entries on or after that date.  
* If the **Check G/L Account Usage** field on the **General Ledger Setup** page is selected, the account must not be used in any posting groups or posting setup.  

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] prevents you from deleting a general ledger account that stores data that is needed in the chart of accounts.  

You can also specify when to allow people to delete accounts. On the **General Ledger Setup** page, the **Block Deletion of G/L Accounts** toggle works together with the date in the **Check G/L Acc. Deletion After** field to act as an extra validation. If you turn on the **Block Deletion of G/L Accounts** toggle, you can't delete G/L accounts with ledger entries after the date in the **Check G/L Acc. Deletion After** field. To delete such an account, someone with access to the **General Ledger Setup** page must turn off the **Block Deletion of G/L Accounts** toggle.  

Turning on the **Block Deletion of G/L Accounts** field is often a best practice, as is setting the date in the **Check G/L Acc. Deletion After** field, for example, to the date through which regulations require you to store finance data.  

### Video guidance

This video shows how to specify whether, and when, people can delete G/L accounts.

# Customize pages for profiles

Business Central provides both [personalization](ui-personalization-user.md) for users and customization for administrators. Personalization allows users to tailor their workspace by adjusting page layouts to suit their own preferences. Administrators can customize page layouts for a specific profile, based on business roles or departments, so that all assigned users see the same customized page. While personalization allows users to show, hide, and move fields and actions on a page, customization offers extra capabilities. For example, customization allows you to show fields that are in the page's source table or extension tables but aren't defined on the page object&mdash;this isn't possible personalization.  <!--For more information, see [Personalize Your Workspace](ui-personalization-user.md).-->

<!--Similarly, administrators can customize pages for a profile, according to the related business role or department, so that all users assigned the profile see the customized page layout. As an administrator, you customize pages by using the same functionality as users do when they personalize pages, except with few extra capabilities. Like personalization, you can show, hide, and move fields, actions, or parts on a page. But while personalization only allows you to work with fields that are defined on the page object, customization allows you add fields that are in the source table or table extension, but not defined on the page object. -->

> [!NOTE]
> The typical business use of a profile is a role. A profile is therefore named *Profile (Role)* in the UI.

Page customization starts from the **Profiles (Roles)** page, the administrator's starting point for managing users' profiles on individual profile cards. In addition to customizing the page layout, you control various other settings for profiles on the **Profile (Role)** page for each profile. For more information, see [Manage Profiles](admin-users-profiles-roles.md).

## Prerequisites

- Your Business Central account must have the **D365 Profile Mgt.** permission set or equivalent permissions. 

   The **D365 Profile Mgt.** permission set includes the execute permission on the system object **9026 Add Field to Table**. If you don't have this permission, you're not allowed to add fields on the page unless they're defined on the page object. 

## Customize pages for a profile

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Profiles (Roles)**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the line for the profile that you want to customize pages for, and then choose the **Edit** action.
3. Choose the **Customize pages** action.

    [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] opens on a new browser tab for the selected profile with the **Customizing** banner activated. The **Customizing** banner offers the same functionality as the **Personalizing** banner that is available to users.

4. Customize pages according to the needs of the role or department in question in the same way as a user would do when personalizing. For more information, see [Personalize Your Workspace](ui-personalization-user.md).

    > [!NOTE]
    > To navigate during personalization, use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Click</kbd> on an action if it is highlighted by the arrowhead.

5. When you have finished changing the layout on one or more pages, choose the **Done** button on the **Customizing** banner.
6. Close the browser tab.

The customization of pages is now recorded for the profile.

## View all customized pages for a profile

You can get an overview of which pages are customized for a profile, for example to plan which pages to customize further or delete.

- On the **Profile (Role)** page, choose the **Manage customized pages** action.

On the **Customized Pages** page, you can delete customizations, and you can troubleshoot by scanning for potential issues.  

## Delete all customizations for a profile

You can cancel all customizations that you have made for a profile. Customizations introduced with an extension and personalizations made by a user aren't deleted. You can delete all personalizations with another action. For more information, see [To delete all personalizations made by a user](admin-users-profiles-roles.md#delete-all-personalizations-made-by-a-specific-user).

- On the **Profile (Role)** page for a customized profile, choose the **Clear customized pages** action.

The layout on pages for the profile is reset to the default layout.  

## Delete customization for specific pages for a profile

You can delete individual page customizations that you have made for a profile. Customizations introduced with an extension and personalizations made by a user aren't deleted. You can delete specific page personalizations with another action. For more information, see [To delete personalizations for specific pages](admin-users-profiles-roles.md#delete-personalizations-for-specific-pages).

1. On the **Profile (Role)** page, choose the **Manage customized pages** action.
2. On the **Customized Pages** page, select one or more lines for page customizations that you want to delete, and then choose the **Delete** action.

The layout on the selected pages is adjusted to the changes you made.

## Add a field

You add fields to the page from the **Add field to page** pane, which you open by selecting the **+ Field** action when in the customization mode. It's important to understand that the **Add field to page**  pane is used to show fields that already exist&mdash;either on the page and its source tables,&mdash;but are currently hidden from view. You can't create new fields.

The **Add field to page** pane presents all fields that can be shown on the page. Fields are divided into the following categories, as determined by the underlying design of the page itself, its source table, and extensions:

|Category|Description|
|-|-|
|Table fields not on the page object|Includes fields that are defined in the base table or extension tables, but aren't defined on the page. The tooltip for these fields includes the label **Defined by the table**.<br><br>|
|Page fields bound to a table|Includes fields that are defined in the base table or table extensions and are also defined on the page as either shown or hidden. The tooltip for these fields includes the label **Defined by the page**.|
|Page fields that aren't bound to a table| Fields that are only defined on the page, not in the base table or extension tables. These fields typically used for variable or calculation. The tooltip for these fields includes the label **Defined by the page**.|

<!--
- Table fields not on the page object. Includes fields that are defined in the base table or extension tables, but aren't defined on the page, either as shown or hidden.   
- Page fields bound to a table. Includes fields that are defined in the base table or table extensions and are also defined on the page as either shown or hidden. 
 - Page fields that are not bound to a table. Fields that are Includes fields that are only defined on the page, not in base table or extension table. These fields typically used for variable or calculation. -->

Use the filter button above the list to change what category of fields are presented the **Add field to page** pane.  

:::image type="content" source="media/customization-filter.svg" alt-text="Shows the filter button in the Add a field pane in the customization mode.":::
 
### Add table field that's not on the page object

If you want to make a table-only field available on a page to users, you must first add it to the page. Once you've added the field, users can choose to show or hide the field by using personalization. There are couple ways to add a field.

- One way is to drag it from  **Add field to page** pane to the desired position.
- Another way is to select the field in the pane to display the recommended location on the page. Then go to the field location on the pages, select the arrowhead, then select **Add**. 

Once the field has been added, the tooltip for the field in the  **Add field to page** pane switches to **Defined by the page**.

> [!NOTE]
> The added field is locked from editing and can't be unlocked.

## Remove a field

If you've added a table field that originally wasn't on the page object, you can remove it again. Removing a field is different that hiding it. When you hide a field, users can still show it on their workspace through personalization. However, if you remove a field, the field is no longer available for users to show, or hide for that matter. If the field is currently displayed on a user's workspace, it disappears from their workspace when you remove it. 

To remove a field, select the arrowhead on the field in the page and then **Remove**. If you can't find the field, select it in the **Add field to page** pane to indicate its hidden location. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Removing a field doesn't delete data that's stored in the field or it's source tables. It just removes the field from view. 

## Lock and unlock editing

Customization allows you to lock (allow editing) or unlock editing (prevent editing) of most fields on a page. To lock or unlock editing, select the field on the page, select the arrowhead, and then select **Lock editing** or **Unlock editing**. It's important to keep in mind a few rules about locking and unlocking fields:

- Field's that were originally not on the page object but were added to the page by customization are always locked, and can't be unlocked using customization or personalization.
- The design of the field can also prevent it from being edited. If the AL developer set the field's [Editable property](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/properties/devenv-editable-property) to `false`, it's always locked and can't be unlocked.
- It's important to note that the lock editing feature is intended to aid in the accuracy, consistency, and reliability of data. It's not intended to secure data integrity.


<!--However, whatever option you choose for a field, users can always change the setting on their own workspace using personalization. For this reason, it's important to consider locking as a deterrence measure and not a preventative measure.--> 
## Important information and tips

- Not all table fields may be available for customization from the **Add field to page** pane. The developer of a table can choose to prevent a field from appearing in customization by setting the field's [AllowInCustomization property](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/properties/devenv-allowincustomizations-property) to `Never`.
- You can't customize a page that's in [analysis mode](analysis-mode.md). The **Analyze** switch is deactivated. If you switch to customization mode while the page is in analysis mode, then analyze mode is automatically switched off. 
- Some pages have multiple page fields that map to the same source table. The **Add field to page** pane shows all of these page fields independently. You can show, hide, or move these fields independently without affecting the others.
- If a part or group is hidden, you can still identify hidden fields inside the part or group, but you can't add, move or show fields in the part or group until they're made visible.

# Handling Lot Sizes in Production
In terms of quantity, the number of items you produce in a production operation might not correlate to how sell them. For example, you might produce hundreds of items in a single lot, but sell each item individually. When you configure your production routes and bills of materials (BOMs), there are few nuances you should consider with regards to lot sizes. This topic describes how lot sizes impact cost calculations and resource planning.

## Units of Measure in Production Bill of Materials
Although you specify the base unit of measure (UOM) for an item, your BOM might use a different UOM for the finished product. For example, the base UOM for an item might be PCS, but your BOM might call for pallet or ton. This comes in handy when your machines or raw components dictate the volume. For example, you probably wouldn't want to bake a single muffin because it is difficult to use a portion of an egg. Instead, you bake a batch of muffins to reduce waste. For more information, see [Create Production BOMs](production-how-to-create-production-boms.md).

## Lot size on routing lines
From a routing perspective, you can specify a lot size on routing lines to align with the capacity of the machines that produce the items. The run time on routing lines is reduced proportionally to the lot size. 

This works well when the quantity on a production order is a factor of the lot size on the route. For example, if your baking sheet can hold 10 muffins, you should bake 10, 20, 30, and so on, and not 5 nor 15.  This is much less of an issue if you are dealing with large quantities.

Lot size is also popular in manufacturing environments where output is measured as quantity you can make during fixed amount of time. Example, if Volume per 9 hour shift is 25000 cubic feet, you can set run time as 9 hours and lot size as 25000.
The production order quantity becomes less important as on the production order the run time gets calculated as the Run time / Lot size to get the run time per piece.
 
> [!NOTE]
> The value defined in Lot size doesn't have impact on time specified in **Setup Time** field of the routing line. The setup will happen only one time, even if there are several lots. For example, so that you don’t need to warm the oven for the second lot of muffins. For more information, see [Create Routings](production-how-to-create-routings.md).

## Lot Sizes for Items and Stockkeeping Units
Lot sizes defined for routings are not the same as lot sizes for items or stockkeeping units. Those values are used for a different purpose, and do not affect production capacity. 

## Lot size on item and stockkeeping units
For items and stockkeeping units, lot sizes have the following effects on cost calculation and supply planning:

* For standard cost calculation, if you enable **Cost Incl Setup** on the **Manufacturing Setup** page, the cost for the setup is added to the standard cost. If you specify a lot size, the setup cost for routing operation will be reduced according to one lot size. For example, if your lot size defined on item card is 10, and it takes 15 minutes to heat the oven, the cost of the fuel will be allocated to the 10 muffins as roughly 1.5 minutes. 

> [!NOTE]
> Setup costs are handled differently from a standard cost and capacity allocation perspectives. If produced quantity doesn't match lot size defined in the item card that will lead to variation. For more information, see [Managing Inventory Costs](finance-manage-inventory-costs.md). <!--not sure that I got this part right seems to repeat the first example.-->

For supply planning, the lot size setting on items works with the **Default Dampener %** on the **Manufacturing Setup** page. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will ignore changes in demand that are below the dampener percentage and will not create planning suggestions. For example, 15 is specified in the Default Dampener % field, and we have a production order for 20 muffins to feed 20 guests, but one guest cannot attend. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will ignore the single missing guest because it's only 10% of the lot size 10 defined on the item. However, if two guests cannot make it, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will suggest that we reduce the order quantity because two is 20% of the lot size. For more information about planning, see [Planning](production-planning.md).

# Sales by Customer (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Sales by Customer** report gives a clear picture of your organization's customers and their sales activities. It highlights key metrics for each customer, such as sales amount and quantities along with the costs associated. You can break down the metrics by the specific items that are sold per customer to identify key trends.

:::image type="content" source="media/powerbi/sales/sales-by-customer.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Sales by Customer Power BI report" lightbox="media/powerbi/sales/sales-by-customer.png":::

## Use the report

This report is meant for all users to identify key customers and other customers that buy less than expected.

A COO can quickly identify a list of the top customers generating revenue for the company. You can easily identify which customers are generating the most revenue and how much each customer is contributing to your company's overall revenue. This information helps you make informed decisions and can provide valuable insights to the CFO regarding where the revenue is coming from.

A business development manager can quickly identify how you're attracting new customers to purchase from your organization. You can break down the metrics to find out how salespeople are performing. This information can then translate into what a sales manager would want to see, and enable them to track how sales are going for different salespeople.

For salespeople, the report you help can tailor your onsite visits to your customers based on their recent purchases. This report can also show you insights into specific period trends for this customer, and identify opportunities to up-sell or cross-sell.

## Key performance indicators

The report includes the following key performance indicators (KPIs) and measures:

- [**Sales Amount**](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#sales-amount)
- [**Sales Quantity**](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#sales-quantity)
- [**Cost Amount**](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#cost-amount)
- [**Cost Amount Non-Inv**](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#cost-amount-non-inv)
- [**Gross Profit**](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#gross-profit)
- [**Gross Profit Margin**](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#gross-profit-margin)

[!INCLUDE[click-on-a-kpi-link](includes/click-on-a-kpi-link.md)] 

[!INCLUDE[powerbi-tip-track-kpis](includes/powerbi-tip-track-kpis.md)]

## Data used in the report

The report uses data from the following tables in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]:

- Customer
- Item
- Value Entry
- Sales Line

# Changing Company and Other Settings in Teams

[!INCLUDE [online_only](includes/online_only.md)]

The [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams includes a **Settings** page that lets you view and change information about your connection to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For example, you switch the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] environment and company you're connected to. You can also see which account you're using to access [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], and sign out and in again as needed.

There are two ways to open the **Settings** page: 1) from the message compose box or 2) from the command box.

1. Next to the message compose box, select **+**, right-click the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app icon, then select **Settings**.

# Use job queues to schedule tasks

Use the **Job Queue Entries** page to schedule and run specific reports and codeunits. You can set jobs to run one time, or on a recurring basis. For example, you might want to run the **Salesperson * Sales Statistics** report weekly to track sales by salesperson each week, or run the **Delegate Approval Requests** codeunit daily to prevent documents from piling up.

The **Job Queue Entries** page lists all existing jobs. If you add a job queue entry that runs on a schedule, you must provide some information. For example:

* The type of object to run, such as a report or codeunit. You must have permission to run the report or codeunit.
* The name and object ID of the object.
* Parameters to specify the behavior of the job queue entry. For example, you can add a parameter to only send posted sales orders.
* The schedule for when, and how often, the job queue entry runs.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> If you're assigned the SUPER permissions set that comes with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you have permission to run all objects included in your license. If you have the Delegated Admin role, you can create and schedule job queue entries, but only administrators and licensed users can run them.

After a job finishes successfully, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] removes it from the list of job queue entries, unless it's a recurring job. For recurring jobs, the **Earliest Start Time** field is adjusted to show the next time that the job will run.

## Examples of what you can schedule using job queue entries

### Schedule reports

You can schedule a report or batch job to run at a specific date and time. Scheduled reports and batch jobs are entered in the job queue and processed at the scheduled time, similar to other jobs. You choose the **Schedule** option after you choose the **Send to** action, and then you enter information such as printer, time, date, and recurrence.  

To learn more about scheduling, go to [Scheduling a Report to Run](ui-work-report.md#ScheduleReport)

### Schedule synchronization between [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)]

If you integrate [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)], the job queue lets you schedule when to synchronize data. Depending on the direction and rules you define, the job queue entry can create records in one app to match records in the other. A good example is when you register a contact in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)], the job queue entry can set up that contact for you in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. To learn more about scheduling, go to [Scheduling a Synchronization between Business Central and Dynamics 365 Sales](admin-scheduled-synchronization-using-the-synchronization-job-queue-entries.md).

### Schedule when to post sales and purchase orders

You can use job queue entries to schedule business processes to run in the background. For example, background tasks are useful when multiple users post sales orders at the same time, but only one order can be processed at a time. To learn more about background posting, go to [To set up background posting with job queues](ui-batch-posting.md#to-set-up-background-posting-with-job-queues).

## Important for scheduling recurring jobs

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Recurring job queues can affect performance, so you shouldn't run them too frequently. When you set up how often to run a recurring job, try to set the largest time interval you can. For example, if you're about to set a recurrence of five minutes, consider whether it can be 15 minutes, or even once per hour instead. When planning for recurring job queues, consider which areas of the application the job will affect. Is it an area where many users work and will be impacted by heavy activity? Consider the length of a single job run and the business motivations for running jobs with a given cadence.

## The earliest start date

The value in the **Earliest Start Date/Time** field on the **Job Queue Entry Card** page shows the next time the job will run. There are several factors that can affect whether a job queue entry actually runs at that time.

The most common factors are the number of job queue entries in an environment, and the overall number of scheduled tasks. To protect performance levels, there are operational limits. If you have many entries and, for example, one of them fails or takes longer than expected, the next job might not start at the expected time. If you have codeunits that are generating 100,000 or more scheduled tasks, you should investigate whether you actually need all of those tasks. You can access the list of all scheduled tasks on the **Scheduled Tasks** page.

To learn more about monitoring the status of job queue entries, go to [To view status for any job](#to-view-status-for-any-job). To learn more about operational limits, go to [Asynchronous task limits](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/operational-limits-online#Task).

## Monitor status or errors in the job queue

Data that the job queue generates is stored, so that you can troubleshoot errors.  

For each job queue entry, you can view and change the status. When you create a job queue entry, its status is set to **On Hold**. You can set the status to **Ready** and back to **On Hold**, for example. Otherwise, status information is updated automatically.

The following table describes the values of the **Status** field.

| Status | Description |
|--|--|
| Ready | The job queue entry is ready to be run. |
| In Process | The job queue entry is in process. This field updates while the job queue is running. |
| On Hold | The default status of the job queue entry when you create it. Choose the **Set Status to Ready** action to change the status to **Ready**. Choose the **Set On Hold** action to revert the status to **On Hold**. To learn more, go to [About On Hold](#about-on-hold).|
| On Hold Due to Inactivity | Used primarily for job queue entries that schedule synchronization between [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and another application, such as [!INCLUDE [cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)]. To learn more about this status, go to [About inactivity timeouts](/dynamics365/business-central/admin-scheduled-synchronization-using-the-synchronization-job-queue-entries#about-inactivity-timeouts). |
|Waiting | Only relevant for job queue entries that are assigned a category code. Indicates that the job is scheduled, but the underlying scheduled task isn't active. After the job queue entry that's currently running and is in the same category finishes, the status of the next job in the category with the status Waiting becomes Ready. |
| Error | Something went wrong. Choose **Show Error** to show the error message. |
| Finished | The job queue entry is complete. |

### About On Hold

Setting a job queue entry to **On Hold** doesn't affect a job that's already running. After a job starts, it continues to run until completion, regardless of any subsequent changes made to the job queue entry, such as putting it on hold.<br><br>The **On Hold** status is typically used to prevent a job from automatically starting when it reaches its scheduled start time. It allows you to temporarily pause a job before it begins processing. <br><br>If you need to stop or cancel a running job, you can manually intervene in the process. For example, you can stop the corresponding session or process.

### To view status for any job

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Job Queue Entries**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Job Queue Entries** page, select a job queue entry, and then choose the **Log Entries** action.  

> [!TIP]
> For in-depth analysis based on telemetry, you can use Application Insights in Microsoft Azure to review the status of job queue entries. To learn more about telemetry, go to [Monitoring and Analyzing Telemetry](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/telemetry-overview) and [Analyzing Job Queue Lifecycle Trace Telemetry](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/telemetry-job-queue-lifecycle-trace).

## View scheduled tasks

The **Scheduled Tasks** page in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] shows which tasks are ready to run in the job queue. The page also shows information about the company that each task is set up to run in. However, only tasks that are marked as belonging to the current environment can run.  

For example, all scheduled tasks stop if the company is in an environment that's a copy of another environment. Use the **Scheduled Tasks** page to set tasks as ready to run in the job queue.  

> [!NOTE]
> Internal administrators and licensed users can schedule tasks to run. Delegated administrators can set up and schedule tasks to run, but only licensed users can run them.

## The My Job Queue part

The **My Job Queue** part on your home page shows the job queues entries that you started but aren't finished. By default the part isn't displayed, but you can add it to your home page. To learn more about personalization, go to [Personalize Your Workspace](ui-personalization-user.md).  

The part shows the following information:

* Which documents with your ID in the **User ID** field are being processed or are queued, including documents that are posting in the background.
* Whether there was an error when posting a document or in the job queue entry.

The My Job Queue part also lets you cancel a document posting.

> [!TIP]
> Another useful feature is the **Job Queue Tasks** cue on your home page. The cue makes it easy to monitor job queue entries based on their status. To learn more, go to [The Job Queue Tasks cue](#the-job-queue-tasks-cue).

### To view an error from the My Job Queue part

1. On an entry with the status **Error**, choose the **Show Error** action.
2. Review the error message and fix the problem.

## The Job Queue Tasks cue

The **Job Queue Tasks** cue on your home page makes it easy to keep an eye on your job queue entries. The cue shows tiles for three statuses:

* Tasks Failed: These tasks need attention. Tasks display in this tile after they exceed the maximum number of attempts to run that you specified for the job queue entry. To learn more, go to [Handle job queue entry issues](#handle-job-queue-entry-issues).
* Tasks in Process: These tasks are running.
* Tasks in Queue: These tasks are waiting their turn.

You can configure the **Job Queue Tasks** cue to use color indicators, so it's easy to know when job queue entries need attention. To learn more about color indicators for cues, go to [Set Up a Colored Indicator on Cues for the Company or Individual Users](admin-how-set-up-colored-indicator-on-cues.md).

## Handle job queue entry issues

Job queue entries stop running when there's an error. For example, this can be a problem when an entry connects to an external service, such as a bank feed. If the service is temporarily not available and the job queue entry can't connect, the entry will show an error and stop running. You'll have to manually restart the job queue entry. However, the **Maximum No. of Attempts** and **Rerun Delay (sec.)** fields can help you avoid this situation. The **Maximum No. of Attempts** field lets you specify how many times the job queue entry can fail before it stops trying to run. The **Rerun Delay (sec.)** field lets you specify the amount of time, in seconds, between attempts. The combination of these two fields might keep the job queue entry running until the external service becomes available.

If a job queue entry shows an error, your first option to resolve the issue is to restart the job queue entry. You can set the status of the job queue entry to **On Hold** and then to **Ready**, or just restart it.

If a restart doesn't help, the issue might be in the code. You can find the owner (also called the *publisher*) of the code in the AL stack trace in the Job Queue log. If the error comes from an app/extension, contact your Microsoft partner. If the error comes from a Microsoft application, open a support request with Microsoft.

If you contact your Microsoft partner or Microsoft for support, provide the following information:

* The ID of the job queue entry runs where the error occurred
* The timestamp of when the error occurred
* Your timezone

> [!TIP]
> Depending on whether your [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is earlier or later than version 22.1, gather the information in the following ways:
>
> * For earlier versions, provide a screenshot of the **Job Queue Log Entries** page.
> * For later versions, use the **Copy details** action on the Job Queue Log Entries page to copy the information (job queue ID, timestamp, and your timezone).

### Get notified when a job queue entry fails

If something goes wrong and a job queue entry fails, or isn't scheduled for some reason, you might want to be notified so you can react quickly. You can set up notifications to alert you, your job queue administrator, or both. The notification lets you:

* Restart the job queue entry, which is typically the first thing to try.
* Go directly to details about the failure.

To set up notifications for job queue entry failures, start the **Set Up Job Queue Notifications** assisted setup guide from the **Assisted Setup** page. Use the guide to enter the following settings:

* Who to notify about a failure. You can notify the person who started the job queue entry, or job queue entry administrators, or both.
* How you want to be notified. You can turn on in-product notifications that show at the top of your home page.

   :::image type="content" source="media/in product notification example.png" alt-text="Shows a notification at the top of a home page.":::

   Or, use [external business events](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/business-events-overview#query-business-central-catalog-of-business-events-in-dataverse) to start a Power Automate flow. You can specify when, how, and who to notify for the flow. Your Power Automate flow must subscribe to the **Job queue task failed** event. To make it easier to create a flow that uses external business events, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides the [Notify in Outlook when Job Queue in Business Central fails](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2288541) Power Platform template. An assisted setup guide helps you get set up in just a few steps. To learn more about Power Automate flows, go to [Use Power Automate flows in Business Central](/dynamics365/business-central/across-how-use-financials-data-source-flow).
* When you want to be notified. You can choose to be notified immediately, or specify thresholds to be notified only after a number of job queue entries fail.

After you set up notifications, you can always turn them on or off. On the **My Notifications** page, for the **Job Queue Failed Notification**, select or clear the **Enabled** checkbox.

## Monitor the job queue with telemetry

Administrators can use [Azure Application Insights](/azure/azure-monitor/app/app-insights-overview) to gather and analyze telemetry that helps identify problems. To learn more about telemetry, go to [Monitoring and Analyzing Telemetry](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/telemetry-overview) and [Analyzing Job Queue Lifecycle Trace Telemetry](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/telemetry-job-queue-lifecycle-trace).

Telemetry lets administrators set up alerts on job queue issues that send a text message, email, or a message in Teams if something isn't right. To learn more about these alerts, go to [Alert on Telemetry](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/telemetry-alert).

# Manage inventory

For each physical product you trade in, you must create an item card of the **Inventory** type. Items you offer to customers but don't keep in inventory you can register as catalog items, which you can convert to inventory items when necessary. You can increase or decrease the quantity of an item in inventory by posting directly to the item ledger entries, such as after a physical count or if you don't record purchases.

Inventory increases and decreases are naturally also recorded when you post purchase and sales documents, respectively. To learn more, go to [Record Purchases](purchasing-how-record-purchases.md), [Sell Products](sales-how-sell-products.md), and [Invoice Sales](sales-how-invoice-sales.md). Transfers between locations change inventory quantities across your company's warehouses.

To enhance your overview of items and to help you find them, you can categorize items and give them attributes to search and sort by.

> [!NOTE]
> The physical handling of items is referred to as warehouse activities. Learn more at [Warehouse Management Overview](design-details-warehouse-management.md).

Planning for items to fulfill demand is covered as part of supply planning functionality. Learn more at [Planning](production-planning.md).

| Explore built-in inventory reports. | [Built-in inventory and warehouse reports](inventory-WMS-reports.md) |

## Inventory reconciliation

When you post inventory transactions, such as sales shipments, purchase invoices, or inventory adjustments, the changed item costs are recorded in item value entries. To reflect this change in inventory value in your financial books, the inventory costs are automatically posted to the related inventory accounts in the general ledger. For each inventory transaction you post, the appropriate values are posted to the inventory account, adjustment account, and COGS account in the general ledger. To learn more, go to [Reconcile Inventory Costs with the General Ledger](finance-how-to-post-inventory-costs-to-the-general-ledger.md).

Even though inventory costs are automatically posted to the general ledger, it's still necessary to ensure that the costs of goods are forwarded to the related outbound sales transaction, especially in situations where you sell goods before you invoice the purchase of those goods. This is referred to as cost adjustment. Item costs are automatically adjusted when you post item transactions, but you can also adjust item costs manually. To learn more, go to [Adjust Item Costs](inventory-how-adjust-item-costs.md).

# Set up approval users

Before you can create workflows that involve approval steps, you must set up the users who are involved in approval processes on the **Approval User Setup** page. You can also set amount limits for different types of requests, define substitute approvers, and set up notifications.  

After you set up approval users, you can create workflow responses for approval workflows. Learn more at [Create Approval Workflows](across-how-to-create-workflows.md).  

> [!TIP]
> You can require that multiple approvers react to an approval request by creating a group of approvers on the **Workflow User Group** page. Learn more at [Set Up Workflow User Groups](across-how-to-set-up-workflow-users.md).  

## To set up an approval user

[!INCLUDE [workflow-requestor-approver](includes/workflow-requestor-approver.md)]

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Approval User Setup**, then choose the related link.  
2. Create a new line on the **Approval User Setup** page, and then fill the fields as described in the following table.  

   |Field|Description|
   |-----|-----------|
   |**User ID**|Select the user ID of the person involved in the approval process.|
   |**Salespers./Purch. Code**|Specify the salesperson or purchaser code that applies to the user.<br /><br /> You typically fill in the **Salespers./Purch. Code** field if the salesperson or purchaser responsible for the customer or vendor is also the person who must approve a sales or purchase request.|
   |**Approver ID**|Select the user ID of the person who must approve requests made by the person you specified in the **User ID** field.|
   |**Sales Amount Approval Limit**|Specify the maximum sales amount in local currency (LCY) that the person selected in the **User ID** field can approve.|
   |**Unlimited Sales Approval**|Specify that the person identified in the **User ID** field can approve all sales requests regardless of the amount.<br /><br /> If you select this checkbox, you can't fill in the **Sales Amount Approval Limit** field.|
   |**Purchase Amount Approval Limit**|Specify the maximum purchase amount in LCY that the person identified in the **User ID** field can approve.|
   |**Unlimited Purchase Approval**|Specify that the person identified in the **User ID** field can approve all purchase requests regardless of the amount.<br /><br /> If you select this checkbox, you can't fill in the **Purchase Amount Approval Limit** field.|
   |**Request Amount Approval Limit**|Specify the maximum amount in LCY that the person identified in the **User ID** field can approve for purchase quotes.<br /><br /> To use this field, you must select the **Approver Chain** option in the **Approver Limit Type** field on the **Workflow Response** page.|
   |**Unlimited Request Approval**|Specify that the person identified in the **User ID** field can approve all purchase quotes regardless of the amount.<br /><br /> If you select this checkbox, you can't fill in the **Request Amount Approval Limit** field.|
   |**Substitute**|Select the user ID of the person who will approve requests made by the person identified in the **User ID** field if the user in the **Approver ID** isn't available. <br /><br />**Note:**  The substitute can either be the user in the **Substitute** field, the direct approver, or the approval administrator, in that order of priority. Learn more at [Use Approval Workflows](across-how-use-approval-workflows.md).|
   |**Email**|Specify the email address of the person in the **User ID** field.|
   |**Approval Administrator**|Specify the user who has permission to unblock approval workflow, such as by delegating approval requests to new substitute approvers or deleting overdue approval requests.<br /><br />**Note** Only one person can be the approval administrator.|

3. To test the approval user setup, choose the **Approval User Setup Test** action.  
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for every person you want to set up as an approval user.  

The next step is to specify how you want [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to notify people that a request is pending their attention. Learn more at [Setting Up Workflow Notifications](across-setting-up-workflow-notifications.md).

# Configure Copilot and agent capabilities

This article explains how to control Microsoft Copilot and agent capabilities in Dynamics 365 Business Central. An administrator must complete these tasks.

Copilot is a system feature and an integral part of Business Central. Like most system features, you can't turn Copilot on or off. However, Business Central provides extensive transparency and control for administrators, including:

- Understand which Copilot and agent capabilities are available to your environment.
- Deactivate individual capabilities.
- Grant or deny access to individual users for each capability.
- Data governance controls.

There are different levels of access control for agent capabilities, depending on the feature:

- Allow data movement across geographical regions.

    This task is required only if your Business Central environment is in a different geography than the Azure OpenAI Service it uses. [Learn more about this task](#allow-data-movement-across-geographies).

- Activate the feature on the **Copilot & agent capabilities** page. [Learn more about this task](#activate-features).

If any of these requirements aren't met, the feature isn't available for use.

> [!NOTE]
> By default, starting with update 25.0, data movement across geographies is enabled, and all features are activated. This setup means Copilot is ready to use without any configuration unless you choose to deactivate specific features.

## Prerequisites

- You use Business Central online.
- You're an [administrator](#requirements-for-being-an-administrator) in Business Central.

## Allow data movement across geographies

This section applies only if the **Allow data movement** toggle switch appears near the top of the **Copilot & agent capabilities** page. If the **How do I govern my copilot data?** link appears instead of the **Allow data movement** option, skip this task.

![Screenshot that shows the Allow data movement option on the Copilot & agent capabilities page.](media/allow-data-movement-v3.png "Screenshot that shows the Allow data movement option on the Copilot & agent capabilities page.")

The presence of the **Allow data movement** toggle indicates that the location of your Business Central environment (where data is processed and stored) differs from the Azure OpenAI Service geography that Copilot uses. To enable Copilot, you must allow data movement between geographies. Learn more in [Copilot data movement across geographies](ai-copilot-data-movement.md).

You can choose to disallow data movement, which deactivates Copilot and all features. To allow or disallow data movement across geographies:

1. In Business Central, search for and open the **Copilot & agent capabilities** page.
1. Switch the **Allow data movement** toggle on or off as desired.

After an Azure OpenAI Service becomes available in the geography of your Business Central environment, your environment is automatically connected to it. At that point, the **Allow data movement** toggle no longer appears on the **Copilot & agent capabilities** page.

## Activate features

Copilot and agent capabilities are active by default when they're made available in preview or become generally available. On the **Copilot & agent capabilities** page, you can turn individual features off or on again for all users.

1. In Business Central, search for and open the **Copilot & agent capabilities** page.
1. The page lists all available Copilot and AI-related features and their status (*Active* or *Inactive*). The features are divided into two sections: preview and generally available.

    - To turn on a feature, select it in the list, and then select **Activate**.
    - To turn off a feature, select it in the list, and then select **Deactivate**.

    [![Screenshot that shows the Activate and Deactivate buttons for the feature lists on the Copilot & agent capabilities page.](media/copilot-agent-capabilities-page.svg)](media/copilot-agent-capabilities-page.svg#lightbox "Screenshot that shows the Activate and Deactivate buttons for the feature lists on the Copilot & agent capabilities page.")

## Granting user access

Copilot and agent capabilities can offer functionality that is intended for any users across your organization or for specific user roles. Most Copilot and agent capabilities offer access control through permissions and permission sets in Business Central's permission management system. Learn more about permissions and permission sets in [Assign permissions to users and groups](ui-define-granular-permissions.md).

The following table lists the permissions that are required to use the Copilot features that Business Central provides.

| Copilot feature | Required permissions |
|---|---|
| Analysis assist | **DATA ANALYSIS - EXEC** permission set or execute permission on system object 9640 **Allow Data Analysis mode**. These permissions are the same ones that are required to access the analysis mode. |
| Autofill | **Copilot Sys Features** permission set or execute permission on system object 9700 **Allow Copilot Autofill**. |
| Bank reconciliation assist | Permission on page 7250 **Bank Acc. Rec. AI Proposal** and page 7252 **Trans. To GL Acc. AI Proposal**. |
| Chat |**Copilot Sys Features** permission set or execute permission on system object 9690 **Allow Copilot Chat**. |
| Suggest substitute items| Permission on page 7410 **Item Subst. Suggestion** and page 7411 **Item Subst. Suggestion Sub**.|
| Summarize |**Copilot Sys Features** permission set or execute permission on system object 9680 **Allow Copilot Summary**. |
| Map e-documents | Permission on page 6166 **E-Doc. PO Copilot Prop**. |
| Marketing text suggestions | Permission on page 5836 **Copilot Marketing Text**. |
| Sales line suggestions | Permission on page 7275 **Sales Line AI Suggestions** and page 7276 **Sales Line AI Suggestions Sub**. |
|Sales Order Agent|Learn more in [Manage agent permissions and user access](sales-order-agent-setup.md#manage-agent-permissions-to-objects-data-and-ui-elements).|

To grant or deny access to specific non-Microsoft Copilot and agent capabilities, consult the feature's documentation or publisher for the required permissions.

## Requirements for being an administrator

You need SUPER permission in your Business Central user account or one of the following Business Central licenses:

- Delegated Admin agent - Partner
- Delegated Helpdesk agent - Partner
- Internal Admin
- Internal BC Administrator
- Dynamics 365 Administrator

Business Central doesn't yet offer granular, object-level permissions so that only specific administrators can configure Copilot.

## Next steps

For the sales order agent, there are a few more steps you must complete before the agent is ready for use. Learn more in [Set up Sales Order Agent](sales-order-agent-setup.md#configure-and-activate-sales-order-agent).

# Make check payments

You can issue electronic and manual checks in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Both methods use the payment journal to issue checks to vendors. You can also void checks and view check ledger entries.

The following procedure shows how to pay a vendor with a computer checks by:

- Applying the payment to the relevant vendor invoice.
- Printing the check.
- Posting the payment as paid.

These steps result in positive vendor ledger entries that are applied to negative bank ledger entries, and physical checks for processing in the bank.

You can pay with two types of checks. For both types, the **Bal. Account Type** or the **Account Type** field must contain **Bank Account**.

- **Computer Check**: Select this option if you want to print a check for the amount on the payment journal line. You must print the checks before you can post the journal lines.
- **Manual Check**: Select this option if you have created a check manually and want to create a corresponding check ledger entry for this amount. By using this option, you can't print the check.

> [!NOTE]  
> To make sure that your bank only clears validated checks and amounts, you can send them a file that contains vendor, check, and payment information. To learn more, go to [Export a Positive Pay file](finance-how-positive-pay.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Your printer must be correctly set up with the check forms, and you must define which check layout to use. To learn more, go to [Select a Check Layout](finance-how-define-check-layouts.md). Alternatively, you can send the check as a PDF file, for example.  

You can print up to 10 invoices on a page for a check stub. If a check applies to more than 10 invoices, when you print the stub we void the check on the first page and print the word VOID on the check. We then print the remainder of the invoices and the total check amount on the second page.

## To pay a vendor invoice with a check

The following describes how to pay a vendor by check. The steps are similar to refund a customer by check.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Payment Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. Fill in the payment journal lines. To learn more, go to [Record Payments and Refunds](payables-how-post-payments-refunds.md).
3. In the **Payment Method Code** field, select **Check**.
4. Choose the **Print Check** action.
5. On the **Check** page, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
6. If your printer is set up to print checks, choose the **Print** button. Otherwise, choose the **Send to** button, select the **PDF Document** option, choose the **OK** button, and then print the PDF document.

    You can now send the physical checks to the vendors.
7. Choose the **Post** action.

    The payment is applied to the vendor and paid. Fully applied vendor ledger entries and bank ledger entries are created.

> [!NOTE]  
> If you want to print and pay checks in more than one currency from different bank accounts, you must run the **Print Check** batch job separately for each currency and specify the appropriate bank account.

## To cancel printed checks that aren't posted

You can cancel non-posted checks after they have been printed by using the **Void Check** action on the **Payment Journal** page.

1. On the **Payment Journal** page, choose the **Void Check**, and then choose which checks to cancel.

## To void checks

After you post a check payment, you can only cancel (void) a check from the resulting bank ledger entries.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If the check is applied to an invoice, unapply the payment first so that the invoice can be repaid. To learn more, go to [To unapply an application of vendor entries](payables-how-apply-purchase-transactions-manually.md#to-unapply-an-application-of-vendor-entries). The steps are the same for customers. After you unapply the payment, void the check. If the check was printed but didn't pay an invoice, then choose **Void Check Only** as described in this section.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Bank Accounts**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the relevant bank account, and then choose the **Check Ledger Entries** action.
3. On the **Check Ledger Entries** page, choose the **Void Check** action.
4. Select the **Void Check Only** checkbox.
5. Choose the **OK** button.

## To view a summary of posted checks

If you want to review posted checks, for example to verify multiple checks paid to one vendor, you can use the **Bank Account - Check Details** report.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Bank Account - Check Details**, and then choose the related link.
2. Set filters as relevant, and then choose the **Preview** button.

# Transferring and posting cost entries

Before you define cost allocations, you must understand how cost entries come from the following sources:  

- Automatic transfer of general ledger entries.  
- Manual cost posting for pure cost entries, internal charges, and manual allocations.  
- Automatic allocation postings for actual costs.  
- Transfer of budget entries to actual.

## Criteria for transferring general ledger entries to cost entries

It's important to understand the criteria for transferring general ledger entries to cost entries. During the transfer, the **Transfer GL Entries to CA** batch job uses the following criteria to determine if and how the general ledger entries are transferred.  

General ledger entries are transferred if:  

- The entries have dimension values corresponding to either a cost center or a cost object.  
- The entries have dimension values that correspond to a cost center and a cost object. For these entries, the cost center takes precedence. This helps avoid a situation where a cost type appears in both a cost object and a cost center and is therefore counted twice in the statistics.  
- The document number in the entries is empty, so it will appear with a document number of 0000 in the cost entries.  
- The entries are transferred to a cost type that allows for combined entries and these entries are transferred as a combined entry either monthly or daily.  

General ledger entries aren't transferred if:  

- The entries have dimension values that don't correspond to a cost center or a cost object.  
- The entries have an amount of zero.  
- The entries have a general ledger account that has been deleted.  
- The entries have a general ledger account that isn't of the type **Income Statement**.  
- The entries have a general ledger account that isn't assigned a cost type.  
- The entries have a posting date before the **Starting Date for G/L Transfer**.  
- The entries have been posted with a closing date. These are typically entries that set back the balance of the income statement at the end of the year.

## Transferring general ledger entries to cost entries

You can transfer general ledger entries to cost entries.  

Before you run the process for transferring general ledger entries to cost entries, you must prepare the transfer to avoid manual correction posting.  

### To prepare the transfer  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Cost Accounting Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  On the **Cost Accounting Setup** page, verify that the **Starting Date for G/L Transfer** field is set to the correct value.  
3.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Chart of Cost Types**, and then choose the related link.  
4.  On the **Cost Type Card** page, verify that the **G/L Account Range** field is linked correctly for each cost type to take entries from the general ledger.  
5.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Chart of Accounts**, and then choose the related link.  
6.  For each relevant general ledger account, on the **G/L Account Card** page, verify that the **Cost Type No.** field is linked correctly to a cost type. For more information, see [Setting Up Cost Accounting](finance-set-up-cost-accounting.md).  
7.  Verify that all relevant general ledger entries have dimension values that correspond to a cost center and a cost object.  

### To transfer general ledger entries to cost entries

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Transfer GL Entries to CA**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Choose the **Yes** button to start the transfer. The process transfers all general ledger entries that haven't already been transferred.  

During the transfer, the process creates connections in the entries in the **Cost Entry** table and the **Cost Register** table. This makes it possible to trace the source of cost entries.

## Automatic transfer and combined entries

In cost accounting, you can transfer general ledger entries to a cost type by using a combined posting. You can specify if a cost type receives combined entries in the **Combine Entries** field in the cost type definition. The following table describes the different options.  

|Combine Entries|Description|  
|---------------------|-----------------|  
|None|Each general ledger entry is transferred individually to the corresponding cost type.|  
|Day|General ledger entries with the same posting date are transferred as one entry to the corresponding cost type.|  
|Month|All general ledger entries in the same calendar month are transferred as one entry to the corresponding cost type.|  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  If you have selected the **Auto Transfer from G/L** check box on the **Cost Accounting Setup** page, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] updates the cost accounting after every posting in the general ledger. Combined entries are not possible.

## Results of transferring general ledger entries to cost entries

During the transfer of general ledger entries to cost entries, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates connections in the entries in the **G/L Entry** table, the **Cost Entry** table, and the **Cost Register** table to make it possible to trace the connections between cost entries and general ledger entries.  

### General ledger entries

For each general ledger entry that is transferred to cost accounting, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] fills the cost **Entry No.** field.  

### Cost entries

For each cost entry, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] saves the entry number of the corresponding general ledger entry in the **G/L Entry No.** field in the **Cost Entry** table.  

For combined cost entries, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] saves the entry number of the last general ledger entry, which is the entry with the highest entry number.  

The **G/L Account** field in the **Cost Entry** table contains the number of the general ledger account that the cost entry came from.  

For single cost entries, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] transfers the posting text from the general ledger entry to the **Description** text field. For combined entries, the text field shows these entries are transferred as combined entries. For example, for a combined entry for the month of October in 2013, the text can be **Combined Entries, October 2013**.  

### Cost register

In the **Cost Register** table, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates an entry with the source transfer from general ledger. The entry records the first and last entry numbers of the general ledger entries that are transferred, in addition to the first, and last entry numbers of the cost entries that are created.

# Set Up Base Calendars

You can assign a base calendar to your company and its business partners, such as customers, vendors, or locations. Delivery and receipt dates on future sales order, purchase order, transfer order, and production order lines are calculated according to the calendar’s specified working days. The main task in setting up a new base calendar is to specify and define the non-working days that you want to apply.  

## To set up a base calendar

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Base Calendar**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Choose the **New** action.  
3.  Fill in the **Code** field.  
4. Choose the **Maintain Base Calendar Changes** action.
5. On the **Base Calendar Changes** page, use the **Recurring System** field to mark a particular date or day as a recurring nonworking day. You can select either the **Annual Recurring** or **Weekly Recurring** option.  

    If you select **Annual Recurring**, you must also enter the relevant date in the **Date** field.  

    If you select **Weekly Recurring**, you must also select the relevant day of the week in the **Day** field. If you leave the field empty, you must fill in the **Date** field. The **Day** field is filled in automatically.  

When you make an entry, the **Nonworking** field is selected. You can choose to clear the check mark to make it a working day.  
 When you return to the base calendar card, you will observe that the nonworking day entries that you made have been updated. These entries now appear in red and the **Nonworking** field is selected.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  When setting up a new base calendar, you can select and copy lines from an existing calendar. You do this in the relevant **Base Calendar Changes** page.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  Any base calendar defined for the vendor or the location affects how the dates are calculated and rounded to working days.
Specifies a date formula for the time that it takes to replenish the item. It is used to calculate the **Planned Receipt Date** field, if calculating forward, and **Order Date** field, if calculating backwards. See [Lead Time Calculation](across-how-to-assign-base-calendars.md#lead-time-calculation).

## Lead Time Calculation

Any base calendar defined for the vendor or the location affects how the dates are calculated and rounded to working days. Accordingly, the two date fields on purchase order lines are calculated as follows under different conditions.

|Calculation Direction|Vendor Calendar Defined|Vendor Calendar Not Defined|
|---------------------|-----------------------|---------------------------|
|Forward|planned receipt date = order date + vendor lead time (per the vendor calendar and rounded to the next working day in first the vendor calendar and then the location calendar)|planned receipt date = order date + vendor lead time (per the location calendar)|
|Backward|order date = planned receipt date - vendor lead time (per the vendor calendar and rounded to the previous working day in first the vendor calendar and then the location calendar)|order date = planned receipt date - vendor lead time (per the location calendar)|

> [!NOTE]
> In addition to the lead time calculation that affects the planned receipt date and order date, as shown in the above table, warehouse handling time and safety lead time may be added to the formulas to make up the value in the **Expected Receipt Date** field, as follows: Planned Receipt Date + Safety Lead Time + Inbound Warehouse Handling Time = Expected Receipt Date.

> [!Important]
> If your location uses a significantly different calendar than your vendors do, then it is important that you set up specific calendars for those vendors, to calculate optimal vendor lead times. For information about how to set up vendor calendars, see [To assign a base calendar](across-how-to-assign-base-calendars.md#to-assign-a-base-calendar).

The contents of the **Lead Time Calculation** field is copied from either the item card or the SKU card, if the lead time is defined for the item, or on the **Item Vendor Catalog** page, if the lead time is defined for the vendor.

## To customize a calendar
The main task in customizing a base calendar for your company, or one of its business partners, is to enter any changes to working and nonworking day status.

For example, while a base calendar would typically list all Saturdays as non-working days, the customized calendar for a particular location may list all Saturdays during the months of November and December, and leading up to the holiday season, as working days.

The following procedure uses the case of the location as an example. Note that at this point, you have already assigned a base calendar to the location.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Locations**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the location that you want to update, and then select the **Customized Calendar** field. Note that a calendar must be selected in the **Base Calendar Code** field.
3. On the **Customized Calendar Entries** page opens, choose the **Maintain Customized Calendar Changes** action.
4. In the **Customized Calendar Changes**, add lines for customized calendar entries.

    When you enter a line, the **Nonworking** check box is selected. You can clear the check box if you want to change the status to a working day.

    You can use the **Recurring System** field to set a particular date or day as a recurring nonworking day. You can select either the **Annual Recurring** or **Weekly Recurring** option.

    If you select **Annual Recurring**, you must also enter the relevant date in the **Date** field. If you select **Weekly Recurring**, you must also select the relevant day of the week in the **Day** field. If you leave the field empty, you must fill in the **Date** field. The **Day** field is then filled in automatically. This could be useful if you want to mark an individual date as a nonworking or working day.

5. Choose the **OK** button.

On the **Customized Calendar Entries** page, you will observe that the date entries are updated with the changes that you made.

On the Location card, you will observe that the **Customized Calendar** field contains **Yes**, indicating that a customized calendar has been set up.

> [!Important]
> If you do not fill in the **Location Code** field on an order line, your company’s calendar is used.


If you do not fill in the **Shipping Agent Code** field on the order line, your company’s calendar is used.

> [!NOTE]  
> If you make changes to a base calendar for which customized calendar changes exist, all existing customized calendars are updated automatically.

## To assign a base calendar  
The following procedure schedules delivery dates on sales order lines for a customer as an example.

Base calendars are assigned to your own company, customers, vendors, locations, and shipping agents as follows:  

-   On the **Company Information** and **Customer** cards, the base calendar is assigned on the **Shipping** FastTab.  
-   On the **Vendor** card, the base calendar is assigned on the **Receiving** FastTab.  
-   On the **Location** card, the base calendar is assigned on the **Warehouse** FastTab.  
-   On the **Shipping Agents** page, the base calendar is assigned on the **Shipping Agent Services** page.

# Setting up cash flow analysis

If you want some help to decide what to do with your cash, have a look at the charts on the Accountant Role Center:

* **Cash Cycle**  
* **Income & Expense**  
* **Cash Flow**  
* **Cash Flow Forecasts**  

This article describes where the data in the charts comes from and, if necessary, what to do to start using the charts.
<br><br>  

> [!Video https://learn-video.azurefd.net/vod/player?id=4ecab63b-f107-4666-b88f-656a133a0f78]

## The Cash Cycle and Income & Expense charts

The **Cash Cycle** and **Income & Expense** charts are ready to go, based on the Chart of Accounts and financial reports. The accounts are where the data comes from, and financial reports calculate the relationship between sales and receivables. Some accounts and financial reports are provided. You can use them as-is, change them, and add new ones. If you add G/L accounts to your chart of accounts, for example, by importing them from QuickBooks, map the accounts on the **Financial Reports** page for the following reports:

| Financial report name | Where it's used |
| --- | --- |
| **I_CACYCLE** |Cash Cycle |
| **I_CASHFLOW** |Cash Flow |
| **I_INCEXP** |Income & Expense |
| **I_MINTRIAL** |As an income statement if you don't use the chart of accounts |

> [!NOTE]
> It's a good idea to keep the calculations that are provided for the financial report.

Enter accounts in the **Totaling** field for **Total Revenue**, **Total Receivables**, **Total Payables**, and **Total Inventory**. To map to a range of accounts, enter the account numbers separated by ".." as in **1111..4444**. Alternately, to map to specific accounts, enter the account numbers separated by a vertical bar as in **2222|3333|5555**.  

> [!TIP] 
> Verify your mapping by choosing the **Overview** action.  

## Set up the Cash Flow chart

The Cash Flow chart is based on:  

* A chart of cash flow accounts.
* One or more cash flow setups. These setups specify the accounts to use for general ledger, purchases, sales, services, and fixed assets.  

To help you get going, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides some accounts and cash flow setups. You can add, change, or remove them.  

To set up the accounts, search for **Chart of Cash Flow Accounts**, choose the link, and then fill in the fields. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)] Repeat these steps for **Cash Flow Setup**.

## Set up cash flow forecasts

The **Cash Flow Forecast** chart uses cash flow accounts, cash flow setups, and cash flow forecasts. Some are provided, however, you can set up your own by using an assisted setup guide. The guide helps you specify things like:

* When to update the forecast
* Which accounts to base it on
* When you pay taxes
* Whether to turn on [Azure AI](https://azure.microsoft.com/overview/ai-platform/).  

Cash flow forecasts can use Azure AI to create a more comprehensive forecast. The connection to Azure AI is already set up for you. You just need to turn it on. When you sign in to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], a notification displays in a blue bar and provides a link to the default cash flow setup. The notification displays only once. If you close it, but then decide to turn on Azure AI, you can use the assisted setup guide or a manual process.  

> [!NOTE]
>
> Alternatively, you can use your own predictive web service. For more information, see [Create and use your own predictive web service for cash flow forecasts](#AnchorText).  

To use the assisted setup guide:  

1. In the Accountant Role Center, under the **Cash Flow Forecast** chart, choose the **Open Assisted Setup** action.
2. Fill in the fields in each step of the guide. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
3. Back in the Accountant Role Center, choose the **Recalculate Forecast** action under the **Cash Flow Forecast** chart.

To use a manual process:  

1. In the Accountant Role Center, choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Cash Flow Setup**, then choose the related link.
2. Expand the **Azure AI** FastTab, then choose the **Azure AI Enabled** field.
3. Back in the Accountant Role Center, choose the **Recalculate Forecast** action under the **Cash Flow Forecast** chart.

> [!TIP]  
> Consider the length of the periods that the service will use in its calculations. The more data you provide, the more accurate the predictions will be. Also, watch out for large variances in periods. They will also impact predictions. If Azure AI does not find enough data, or the data varies a lot, the service will not make a prediction.  

## Design details

Subscriptions for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] come with access to several predictive web services in all regions where [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is available. Learn more at the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central Licensing Guide. The guide is available for download on the [Business Central](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/business-central/overview/) website.

These web services are stateless, meaning they use data only to calculate predictions on demand. They don't store data.

> [!NOTE]
>
> You can use your own predictive web service instead of ours. For more information, see [Create and use your own predictive web service for cash flow forecasts](#AnchorText).

### Data required for forecast

To make predictions about future revenue and expenses, web services require historical data from receivables, payables, and taxes.

#### Receivables

**Due Date**, **Amount (LCY)** fields of the **Customer Ledger Entries** page, where:

* The document type is *Invoice* or *Credit Memo*.
* The due date is between date that is calculated based on the values in the **Historical Periods** and **Period Type** fields on the **Cash Flow Setup** page and the work date.

Before it uses the predictive web-service, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] compresses transactions by **Due Date** based on the value in the **Period Type** field on the **Cash Flow Setup** page.

#### Payables

**Due Date**, **Amount (LCY)** fields on the **Vendor Ledger Entries** page, where:

* The document type is *Invoice* or *Credit Memo*.
* The due date is between date that is calculated based on values in the **Historical Periods** and **Period Type** fields on the **Cash Flow Setup** page and the work date.

Before it uses the predictive web-service, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] compresses transactions by **Due Date** based on the value in the **Period Type** field on the **Cash Flow Setup** page.

#### Tax

**Document Date**, **Amount** fields on the **VAT (Tax) Ledger Entries** page, where:

* The document type is *sales*.
* The document date is between the date that is calculated based on values in the **Historical Periods** and **Period Type** fields on the **Cash Flow Setup** page and the work date.

Before it uses the predictive web-service, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] compresses transactions by **Document Date** based on value in the **Period Type** field in the **Cash Flow Setup** page.

## <a name="AnchorText"></a>Create and use your own predictive web service for cash flow forecasts

For [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, the model is published by Microsoft and connected to the Microsoft subscription. For other deployment options, you have to create Machine Learning resources in your own Azure subscription. You can find sample steps in the [sample repo](https://github.com/microsoft/BCTech/tree/master/samples/MachineLearning). The purpose of this task is to get the API URI and API key.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Cash Flow Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Expand the **Azure AI** FastTab, and then fill in the fields, including the API URL and API key provided from Azure Machine Learning studio. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
3. In the Accountant Role Center, choose the **Recalculate Forecast** action under the **Cash Flow Forecast** chart.

# Finding pages and reports with the role explorer

You can get an overview of the pages and reports that make up the features that people your business role often use. You can also explore what's available for other roles. This article refers to the overview of pages and reports as the *role explorer*.

In addition to the overview, the role explorer provides actions that open pages or reports, for example, so you can explore the information that the page or report includes. You can also use the role explorer as a way to get around in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

[!INCLUDE [about-ui-learn](includes/about-ui-learn.md)]

## Open the role explorer

You can open the role explorer from role centers, list pages, and the **Tell Me** window.

- On your role center or any list page, choose the ![Menu button.](media/ui_menu_button.png "Menu button") button, or select <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>F12</kbd>.
- In the **Tell Me** window, choose the **exploring pages** action.

## Open the role explorer filtered to show reports

You can open the role explorer in a filtered view that only shows reports:

- On your role center or any list page, choose the **All Reports** action.
- In the **Tell Me** window, choose the **exploring reports** action.

## Open pages and reports

The actions that open pages or reports are organized under nodes that are named after application areas. You can collapse or expand each node individually, or all nodes together.

- To expand/collapse an individual top-level or subnode, choose the node.
- To expand/collapse all top-level nodes on the page, but leave the subnodes as they are, choose **...** at the top, then choose **Expand** or **Collapse**.
- To expand/collapse all top-levels node and all subnodes under it, choose **...** at the top, then choose the **Expand All** or **Collapse All** action.

## Search for pages and reports

To quickly locate a page or report, select **Find**, and then enter a word or phrase for what you want to find. Role explorer highlights any matching text. If the page or report is hidden in a collapsed node, the collapsed node is marked with a dot.

## Explore other roles

To explore roles other than your own, select **Explore more roles**. Role explorer displays each role under its own heading, with links to its features. You can find and go to features just like you do when exploring your role.

> [!NOTE]
> You can only access roles that are set up to show in the role explorer. If a role isn't available, it probably isn't set up to show. To learn more, go to [Manage Profiles](admin-users-profiles-roles.md).

When you explore other roles, you can also narrow down your exploration by using the **Report & Analysis** and **Administration** actions.

- **Report & Analysis** filters the role explorer to show only reports and analysis features.
- **Administration** filters the role explorer to show only pages for administrative tasks, such as pages related to how you set up your [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

> [!TIP]
> For developers, you categorize pages and reports by setting the [UsageCategory property](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/properties/devenv-usagecategory-property) in the object's AL code.
<!--
 
## Role explorer actions

There a several actions along the top of the role explorer to help you locate features of your role and other roles.

|Action|Description|
|------|------|
|**All**|Shows all features that are related to the role.|
|**Find**|Lets you enter a word or phrase to quickly locate feature names that match.|
|**Explore more roles**|All business features that are available for all roles including your own. When exploring all roles, the other actions work the same way, except for all roles shown. **NOTE:** You can only access roles that are set up to show in role explorer. For more information, see [Manage Profiles](admin-users-profiles-roles.md).  |
|**Report & Analysis**|This action Shows only those features that are categorized as reports and analysis features.|
|**Administration**|Shows only those features that are categorized as administration features.|

<!--
Choose the **Find** action at the top of the role explorer to quickly locate feature names that contain a certain term.

Choose the **Explore more roles** action at the top of the role explorer to get an overview of all business features that are available for all roles including your own.

> [!NOTE]
> Only Role Center actions for profiles where the **Show in Role Explorer** check box is selected will appear on the extended version of the role explorer (shown with the **Explore more roles** action). For more information, see [Manage Profiles](admin-users-profiles-roles.md).
-->

## Expand and collapse nodes

The actions that open pages or reports are organized under nodes named after the features or application areas. You can collapse or expand each node individually, and you can collapse or expand all nodes.

- To expand or collapse a top-level or subnode, choose the node.
- To expand or collapse all top-level nodes on the page, choose the **Expand** or **Collapse** action.
- To expand or collapse all top-level nodes and their subnodes:
  - Select the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd> keys while you choose the **Expand** or **Collapse** action.
  - Choose **...**, and then choose the **Expand All** or **Collapse All** action.

## Learn more about a page or report

[!INCLUDE[2025_releasewave1](includes/2025_releasewave1.md)]

Teaching tips are available for some pages and reports. When that's the case, when you hover over the action for the page or report an information icon displays next to the name. Select the icon to learn more about the page or report.

# Batch post output and run times

The output quantity represents the work progress in the form of the finished quantity and used capacity of the work or machine center.

You can use an output journal to:

* Adjust inventory with the output of finished items from production.
* Register quantities and scrap for each operation in a production routing.
* Register setup and run time for work and machine centers.

> [!NOTE]
> If you use a production routing, inventory is updated only when you post output quantity for the last operation.

The **Production Journal** page lets you do the same tasks as the **Output Journal** page, and also do consumption posting tasks. To learn more, go to [Register Consumption and Output for a Released Production Order Line](production-how-to-register-consumption-and-output.md).

## To post output quantities and/or register run times for one or more production order lines

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Output Journal**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields with the production order data and the output data and/or run time. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
  
    You can use the **Explode Routing** function to generate journal lines from production orders.
  
3. If the operation is complete, select the **Finished** field.  
4. Choose the **Post** action to post the operations.

    Capacity ledger entries are updated for the used work or machine centers with information about time and quantity of output and scrap. If you posted the last operation, the item is added to inventory.

# Create Blanket Assembly Orders

You can use assembly management to customize an assembly item to a customer's request during the sales process. For more information, see [Sell Items Assembled to Order](assembly-how-to-sell-items-assembled-to-order.md).  

 As with any other type of item, you can also create blanket sales orders for customized assembly items before periodically making the actual sales orders according to the blanket order agreement. This process involves several extra steps when you compare it to creating a regular blanket sales order, and it uses a variation of a linked assembly order, which is a blanket assembly order.

> [!NOTE]  
>  Like all blanket orders, quantities on assembly blanket orders are only forecasts and are not operational until they are converted to actual assembly orders. Therefore, order functionality, such as availability calculation, reservation, and item tracking, is not active on blanket assembly orders.  

## To create a blanket assembly order for an assemble\-to\-order item  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Blanket Sales Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Create a new blanket sales order with one line for an assembly item. For more information, see [Create Blanket Sales Orders](sales-how-to-create-blanket-sales-orders.md).  
3. In the **Qty. to Assemble to Order** field on the blanket assembly order line, enter the full quantity.

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  You should not create blanket order agreements for a partial quantity. Therefore, you must enter the same quantity that you entered in the **Quantity** field on the blanket sales order line.  

4. Choose the **Assemble to Order** action, and then choose the **Assemble-to-Order Lines** action. Alternatively, choose the **Qty. to Assemble to Order)** field on the line.  
5. On the **Assemble-to-Order Lines** page, review or modify the assembly order lines according to the blanket order agreement that you have made with the customer. If you want to view more information, choose the **Show Document** action to open the complete blanket assembly order. You cannot change the contents of most fields, and you cannot post.  
6. When you have adjusted the assembly order lines according to the blanket order agreement, close the **Assemble-to-Order Lines** page to return to the **Blanket Sales Order** page.  
7. When the customer requests to create a sales order based on the agreed blanket sales order, create a sales order for the agreed assembly item or items. For more information, see [Create Blanket Sales Orders](sales-how-to-create-blanket-sales-orders.md).

The linked blanket assembly order and any customizations are linked to that new sales order to prepare for assembly of the item or items to be sold.

# How to use approval workflows

When someone must approve a record, such as a new purchase document or customer, you can send an approval request as part of a workflow. Based on how you set up the workflow, the appropriate approver is notified that the record requires their approval.

You set up approval workflows on the **Workflow** page. You must also set up approval users, including any relevant amount limits, on the **Approval User Setup** page. Learn more at [Set Up Approval Workflows](across-set-up-workflows.md).  

In addition to the approval workflows described in this article, you can perform various other workflow tasks. Learn more at [Use Approval Workflows](across-use-workflows.md).

Core approval workflows for purchases documents, sales documents, payment journals, customer cards, and item cards are ready to start as guides. Learn more at [Getting Ready for Doing Business](ui-get-ready-business.md).

## Request a record approval

An approval user does the following task.

1. On the page that presents the record, choose the **Send Approval Request** action.
2. To see all your approval requests, choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Approval Request Entries**, then choose the related link.  

The status of the approval entry is updated from **Created** to **Open**. The status of the record, such as a purchase invoice, is updated from **Open** to **Pending Approval** and remains locked for processing until all approvers approve the record.

After all required approvers approve the record, the status changes to **Released**. You can then continue working with the record.

## Cancel approval requests

An approval user with approver rights can cancel approval requests.

A customer might want to change an order after it's submitted for approval. In this case, you can cancel the approval process, make the necessary changes to the order, and request approval again.

- On the page displaying the record, choose the **Cancel Approval Request** action.

When an approval request was canceled, the status of the related approval entry changes to **Canceled**. The status of the record updates from **Pending Approval** to **Open**. At this point, the approval process can restart.

## Approve or reject approval requests

An approval user with approver rights can approve or reject approval requests.

You can process approval requests on the **Requests to Approve** page, including approving multiple requests at a time. Alternatively, you can approve individual records by choosing the link in the notification that you receive.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Requests to Approve**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select one or more lines of the records you want to approve or reject.
3. Choose the **Approve**, **Reject**, or **Delegate** actions.

When a record is approved or rejected, the approval status in the **Status** field changes to **Approved** or **Rejected**, respectively.

If an approver hierarchy is set up, the record status is **Pending Approval** until all requested approvers approve the record. Then the record status changes to **Released**.

At the same time, the approval status changes from **Created** to **Open** as soon as an approval request for the record is created. If the request is rejected, the approval status changes to **Rejected**. The status remains **Open** or **Rejected** until all approvers approve the request.

## Delegate approval requests

An approval user with approver rights can delegate approval requests.

To prevent records from piling up or otherwise blocking the workflow, the approver and the approval administrator can delegate an approval request to a substitute approver. The substitute can either be a designated substitute, the direct approver, or the approval administrator, in that order of priority. You typically use this feature if an approver is unavailable or unable to approve requests before the due date.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Requests to Approve**, then choose the related link.
2. Select one or more lines of approval requests you want to delegate to a substitute approver, then choose the **Delegate** action.

A notification to approve the request is sent to the substitute approver.

## Manage overdue approval requests

An approval user with approver rights can remind approval workflow users of overdue approval requests. Use the **Send Overdue Approval Notifications** action to do so.

The **Send Overdue Approval Notifications** action checks for all open approval requests currently overdue. Each approver with at least one overdue approval entry receives a notification with the list of all their overdue approval requests. The notification is also sent to their approver and all the requesters of the overdue approvals. This last step helps if the overdue approval entry must be delegated to a substitute.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Overdue Approval Requests**, and then choose the related link.

# Combine shipments on a single invoice

You can manually or automatically combine shipments from sales or service orders in a single sales or service invoice.  

Before you can create a combined shipment, you must post, but not invoice, more than one sales or service shipments for the same customer in the same currency.

> [!NOTE]
> The procedures in this article describe how to combine shipments in a sales invoice. The steps are the same for service invoices. Just replace the word "sales" with "service."

## To manually combine shipments on a single invoice

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Invoices**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action, and then fill in the fields as necessary. To learn more, go to [Invoice Sales](sales-how-invoice-sales.md) or [Create service invoices or credit memos](service-how-create-invoices.md).
3. In the **Sell-to Customer No.** field, enter the customer to invoice for the shipped items.  
4. On the **Lines** FastTab, choose the **Get Shipment Lines** action.  
5. Select the shipment line that you want to include in the invoice:  

    - To insert all lines, select all lines and choose the **OK** button.  
    - To insert specific lines, select the lines and choose the **OK** button. You can use the Ctrl key to select multiple nonsequential lines.  

    If an incorrect shipment line was selected or you want to start over, you can delete the lines on the invoice and rerun the **Get Shipment Lines** action.  
6. To post the invoice, choose the **Post** action.  

> [!TIP]  
> If you shipped orders where the **Sell-to Customer No.** is different from the **Bill-to Customer No.**, those lines don't display in the **Get Shipment Lines** report. Use personalization to add the **Sell-to Customer** field to the page and remove the filter. Now you can add shipment lines to the invoice regardless of the value in the **Sell-to Customer No.** field, as long as the **Bill-to Customer No.** field on the shipment lines matches the value on the sales invoice.  

## To automatically combine shipments on a single invoice

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] selects only sales orders where **Combine Shipments** is chosen.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Combine Shipments**, and then choose the related link. The batch job request page opens.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
3. Choose the **Post Invoices** checkbox.  
4. Choose the **OK** button.  

> [!NOTE]  
> You must manually post the invoices if the **Post Invoices** checkbox wasn't selected on the batch job.  

## To remove open sales orders after combined shipment posting

When you combine and post shipments on an invoice, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates a posted sales or service invoice for the invoiced lines. The **Quantity Invoiced** field on the original order updates based on the invoiced quantity. The orders from which you post the shipments still exist, even if they're fully shipped and invoiced.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Delete Invoiced Sales Orders**, and then select the link.  
2. Specify in the **No.** filter field which sales orders to delete.  
3. Choose the **OK** button.  

Alternatively, delete individual sales or service orders manually.  

Repeat steps 1 through 3 for other affected documents, such as blanket sales orders.

# About the Data Exchange Framework

You can use the Data Exchange Framework to manage the exchange of business documents, bank files, currency exchange rates, and any other data files with your business partners or authorities.

As an administrator or Microsoft partner, you can use the framework in new integration features by setting up which data to exchange and how. For example, the format of files for exchange of data in bank files, electronic documents, currency exchange rates, and other with ERP systems vary depending on the provider of the data file or stream and on the country/region. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports various bank file formats and data service standards. To provide support for other electronic document formats, you use the data exchange framework.

 The following diagrams show the architecture of the data exchange framework.  

 ![Data Exchange Framework &#45; Import.](media/across-data-exchange/dataexchangeframework_import.png)  

 ![Data Exchange Framework &#45; Export.](media/across-data-exchange/dataexchangeframework_export.png)  

## Electronic documents

As an alternative to emailing business documents as file attachments, you can send and receive them electronically. An "electronic document" is a standard-compliant file representing a business document, such as an invoice from a vendor that you can receive and convert to a purchase invoice in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Trading partners exchange electronic documents through external document exchange services. By default, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports sending and receiving electronic invoices and credit memos in the PEPPOL format, which is supported by the largest providers of document exchange services. Currently, Avalara and Pagero exchange services are pre-configured and ready to be set up for your company (Microsoft will support more exchange services in near future). To provide support for other electronic document formats, you must check if they're already delivered in your localization to create new data exchange definitions.  

From PDF or image files representing incoming documents, you can have an external OCR service (Optical Character Recognition) create electronic documents that you can then convert to document records in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], like for electronic PEPPOL documents. For example, when you receive an invoice in PDF format from your vendor, you can send it to the OCR service from the **Incoming Documents** page. After a few seconds, you receive the file back as an electronic invoice that can be converted to a purchase invoice for the vendor. If you send the file to the OCR service by email, then a new incoming document record is automatically created when you receive the electronic document back.  

To send, for example, a sales invoice as an electronic PEPPOL document, read this [instruction](finance-how-use-edocuments.md). The data conversion and sending of the PEPPOL sales invoice are performed by dedicated codeunits and XMLports.  

To receive, for example, an invoice from a vendor as an electronic PEPPOL document, read the following [instruction](finance-how-use-edocuments-purchase.md). You can either set up the Job Queue feature to process such files regularly or you can start the process manually. For both sales and purchase processes, first, [you must set up](finance-how-setup-edocuments.md) various master data, such as services, company information, vendors, items, and units of measure. These are used to identify the business partners and items when you convert data in elements in the incoming document file to fields in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The receiving and data conversion of PEPPOL invoices are performed by the Data Exchange Framework.  

To receive, for example, an invoice as an electronic OCR document, you process it the same way as you would when receiving an electronic PEPPOL document. The receiving and conversion of electronic documents from OCR are performed by the Data Exchange Framework, represented by the **OCR – Invoice** data exchange definition.  

## Bank files

The formats of files for exchanging bank data with business management applications vary depending on the supplier of the file and the country or region. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports import and export of Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) bank files. Additionally, the AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals extension lets you connect to a AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals extension provided by an external provider, AMC Consult. For more information, see [Make Payments with the AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals extension or SEPA Credit Transfer](finance-make-payments-with-bank-data-conversion-service-or-sepa-credit-transfer.md). To provide support for other electronic document formats, you use the Data Exchange Framework.  

To export SEPA credit transfers, you choose **Export Payments to File** button on the **Payment Journal** page and then upload the file to process the payments in your bank. First you must set up various master data, such as bank account, vendors, and payment methods. The data conversion and export of SEPA bank data is performed by a dedicated codeunit and XMLport, represented by the **SEPA Credit Transfer** bank export/import setup. Alternatively, you can set up the AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals extension to perform the export, represented by the **AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals extension - Credit Transfer** data exchange definition.  

 To export SEPA direct debit instructions, you choose the **Export Direct Debit File** button on the **Direct Debit Collections** page and then send to your bank to automatically collect the involved customer payments. First you must set up bank accounts, customers, direct-debit mandates, and payment methods. The data conversion and export of SEPA bank data is performed by dedicated a codeunit and XMLport, represented by the **SEPA Direct Debit** bank export/import setup.  

 To import SEPA bank statements, you choose the Import Bank Statement button in the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** and **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** pages and then you proceed to apply each bank statement entry to payments or bank ledger entries, manually or automatically. First you must set up bank accounts. The import and data conversion of SEPA bank data is performed by the Data Exchange Framework, represented by the **SEPA CAMT** data exchange definition. Alternatively, you can set up the AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals extension to perform the import, represented by the **AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals extension – Bank Statement** data exchange definition.  

 In addition, the local versions of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] support various other file formats for importing and exporting bank data, payroll transactions, and other data. For more information, see the [Local Functionality](about-localization.md) landing page for your country/region in the Help.  

## Currency exchange rates

You can set up an external service to keep your for currency exchange rates up to date. The service that provides updated currency exchange rates is enabled by a data exchange definition. Accordingly, the **Exch. Rate Update Setup Card** page is a condensed view of the **Data Exchange Definition** page for the data exchange definition in question.  

For all exchanges of data in XML files, you can prepare the data exchange setup by loading the related XML schema file on the **XML Schema Viewer** page. Here you select the data elements that you want to exchange with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]  and then you either initialize a data exchange definition or generate an XMLport.

## Intrastat

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses the Data Exchange Framework for Intrastat reporting where you can easily create timestamped files in different formats for export. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] contains prepared formats for localized countries/regions and for default version. But you can change the out-of-box report or make your own.

# EU third-party purchase transactions

European Union (EU) third-party trade occurs when you receive a purchase invoice from a customer in one EU country/region, and the products are sent to a different EU country/region without entering the country of residence. The transaction amount can be identified and reported separately to comply with some EU countries'/regions' value-added tax (VAT) reporting and VAT Information Exchange System (VIES) requirements. Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central enables purchase transactions to be set up as EU third-party trade. Posted EU third-party transactions can be filtered in VAT statements and excluded from the amount in the **Sales to Customer** column of the **VAT-VIES Declaration Tax Auth** report.

Even if the feature is preinstalled as an extension, it isn't activated by default. Follow these steps to activate the feature.

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, go to the **Feature Management** workspace, and then select the related link.
2. In the list, find and select **Feature update: Replace the existing EU 3-Party Purchase functionality with the new EU 3-Party Trade Purchase extension**.
3. In the **Enabled for** column, select **All users**.

> [!NOTE]
> If you use the German or Italian localization, you won't be able to enable this app because it's not compatible with certain VAT features in those localizations.  

## Enable EU third-party trade functionality for a purchase

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Setup**, and then select the related link.
2. On the **VAT Setup** page, mark the **Enable EU 3-Party Purchase** field.

# Consolidate financial data from multiple companies

Some organizations use [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in multiple business units or legal entities. Others use [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in subsidiaries that must report into parent organizations. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] gives accountants tools that help them transfer general ledger entries from two or more companies (subsidiaries) into a consolidated company.  

Each company involved in a consolidation is called a business unit. The company in which you combine the data is called the consolidated company.  

You can transfer financial data from subsidiaries to the consolidated company, even if the subsidiaries use [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in different environments. To learn more about how to connect to other environments, go to [Set Up Company Consolidation](finance-consolidated-company-reporting-setup.md#busunit).

If the financial statements of a business unit use a different currency than the consolidated company, you must set up exchange rates for consolidation. To learn more about exchange rates for consolidations, go to [Set Up Company Consolidation](finance-consolidated-company-reporting-setup.md#exchrates).  

You can consolidate:  

* Across companies that have different charts of accounts.  
* Companies that use different fiscal years and different currencies.  
* Either the full amount or a percentage of a company's financial information.
* Using different currency exchange rates in individual G/L accounts.
* Companies in other accounting and business management programs.
* Companies in different [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] environments.

You set up the consolidated company in the same way that you set up other companies. The chart of accounts is independent of the chart of accounts in the business units. The chart of accounts in the business units can differ from one another. To learn more about setting up a consolidation, go to [Set Up Company Consolidation](finance-consolidated-company-reporting-setup.md).  

> [!TIP]
> Consolidating financial data can be especially relevant for intercompany processes. To learn more about intercompany features, go to [Managing Intercompany Transactions](intercompany-manage.md).

## Consolidate data

Before you consolidate, it's a good idea to test your data before you transfer it to the consolidated company. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] looks for differences in the information in the business units and the consolidated company. For example, whether account numbers or dimension codes are different. Correct any errors you find before you run the report. You can test the database or, if you're importing data from an XML file, the file.

### Test the data before you consolidate

1. Open the consolidated company.  
2. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Business Units**, and then choose the related link.  
3. Test the file and database, as follows:  

    * To test a file, choose the **Test File** action, enter the name of the file to test, and then choose **Print**.  
    * To test the database, choose **Test Database**.  

### Run the consolidation

After you've tested the data, you can transfer it to the consolidated company. An assisted setup guide will help you through the process.

> [!NOTE]
> When you run the consolidation you can choose the companies to include. If your consolidated company doesn't have access to one or more subsidiaries, the guide will let you grant access to them.

1. Sign in to the consolidated company.  
2. On the **Business Units** page, choose the **Consolidate** action.  
3. Fill in the required fields.  

## Use the Consolidated Trial Balance report

The **Consolidated Trial Balance** report can give you an overview of the overall financial health of your business. The report combines general ledger entries from each of your companies in a new company that you created for the consolidated data. The consolidated company is just a container for the consolidated data, and doesn't have any live business data. The companies that you include in the consolidated company become **Business Units** in the report. If you have four business units or fewer, you can also use the **Consolidated Trial Balance (4)** report.  

The report shows a line for each account, and follows the structure of the chart of accounts. An account isn't shown if all the amounts on the line are 0. The report shows the following information for each account:

* The account number and the name of the account.
* The totals for the consolidated company and for each business unit. Totals can display either as a net change or the balance to date.
* The eliminations made in the consolidated company. Eliminations always show for a period corresponding to the consolidated company's fiscal year.
* The total for the consolidated company after the eliminations show either as a net change or the balance to date.

## Eliminate repeated transactions

After you consolidate the companies, you must find and eliminate any transactions that are recorded more than once across companies. Processing consolidation eliminations is a manual process.  

To eliminate repeated transactions:

1. Find transactions that might need to be adjusted, and enter general journal lines to eliminate them.
2. Run the **G/L Consolidation Eliminations** report to help you assess the effect of the general journal lines before posting.
3. Post the adjusting transactions.

The **G/L Consolidation Eliminations** report displays a tentative trial balance where you can simulate the consequences of eliminating entries. The report compares the entries in the consolidated company with the eliminations entered in the general journal.

Before you can include a business unit in the report, you must set up the unit on the **Business Units** page. Make sure to turn on the **Consolidate** toggle.

A line is created for each account, following the structure of the chart of accounts. An account isn't shown if all amounts on the line are 0. The report shows the following information for each account:

* Account number.
* Account name.
* If you selected one or more business unit codes in the **Business Unit Code** field on the request page, a total shown for the consolidated company excludes the selected business units and eliminations. If you didn't fill in **Business Unit Code** field, the total for the consolidated company excludes eliminations.
* If you selected a business unit code in the **Business Unit Code** field on the request page, a total shows for the imported entries from the business unit. If you didn't fill in the **Business Unit Code** field, a total shows for the posted eliminations in the consolidated company.
* The total for the consolidated company with all the business units and all posted eliminations.
* The eliminations to make in the consolidated company. That is, the entries in the general journal that is selected on the request page.
* The posting text copied from the general journal.
* The consolidated company's total after the eliminations, if they're posted.

[!INCLUDE [finance_reports_consolidation](includes/finance-reports-consolidation-include.md)]

## Export and import consolidated data between databases

If data for a business unit is in another database, you can do a manual file-based transfer or automate the process by using an API. To learn more about the API, go to [Use our API to automatically share data across environments](#use-our-api-to-automatically-share-data-across-environments).

This section describes the manual, file-based process.

You export the data to a file before you include it in the consolidation. Export each company separately by using the **Export Consolidation** batch job.  

> [!TIP]
> Use the same process to export consolidated data that you must submit to Dynamics 365 Finance. For example, if the business unit is a subsidiary and the parent company uses Dynamics 365 Finance.

After you run the batch job, all entries in general ledger accounts are processed. For every combination of selected dimensions and date, the contents of the entries' **Amount** fields are totaled and exported. The next combination of the selected dimensions and date with the same account number is processed. Then the combinations in the next account number are processed, and so on.  

The exported entries contain the following fields: **Account No.**, **Posting Date**, and **Amount**. If dimensions information was also exported, dimension codes and dimension values are also included.  

1. For each exported line, if the total of the **Amount** fields is a debit, the account number that is set up in the business unit's **Consol. Debit Acc.** field is exported to the line. If the total is a credit, the corresponding number in the **Consol. Credit Acc.** field is exported to the line.  
2. The date used for each exported line is either the period's ending date or, if the transfer occurs each day, the exact date of the calculation.  
3. The dimension value exported for the entry will be the consolidated company dimension value that is specified in the **Consolidation Code** field for that dimension value. If a consolidated company dimension value hasn't been entered in the **Consolidated Code** field for the dimension value, the dimension value itself will be exported to the line.  
4. The XML files also contain the currency exchange rates in the consolidation period. These rates are included in a separate section at the beginning of the file.  

## Use our API to automatically share data across environments

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides an API that let's you automate the process of sharing financial data from business units to the consolidated company. The API is free to use and easy to set up. It even let's you share data across [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] environments. For example, you might need to share across environments when business units are not in the same Azure geographies. To learn more about using the API to automate the consolidation process, go to [Set Up Company Consolidation](finance-consolidated-company-reporting-setup.md#busunit).

# Record special sales prices and discounts

> [!NOTE]
> 2020 release wave 2 introduced new, streamlined processes for setting up and managing prices and discounts. If you're a new customer using the latest version, you're using the new experience. If you're an existing customer, whether you are using the new experience depends on whether your administrator has enabled the **New sales pricing experience** feature update in **Feature Management**. Learn more at [Enabling Upcoming Features Ahead of Time](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/feature-management) in the administration content.

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports various pricing strategies, such as:

* One-price-fits-all models where an item is always sold at the same price.
* Special price agreements with specific customers, or groups of customers.
* Campaigns when a sale meets the criteria for a special offer. For example, you might have the following criteria for an order:

  * It meets a minimum quantity
  * It's before a certain date
  * It includes a certain type of item  

To use a basic pricing model, you only need to specify a unit price when you set up an item or resource. That price will always be used on sales documents. For more advanced models, for example, when you want to offer special prices for a sales campaign, you can specify criteria on the **Sales Prices** page. You can offer special prices based on a combination of the following information:  

* Customer
* Item
* Unit of measure
* Minimum quantity
* Dates that define the period for which the prices are valid.

After you set up special prices, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can calculate best prices on sales and purchase documents, and on lines on projects and item journals. Learn more at [Best Price Calculation](sales-how-record-sales-price-discount-payment-agreements.md#best-price-calculation).

For sales discounts, you can set up two types:

| Discount Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Sales Line Discount** |Add an amount on sales lines that have a certain combination of customer, item, minimum quantity, unit of measure, or starting and ending date. This type works in the same way as for sales prices. |
| **Invoice Discount** |A discount percentage that is subtracted from the sales document total if the sum of all lines on the document exceeds a certain minimum. |

> [!TIP]  
> If an item should never be sold with a discount, leave the discount fields on the item page empty, and do not include the item in any line discount setups.

## To set up a sales price for a customer

These steps differ, depending on whether your administrator has turned on the **New sales pricing experience** feature update. If the feature update isn't turned on, follow the steps on the Current Experience tab. 

#### [Current experience](#tab/current-experience/)

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customers**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the customer, and then choose the **Prices** action.
3. Fill in the fields on the line as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)] Fill a line for each combination that will grant a special sales price to the customer.

#### [New experience](#tab/new-experience/)  

By default, the status of new price lists is **Draft**. Draft price lists aren't included in price calculations. When you're done adding lines and want to start using the prices, change the status to **Active**.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customers**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the customer, and then choose the **Sales Price Lists** action. 
3. Choose **New** to create a new sales price list.
4. On the **General** and **Tax** FastTabs, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
5. To add items to the list, do one of the following steps:
   * To add many items, choose **Suggest Lines**, and then enter filter criteria to specify the types of items to add. Optionally, you can enter other settings for the items that are specific to the price list. You can change these settings later if needed.
   * To copy items from another price list, choose **Copy Lines**, and then choose the price list to copy.
   * To add items manually, in the grid, in the **Product Type** field, choose the type of product that the price list is for. Depending on your selection, fill in the remaining fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
6. To start using the price list, in the **Status** field, choose **Active**.

## Using sales and purchase price lists

> [!NOTE]
> Using price lists requires that your administrator has enabled the **New sales pricing experience** feature update in **Feature Management**. Learn more at [Enabling Upcoming Features Ahead of Time](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/feature-management) in the administration content.

Most of the new sales pricing experience is similar to the current experience, but there are a few differences. Those differences are described in the following sections.

The **Applies-to Type** and **Applies-to No.** fields let you choose what a price list will apply to, such as customer or customer price group. Using **View Columns for**, you can show or hide columns relevant for setting prices, discounts, or prices and discounts.

### Converting existing prices when you turn on the pricing feature update

When you enable the **New sales pricing experience** feature update on the **Feature Management** page, the **Feature Data Update** guide opens. Use the **Use default prices** toggle as follows:

* If you want to work with all prices on a single page, turn it on. Existing prices will be converted to one default price list for each of the following documents:

  * Sales
  * Purchases
  * Job sales
  * Job purchases

  You can edit all prices for these areas on the **Prices Worksheet** page. The default price lists will be set on the **Sales & Receivables Setup**, **Purchases & Payables Setup,** and **Projects Setup** pages.

> [!NOTE]
> If prices are set only on item or resource cards, default price lists will not be filled in with those prices during the data update. However, you can open any of the default price lists or the **Price Worksheet** page and use the **Suggest Lines** action to add the prices set on item or resource cards.

* To use sales price lists, turn it off. Existing prices will be converted to a new price list for each combination of the following things:

  * Customer
  * Customer group or campaign
  * Starting and ending dates
  * Currencies

If you have many combinations, you'll have many price lists.

If you've already enabled the New Pricing Experience, you can create default price lists manually or specify an existing price list as the default. To set an existing price list as default, turn on the **Allow Updating Defaults** toggle on the price list. Then, on the **Sales & Receivables Setup**, **Purchase & Payables**, or **Projects Setup** pages, set the price list as the default.

### Editing active price lists

To allow people to edit prices on active price lists for items, resources, customers, vendors, or other entities that use pricing, turn on the **Allow Editing Active Price** toggle on the **Sales & Receivables Setup** and **Purchase & Payables Setup** pages.

When the **Allow Editing Active Price** toggle is turned off, to update prices in a price list you must change the status of the price list to **Draft**, make your change, and then reactivate the price list.

The **Prices Overview** page provides an overview of all prices across price lists. You can set filters to narrow down the list of prices you may want to modify or add to. After you modify prices, you must use the **Verify Lines** action to verify the prices against other price list lines. Verifying prices helps avoid duplicates and ambiguity during price calculation.

> [!NOTE]
> When you edit a line in an active price list the status of the line becomes **Draft**, and the line will not be considered during price calculation until you use the **Verify Lines** action. After you verify the price the line's status becomes **Active** and it will be considered in price calculations.

To add new prices, on the **Prices Overview** page, use the **Add New Lines** action. The **Prices Worksheet** page opens, and you can add price lines either by suggesting them based on criteria, copying them from other price lists, or manually entering them. Afterward, you can use the **Implement Price Change** action to compare the new prices with other price lists to avoid duplicates and ambiguity during price calculation.

#### Create sales price lines based on the unit price

1. On the **Prices Worksheet** page, choose the **Suggest Lines** action.
2. On the **Price Lines - Create new** page, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
3. On the **Product filter** field, define filters for the selected **Product Type**.
4. Choose the **Defaults** field to specify settings such as:
   * Which entities the price list will be assigned to.
   * Dates when the price is valid.
   * The currency code.
   * The amount type filter that defines the columns shown on the price list lines.
5. Choose **OK**. New lines will be added to the **Price Worksheet** page with the selected settings and the unit prices from the item cards.
6. Edit the created lines with the new unit prices or discounts. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

#### Create sales price lines based on existing price lists

1. On the **Prices Worksheet** page, choose the **Copy Lines** action.
2. On the **Price Lines - Copy existing** page, select an existing price list on the **From Price List** field.
3. On the **Price Line filter** field, define filters for the products on the selected price list.
4. Choose the **Defaults** field to specify settings such as:
   * Which entities the price list will be assigned to.
   * Dates when the price is valid.
   * The currency code.
   * The amount type filter that defines the columns shown on the price list lines.
5. Fill in the other fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
6. Choose **OK**. New lines will be added to the **Price Worksheet** page with the selected settings.
7. Edit the created lines with the new unit prices or discounts. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

## To copy sales prices

These steps differ, depending on whether your administrator has turned on the **New sales pricing experience** feature update. If the feature update isn't turned on, follow the steps on the Current Experience tab.

#### [Current experience](#tab/current-experience/)  

If you want to copy sales prices, such as an individual customer's sales prices to use for a customer price group, you must run the **Suggest Sales Price on Wksh.** batch job on the **Sales Price Worksheet** page.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Price Worksheet**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **Suggest Sales Price on Wksh.** action.  
3. On the **Sales Prices** FastTab, fill in the **Sales Type** and **Sales Code** fields with the original sales prices you want to copy.  
4. In the top section of the request page, fill in the **Sales Type** and **Sales Code** fields with the type and name you want the sales prices copied to.  
5. If you want the batch job to create new prices, select the **Create New Prices** checkbox.  
6. Choose the **OK** button to fill in the lines on the **Sales Price Worksheet** page with the suggested new prices, indicating that they're valid for the selected sales type.  

   > [!NOTE]  
   > This batch job only creates suggestions and it does not implement the suggested changes. If you are satisfied with the suggestions and want to implement them, that is insert them on the **Sales Prices** page, choose the **Implement Price Changes** action on the **Sales Price Worksheet** page.

#### [New experience](#tab/new-experience/)  

You can specify the settings that the price list will use:

* Use the settings from the header on the list you're copying.
* Use the settings from the list you're copying to. To use the settings from the price list you're copying prices to, turn on the **Use defaults from target** toggle.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Price Lists**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the price list to copy, and then choose **Copy Lines**.
3. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

   > [!NOTE]
   > You can't have two items that have the same settings but different prices. If that happens, a message will display when you activate the price list. You can choose the price to use by opening the list and deleting the incorrect price.

## To bulk update item prices

These steps differ, depending on whether your administrator has turned on the **New sales pricing experience** feature update. If the feature update isn't turned on, follow the steps on the Current Experience tab.

#### [Current experience](#tab/current-experience/)

To bulk update item prices, such as increase all prices by a percentage, you can fill in the Sales Price Worksheet page by using the following batch jobs:

* **Suggest Sales Price on Wksh.** suggests changes in one of two ways:

  * By applying an adjustment factor to existing sales prices.
  * By copying existing sales price agreements to other customers, customer price groups, or sales campaigns.

* **Suggest Item Price on Wksh.** suggests changes in one of two ways:

  * By applying an adjustment factor to existing unit prices on item cards.
  * By suggesting prices for new combinations of currency, units of measure, and so on.

  This batch job doesn't change the unit prices on items.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Price Worksheet**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **Suggest Item Price on Wksh.** action.  
3. On the **Item** FastTab, fill in the **No.** or **Inventory Posting Group** or other fields with the original item prices you want to update.  
4. In the top section of the request page, fill in the **Sales Type** and **Sales Code** with the type and name you want the sales prices copied to.
5. If you want the batch job to automatically adjust suggested item prices, enter the adjustment in the **Adjustment Factor** field. For example, you would enter 1.15 in **Adjustment Factor** for a 15% increase in item price.  
6. If you want the batch job to create new prices, turn on the **Create New Prices** toggle.  
7. Choose the **OK** button to fill in the lines on the **Sales Price Worksheet** page with the suggested new prices.
8. To implement the suggestions, use the **Implement Price Changes** action. The batch job creates suggestions but doesn't implement them. 

#### [New experience](#tab/new-experience/)

To update prices for multiple items, you must create a new price list, and then copy the lines from an existing price list. When you copy the lines you can use filters to specify what to copy, and you can specify an integer or decimal number in the **Adjustment Factor** field to increase or decrease prices. The price list must be in the **Draft** status. If needed, you can then deactivate the old price list.

> [!NOTE]
> You can't have two lines that have the same settings but different prices. If that happens, a message will display when you activate a price list. You can choose the price to use by opening the list and deleting the incorrect price.  

---

## Best price calculation

After you record special prices and line discounts for sales and purchases, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates the best price on sales and purchase documents, and on project and item journal lines.

The best price is the lowest price with the highest line discount allowed on a given date. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates best prices when it adds unit prices and the line discount percentages on document and journal lines.

> [!NOTE]  
> The following describes how the best price is calculated for sales. For purchases, the calculation is similar but is based on the available parameters. For example, item discount groups are not supported for purchasing.

1. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] checks the combination of the bill-to customer and the item and then calculates the applicable unit price and line discount percentage, using the following criteria:

    * Does the customer have a price/discount agreement, or does the customer belong to a group that does?
    * Is the item or the item discount group on the line included in any of these price/discount agreements?
    * Is the date within the starting and ending date of the price/discount agreement? For invoices and credit memos, this is the date in the **Posting Date** field on the document header. For all other documents, it's the date in the **Order Date** field on their headers.
    * Is a unit of measure code specified? If so, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] checks for prices/discounts with the same unit of measure code, and prices/discounts with no unit of measure code.

2. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] checks whether any price/discount agreements apply to information on the document or journal line. It then inserts the applicable unit price and line discount percentage using the following criteria:

    * Is there a minimum quantity requirement in the price/discount agreement that is fulfilled?
    * Is there a currency requirement in the price/discount agreement that is fulfilled? If so, the lowest price and the highest line discount for that currency are inserted, even if local currency would provide a better price. If there's no price/discount agreement for the specified currency code, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] inserts the lowest price and the highest line discount in your local currency.

If no special price can be calculated for the item on the line, then either the last direct cost or the unit price from the item card is inserted.

## Sales invoice discounts and service charges

When you use invoice discounts, the total amount on the invoice determines the size of the discount that is granted. On the **Cust. Invoice Discounts** page, you can also add a service charge to invoices over a certain amount.  

Before you can use invoice discounts with sales, you must specify certain information. You must make the following decisions:  

* Which customers will be granted this type of discount?  
* Which discount percentages you'll use?  

If you want invoice discounts to be calculated automatically, on the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page, turn on the **Calc Inv. Discount** toggle.  

You can specify whether you'll grant invoice discounts when an invoice meets certain criteria for each customer. For example, when the invoice amount is large enough. Invoice discounts can be in local currency for domestic customers, or in foreign currency for foreign customers.  

You link discount percentages to specific invoice amounts on the **Cust. Invoice Discounts** page for each customer. You can enter any number of percentages. Each customer can have their own page, or you can link several customers to the same page.  

In addition to, or instead of, a discount percentage, you can link a service charge amount to a specific invoice amount.  

> [!TIP]  
> Before you enter this information, it's a good idea to prepare an outline of the discount structure that you want to use. The structure makes it easier to determine which customers can be linked to the same invoice discount page. The fewer pages you have to set up, the faster you can enter the basic information.

For training in discounts in sales, see [Set up discounts for your customers](/training/modules/customer-discounts-dynamics-365-business-central/index).

### Calculating invoice discounts on sales

[!INCLUDE [sales-invoice-discounts](includes/sales-invoice-discounts.md)]

## To set up a sales line discount for a customer

These steps differ, depending on whether your administrator has turned on the **New sales pricing experience** feature update. If the feature update isn't turned on, follow the steps on the Current Experience tab.

3. Fill in the fields on the line as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)] Fill a line for each combination that will grant a sales line discount to the customer.

> [!NOTE]
> When you open the **Sales Prices** and **Sales Line Discounts** pages from a specific customer, the **Sales Type Filter** and **Sales Code Filter** fields are set for the customer and can't be changed or removed.
>
> To set up prices or line discounts for all customers, a customer price group, or a campaign, you must open the pages from an item card. Alternatively, for sales prices, use the **Sales Price Worksheet** page. Learn more at [To bulk update item prices](sales-how-record-sales-price-discount-payment-agreements.md#to-bulk-update-item-prices).  

#### [New experience](#tab/new-experience/)

2. Choose the customer, and then choose the **Sales Price Lists** action.
3. Open the price list for which to specify the line discount.
4. Create a new line, or choose an existing line, and then fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
5. In the **Defines** field, choose either **Price & Discount**, or just **Discount**. 
6. In the **Line Discount %** field, specify the discount percentage.

    > [!TIP]
    > If you're editing an existing line, you can filter the lines by choosing the appropriate option in the **View Columns for** field.

    > [!NOTE]  
    > Invoice discount codes are represented by existing customer cards. This enables you to quickly assign invoice discount terms to customers by picking the name of another customer who will have the same terms. To set up customer-specific invoice discount terms, set the **Invoice Disc. Code** field to the customer's customer code, and then proceed to the next step.

## To set up an invoice discount for a customer

After you decide which customers are eligible for invoice discounts, enter the invoice discount code on the Customer Card pages. Then set up the terms for each code.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customers**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the customer page for a customer that will be eligible for invoice discounts.
3. In the **Invoice Disc. Code** field, select a code for the relevant invoice discount terms to use to calculate invoice discounts for the customer.

> [!NOTE]  
> Invoice discount codes are represented by existing customer cards. This enables you to quickly assign invoice discount terms to customers by picking the name of another customer who will have the same terms.

Proceed to set up the new sales invoice discount terms.

1. On the **Customers** page, choose the **Invoice Discounts** action. The **Cust. Invoice Discounts** page opens.
2. In the **Currency Code** field, enter the code for a currency that the invoice discount terms on the line apply to. Leave the field blank to set up invoice discount terms in USD.
3. In the **Minimum Amount** field, enter the minimum amount that an invoice must have to be eligible for the discount.
4. In the **Discount %** field, enter the invoice discount as a percentage of the invoice amount.
5. Repeat steps 5 through 7 for each currency that the customer will receive a different invoice discount for.

# Creating Power BI reports for displaying list data in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]

[!INCLUDE[prod_long](includes/prod_long.md)] includes a Power BI FactBox control element on many key list pages. The purpose of this FactBox is to display Power BI reports that are related to records in the lists, providing extra insight into the data. The idea is that as you move between rows in the list, the report updates for the selected entry.

[!INCLUDE[prod_long](includes/prod_long.md)] comes ready with some of these reports. You can also create your own custom reports that display in this FactBox. Creating these reports is similar to other reports. But there are a few design rules you have to follow to make sure the reports display as expected. These rules are explained in this article.

> [!NOTE]
> For general information about creating and publishing Power BI reports for Business Central, see [Building Power BI Reports to Display [!INCLUDE [prod_long](includes/prod_long.md)] Data](across-how-use-financials-data-source-powerbi.md). 

## Prerequisites

- A Power BI account.
- Power BI Desktop.

<!-- 
For more information about getting started, see [Use [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] as a Power BI Data Source](across-how-use-financials-data-source-powerbi.md).-->

1. Start Power BI Desktop.
2. Select **Get Data**, and start choosing the data source for the report.

    Specify the Business Central list pages that contain the data that you want in the report. For example, to create a report for the **Sales Invoices** list, include pages related to sales.

    For more information, follow the instructions [Add [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] as a data source in Power BI Desktop](across-how-use-financials-data-source-powerbi.md#getdata).

3. Set the report filter.

    To make the data update to the selected record in the list, you add a filter to the report. The filter must include a field of the data source that's used to uniquely identify each record in the list. In developer terms, this field is the *primary key*. In most cases, the primary key for a list is the **No.** field.

    To set the filter, do the following steps:

    1. In the **Filters**, select the primary key field from the list of available fields.
    2. Drag the field to **Filters** pane and drop it in the **Filters on all pages** box.
    3. Set the **Filter type** to **Basic filtering**. It can't be page, visual, or advanced filter.

    ![Setting the report filter for the Sales Invoice Activity report.](./media/across-how-use-powerbi-reports-factbox/financials-powerbi-report-filter-v3.png)
4. Design the report layout.

    Create the layout by dragging fields and adding visualizations. For more information, see, [Work with Report view in Power BI Desktop](/power-bi/create-reports/desktop-report-view) in the Power BI documentation.

5. See the next sections about sizing the report and using multiple pages.

6. Save and name the report.

    Give the report a name that contains the name of the list page associated with the report, as it is in the client. The name isn't case-sensitive though. Suppose the report is for the **Sales Invoices** list page. In this case, include the words **sales invoices** somewhere in the name, like **my sales invoices.pbix** or **my_Sales Invoices_list.pbix**.

    This naming convention isn't a requirement. However, it makes selecting reports in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] quicker. When the report selection page opens from a list page, it's automatically applied a filter based on the page name. The filter has the syntax: `@*<caption>*`,  like `@*Sales Invoices*`. This filtering is done to limit the reports that are displayed. Users can clear the filter to get a full list of reports available in Power BI.

7. When you're done, publish the report as usual.

    For more information, see [Publishing a Report](across-how-use-financials-data-source-powerbi.md#publish-reports).

8. Test the report.

    Once the report's been published to your workspace, it should be available from the Power BI FactBox on the list page in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

    To test it, do the following steps.

    1. Open [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and go to the list page.
    2. If you don't see the Power BI FactBox, go the action bar, then select **Actions** > **Display** > **Show/Hide Power BI Reports**.
    3. In the Power BI FactBox, select **Select Reports**, select the **Enable** box for the report, then select **OK**.

    If designed correctly, the report displays.  

## Set the report size and color

The size of the report must be set to 325 pixels by 310 pixels. This size provides the proper scaling of the report in the available space of the Power BI FactBox control in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. To define the size of the report, place focus outside of the report layout area, and then choose the paint roller icon.

![Setting the report width and height for the Sales Invoice Activity report.](./media/across-how-use-powerbi-reports-factbox/financials-powerbi-report-sizing-v3.png)

You can change the width and height of the report by choosing **Custom** in the **Type** field.

If you want the background of the report to blend with the background color of the Power BI FactBox control, set report background color to *#FFFFFF* (white). 

> [!TIP]
> Use the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] theme file to build reports with the same color styling as the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] apps. For more information, see [Use the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] report theme](across-how-use-financials-data-source-powerbi.md#theme).

## Reports with multiple pages

With Power BI, you can create a single report with multiple pages. However, for reports that display with list pages, we recommend that they don't have more than one page. The Power BI FactBox only shows the first page of your report.

## Fixing problems

This section explains how to fix problems that you might run into when you try to view a Power BI report for a list page in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

### You can't see the Power BI FactBox on a list page

By default, the Power BI FactBox is hidden from view. To show the FactBox on a page, from the action bar, select **Actions** > **Display** > **Show/Hide Power BI Reports**.

### You can't see the report in the Select Report pane

The report's name doesn't contain the name of the list page that's being shown. Clear the filter to get a full list of Power BI reports available.  

### Report is loaded but blank, not filtered, or filtered incorrectly

Verify the report filter contains the right primary key. In most cases, this field is the **No.** field, but in the **G/L Entry** table, for example, you must use the **Entry No.** field.

### Report is loaded, but it shows a page you didn't expect

Verify that the page you want displayed is the first page in your report.  

### Report appears with an unwanted gray boarder, or it's too small or too large

Verify that the report size is set to 325 pixels x 310 pixels. Save the report, and then refresh the list page.

# Get ready to synchronize master data

When two or more companies use some of the same master data, you can synchronize the data rather than add it manually in each company. For example, synchronizing data is useful when you're setting up new subsidiary companies.

Master data includes settings and nontransactional information about business entities. For example, customers, vendors, items, and employees. The data provides context for business transactions. The following are a few examples of master data for a customer:

* Name
* Identification number
* Address
* Payment terms
* Credit limit

You set up synchronization in the subsidiary companies. Subidiaries use a pull model to pull the data from the source company that they need to do business with them. After you set up synchronization and synchronize data for the first time, you're all set. Job queue entries update coupled records in the subsidiaries when someone changes data in the source company.

## Uni-directional synchronization only

You can synchronize data only from the source company to the subsidiary companies in a pull fashion. Subsidiaries can't push data to the source company.

> [!NOTE]
> Although it's possible, we don't recommend that you set up bi-directional synchronization. That is, synchronizing data from the source company to the subsidiaries, and from the subsidiaries to the source company. Synchronizing data in both directions can lead to conflicts or unwanted overwrites.

## Before you start

The following are requirements for setting up synchronization.

* All companies must be in the same environment.
* The user who sets up the subsidiary must have the **Essential**, **Premium**, or **Basic ISV** license.

> [!NOTE]
> The Team Member and Internal Administrator licenses let you access but not modify records, so they can't be used to set up the synchronization. The Delegated Admin license doesn't let you schedule background tasks, so you can't complete the setup.

## Specify the source company

The first steps are to specify the company that is the data source and enable synchronization. Subsidiary companies pull data from the source company.

> [!NOTE]
> When you enable synchronization, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates and schedules the job queue entries that synchronize the data. It might look like the entries immediately sync the data, but that isn't the case. The created job queue entries only sync coupled records, and at this point you don't yet have coupled records. Synchronization starts after you [Enable or disable tables and fields](#enable-or-disable-tables-and-fields) and [Synchronize for the first time](#synchronize-for-the-first-time).

1. In a subsidiary company, choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Master Data Management Setup**, and then choose the related link.
1. In the **Source Company** field, specify the company that you want to pull changes from.
1. Turn on the **Enable Synchronization** toggle.
1. In the confirmation dialog, choose **OK**. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] finds the tables and fields that are available from the source company.

The next step is to enable tables and fields for synchronization.

## Enable or disable tables and fields

To save time, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides a list of tables that businesses often synchronize. By default, these tables are enabled for synchronization. You can modify, disable, or delete them as you see fit. As an extra time-saver, some fields on the tables are already disabled because they probably aren't relevant for the subsidiary.

> [!NOTE]
> If one or more extensions are installed in the source company, when a subsidiary sets up synchronization the **Synchronization Tables** page includes tables from the extensions, and you can access their fields. However, if the source company adds an extension after synchronization is set up, each subsidiary must manually add the tables. To learn more about adding tables, go to [Add or delete tables from the synchronization tables list](#add-or-delete-tables-from-the-synchronization-tables-list). To learn more about extending [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], go to [Developing extensions in Visual Studio Code](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-dev-overview#developing-extensions-in-visual-studio-code).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Master Data Management Setup**, and then choose the related link.
1. Choose the **Synchronization Tables** action.
1. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](../archive/SetupAndAdministration/includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

> [!TIP]
> The **Table Filter** field is helpful for controlling what to synchronize for a table. You can set up filters to synchronize only when certain conditions are met. For example, you can add filters that specify that you synchronize only vendors in a certain region. Or, customers that use a certain currency.
>
> If the subsidiary already has data in their tables, another good way to set criteria for synchronization is to set up match-based coupling. To learn more about matching, go to [Use match-based coupling](#use-match-based-coupling).

1. To enable fields for a table, choose the table, and then choose the **Fields** action.
1. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](../archive/SetupAndAdministration/includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

> [!TIP]
> A fast way to enable or disable multiple fields at the same time is to select them in the list, and then use either the **Enable** or **Disable** actions.

### Use match-based coupling

You can specify the data to synchronize for a table by matching records based on criteria. On the **Master Data Management Setup** page, choose the **Match-Based Coupling** action to open the **Select Coupling Criteria** page. You can define the following criteria for your matching:

* Whether to synchronize after you couple records.
* Whether to create a new record in the subsidiary company if a unique, uncoupled match can be found by using the match criteria. To activate this capability, turn on the **Create New if Unable to Find a Match** action.
* The fields to use to match records, and whether the match is case-sensitive.
* Prioritize the order in which records are searched by specifying a match priority. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] searches for a match in ascending order based on the match priority. A blank value equals priority 0, which is the highest priority. Fields with the 0 priority are considered first.

## Synchronize for the first time

When you're ready, on the **Master Data Management Setup** page, choose the **Start Initial Synchronization** action. On the **Master Data Initial Synchronization** page, choose the type of synchronization that you want to use for each table.

* If you already have records in both the source and the subsidiary companies, and you want to match existing records, choose the **Use Match-Based Coupling** action. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] matches records in the subsidiary company with records in the source company. The matches are based on matching criteria that you define. For several default tables, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] already matched existing records by using their primary key, but you can change that if you want. You can also let the synchronization create new records in the subsidiary for records in the source company that the subsidiary doesn't have. To learn more about matching, go to [Use match-based coupling](#use-match-based-coupling).
* If you choose **Run Full Synchronization**, synchronization creates new records for all records in the source company that aren't coupled yet. For example, this option is useful in the following scenarios:

    * The subsidiary doesn't have data in the table.
    * You want to add records from the source company without matching.  

After you choose the option to use, choose the **Start All** action to start the synchronization.

While synchronization is running, the **Job Status** column on the **Master Data Initial Full Synchronization** page shows the status of each job queue entry. Press **F5** on your keyboard to update the status.

> [!TIP]
> Tables synchronize in a predefined order. If synchronization is stuck on a table, select the table and then choose the **Restart** action to get it going again.

To access details, such as the number of records that are inserted or modified, choose the value in the **Job Status** column to open the **View - Integration Synchronization Jobs** page. For records that were inserted, you can choose the number in the **Inserted** column to access more details about the new records.

## Add or delete tables from the synchronization tables list

### Add a table

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Although tables that contain transactional data are available in the list, such as tables that contain ledger entries, you shouldn't choose them. Synchronization works only for tables that contain nontransactional data.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Synchronization tables**, and then choose the related link.
1. Choose **New**, and then choose the table to add.
1. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](../archive/SetupAndAdministration/includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

### Delete a table

> [!NOTE]
> If you delete a record in the source company, it isn't also deleted in the subsidiary. Keeping the record in the subsidiary helps prevent unwanted loss of data. The subsidiary can decide to delete the table if they want.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Synchronization tables**, and then choose the related link.
1. Choose the **Delete** action.

## Use export and import to share a synchronization setup

If you're setting up several subsidiaries that use the same or similar synchronization settings, there's a time saver. Set up one subsidiary company and then export its setup to an .xml file. The file contains the entire setup, including table and field mappings and filter criteria. You can then import the file to the next subsidiary. To import or export a setup, on the **Master Data Management Setup** page, use the **Import** or **Export** actions.

# Sales by Item (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Sales by Item** report gives a clear picture of your organization's item sales. It showcases key metrics for each item or item category. For example, the sales amount, quantities, and the cost amounts. You can break down the information further by the specific customers that buy the items.

:::image type="content" source="media/powerbi/sales/sales-by-item.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Sales by Item Power BI report" lightbox="media/powerbi/sales/sales-by-item.png":::

## Use the report

Leadership and management teams use the report to track item sales. Sales teams can use it to better identify key items.  

CEOs might want a list of the top-selling items by revenue, and be able to compare the list with how much each item contributed to the company's overall revenue. You can use this information to make strategic decisions about which items to focus on and how to allocate resources.  

Sales managers can identify which items aren't performing and implement sales promotions for them. You can also use this information to adjust inventory levels of different items, procure extra stock to assist with demand, or reduce stock levels for slower periods.  

Salespeople can tailor their pitch based on the sales performance for specific items. The report lets you identify high-performing items. You can also use this report to gain insights on lower-performing items so salespeople can spot opportunities to up-sell or cross-sell.

## Key performance indicators

The report includes the following key performance indicators (KPIs) and measures:

- [**Sales Amount**](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#sales-amount)
- [**Sales Quantity**](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#sales-quantity)
- [**Cost Amount**](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#cost-amount)
- [**Cost Amount Non-Inv**](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#cost-amount-non-inv)
- [**Gross Profit**](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#gross-profit)
- [**Gross Profit Margin**](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#gross-profit-margin)

[!INCLUDE[click-on-a-kpi-link](includes/click-on-a-kpi-link.md)] 

[!INCLUDE[powerbi-tip-track-kpis](includes/powerbi-tip-track-kpis.md)]

## Data used in the report

The report uses data from the following tables in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]:

- Item

# Collect payments with SEPA Direct Debit

With your customer's consent, you can collect payments directly from the customer's bank account according to the SEPA format.  

First, set up the export format of the bank file that instructs your bank to perform a direct debit. Then, set up the customer's payment method. Last, set up the direct-debit mandate that reflects your agreement with the customer to collect their payments in a certain agreement period.  

To instruct the bank to transfer the payment amount from the customer's bank account to your company's account, you create a direct-debit collection entry, which holds information about bank accounts, the affected sales invoices, and the direct-debit mandate. You then export an XML file that is based on the collection entry, which you send to your bank for processing. Any payments that couldn't be processed will be communicated to you by your bank, and you must then manually reject the direct debit-collection entries in question.  

You can set up standard customer sales codes with the direct-debit payment method and mandate information. You can then use the **Create Standard Cust. Invoices** batch job to generate multiple sales invoices with the direct-debit information prefilled. This is can be done manually or automatically, according to the payment due date.  

When payments are successfully processed, as communicated by your bank, you can post the payment receipts either directly from the **Direct Debit Collect. Entries** page or by moving the payment lines to the journal where you post payment receipts, such as the **Cash Receipt Journals** page. Alternatively, depending on your cash management process, you can wait and just apply the payments as a part of bank reconciliation.  

> [!NOTE]  
> To collect payments using SEPA Direct Debit, the currency on the sales invoice must be EURO.  

## How to set up SEPA Direct Debit

From the **Direct Debit Collections** page, you can export instructions to your electronic bank to perform a direct debit collection from the customer's bank account to your bank account according to the SEPA Direct Debit format.

> [!NOTE]
> The global version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports the SEPA direct debit format only. Your country/region version may support other formats for electronic payment. See under **Local Functionality** in the table of contents.  

To enable export of a bank file format that aren't supported out of the box in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can set up a data exchange definition by using the data exchange framework. For more information, see [Set Up Data Exchange Definitions](across-how-to-set-up-data-exchange-definitions.md).  

Before you can process customer payments electronically by exporting direct debit instructions in the SEPA Direct Debit format, you must perform the following setup steps:  

* Set up the export format of the bank file that instructs your bank to perform a direct debit collection from the customer's bank account to your bank account.  
* Set up the customer's payment method.  
* Set up the direct-debit mandate that reflects your agreement with the customer to collect their payments in a certain agreement period.

    |**Valid To**|Specify the date when the direct\-debit mandate ends.|  
    |**Date of Signature**|Specify the date when the customer signed the direct\-debit mandate.|  
    |**Type of Payment**|Specify if the agreement covers multiple (**Recurring**) or a single (**One Off**) direct debit collection.|  
    |**Expected Number of Debits**|Specify how many direct debit collections you expect to make. This field is only relevant if you selected **Recurring** in the **Sequence Type** field.|  
    |**Debit Counter**|Specifies how many direct debit collections have been made using this direct\-debit mandate. This field is automatically updated.|  
    |**Blocked**|Specify that direct debit collections can't be made using this direct\-debit mandate.|  

6. Repeat steps 1 through 5 for all customers that you want to set up for SEPA Direct Debits.  

 The direct-debit mandate is automatically inserted in the **Direct Debit Mandate ID** field when you create a sales invoice for the customer that you selected in step 2. For more information, see [Create Recurring Sales and Purchase Lines](sales-how-work-standard-lines.md).

## Creating SEPA Direct Debit Collection Entries and Export to a Bank File

To instruct the bank to transfer the payment amount from the customer's bank account to your company's account, you create a direct-debit collection, which holds information about the customer's bank account, the affected sales invoices, and the direct-debit mandate. From the resulting direct-debit collection entry, you then export an XML file that you send or upload to your electronic bank for processing. Any payments that couldn't be processed by the bank will be communicated to you by your bank, and you must then manually reject the direct debit-collection entries in question.  

 > [!NOTE]  
 > To collect payments using SEPA Direct Debit, the currency on the sales invoice must be EURO.  

### To create a direct-debit collection  

 1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Direct Debit Collections**, and then choose the related link.  
 2. On the **Direct Debit Collections** page, choose the **Create Direct Debit Collection** action.  
 3. On the **Create Direct Debit Collection** page, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|

    |**From Due Date**|Specify the earliest payment due date on sales invoices that you want to create a direct-debit collection for.|  
    |**To Due Date**|Specify the latest payment due date on sales invoices that you want to create a direct-debit collection for.|  
    |**Partner Type**|Specify if the direct-debit collection is made for customers of type **Company** or **Person**.|  
    |**Only Customers With Valid Mandate**|Specify if a direct-debit collection is created for customers who have a valid direct-debit mandate. **Note:**  A direct-debit collection is created even if the **Direct Debit Mandate ID** field isn't filled on the sales invoice.|  
    |**Only Invoices With Valid Mandate**|Specify if a direct-debit collection is only created for sales invoices if a valid direct-debit mandate is selected in the **Direct Debit Mandate ID** field on the sales invoice.|  
    |**Bank Account No.**|Specify which of your company's bank accounts the collected payment will be transferred to from the customer's bank account.|  
    |**Bank Account Name**|Specifies the name of the bank account that you select in the **Bank Account No.** field. This field is filled automatically.|  

 4. Choose the **OK** button.  

A direct-debit collection is added to the **Direct Debit Collections** page, and one or more direct-debit collection entries are created.  

### To export a direct-debit collection entry to a bank file

 1. On the **Direct Debit Collections** page, choose the **Direct Debit Collect. Entries** action.  
 2. On the **Direct Debit Collect. Entries** page, select the entry that you want to export, and then choose the **Create Direct Debit File** action.  
 3. Save the export file to the location from where you send or upload it to your electronic bank.  

      On the **Direct Debit Collect. Entries** page, the **Direct Debit Collection Status** field is changed to File Created. On the **SEPA Direct Debit Mandates** page, the **Debit Counter** field is updated with one count.  

 If the exported file can't be processed, for example because the customer is insolvent, you can reject the direct-debit collection entry. If the exported file is successfully processed by the bank, the due payments of the involved sales invoices are automatically collected from the involved customers. In that case you can close the collection.  

### To reject a direct-debit collection entry  

* On the **Direct Debit Collect. Entries** page, select the entry that wasn't successfully processed, and then choose the **Reject Entry** action.  

    The value in the **Status** field on the **Direct Debit Collect. Entries** page is changed to **Rejected**.  

### To close a direct-debit collection

* On the **Direct Debit Collect. Entries** page, select the entry that was successfully processed, and then choose the **Close Collection** action.  

    The related direct-debit collection is closed.  

 You can now proceed to post receipts of payment for the involved sales invoices. You can do this as you typically post payment receipts, such as on the **Payment Registration** page, or you can post the related payment receipts directly from the **Direct Debit Collect. Entries** page. For more information, see [Collect Payments with SEPA Direct Debit](finance-collect-payments-with-sepa-direct-debit.md).

## Posting SEPA Direct Debit Payment Receipts

When a direct debit collection is successfully processed by your bank, you can proceed to post receipt of the payment for the involved sales invoices. For more information, see [Create SEPA Direct Debit Collection Entries and Export to a Bank File](finance-collect-payments-with-sepa-direct-debit.md#creating-sepa-direct-debit-collection-entries-and-export-to-a-bank-file).  

You can post the payment receipt directly from the **Direct Debit Collections** page or the **Direct Debit Collect. Entries** page. Alternatively, you can relay the work to another user by preparing the related journal lines.  

### To post a direct-debit payment receipt from the Direct Debit Collections page

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Direct Debit Collections**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select a line for a direct debit collection that has been exported to a bank file and successfully processed by the bank.
3. Choose the **Post Payment Receipts** action.  
4. On the **Post Direct Debit Collection** page, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Direct Debit Collection No.**|Specify the direct debit collection that you want to post payment receipt for.|  
    |**General Journal Template**|Specify which general journal template to use for posting the payment receipt, such as the template for cash receipts.|  
    |**General Journal Batch Name**|Specify which general journal batch to use for posting the payment receipt.|  
    |**Create Journal Only**|Select this check box if you don't want to post the payment receipt when you choose the **OK** button. The payment receipt will be prepared in the specified journal and won't be posted until someone posts the journal lines in question.|  

5. Choose the **OK** button.

# Moving Averages (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Moving Averages** report provides a comprehensive overview of your average purchases over a 30-day period. This report focuses on the purchase amount and compares the current purchase amount to a 30-day average. The comparison lets you quickly identify deviations from the norm. Use this information to address issues and ensure that purchasing activities align with business operations and profitability.

:::image type="content" source="media/purchases/purchases-moving-averages.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Moving Averages Power BI report" lightbox="media/purchases/purchases-moving-averages.png":::

## Use the report

The report helps management teams find key trends and make changes based on average purchase metrics.

CEOs need to track the moving average of purchase amounts over a specific period. Use this report to see performance trends and get help to make short term strategic decisions based on the trends.

Purchasing managers want to know which periods have a higher demand than others to plan purchasing schedules and budget accordingly. Use the report to analyze historical data and forecast upcoming trends so you can optimize inventory levels and reduce stock-outs.

For example, you might notice that purchasing demands are often higher towards the end of the year. You can work with your team to plan ahead and allocate staff to handle workload spikes.


## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The *Moving Averages* report includes the following KPIs and measures: 

- [**Purchase Amount**](purchases-powerbi-kpis.md#purchase-amount)
- [**Purchase Amount Average 30D**](purchases-powerbi-kpis.md#purchase-amount-avg-30d-fiscal)

# Understanding Assemble to Order and Assemble to Stock

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] lets you supply assembly items in the following ways:

* Assemble to order  
* Assemble to stock  

## Assemble to order

Use the assemble-to-order process for items that you don't want to stock. For example, for the following reasons:

* You'll customize the items for customer requirements.
* You want to minimize the cost of on-hand inventory.

The following list describes some of the benefits of the assemble-to-order process:  

* Customize assembly items when taking a sales order.  
* Overview availability of the assembly item and its components.  
* Reserve assembly components immediately to guarantee order fulfillment.  
* Determine the profitability of the customized order by rolling up price and cost.  
* Integrated with the warehouse to make assembly and shipping easier.  
* Assemble to order when you create a sales quote or a blanket sales order.  
* Combine inventory quantities with assemble-to-order quantities.  

In the assemble-to-order process, you assemble items for a sales order. There's a one-to-one link between the assembly order and the sales order.  

When you enter an assemble-to-order item on a sales order line, an assembly order is automatically created. The assembly order is based on the sales line, and its lines are based on the item's assembly BOM. The quantity of components on the assembly BOM is multiplied by the order quantity. The **Assemble-to-Order Lines** page shows details about the linked assembly order lines. The details can help you customize the assembly item. The delivery date is based on the availability of components. To learn more about assembling items for sales orders, go to [Sell Items Assembled to Order](assembly-how-to-sell-items-assembled-to-order.md).  

> [!NOTE]  
> Although it isn't part of the default process, you can sell inventory quantities and assemble-to-order quantities on the same sales order. To learn more about combining stock and assemble-to-order items, go to [Sell Inventory Items in Assemble-to-Order Flows](assembly-how-to-sell-inventory-items-in-assemble-to-order-flows.md).  

To specify that an item is assembled-to-order, in the **Assembly Policy** field on the **Item Card** page for the item, choose **Assemble-to-Order**.  

## Assemble to stock

Use the assemble-to-stock process for items that you assemble and store for future sales. Assemble-to-stock items are standard items, such as packaged kits, that you don't customize. You can also consume these items as subassembly components. The items are picked and processed as single items and are treated as finished production items. To learn more about assembly items, go to [Assemble Items](assembly-how-to-assemble-items.md).  

When you specify an assemble-to-stock item on a sales line, the item is treated like any other item sold from inventory. For example, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] checks availability only for the assembled item only, and not its components.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Although it isn't part of the default process, you can assemble an item to order even if the item is set up to be assembled to stock. Learn more at [Sell Assemble-to-Order Items and Inventory Items Together](assembly-how-to-sell-assemble-to-order-items-and-inventory-items-together.md).  

To specify that an item is assembled-to-stock, in the **Assembly Policy** field on the **Item Card** page for the item, choose **Assemble-to-Stock**.  

## Combination scenarios

When assemble-to-order and inventory quantities are combined on a sales order, assemble-to-order quantities must be shipped first.  

If an assembly order is linked to a sales order line, the value in the **Qty. to Assemble to Order** field on the sales order line is copied to the **Quantity to Assemble** field via the **Quantity** field on the assembly order. Learn more at [Sell Items Assembled to Order](assembly-how-to-sell-items-assembled-to-order.md).  

The value in the **Quantity to Assemble** field is related to the **Qty. to Ship** field on the sales order line. This relation manages how you ship partial and complete assemble-to-order quantities:

* When the full quantity on the sales order line is assembled to order
* In combination scenarios where part of the quantity is assembled to order and part is shipped from inventory.

The combination scenario allows flexibility for partial shipments. You can use the **Quantity to Assemble** field to specify the quantity to ship partially from inventory and by assembling to order.  

If the full sales line quantity must be assembled to order and shipped, the value in the **Qty. to Ship** field is copied to the **Quantity to Assemble** field on the linked assembly order when you change the quantity to ship. This update ensures that the quantity being shipped is fully supplied by the assemble-to-order quantity.  

However, in combination scenarios, the full value in the **Qty. to Ship** is not copied to the **Quantity to Assemble** field on the assembly order. Instead, a default value is inserted in the **Quantity to Assemble** field. The value is calculated from the **Qty. to Ship** field to ensure the assemble-to-order quantities ship first.

To deviate from the default, for example because you only want to assemble more or less of the quantity in the **Qty. to Ship** field, you can modify the **Quantity to Assemble** field within predefined rules, as illustrated below.  

An example of why you would modify the quantity to assemble is that you want to partially post the shipment of inventory quantities before you ship the assembly output.  

The following tables explain the rules that define the minimum and maximum values that you can enter in the **Quantity to Assemble** field to deviate from the default value in a combination scenario. The table shows a combination scenario where the **Qty. to Ship** field on the linked sales order line is changed from 7 to 4, and the **Quantity to Assemble** is therefore defaulted to 4.  

**Sales Order Line**

|                | **Quantity** | **Qty. to Ship** | **Qty. to Assemble to Order** | **Quantity Shipped** |
|----------------|--------------|------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------|
|**Initial value**| 10          | 7                | 7                             | 0                    |
|**Change**      |              | 4                |                               |                      |

**Assembly Order Header**

|                | **Quantity** | **Qty. to Ship** | **Qty. to Assemble to Order** | **Quantity Shipped** |
|----------------|--------------|------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------|
|**Initial value**| 7           | 7                | 0                             | 7                    |
|**Change**      |              | 4 (inserted by default)|                         |                      |

Based on this example, you can modify the **Quantity to Assemble** field as follows:  

* The minimum quantity you can enter is 1. You must assemble at least one unit to be able to sell the four units, assuming that the remaining three are available in inventory.  
* The maximum quantity that you can enter is 4. This limit ensures that you don't assemble more of the item than you need for the sale.

# Design Details: Inventory Periods
Backdated transactions or cost adjustments often affect balances and stock valuations for accounting periods that may be considered closed. This can have adverse effects on accurate reporting, especially within global corporations. The Inventory Periods feature can be used to avoid such problems by opening or closing inventory periods to limit posting in a set period of time.  

 An inventory period is a period of time, defined by an ending date, in which you post inventory transactions. When you close an inventory period, no value changes can be posted in the closed period. This includes new value postings, expected or invoiced postings, changes to existing values, and cost adjustments. However, you can still apply to an open item ledger entry that falls in the closed period. For more information, see [Design Details: Item Application](design-details-item-application.md).  

 To make sure that all transaction entries in a closed period are final, the following conditions must be met before an inventory period can close:  

-   All outbound item ledger entries in the period must be closed (no negative inventory).  
-   All item costs in the period must be adjusted.  
-   All released and finished production orders in the period must be cost adjusted.  

 When you close an inventory period, an inventory period entry is created by using the number of the last item register that falls in the inventory period. In addition, the time, date, and user code of the user closing the period are recorded in the inventory period entry. By using this information with the last item register for the previous period, you can see which inventory transactions were posted in the inventory period. It is also possible to reopen inventory periods if you need to post in a closed period. When you reopen an inventory period, an inventory period entry is created.

# Responding to requests about users' personal data

Data subjects can request several types of actions regarding their personal data. For example, under some privacy laws and regulations, they have the right to request the export, deletion, and modification of their personal data. These requests are called *Data Subject Requests*. If you have classified the sensitivity of your data, and are sure they are correct, an administrator can respond to requests by using the options in the **Data Privacy** tab in the **Administration of users, security groups and permissions** Role Center.

## Types of requests

The following table provides examples of the types of requests administrators can respond to.

> [!Note]
> While we provide capabilities for responding to these types of request, and thereby accessing, personal data, it's your responsibility to ensure that personal and sensitive data are located and classified appropriately.

|Request Type|Description and Suggested Response|
|-----|-----|
|Portability requests|A data subject can make a data portability request. You must export the data subject's personal data from your systems and provide it in a structured, commonly used format. To respond to these requests, you can use the **Data Privacy Utility** to export personal data to an Excel file or a RapidStart configuration package. Using Excel, you can edit the personal data and save it in a commonly used, machine-readable format, such as .csv or .xml. For RapidStart configuration packages, you can configure master data tables and their related tables that contain personal data. <br><br> **Note:** When you export data, you specify a minimum sensitivity level. The export includes the minimum and all sensitivity levels above it. For example, if you export data that is classified as Personal, the export also includes data classified as Sensitive. <br><br>When exporting data related to a data subject, the **Data Privacy Utility** looks for direct relationships between the data subject and data related to the data subject. Indirect relationships between data related to the data subject and other data are not exported automatically by the **Data Privacy Utility**. For example, the Contact table has directly related Contact Profile Answers data, and the Contact Profile Answers table is further related to Profile Questions data. If you want to export Profile Questions as well, you must add this table manually as a row with the appropriate filters in the configuration package that the **Data Privacy Utility** creates.<br><br>The **Data Privacy Utility** only considers tables of the type **Normal**. Data in other types of tables, such as CDS, CRM, ExternalSQL, and others resides in external systems, and portability requests should be handled in those systems.|
|Requests for deletion|A data subject can request that you delete their personal data. There are several ways to delete personal data using the customization capabilities, but the decision and implementation is your responsibility. In some cases, you might choose to directly edit your data. For example, delete a contact and then run the Delete Canceled Interaction batch job to delete interactions for the contact. <br><br> **Note:** If you've specified a date in the **Allow Document Deletion Before** field on the **Sales & Receivables Setup** or **Purchases & Payables Setup** pages, you might need to change the date so that you can delete posted sales and purchase documents that have posting dates on or before that date.|
|Requests for correction|A data subject can request that you correct inaccurate personal data. There are several ways to do so. In some cases, you can export lists to Excel to quickly bulk-edit multiple records, and then import the updated data. For more information, see [Exporting your Business Data to Excel](about-export-data.md). You can also manually edit fields that contain personal data, such as editing information about a customer in the Customer card. However, records such as general, customer, and tax ledger entries are important. If you store personal data in business transaction records, consider using the customization capabilities to modify such personal data.|

## Restrict data processing for a data subject

A data subject can request that you temporarily stop processing their personal data. To honor such requests, you can mark their record as blocked due to privacy to stop processing their data. When a record is marked as blocked, you cannot create new transactions that use that record. For example, you cannot create a new invoice for a customer when either the customer or the salesperson is blocked. To mark a data subject as blocked, open the card for the data subject, for example the Customer, Vendor, or Contact cards, and choose the **Privacy Blocked** check box. You may need to choose **Show More** to display the field.  

## Handling data subject requests when using a trial version

Certain types of personal data are part of a Microsoft 365 account, and only administrators can export the data. The process for handling data subject requests is different depending on the type of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] tenant.

If you have a paid subscription for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], users must contact their organization's tenant administrator to make a data subject request. Administrators have the administrative rights and tools to fulfill data subject requests.

If you signed up for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] from the [Trials](https://trials.dynamics.com/) page, and you're still using the trial version, users can download and export their own data in the [Work and School Privacy page in the Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/GDPRViralBlade).

On the Work and School Privacy page, you can also close your account. However, we recommend that you export and delete all data first. Deleting your account means that you lose access to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

You can still mark people as blocked due to privacy and export, edit, or delete transactions as explained elsewhere in this article.  

## Exporting data from tables not classified by data subject

If you must export data that isn't classified in a way so that it's automatically exported, such as data from the Profile Answers table, you must take the following actions:

* Consider whether you really must export supplemental data that isn't directly related to the contact.
* Add the table and relationship manually to the Rapid Start package and export it directly from the Rapid Start package. We generate a Rapid Start package for you, so that you can tweak it in such situations.

## Handling data about minors

If a contact person's age is below the age of legal consent according to the laws in your region, you can indicate that by choosing the **Minor** check box on the **Contact** card. When you do, the **Privacy Blocked** check box is automatically selected. When you receive consent from the minor's parent or legal guardian, you can choose the **Parental Consent Received** check box to unblock the contact. Though you can process personal data for minors, you cannot use the profiling functionality in Dynamics 365 Sales.

> [!Note]
> The Change Log can record details such as when, and by whom, the **Parental Consent Received** check box was chosen. An administrator can set that up by using the **Change Log Setup** guide, and also choosing the **Log Modification for Parental Consent Received** check box on the **Contact** card. For more information, see [Logging Changes](across-log-changes.md).

# Intelligent insights and cloud migration (on-premises only)

If you're using [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, you have full access to scenarios that are based on the intelligent cloud. For example, key performance indicators (KPIs) that are based on machine learning, or when you view your data in Power BI.  

However, if you use [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, you don't have access to the same insights. If you want to benefit from online scenarios, you must migrate to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online. For more information, see [Migrating On-Premises Data to Business Central Online](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/migrate-data) in the administration content for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

## Viewing Insights in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Online

For an on-premises environment for which data was migrated to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, the **Intelligent Cloud Insights** page in the online environment shows four key points of interest for most businesses:

- Cash availability
- Sales profitability
- Net income
- Inventory value

Next to the KPI charts, you get insights into potential areas of concern, including overdue payments. Choose each insight to explore the data.  

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Intelligent cloud insights.](media/across-intelligent-cloud/intelligentcloudApril19.png "Shows the Intelligent Cloud Insights page in Business Central online")

The page also connects to Power BI for even more insights. Optionally, connect to Azure AI for even more intelligent insights. For more information, see [The Sales and Inventory Forecast Extension](ui-extensions-sales-forecast.md).

# Revalue Fixed Assets

Revaluation of fixed assets can consist of appreciations, write-downs, or general value adjustments.

When the value of a fixed asset increases, you post a journal line with appreciation to the depreciation book. The new amount is recorded as appreciation according to the fixed asset posting setup.

When the value of a fixed asset decreases, you post a journal line with a lower amount, a write-down, to the depreciation book. The new amount is recorded as a write-down according to the fixed asset posting setup.

Indexation is used to adjust multiple fixed asset values, for example per general price changes. The **Index Fixed Assets** batch job can be used to change various amounts, such as write-down and appreciation amounts.

## To post appreciation from the fixed asset G/L journal

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **FA G/L Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Create an initial journal line and fill in the fields as necessary.
3. In the **FA Posting Type** field, select **Revaluation**.
4. Choose the **Insert FA Bal. Account** action. A second journal line is created for the balancing account that is set up for appreciation posting.

    > [!NOTE]  
    >   Step 4 only works if you have set up the following: On the **FA Posting Group Card** page for the posting group of the fixed asset, the **Appreciation Account** field contains the general ledger debit account and the **Appreciation Bal. Account** field contains the general ledger account to which you want to post balancing entries for appreciation. For more information, see [To set up fixed asset posting groups](fa-how-setup-general.md#to-set-up-fixed-asset-posting-groups).  
5. Choose the **Post** action.

## To post a write-down from the fixed asset G/L journal

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **FA G/L Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Create an initial journal line, and fill in the fields as necessary.
3. In the **FA Posting Type** field, select **Write-Down**.
4. Choose the **Insert FA Bal. Account** action. A second journal line is created for the balancing account that is set up for write-down posting.

    > [!NOTE]  
    >   Step 4 only works if you have set up the following: On the **FA Posting Group Card** page for the posting group of the fixed asset, the **Write-Down Account** field contains the general ledger credit account and the **Write-Down Expense Account** field contains the general ledger debit account to which you want to post balancing entries for write-downs. For more information, see [To set up fixed asset posting groups](fa-how-setup-general.md#to-set-up-fixed-asset-posting-groups).
5. Choose the **Post** action.

## To perform general revaluation of fixed assets

Indexation is used to adjust multiple fixed asset values, for example per general price changes. The **Index Fixed Assets** batch job can be used to change various amounts, such as write-down and appreciation amounts. The **Allow Indexation** checkbox on the **Depreciation Book** page must be selected.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Index Fixed Assets**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary.
3. Choose the **OK** button.

    Revaluation lines are created per your settings in step 2. The lines are created in either the fixed asset journal or the fixed asset G/L journal, depending on your template and batch setup on the **FA Journal Setup** page. For more information, see [Set Up General Fixed Asset Information](fa-how-setup-general.md).
4. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **FA G/L Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
5. Select the journal with the fixed assets that you want to revalue, and then choose the **Ledger Entries** action.  
6. Check the created entries, and then choose the **Post** action to post the journal.

    > [!TIP]  
    >   If the index figures are for simulation purposes only, you can create a special depreciation book to store them in. Then these entries will not affect any of the other depreciation books.

## To post other acquisition costs

You post other acquisition cost for a fixed asset from a purchase invoice or from a fixed asset journal in the same way as you post the original acquisition cost. For more information, see [Acquire Fixed Assets](fa-how-acquire.md).  

If depreciation is already calculated for the fixed asset, select the **Depr. Acquisition Cost** checkbox to have the other acquisition cost less the salvage value depreciated in proportion to the amount by which the previously acquired fixed asset is depreciated. This method ensures that the depreciation period isn't changed.  

The depreciation percentage is calculated as:  

*P = (total depreciation x 100) / depreciable basis*

*Depreciation amount = (P/100) x (extra acquisition cost - salvage value)*  

Remember to select the **Depr. until FA Posting Date** checkbox on the invoice, the fixed asset G/L journal, or the fixed asset journal lines to ensure that depreciation is calculated from the last fixed asset posting date to the posting date of the other acquisition cost.

### Example - Posting Other Acquisition Costs

A machine is purchased on August 1, 2000. The acquisition cost is 4,800. The depreciation method is straight-line over four years.

On August 31, 2000, the **Calculate Depreciation** batch job is run. Depreciation is calculated as:

*book value x number of depreciation days / total number of depreciation days = 4800 x 30 / 1440 = 100*  

On September 15, 2000, an invoice is posted for painting the machine. The invoice amount is 480.

If you selected the **Depr. until FA Posting Date** checkbox on the invoice before posting, the following calculation is made:  

15 days of depreciation (from 09/01/00 to 09/15/00) is calculated as:

*book value x number of depreciation days / remaining number of depreciation days = (4800 - 100) x 15 / 1410 = 50*

If you selected the **Depr. Acquisition Cost** checkbox on the invoice before posting, the following calculation is made:  

*The other acquisition cost is depreciated as ((150 x 100) / 4800) / 100 x 480 = 15*

The depreciable basis is now *5280 = (4800 + 480)*, and the accumulated depreciation is *165 = (100 + 50 + 15)*, corresponding to 45 days of depreciation of the total acquisition cost. This calculation means that the asset is totally depreciated within the estimated lifetime of four years.  

When the **Calculate Depreciation** batch job is run on 09/30/00, the following calculation is made:  

*Remaining depreciable life is 3 years, 10 months, and 15 days = 1395 days*  

*Book value is (5280 - 165) = 5115*  

*Depreciation amount for September 2000: 5115 x 15 / 1395 = 55.00*  

*Total of depreciation = 165 + 55 = 220*  

If you didn't select the **Depr. until FA Posting Date** checkbox, the asset would lose 15 days of depreciation because the **Calculate Depreciation** batch job run on 09/30/00 would calculate depreciation from 09/15/00 to 09/30/00. This means that when the **Calculate Depreciation** batch job is run on 09/30/00, the calculation is as follows:  

*Remaining life time is 3 years, 10 months, and 15 days = 1395 days*  

*Book value is (4800 + 480 - 100 - 15) = 5165*

*Depreciation amount for September 2000: 5165 x 15 / 1395 = 55.54*  

*Total of depreciation = 100 + 15 + 55.54 = 170.54*

# Restrict and allow usage of a record

If you want to restrict a record from being used in certain activities, for example, until the record has been approved, you can add two workflow responses in the workflow that controls the use of the record. One workflow response restricts usage of the record as defined by the workflow event and conditions. The other workflow response allows the use of the record as defined by the workflow event and conditions. Two responses exist in the default version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] for this purpose: **Add record restriction** and **Remove record restriction**.

> [!NOTE]  
> The default version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers support for restricting a record from being posted, from being exported as a payment, and from being printed as a check. To support other restrictions, a Microsoft partner must customize the application code.  

> [!NOTE]  
> The workflow functionality to restrict and allow records from being used is not related to the functionality to block item, customer, and vendor records from being posted.

The following procedure describes how to restrict purchase orders from being posted until they've been approved. The new workflow is based on the *Purchase Invoice Approval Workflow* template.  

## Create a workflow step that restricts posting of unapproved purchase orders

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Workflows**, then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Workflows** page, choose the **New Workflow from Template** action. Learn more at [Create Workflows from Workflow Templates](across-how-to-create-workflows-from-workflow-templates.md).
3. On the **Workflow Templates** page, choose the *Purchase Invoice Approval Workflow* template.  

   Note that the first two workflow steps are about restricting and then allowing usage of purchase invoices. Change the event condition on the first step of the new workflow to specify that it applies to purchase orders.  
4. On the **Workflow Steps** FastTab, choose the **On Condition** field for the first step, then, for the **Document Type** filter, select **Order**.  
5. Proceed to edit, delete, or add other workflow steps to reflect a business process that begins by restricting unapproved purchase orders from being posted.

> [!NOTE]
> For more information about the Microsoft Fabric release plan, see [aka.ms/FabricRoadmap](https://aka.ms/FabricRoadmap)
> 
> The regular publishing of this roadmap will help you stay informed about how [!INCLUDE[microsoft_fabric](includes/microsoft_fabric.md)] will address your needs.

## Where does [!INCLUDE[microsoft_fabric](includes/microsoft_fabric.md)] fit into [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] analytics

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] comes with many out-of-the-box reports and data analysis capabilities such as financial reporting, open in Excel, and analysis mode on lists and queries. On top of this, it's easy to define Power BI reports that read data from standard and custom APIs, define Power BI metrics scorecards, and embed all of these directly in the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] client. But for customers with more advanced data science or business intelligence scenarios that require richer data engineering or data integration, [!INCLUDE[microsoft_fabric](includes/microsoft_fabric.md)] might be a good option. 

## OneLake

A key part of [!INCLUDE[microsoft_fabric](includes/microsoft_fabric.md)] offering is OneLake. OneLake is a single, unified, logical data lake for the whole organization. You can think of OneLake as the OneDrive for data. It provides you with data lake as a service without having to build it yourself. OneLake comes automatically with every [!INCLUDE[microsoft_fabric](includes/microsoft_fabric.md)] tenant with no infrastructure to manage. All the data, which lands in OneLake, automatically takes part in out-of-the-box data governance such as data lineage, data protection, certification, and catalog integration. It breaks down data silos by enabling different parts of the organization to work independently while still contributing to the same data lake.

[!INCLUDE[microsoft_fabric](includes/microsoft_fabric.md)] items store your data in OneLake in an open file format. For structured tabular data, this format is *delta parquet*. Delta parquet format allows every analytics engine in [!INCLUDE[microsoft_fabric](includes/microsoft_fabric.md)] to access the data from other analytics engines. This way, it allows flexibility for data practitioners to use the tools of your choice.

# Create production BOMs

A production bill of material (BOM) holds master data that describes the components and subassemblies used in the production of an item. When you create a production order for an item, its production BOM governs the calculation of material requirements as represented on the **Prod. Order Components** page.

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] also supports assembly BOMs. Use assembly orders to make end items from components in a process that one or more basic resources, which aren't machine or work centers, can do. Or, a process that can complete without any resources. For example, an assembly process could be to pick two wine bottles and one coffee sack and then pack them as a gift item. To learn more, go to [Assembly BOMs or Production BOMs](inventory-how-work-boms.md#assembly-boms-or-production-boms).  

> [!TIP]
> The **Contoso Coffee Demo Data** app includes demonstration products for a variety of production BOM scenarios that can be used on a test environment, including during a trial. Learn how to set up the Contoso Coffee Data and find walkthroughs for different scenarios at [Introduction to Contoso Coffee Demo Data](contoso-coffee/contoso-coffee-intro.md).

Before you can set up a routing, the following setups must be in place:  

- Item cards are created for parent items that take part in manufacturing. To learn more, go to [Register New Items](inventory-how-register-new-items.md).
- Production resources are set up. To learn more, go to [Set Up Work Centers and Machine Centers](production-how-to-set-up-work-and-machine-centers.md).

## To create a production BOM

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Production BOMs**, then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
4. To edit the BOM, set the **Status** field to **New** or **Under Development**. To activate it, set the **Status** field to **Certified**.  

    Proceed to fill in the production BOM lines.
5. In the **Type** field, select whether the item on this BOM line is an ordinary item or a production BOM. If the item on the line is a production BOM, then it must already exist as a certified production BOM.  
6. In the **No.** field, look up and select the item or production BOM in question, or type it in the field.  

   > [!TIP]
   > If you need to add several items, you can use the **Select items** action to select and add them. You can also use the **Edit in Excel** action. You can make changes to records in Excel, and then update the data in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. To learn more about the Edit in Excel action, go to [Edit in Excel](across-work-with-excel.md#edit-in-excel).

7. In the **Quantity per** field, enter how many units of the item go into the parent item, for example, 4 wheels for 1 car.  
8. In the **Scrap %** field, you can enter a fixed percentage of components that are scrapped during production. When the components are ready to be consumed in a released production order, this percentage is added to the expected quantity in the **Consumption Quantity** field in a production journal. To learn more, go to [Register Consumption and Output](production-how-to-register-consumption-and-output.md).  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > This scrap percentage represents components that are scrapped during production when picking from inventory. The scrap percentage on routing lines represents scrapped output before it's put in inventory.  

9. In the **Routing Link Code** field, enter a code to connect the component to a specific operation. To learn more, go to [To create routing links](production-how-to-create-routings.md#to-create-routing-links).
10. To copy lines from an existing production BOM, choose the **Copy BOM** action to select existing lines.  
11. Certify the production BOM.  
12. You can now attach the new production BOM to the card of the parent item in question. To learn more, go to [Register New Items](inventory-how-register-new-items.md).  

> [!NOTE]  
> [!INCLUDE [bom-standard-cost](includes/bom-standard-cost.md)] To recalculate the item's standard cost from the item card, choose the **Production** action, then choose the **Calc. Production Std. Cost** action. You can also calculate and update the standard cost for one or many items on the **Standard Cost Worksheet** page. To learn more, go to [Updating standard costs with the Standard Cost Worksheet](finance-about-calculating-standard-cost.md#updating-standard-costs-with-the-standard-cost-worksheet).  

## To create a new version of a production BOM

For example, use new versions of production BOMs when an item is replaced, or when a customer requires a special version of a product. The version principle enables various versions of a production BOM to be managed. The structure of the production BOM version corresponds to the structure of the production BOM. The basic difference is in the time validity of the versions. The starting date defines the validity.  

The starting date indicates the start of the period in which this version is valid. For all other considerations, the starting date is a filter criterion for calculations and evaluations. The BOM version is valid until the next version becomes valid for its starting date. You can quickly go to the certified BOM or BOM version that's valid on the work date by choosing the **Prod. Active BOM Version** action.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Production BOMs**, then choose the related link.  
2. Select the production BOM to be copied, then choose the **Versions** action.  
3. Choose the **New** action.  
4. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
5. In the **Version Code** field, enter the unique identification of the version. Any combination of numbers and letters is permitted.  

    The newly created version is automatically assigned the status **New**.
6. When the BOM version is completed, setting the **Status** field to **Certified**.  

The time validity of the version is specified by the **Starting Date** field.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Select the **Item** option in the **Type** field to use an item from your item master data in the production BOM. If the item also has a production BOM, whereby the **Production BOM No.** field is filled in on the item card, this production BOM is also considered.  
>
> Select the **Production BOM** option if you want to use a phantom production BOM on the line.  
>
> Phantom production BOMs serve for structuring products. This production BOM type never leads to a finished product but is used exclusively for determining the dependent demand. Phantom production BOMs don't have their own item master data.

## Compare production BOM versions

Use the **Production BOM Version Comparison** page to access a list of all production BOM versions and items and the quantity used per item. You can use the matrix to compare different production BOM versions for the used items per version, including the original BOM as the first column. This page gives you an overview of all BOM versions and their respective quantities.

## Quantity calculation formula on production BOMs

The quantity is calculated taking into consideration different dimensions that are also entered on the production BOM lines. The dimensions refer to an order unit of the respective item. The length, width, depth, and weight can be entered as dimensions.  

The Calculation Formula, Length, Width, Depth, and Weight columns aren't displayed, because they're only used by some users. If you wish to use the calculation of the quantity, you must first display these columns.  

The calculation formula defines the relation of the individual components. The following options are available as a calculation formula:  

- **Empty** - No consideration of dimensions. (Quantity = Quantity per.)  
- **Length** - Quantity = Quantity per * Length  
- **Length x Width** - Quantity = Quantity per * Length x Width  
- **Length x Width x Depth** - Quantity = Quantity per x Length x Width x Depth  
- **Weight** - Quantity = Quantity per x Weight  
- **Fixed Quantity** - Quantity = Quantity per

> [!NOTE]
> The **Fixed Quantity** calculation formula ensures that the consumption of a component is the same, regardless of the scrap or output quantities. For production order components, when the **Calculation Formula** field is set to **Fixed Quantity**, the **Expected Quantity** field value is always equal to the **Quantity per** field. The scrap percentage that is defined on the same line is ignored. Fixed quantity is respected by the **Availability by BOM** report. The report will show the item as the bottleneck if the available quantity is less than the quantity in the **Quantity Per Parent** field. The **Able to Make Parent** and **Able to Make Top Item** fields are always blank, regardless of the available quantity. Fixed quantity is also included in calculations for standard costs. The lot size for the produced item impacts the cost that is allocated for one item.

### Example

A production BOM requires 70 metal parts with the dimensions length = 0.20 m and width = 0.15 m. Enter the values as follows: Calculation Formula = Length x Width, Length = 20, Width = 15, Quantity per = 70.

Quantity per x Length * Width, that is, Quantity = 70 x 0.20 m x 0.15 m = 2.1 m2, gives the quantity.

# Validate VAT Registration Numbers

It is important that the VAT registration numbers you have for customers, vendors, and contacts are valid, if you use [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in a country/region that uses VAT. For example, companies sometimes change their tax liability status, and in some countries/regions tax authorities might ask you to provide reports, such as the **EC Sales List** report, that list the VAT registration numbers you use when you do business.

The European Commission provides the VIES VAT Number Validation service on its website, which is public and free. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can save you a step and let you use the VIES service to validate and track VAT numbers and other company information for customers, vendors, and contacts. The service in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is named **EU VAT Reg. No. Validation Service**. The service is available on the **Service Connections** page, and you can start using it right away. The service connection is free, and additional sign up is not required.

## Configure the service to verify VAT registration numbers automatically

To enable the **EU VAT Reg. No. Validation Service**, open the entry in the **Service Connection** page. If the **Service Endpoint** field is not already filled in, use the **Set Default Endpoint** action. Then set the **Enabled** field, and you are good to go.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To enable the validation service, you must have administrator permissions.

Optionally, set up templates for the types of VAT-related data that you want the service to also check. For more information, see the [Validation templates](#validation-templates) section.

When you use our service connection, we record a history of VAT numbers and verifications for each customer, vendor, or contact, in the **VAT Registration Log**, so you can easily track them. The log is specific to each customer. For example, the log is useful for proving that you have verified that the current VAT number is correct. When you verify a VAT number, the **Request Identifier** column in the log will reflect that you have taken action.

You can view the VAT Registration log on the Customer, Vendor, or Contact cards, on the **Invoicing** FastTab, by choosing the lookup button in the **VAT Registration No.** field.  

There are a couple of things to note about the VIES VAT Number Validation service:

* The service uses the http protocol, which means that data transferred through the service is not encrypted.  
* You may experience downtime for this service for which Microsoft is not responsible. The service is part of a broad EU network of national VAT registers.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> It is your responsibility to check that the data is valid. On occasion, data with errors is returned by the VIES VAT Number Validation service. If validation fails, validate the VAT registration numbers on the [web site](https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/vies/), print the result or save it to a shared location, and then add the link to the record for your customer, vendor, or contact. For more information, see [Manage Attachments, Links, and Notes on Cards and Documents](ui-how-add-link-to-record.md).

## Validation templates

You can use the VIES service to also check other company information, such as the address, as well as the VAT registration number. In the **VAT Reg. No. Validation Templates** page, create an entry for each country/region that you want to get further validation for, and then specify the information that you want to get validated automatically.  

For example, add an entry for Spain where you want to get validation for name, street, city, and post code, and then another entry for Germany where you just want validation for post code, for example. Then, in the **EU VAT Registration No. Validation Service Setup** page, specify the default template.  

> [!NOTE]
> Always make sure that the default template works for your needs. You can change the default to match your requirements, such as get validation for all fields or no fields.

The next time that you specify a VAT registration number, the service validates the number and any additional data as determined by your validation templates. If the specified values are different from the values that are returned by the service, you will see the details in the **Validation Details** page where you can accept or reset the values.

# Reconcile customer payments with a cash receipt journal or from customer ledger entries

When you receive a cash payment from a customer or give a cash refund, you can apply the payment or refund to close open debits or credits. You can specify the amount to apply. For example, you can apply partial payments to customer ledger entries. Closing customer ledger entries keeps customer statistics, account statements, finance charges, and so on, up-to-date.

> [!TIP]  
> On the **Customer Ledger Entries** page, red font means that the related payment is past its due date. If overdue payments are becoming a problem, we can help you reduce their frequency. You can enable the **Late Payment Prediction Setup** extension, which uses a predictive model that we built in Azure Machine Learning to predict the timing of payments. These predictions help you reduce outstanding receivables and fine-tune your collections strategy. For example, if a payment is predicted to be late, you can adjust the terms of payment or the payment method for the customer. To learn more, go to [Late Payment Predictions](ui-extensions-late-payment-prediction.md).  

You can apply customer ledger entries in several ways:

* Enter information on the following pages:

If you select **Apply to Oldest** in the **Application Method** field on the customer card, the application occurs automatically.

## To apply customer ledger entries in different currencies to one another

If you sell to a customer in one currency and receive payment in another currency, you can still apply the invoice to the payment.  

Here's an example. You apply Entry A in one currency to Entry B in another currency. The posting date on Entry A is used to find the exchange rate to use to convert amounts on Entry B. The exchange rate is found on the **Currency Exchange Rates** page.  

Applying customer ledger entries in different currencies must be enabled. To learn more, go to [Enable Application of Ledger Entries in Different Currencies](finance-how-enable-application-ledger-entries-different-currencies.md).  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Cash Receipts Journal**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the journal you want, and fill in the first empty journal line using a currency code.
3. Choose the **Apply Entries** action.
4. Select the line with the entry you want to apply to the entry in the cash receipt journal, choose the **Set Applies-to ID** action, and then select the entry you want to apply to.
5. Choose the **OK** button to return to the cash receipt journal.
6. Post the sales journal.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> When you apply entries in different currencies, the entries are converted to USD. Although the exchange rates for the two currencies are fixed, for example between USD and EUR, there might be a small residual amount when they convert to USD. These small residual amounts are posted as gains and losses to the account specified in the **Realized Gains Account** or **Realized Losses Account** fields on the **Currencies** page. The **Amount (USD)** field is also adjusted on the vendor ledger entries.  

## To correct an application of customer entries

When you correct an application, correcting entries are created and posted for all entries. The correcting entries are the same as the originals but have an opposite sign in the **Amount** field. The correcting entries include all general ledger entries derived from the application. For example, the payment discount and currency gains/losses. The entries that the application closed are reopened.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customers**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the relevant customer card.
3. Choose the **Ledger Entries** action.
4. Select the relevant ledger entry, and then choose the **Unapply Entries** action.
5. Alternatively, choose the **Detailed Ledger Entry** action.
6. Select the application entry, and then choose the **Unapply Entries** action.
7. Fill in the fields in the header, and then choose the **Unapply** action.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> If an entry was applied by more than one application entry, unapply the latest application entry first.

# Default data for sustainability

To simplify how you manage your sustainability accounts and emissions, you can create default values for the following entities:  

- **G/L Account** (only available default sustainability account)
- **Item** (available default sustainability account and emissions)
- **Resource** (available default sustainability account and emissions)
- **Work Center** (available default sustainability account and emissions)
- **Machine Center** (available default sustainability account and emissions)

> [!NOTE]
> Although you set default values, you can change them on journals and documents as needed. These values are simply defaults and aren't mandatory.  

## G/L accounts

To set up a default sustainability account for a G/L account, follow these steps:  

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Chart of accounts**, and then select the related link.
2. In the **No.** field, choose the number for the account you want to configure to open the **G/L Account Card** page.  
3. On the **Sustainability** FastTab, use the **Default Sust. Account** field to select the sustainability account you want to use as the default.
4. Close the page.

## Items

For items, you can use the manually entered sustainability account, or use the default value you have on the **Item Category**. The following processes explain both options.

### Specify a default sustainability account for an item category

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Item categories**, and then select the related link.
2. In the **Code** field, choose the code for the category you want to configure to open the **Item Category Card** page.  
3. On the **Sustainability** FastTab, use the **Default Sust. Account** field to select the sustainability account you want to use as the default for the category.
4. Close the page.

### Specify default sustainability values for an item  

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, and then select the related link.
2. Open the card for an item for which you want to set up default values.  
3. Add the default sustainability account:

   1. On the **Sustainability** FastTab, use the **Default Sust. Account** field to select the sustainability account you want to use as the default.  
   2. If you configured default sustainability accounts on item categories, select the **Item Category Code** you want to use on the **Item** FastTab. The default value for the category updates the value in **Default Sust. Account** field.

4. Fill in the following fields for default emissions for this item:

   1. **Default CO2 Emission**
   2. **Default CH4 Emission**  
   3. **Default N2O Emission**

   > [!NOTE]
   > You can add default emissions only if the **Replenishment System** is set to **Purchase**. For other options, you can only set up the **Default Sust. Account**. CO2e (carbon equivalent) is calculated based on your production or assembly processes. If you already filled in the emissions fields and then change the replenishment system to something other than **Purchase**, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] deletes the existing emissions.

5. Run the **Calculate CO2e** action to calculate **CO2e per Unit** field if you're just setting up this item and you don't have earlier transactions. By default, this action updates this item only. However, you can change the filter and apply it to a different range of items.  

   > [!NOTE]
   > The calculation of CO2e (carbon equivalent) is based on the default emissions you specified for the item and your setup on the **Emission Fees** page.  

6. Close the page.

> [!NOTE]
> The information you enter for emissions and the calculated **CO2e per Unit** are overridden by the system's calculations for this item based on **Sustainability Value Entry**. This data comes from the **Posted Purchase Invoice** page, and uses the average method of emission calculation. Therefore, manually calculated **CO2e per Unit** is only used before posting documents with the correct values. This means you can use manual creation for data planning (**Production BOM**, **Assembly Order**, and so on) before you post the related document.  

## Resources

To set up default sustainability values for a resource, follow these steps:  

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **resources**, and then select the related link.
2. Open the card for a resource for which you want to set up default values.
3. On the **Sustainability** FastTab, use the **Default Sust. Account** field to select the sustainability account to use as the default.  
4. Fill in the following fields for default emissions for the resource:

   1. **Default CO2 Emission**
   2. **Default CH4 Emission**  
   3. **Default N2O Emission**

5. Run the **Calculate CO2e** action to calculate the value in the **CO2e per Unit** field.

> [!NOTE]
> You must use the **Calculate CO2e** action to calculate the **CO2e per Unit** field because, unlike items, no other transactions affect these values. By default, this action updates this resource only. However, you can change the filter and apply it to a different range of resources.  

> [!NOTE]
> The calculation of CO2e (carbon equivalent) is based on the default emissions you specified for the resource and your setup on the **Emission Fees** page.  

6. Close the page.

## Work centers

To set up default sustainability values for a work center, follow these steps:  

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Work centers**, and then select the related link.
2. Open the **Work Center Card** page for a work center for which you want to set up default values.  
3. On the **Sustainability** FastTab, use the **Default Sust. Account** field to select the sustainability account to use as the default.  
4. Fill in the following fields for default emissions for this work center:

   1. **Default CO2 Emission**
   2. **Default CH4 Emission**  
   3. **Default N2O Emission**

5. Run the **Calculate CO2e** action to calculate the value in the **CO2e per Unit** field.

> [!NOTE]
> You must use the **Calculate CO2e** action to calculate the **CO2e per Unit** field because, unlike items, no other transactions affect these values. By default, this action updates this work center only. However, you can change the filter and apply it to a different range of work centers.  

> [!NOTE]
> The calculation of CO2e (carbon equivalent) is based on the default emissions you specified for this work center and your setup on the **Emission Fees** page.  

7. Close the page.

# Use e-documents in the sales process

You can use configured electronic documents (e-documents) with the following sales documents:  

- Sales invoices
- Sales orders
- Sales credit memos
- Service invoices
- Service credit memos
- Finance charge memos
- Reminders

## E-documents in sales  

To create and send an e-invoice to a customer, you must create and post the sales invoice. To learn more about the standard process, go to [Invoice Sales](sales-how-invoice-sales.md).

Before posting, you can choose to add the attachment to the invoice if you want to embed it in the Peppol file format.

After you post the sales document, open the **Posted Sales Invoices** page to access the related **E-Documents** page.

### View e-documents

To view existing e-documents, follow these steps.

1. On the **Posted Sales Invoices** page, select **E-Document**, and then select **Open E-Document**.
2. On the **E-Documents** page, on the header, you can view basic information about the posted invoice.
3. The **Record** field shows the document number of the posted sales invoice. Select the link to open the document.
4. In the **Electronic Document Status** field, you can view the real-time status of the document and its location in the process. If the document is posted, the status is **Processed**.

### E-document statuses and logs

For details about the service status level of your e-document, check the **E-Document Service Status** FastTab. On the lines, the system shows one or more services that the document used. In the most common scenario, each document uses only one service. However, a document can use multiple services.

- Check the **E-Document Service Code** field to determine which service was used.
- Check the **E-Document Status** field to determine the current service status for this document.
- If you want more details, select the **Logs** field for the service on the **E-Document Logs** page. A chronological overview of the different statuses for the document is shown.
- Check the **Entry No.** and **Created At** fields, and other information on the **E-Document Logs** page. In the **E-Document Status** field, the first status is **Exported**, which indicates that the e-document file has been created. The next status is **Sent**, which indicates that document was sent to the service provider, if configured.

For more insights, select the entry that has the **Exported** status, and then run one of the following actions:

- **Open Mapping Logs** – Get an overview of all exported fields from the sourced tables in the **Original Value** field. If you used transformation rules in the export process, you can also get the final value in the **New Value** field.
- **Export File** – Export the XML file for manual review.

To view the communication between yourself and the service that you're sending your document to, use the **Communication Logs** field. Open the **E-Document Communication Logs** page to view details about the request and reasons message with that service.

If there's an issue with the service provider, and the document can't be sent, look for the following indicators on the **E-Documents** page:

- The **Electronic Document Status** field on the header shows the **Error** status.
- The **E-Document Status** field on the **E-Document Service Status** FastTab shows the **Sending Error** status.
- The **Error and Warnings** FastTab contains one or more messages that provide the cause of the issue.

After the issue is fixed, manually run the **Send Document** actions. If you need different actions, such as **Recreated Document**, **Cancel Document**, or **Get Approval**, you can run them.

## Manually create e-documents when they weren't created automatically

Using e-documents requires some configuration, and sometimes people get that wrong. If there was a problem with your setup when you posted sales documents, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] might not automatically create e-documents for them. If that happens, after you fix your setup, you can generate new e-documents from the posted documents.

To check whether [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] created an e-document, open the **Posted Sales Invoice** page and select the **Open E-Document** action. If [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't find a related e-document, a message displays. Review your settings for your e-documents and correct any mistakes. To learn more about the setup, go to [Set up e-documents](finance-how-setup-edocuments.md).

When you're ready, you can run the **Create New E-Document** action to generate an e-document based on the workflow rules.

## Overview of e-document statuses

To get a better overview of all e-documents in the company, you can select the **Accountant** role center where e-document statuses exist. There, you can find e-document activities that have the following statuses:

- **Outgoing e-documents:**

    - Processed
    - In Progress
    - Error

# Register Employees

To use the Human Resources functionality, you must first add each employee by filling out the fields on the **Employee Card** page.

## Adding new employees

You can add new employees manually, by filling out the fields on the **Employee Card** page, or you can use templates that contain predefined information. For example, you can create a templates for different types of employee profiles. Using templates saves time when adding new employees, and helps ensure that the information is correct each time. If you create templates for more than one type of employee, you can choose the template to use when you add an employee. If you create only one template it will be used for all new employees. After you create a template, you can use the **Apply Template** action to apply it to one or more selected employees. To create a template, you fill in the information that you want to reuse on the Employee Card page, and then save it as a template.

> [!TIP]
> It can be helpful to personalize the **Employee Template** page when you create a template. For example, you might want to add a field that is not already displayed on the page. For more information, see [Personalize Your Workspace](ui-personalization-user.md#start-personalizing-by-using-the-personalization-mode).

You can modify an employee's details at any time. Keeping employee records up-to-date can simplify personnel-related tasks. For example, if an employee's address changes, you register this on the Employee Card page.

> [!NOTE]  
> You can reimburse employees for their expenses during business activities. For this purpose, you must fill in the fields on the **Payments** FastTab on the **Employee Card** page. For more information, see [Record and Reimburse Employees' Expenses](finance-how-record-reimburse-employee-expenses.md).

## To set up an employee

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Employees**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action.
3. On the **Employee Card** page, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

## To insert a picture of an employee

If you have a picture of an employee, you can insert it on the employee card.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Employees**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the card for the relevant employee.
3. In the **Employee Picture** FactBox, choose the drop-down button, and then choose **Import**.
4. On the **Select a picture to upload** page, then do one of the following steps to upload the picture file:

   [!INCLUDE[file-upload](includes/file-upload.md)]

The picture is inserted in the **Employee Picture** FactBox.

## To register various information about an employee

On the employee card, you can set up information, such as union membership, relatives, and contracts for the employee. The following describes how to set up an alternate address. The steps are similar for all other information that you can set up from an employee card.

You can use alternate addresses to keep track of your employees’ location, for example if they are stationed abroad, on a long business trip, or residing at a summer residence.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Employees**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the card for the relevant employee.
3. Choose the **Alternate Addresses** action.
4. **In the Alternate Address List** page, fill in the fields as necessary.
5. Repeat step 4 for each alternate address.

# Create workflows from workflow templates

On the **Workflow** page, you create a workflow by creating a series of workflow steps on the lines. Each step consists of a workflow event (When Event), moderated by event conditions (On Condition), and a workflow response (Then Response), moderated by response options. The fields on workflow lines provide fixed lists of event and response values that represent the scenarios that [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports. Learn more at [Create Workflows](across-how-to-create-workflows.md).

To save you time when you create approval workflows, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides workflow templates. The templates are available on the **Workflow Templates** page. You can use the templates as they are, or customize them to meet your needs. The codes for the workflow templates from Microsoft are prefixed with **MS-**.

[!INCLUDE [workflow-next-step](includes/workflow-next-step.md)]

If you change a workflow template, but later regret the change, use the **Reset Microsoft Templates** action to revert to the original setting for the workflow.

> [!CAUTION]
> The **Reset Microsoft Templates** action resets all of the Microsoft workflow templates. You can't reset a single template.  

Another way to quickly create a workflow is to import it, for example, if you exported it from another instance of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Learn more at [Export and Import Workflows](across-how-to-export-and-import-workflows.md).  

## To create a workflow from a workflow template

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Workflows**, then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New Workflow from Template** action. The **Workflow Templates** page opens.  
3. Select a workflow template, then choose **OK**.  

   The **Workflow** page opens for a new workflow containing all the information of the selected template. The value in the **Code** field is extended with, for example, "-01" to indicate that this is the first workflow created from the workflow template.  
4. To customize the workflow, edit the workflow steps or add new steps. Learn more at [Create Workflows](across-how-to-create-workflows.md).

# Synchronizing data in Business Central with Microsoft Dataverse

When you integrate [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can decide whether to synchronize data in selected fields of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] (such as customers, contacts, and sales people) with equivalent rows in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] (such as accounts, contacts, and users). Depending on the type of row, you can synchronize data from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], or vice versa. Learn more at [Integrating with Dynamics 365 Sales](admin-prepare-dynamics-365-for-sales-for-integration.md).  

Synchronization uses the following elements:

* Integration table mappings
* Integration field mappings
* Synchronization rules
* Records that are coupled

When synchronization is set up, you can couple [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] records to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] rows to synchronize their data. You can start a synchronization manually, or based on a schedule. The following table provides an overview of the ways you can synchronize.  

|  Type  |  Method  |  Learn more  |  
|--------|----------|-------|  
|Manual synchronization|Synchronize on a row-by-row basis.<br /><br /> You can synchronize individual records in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], such as a customer, with a corresponding [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] row, such as an account. |[Couple and Synchronize Records Manually](admin-manual-synchronization-of-table-mappings.md#synchronize-individual-table-mappings)|  
|  |Synchronize on a table mapping basis.<br /><br /> You can synchronize all records in a [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] table with a table [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] table.|[Synchronize Individual Table Mappings](admin-manual-synchronization-of-table-mappings.md#synchronize-individual-table-mappings)|  
||Synchronize all modified records for all table mappings.<br /><br /> You can synchronize all of the records that were modified in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] tables since the last synchronization.|[Synchronizing All Modified Records](admin-manual-synchronization-of-table-mappings.md#synchronizing-all-modified-records)|
||Full synchronization of all data for all table mappings.<br /><br /> You can synchronize all data in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] tables that are mapped. It also creates new records or rows in the destination solution for uncoupled records in the source solution.<br /><br /> Full synchronization synchronizes all data and ignores coupling. Typically, you do a full synchronization when you set up the integration and only one of solutions contains data. A full synchronization can also be useful in a demonstration environment.|[Run a Full Synchronization](admin-manual-synchronization-of-table-mappings.md#run-a-full-synchronization)|  
|Scheduled synchronization|Synchronize all changes to data for all table mappings.<br /><br /> You can synchronize [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] on scheduled intervals by setting up jobs in the job queue.|[Schedule a Synchronization](admin-scheduled-synchronization-using-the-synchronization-job-queue-entries.md)|  

> [!NOTE]
> The synchronization between [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is based on the scheduled job queue entries and doesn't guarantee real time data consistency between two services. For real time data consistency, explore [Business Central Virtual Tables](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/powerplatform/powerplat-overview) or Business Central APIs.

## Standard table mapping for synchronization

Tables in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)], such as accounts, are integrated with equivalent types of tables in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], such as customers. To work with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] data you set up links, called couplings, between tables in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)].

The following table lists the standard mapping between tables in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)].

> [!TIP]
> You can reset configuration changes made to integration table and field mappings to their default settings by selecting the mappings, and then choosing **Use Default Synchronization Setup**.

| [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] | [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] | Synchronization Direction | Default Filter |
|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------|----------------|
| Salesperson/Purchaser | User | [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] -> [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] | [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] contact filter: **Status** is **No**, **User Licensed** is **Yes**, Integration user mode is **No** |
| Customer | Account | [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] -> [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] -> [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] | [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] account filter: **Relationship Type** is **Customer** and **Status** is **Active**. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] filter: **Blocked** is blank (Customer isn't blocked). |
| Vendor | Account | [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] -> [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] -> [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] | [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] account filter: **Relationship Type** is **Vendor** and **Status** is **Active**. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] filter: **Blocked** is blank (Vendor isn't blocked). |
| Contact | Contact | [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] -> [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] -> [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] | [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] contact filter: **Type** is **Person** and the contact is assigned to a company. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] contact filter: The contact is assigned to a company and the parent customer type is **Customer**. |
| Currency | Transaction Currency | [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] -> [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] |  |

> [!NOTE]
> The **Dataverse** actions aren't available on pages, for example, the Customer Card page, for records that don't respect the table filter on the integration table mapping.

### Tip for admins: viewing table mappings

You can view the mapping between the tables in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on the **Integration Table Mappings** page, where you can also apply filters. You define the mapping between the fields in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] tables and the columns in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] tables on the **Integration Field Mapping** page, where you can add more mapping logic. For example, you might add mapping logic if you need to troubleshoot synchronization.

## Use virtual tables to get more data

When you're setting up your integration, you can use virtual tables to make more data available in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)], without help from a developer.

A virtual table is a custom table that has columns and rows that contain data from an external data source, such as [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The columns and rows in a virtual table look like a regular table, however, the data isn't stored in a physical table in the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] database. Instead, the data is retrieved at runtime.

> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] contains objects that are also called virtual tables. Those table objects aren't related to the virtual tables that you use with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)].

To learn more about virtual tables, go to the following articles:

* [Create and edit virtual tables that contain data from an external data source](/power-apps/maker/data-platform/create-edit-virtual-entities) (Power Apps documentation)
* [Business Central Virtual Table for Microsoft Dataverse Admin Reference](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/powerplatform/powerplat-admin-reference) ([!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] documentation)

To use virtual tables, you must install the **Business Central Virtual Entity** app from [AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-US/product/dynamics-365/microsoftdynsmb.businesscentral_virtualentity).

After you install the app, you can enable virtual tables from one of the following pages in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]:

* When you run the **Set up Dataverse connection** assisted setup guide, you can use the **Dataverse Available Virtual Tables** page to select multiple virtual tables. Afterward, the tables are available in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] and the PowerApps Maker Portal.
* From the **Dataverse Connection Setup**, **Virtual Tables**, and **Available Virtual Tables** pages.  
* From the Power App Maker Portal.

## Synchronize data from multiple companies or environments

You can synchronize data from multiple [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] companies or environments with a [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] environment. In multi-company synchronization scenarios, there are several things to consider.

### Set company IDs

When you synchronize records, we set a company ID on the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] entity to clarify the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] company the records came from. Integration table mappings have integration table filter fields that take the company ID into account. To include a table mapping in a multi-company setup, on the **Integration Table Mapping** page, choose the **Multi-Company Synchronization Enabled** checkbox. The setting optimizes how integration table filter fields filter company IDs in a multi-company setup.

For integration table mappings that synchronize documents, such as orders, quotes, and opportunities, if you choose the **Multi-Company Synchronization Enabled** checkbox the integration only considers entities that have the company ID of the current [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] company. To synchronize documents, for example, between Business Central and Sales, users in Sales must specify the company ID on the documents. Otherwise, the documents don't synchronize.  

For all other integration table mappings, choosing the **Multi-Company Synchronization Enabled** checkbox removes the filter on company ID. The synchronization considers related entities, regardless of their company ID.

### Specify the synchronization direction

If you enable multi-company support on an integration table mapping, we recommend that you set the direction of the mapping to **FromIntegration**. If you set the direction to **ToIntegration** or **Bidirectional**, it's a good idea to use **Table Filter** and **Integration Table Filter** to control which entities synchronize with which company. It's also a good idea to use match-based coupling to avoid creating duplicate records. Learn more at [Customize the match-based coupling](/dynamics365/business-central/admin-how-to-set-up-a-dynamics-crm-connection#customize-the-match-based-coupling).

### Use unique numbers

If your number series doesn't guarantee that primary key values are unique to each company, we recommend that you use prefixes. To start using prefixes, create a transformation rule on the integration field mapping. Learn more at [Handle differences in field values](admin-how-to-modify-table-mappings-for-synchronization.md#handle-differences-in-field-values).

# FAQ for suggest item substitutions with Copilot

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]

These frequently asked questions (FAQ) describe the AI impact of the sales line suggestions feature in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/production-ready-preview-dynamics365.md)]

## What is suggest item substitutions with Copilot?

In a business landscape that changes fast, companies often need to evolve the portfolio of products they sell. Whether it's adding new products, changing existing products, or adding entire product lines and categories, it's often time consuming to create and manage product (item) information.  

Reusing information from similar items can be a good option and Copilot can help you to identify similar items. An extra benefit is that suggest item substitution also reduces the risk of creating duplicated entries on the Items list page.

## What are the capabilities of suggest item substitutions with Copilot?

* Substitutions

You can store similar or interchangeable products on the **Item Substitution Entry** page. Copilot helps to add this information for current products by searching for similar ones in the database.

## What is the intended use of suggest item substitutions with Copilot?

* Substitutions

Intended to suggest item substitutions based on the description of the current item.  

Because the average number of items (products/services) for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] customers is 10.000, finding the right ones might be tough without prior experience or knowledge. The way [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] stores data doesn’t make things easier because you need to do multiple search or filtering exercises on the different pages that store product data.

To assist you in finding items, Copilot extracts keywords, other search terms, and synonyms from the product (item) description, and uses embeddings to find similar items in the database.

## How was suggest item substitutions with Copilot evaluated? What metrics are used to measure performance?

The feature underwent extensive testing with numerous prompts in US English representing both typical use and use by bad actors. Testing was based on [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] demonstration data and a large labeled product catalog available as open source.

This feature is built in accordance with Microsoft's Responsible AI Standard. [Learn more about responsible AI from Microsoft](https://aka.ms/RAI).

## What are the limitations of suggest item substitutions with Copilot? How can users minimize the impact of the suggest item substitutions with Copilot limitations when using the system? 

Find products works best in the English language. While you can use this feature in any of the languages that [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports, item searches in other languages might be less accurate.

If your industry or domain overlaps with what Microsoft considers sensitive topics (such as drugs, violence, adult entertainment, and so on) Copilot might defer to neutral, curated responses, or give inaccurate responses.

Suggest item substitutions only fills in the **Substitute Type**, **Substitute No.**, and **Description** fields. The **Variant Code** field isn't currently supported. If you can ship a product in two different colors, for example, Copilot finds the needed product but leaves the **Variant Code** field empty. You need to fill in the field manually.  

Catalog items aren't currently supported.

The maximum number of results is currently limited to 10.

How you name your products can affect the output. For example, using cryptic abbreviations versus friendly names can reduce output quality.

For products, the following table lists the tables and fields that Copilot searches.

|Table  |Fields  |
|---------|---------|
|Items     | * No.<br>* Description<br>* Description 2<br>* Search Description<br>* GTIN<br>* Vendor Item Number        |
|Item Variants    |* Code<br>* Description<br>* Description 2<br>         |
|Item Reference     |* Reference No.<br>* Description<br>* Description 2         |
|Item Attributes     |* Name<br>* Value         |
|Item Category     |* Code<br>* Description<br>* Parent Category - 1 level         |
|Item Translation     |* Language<br>* Description<br>* Description 2         |
|Item Identifier     |* Code         |
|Extend Text Line     |* Text         |

## In which geographies and languages is Suggest item substitutions available?

This Copilot feature is available in all supported [Business Central countries/regions](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/compliance/apptest-countries-and-translations). However, for customer environments located in countries/regions where Azure OpenAI Service isn't deployed, administrators must first consent to allowing their data to move across boundaries for Business Central to connect to Azure OpenAI service.

## What operational factors and settings allow for effective and responsible use of the feature?

AI-powered suggestions might sometimes be incorrect or incomplete. You should always review the accuracy of Copilot's suggestions before you choose whether to keep them. Copilot’s suggestions aren't saved to the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] database until you choose the **Keep it** button and exit the Copilot window. You can edit and correct any suggestions before you choose to keep it, or after they're inserted in item substitution page.

## What is expected of administrators and end-users when using Suggest item substitutions?

Each individual user chooses whether or not to use suggest item substitutions. Even when the feature is enabled by administrators and available, you can choose to use it always, sometimes, or never.

Administrators make the overall decision on whether to use Copilot capabilities in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. If administrators enable Copilot, they should be sure to grant access to the appropriate users.

> [!NOTE]
> * We don't support this feature in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises or private cloud.
> * Partner's can't extend this feature. That means partner developers can't modify, replace, or extend it.

## Is Copilot the only means to create item substitution entries? 

No, use of Copilot is optional. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers non-AI-powered ways to insert item substitution entries. Organizations can use both approaches at the same time.

## How do I give feedback about AI-generated content?

Each time Copilot provides suggestions, you can provide feedback to Microsoft directly from the Copilot window, using the Like and Dislike buttons. Your feedback remains anonymous and we use this data to improve the quality of the service.

# Send documents and emails

You can easily share information and documents, such as sales and purchase orders and invoices, by email directly from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], without having to open an email app.  

You can send almost all types of documents as PDF attachments. You can also set up a report layout that includes information from the document in the email text, and text that makes the email more friendly. For example, a standard greeting. To learn more, go to [Managing Report and Document Layouts](ui-manage-report-layouts.md).

When you send invoices, you can make it easier for customers to make payments through a payment service, such as PayPal, by automatically adding information and a link to the service in the email. To learn more, go to [Enable Customer Payments Through Payment Services](sales-how-enable-payment-service-extensions.md).

To enable emails from within [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], start the **Set Up Email** assisted setup guide. To learn more, go to [Set Up Email](admin-how-setup-email.md).

> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports only outbound email communications. You can't also receive replies from within the app.

## To send documents by email

This procedure describes how to attach a posted sales invoice to an email as a PDF file, and with document-specific email text. The steps are the same for other documents.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Posted Sales Invoices**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the invoice, choose the **Print/Send** action, and then choose **Send by Email**.
3. In the **Email** field, choose **Yes (Prompt for Settings)**. To learn more, go to [Set Up Document Sending Profiles](sales-how-setup-document-send-profiles.md).

    If the **Email** field on the **Send Document to** page is set to **Yes (Prompt for Settings)**, the **Send Email** page opens. The page shows the contact person in the **To:** field and the document attached as a PDF file. In the **Body** field, you can either enter text manually or you can have the field filled with a document-specific email body that you set up.

4. Choose the **OK** button.
5. In the **To:** field, enter a valid email address. The default value is the customer email address.
6. In the **Subject** field, enter a descriptive subject text. The default value is the customer name and invoice number.
7. In the **Attachment** field, the generated invoice is attached by default as a PDF file.
8. In the **Body** field, enter a short message to the recipient.

    If a document-specific email text is set up on the **Report Selection - Sales** page, the **Body** field is filled in automatically. To learn more, go to [Set Up Reusable Email Texts and Layouts](admin-how-setup-email.md#set-up-reusable-email-texts-and-layouts).
9. Choose the **OK** button to send the email message.

> [!NOTE]  
> If you don't want to specify email settings each time you email a document, you can select the **Yes (Use Default Settings)** option in the **Email** field on the **Send Document to** page. In that case, the **Send Email** page won't open. See Step 4. To learn more, go to [Set Up Document Sending Profiles](sales-how-setup-document-send-profiles.md).  

## To compose and send an email

You can quickly compose emails for contacts, customers, vendors, salespeople/purchasers, and bank accounts directly from the pages for those entities. Just choose **Process**, and then **Send Email** to open the email editor. For bank accounts, the **Send Email** action is under **Actions**.

> [!TIP]
> If you often send email messages that are similar, or want to send a bulk communication, using Word templates with email can speed up the process. For example, to advertise a sales campaign. You can create a template for entities such as customers, vendors, and contacts. Templates can generate the content of an email message for you. Templates can even personalize the content for the recipient based on data in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. To learn more, go to [Use Word Templates for Bulk Communication](ui-mail-merge.md).  

### Attach a document to an email

There are several ways to attach documents to emails.

If you're assigned to an email scenario related to the entity you're sending the email to, an attachment might be automatically added to your message. The attachment is added because a default attachment is assigned to the email scenario. You can delete the attachment if you don't want to send it with your message. To learn more, go to [Assign Email Scenarios to Email Accounts](admin-how-setup-email.md#assign-email-scenarios-to-email-accounts).

To attach a file yourself, in the email editor, use the following actions:

* Choose **Add file** to select a file.
* Choose **Add files from default selection** to manually add the default attachment from the email scenario.
* Choose **Add file from source document** to choose a file attached to the document you're working with. The files are either attached to the document itself, or one or more of its lines.

## Documents marked as printed when they're sent

Some documents in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] have a field that specifies how many times the document was printed. The number in that field is also updated if you send the document by email because a PDF file is generated for it. The number is updated even if you don't send the email.

## Sent emails and your email outbox

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] stores the emails that you send on the **Sent Items** page. It stores the emails to let you resend them, or forward them to someone else. If you can't find an email in your sent items, look for it on the **Email Outbox** page.

> [!NOTE]
> Depending on the extension that your company uses for email, administrators can access a list of messages that people sent, but not the content of the messages

The **Email Outbox** contains the emails that you saved as drafts and emails that failed to send. For example, if the email address was invalid. For messages that failed to send, you can choose **Show Error** or **Investigate Error** to troubleshoot the problem.

# Walkthrough: Create custom financial reports

The examples in this article describe how to create the following reports:

* Example 1 creates a Trial Balance report
* Example 2 creates a Balance Sheet report
* Example 3 creates an Income Statement report

> [!NOTE]
> The examples are based on the demonstration data that [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides for its CRONUS demonstration company.

> [!TIP]
> Formulas are expressed as a row number reference, such as "R" or "CA" (current assets), which adds all accounts with row number "R" or "CA."

## Example 1: Trial Balance

In this example, we have a new financial report called **Trial Balance** and a new row definition called **TB**.

:::image type="content" source="media/trialbalanceselection.png" alt-text="Shows the trial balance selection.":::

1. Open the new Trial Balance report.
1. Open the **TB** row definition, and choose **Insert**.
1. Choose the **Insert G/L Accounts** action to open the G/L Accounts page.
1. Filter the **Account Type** column to **Posting**.

   > [!TIP]
   > To quickly apply the filter, choose any row that has Posting in the Account Type column, and then right-click the Account Type column header and choose **Filter to this value**.

1. On the first line, choose **Show more options** :::image type="content" source="media/show-more-options-icon.png" alt-text="Show more options icon.":::, and then choose **Select more**.
1. Select all lines by choosing the radio button next to the first column header.

   :::image type="content" source="media/account type select all.png" alt-text="Shows how to select all lines.":::

1. Choose **OK** to assign all general ledger accounts with a totaling type of Posting to your row definition.

   > [!TIP]
   > To sum the results of all lines, add a formula on the last line of the row definition. Because this is a trial balance report, the expected result is zero.

Your trial balance report is complete. To view the report, choose the report on the Financial Reporting page, and then choose **View Financial Report**. Choose the column definition you prefer for the report. Often used column definitions for a trial balance report are **Balance Only**, **M-Balance**, and **Default**.

> [!TIP]
> If you add a new general ledger account to the chart of accounts, you must update your row definition to include it. Otherwise, your trial balance report won't balance to zero.

## Example 2: Balance Sheet

In this example, we have a new financial report called **Balance Sheet** and a new row definition called **BS**.

:::image type="content" source="media/balance sheet selection.png" alt-text="Shows a balance sheet selection in financial reporting.":::

1. Open the Balance Sheet report.
1. Open the **BS** row definition.
1. Map the accounts as shown in the following table. This example maps the balance sheet to the chart of accounts in the CRONUS demonstration company.

| Row No.| Description | Totaling Type | Totaling  | Row Type  | Bold  |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| | **Current Assets**| Formula | |Balance at Date    | Yes |
|CA | Cash                | Posting Accounts | 18000..18999 |Balance at Date|     |
|CA | Accounts Receivable | Posting Accounts | 15000..15999 |Balance at Date|    |
|CA |  Other Receivables  | Posting Accounts | 13000..13999 |Balance at Date|    |
|CA | Inventory           | Posting Accounts | 14000..14999 |Balance at Date|    |
|CA |Prepaid Expenses     | Posting Accounts | 16000..16999 |Balance at Date|    |
|CA |Other Current Assets | Posting Accounts | 100000..11999|Balance at Date|    |
|F1 | **Total Current Assets**  | Formula    |              |Balance at Date|    |
|   |                           | Formula    |              |Balance at Date|    |
|   | **Long Term Assets**      |            |              |Balance at Date|Yes |
|LTA|Fixed Assets         | Posting Accounts| 10000..12899  |Balance at Date|    |
|LTA|Accumulated Depreciation| Posting Accounts|12900..12999|Balance at Date|    |
|LTA|Other Long Term Assets | Posting Accounts|17000..17999|19000..19999|Balance at Date|
|F2 |**Total Long Term Assets**|Formula     |   LTA         |Balance at Date | Yes |
|   |                          | Formula    |               |Balance at Date |     |
|F3 | **Total Assets**         |            | F1+F2         | Balance at Date|     |

The following table describes the fields on the **Row Definition** page.

|Field  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|Row No.      |Alphanumeric codes are used for each section. The codes let you group by row number when you use formulas. Groupings help make formulas shorter and more simple. Each formula line is labeled with an alphanumeric code for easy identification.         |
|Description  | Used to hold the words to label each row of the report.        |
|Totaling type| Formula is used in three ways:<br><br>* To add the results of rows together.<br><br>* When combined with a section header or total.<br><br>* When inserting a blank row into the report.<br><br> Posting accounts are used to indicate that the row pulls the result of posted transactions based on the accounts listed in the Totaling column. |
|Totaling | Contains either a range of accounts shown as 10000..11999, or multiple nonconsecutive ranges of accounts shown as 17000..17999\|19000..19999.<br><br> Formulas are expressed as a row number reference, such as CA, which adds all accounts with Row No. of CA.<br><br> Following the general accounting convention of displaying financial report lines in the order of liquidity, general ledger accounts initially appear out of order. Notice that accounts show in the ranges created for each line. Totaling ranges let the report update dynamically when you add a new general ledger account to your chart of accounts.  |
|Row type     | Balance at Date is used for Balance Sheet reports.        |
|Bold         | Section headers and totals are set to Bold so they stand out.        |

> [!TIP]
> This example shows a summarized balance sheet, where each line is a group of related balance sheet accounts. Your report’s level of summarization is up to you. Good financial report design tries to provide enough detail to tell the story of financial performance without detailing every account. Avoid creating a balance sheet that is a categorized trial balance. It can be hard for people to digest such a large amount of information.

Continue to add balance sheet sections as shown in the following table. You can incorporate your own account groupings to create or replicate your company’s method of displaying accounts.  

The last line of this report is a check figure that the report complies with the accounting equation where Assets=Liabilities+Equity. The result of this check figure should be zero. If it isn't zero, it's a good indication that there's a problem:

* Some accounts aren't included in the report.
* Accounts might be included more than once.
* A formula in the report isn't calculating correctly.

Your balance sheet financial report is complete. To view the report, choose the report on the Financial Reporting page and select **View Financial Report**. Select any column definition to use with this report. The column definitions that are typically used for a balance sheet are **Balance Only**, **M-Balance**, and **Default**.

# Design details: cost components

Cost components are different types of costs that make up the value of an inventory increase or decrease.  

The following table shows the different cost components and any subordinate cost components that they consist of.  

|Cost component|Subordinate cost component|Description|  
|--------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
|Direct cost|Unit cost (direct purchase price)|Cost that you can trace to a cost object.|  
|Direct cost|Freight cost (item charge)|Cost that you can trace to a cost object.|  
|Direct cost|Insurance cost (item charge)|Cost that can be traced to a cost object.|  
|Indirect cost||Cost that you can't trace to a cost object.|  
|Direct cost-Non Inventory||Cost that you can't trace to a cost object.|
|Variance|Purchase variance|The difference between actual and standard costs, which is only posted for items using the **Standard** costing method.|  
|Variance|Material variance|The difference between actual and standard costs, which is only posted for items using the **Standard** costing method.|  
|Variance|Capacity variance|The difference between actual and standard costs, which is only posted for items using the **Standard** costing method.|  
|Variance|Subcontracted variance|The difference between actual and standard costs, which is only posted for items using the **Standard** costing method.|  
|Variance|Capacity overhead variance|The difference between actual and standard costs, which is only posted for items using the **Standard** costing method.|  
|Variance|Manufacturing overhead variance|The difference between actual and standard costs, which is only posted for items using the **Standard** costing method.|  
|Variance|Direct Cost - Non Inventory|The difference between actual and standard costs, which is only posted for items using the **Standard** costing method.|
|Revaluation||A depreciation or appreciation of the current inventory value.|  
|Rounding||Residuals caused by the way in which valuation of inventory decreases are calculated.|  

> [!NOTE]  
> Freight and insurance costs are item charges that you can add to an item’s cost at any time. When you run the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job, the value of related inventory decreases update accordingly.

# Depreciation methods for fixed assets

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports eight different methods of depreciation for fixed assets:

* Straight-Line (SL)
* Declining-Balance 1 (DB1)
* Declining-Balance 2 (DB2)
* DB1/SL
* DB2/SL
* Half-Year Convention
* Manual
* User-defined depreciation

## Straight-Line depreciation

With Straight-Line depreciation, you deprecate the asset value either with a fixed yearly percentage or with a fixed yearly amount over the depreciation period. When you use the straight-line method, you must specify one of the following options in the fixed asset depreciation book:  

* The depreciation period (years or months) or a depreciation ending date  
* A fixed yearly percentage  
* A fixed yearly amount  
* Depreciation period  

### Depreciation period

If you enter the depreciation period (the number of depreciation years, the number of depreciation months, or the depreciation ending date), the following formula calculates the depreciation amount:  

* Depreciation Amount = ((Book value - Salvage Value) x Number of Depreciation Days) / Remaining Depreciation Days*  

The remaining depreciation days are calculated as the number of depreciation days minus the number of days between the starting date and the last fixed asset entry date.  

Book value can be reduced by posted appreciation, write-down, custom 1, or custom 2 amounts depending on whether the **Include in Depr. Calculation** field is deactivated and whether the **Part of Book Value** field is activated on the **FA Posting Type Setup** page. This calculation ensures that the fixed asset is fully depreciated at the depreciation ending date.  

### Fixed yearly percentage

If you enter a fixed yearly percentage, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses the following formula to calculate the depreciation amount:  

* Depreciation Amount = (Straight-Line % x Depreciable Basis x Number of Depr. Days) / (100 x 360)*  

### Fixed yearly amount

If you enter a fixed yearly amount, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses the following formula to calculate the depreciation amount:  

* Depreciation Amount = (Fixed Depreciation Amount x Number of Depreciation Days) / 360*  

### Example - Straight-Line depreciation

A fixed asset has an acquisition cost of LCY 100,000. The estimated life is eight years. The **Calculate Depreciation** batch job is run biannually.  

For this example, the fixed asset ledger entry looks like this:  

| Date | FA Posting Type | Days | Amount | Book Value |
| ---- | --------------- | ---- | ------ | ---------- |
| 01/01/20 |Acquisition Cost |(Depreciation starting date) |100,000.00 |100,000.00 |
| 06/30/20 |Depreciation |180 |-6,250.00 |93,750.00 |
| 12/31/20 |Depreciation |180 |-6,250.00 |87,500.00 |
| 06/30/21 |Depreciation |180 |-6,250.00 |81,250.00 |
| 12/31/21 |Depreciation |180 |-6,250.00 |75,000.00 |
| ...      |             |    |          |          |
| 06/30/27 |Depreciation |180 |-6,250.00 |6,250.00  |
| 12/31/27 |Depreciation |180 |-6,250.00 |0         |

## Declining-Balance 1 depreciation

This depreciation method allocates the largest part of an asset's cost to the early years of its useful lifetime. If you use this method, you must enter a fixed yearly percentage.  

The following formula calculates depreciation amounts:  

* Depreciation Amount = (Declining-Bal. % x Number of Depreciation Days x Depr. Basis) / (100 x 360)*  

The depreciable basis is calculated as the book value at the beginning of the year. The number of depreciation days are the number of days between the posting date and the last depreciation date. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates depreciation assuming that any depreciation done in the fiscal year is done with this formula.  

The posted depreciation amount can contain entries with various posting types (write-down, custom1, and custom2) posted since the starting date of the current fiscal year. These posting types are included in the posted depreciation amount if there are check marks in the **Depreciation Type** and the **Part of Book Value** fields on the **FA Posting Type Setup** page.  

### Example 1 - Declining-Balance 1 depreciation

A fixed asset has an acquisition cost of LCY 100,000. The **Declining-Balance %** field is 25. The **Calculate Depreciation** batch job is run biannually.  

The following table shows how the fixed asset ledger entries look.  

| Date | FA Posting Type | Days | Amount | Book Value |
| ---- | --------------- | ---- | ------ | ---------- |
| 01/01/20 |Acquisition Costs |(Depreciation starting date) |100,000.00 |100,000.00 |
| 06/30/20 |Depreciation |180 |-12,500.00 |87,500.00 |
| 12/31/20 |Depreciation |180 |-12,500.00 |75,000.00 |
| 06/30/21 |Depreciation |180 |-9,375.00 |65,625.00 |
| 12/31/21 |Depreciation |180 |-9,375.00 |56,250.00 |
| 06/30/22 |Depreciation |180 |-7,031.25 |49,218.75 |
| 12/31/22 |Depreciation |180 |-7,031.25 |42,187.50 |
| 06/30/23 |Depreciation |180 |-5,273.44 |36,914.06 |
| 12/31/23 |Depreciation |180 |-5,273.44 |31,640.62 |
| 06/30/24 |Depreciation |180 |-3,955.08 |27,685.54 |
| 12/31/24 |Depreciation |180 |-3,955.08 |23,730.46 |
| ...      |             |    |          |          |

Calculation method:  

* Year 1: *25% of 100,000 = 25,000 = 12,500 + 12,500*
* Year 2: *25% of 75,000 = 18,750 = 9,375 + 9,375*
* Year 3: *25% of 56,250 = 14,062.50 = 7,031.25 + 7,031.25*
* ...

The calculation continues until the book value equals the final rounding amount or the salvage value that you entered.  

### Example 2 - Declining-Balance 1 depreciation

An asset's book value is 100,000 on 12/31/2022. You post a depreciation of 1,778 on 2/2/23, which is the expected (proportional) amount of the year's depreciation at 32 days. If you run depreciation on 6/30/2023 [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will suggest 8,222, because there are 148 days from 2/2/2023 until 6/30/2023. The expected remaining depreciation for 6/30/2023 is calculated using the following formula:

* *148/360 x 0.20 x 100,000 = 8,222*

### Example 3 - Declining-Balance 1 depreciation

If you post an amount that doesn't align with the Declining Balance 1 depreciation method, for example, 5,000, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] suggests the remainder of the expected amount.

An asset's book value is 100,000 on 12/31/2022. You post a depreciation of 5,000 on 2/2/2023, which is more than the expected (proportional) amount on 2/2/2023 at 32 days. If you run depreciation on 6/30/2023, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will suggest 8,222, because there are 148 days from 2/2/2023 until 6/30/2023. The expected remaining depreciation for 6/30/2023 is calculated using the following formula:

* *148/360 x 0.20 x 100,000 = 8,222*

### Example 4 - Declining-Balance 1 depreciation

An asset's book value is 100,000 on 12/31/2023. You post a depreciation of 95,000 on 2/2/2023, which exceeds the allowed depreciation amount for the year. If you run depreciation on 6/30/2023, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will suggest 5000, because there are 148 days from 2/2/2023 until 6/30/2023. The expected remaining depreciation for 6/30/2023 is calculated using the following formula: 

* *148/360 x 0.20 x 100,000 = 8,222*

However, the remaining book value is only 5,000, so [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] suggests 5,000 because a book value can't be negative.

## Declining-Balance 2 depreciation

The Declining-Balance 1 and Declining-Balance 2 methods calculate the same total depreciation amount for each year. However, if you run the **Calculate Depreciation** batch job more than once a year, the Declining-Balance 1 method results in equal depreciation amounts for each depreciation period. The Declining-Balance 2 method, on the other hand, results in depreciation amounts that decline for each period.  

### Example - Declining-Balance 2 depreciation

A fixed asset has an acquisition cost of LCY 100,000. The **Declining-Balance %** field is 25. The **Calculate Depreciation** batch job is run biannually. The fixed asset ledger entries look like this:  

| Date     | FA Posting Type  | Days                       | Amount    | Book Value |
| -------- | ---------------- | -------------------------  | --------- | ---------- |
| 01/01/20 |Acquisition Costs |(Depreciation starting date)|100,000.00 |100,000.00 |
| 06/30/20 |Depreciation      |180                         |-13,397.46 | 86,602.54 |
| 12/31/20 |Depreciation      |180                         |-11,602.54 | 75,000.00 |
| 06/30/21 |Depreciation      |180                         |-10,048.09 | 64,951.91 |
| 12/31/21 |Depreciation      |180                         |-8,701.91  | 56,250.00 |
| ...      |                  |                            |           |           |

Calculation Method:  

* *BV* = Book value  
* *ND* = Number of depreciation days  
* *DBP* = Declining-balance percent  
* *P* = *DBP*/100  
* *D* = *ND*/360  

The formula to calculate the depreciation amounts is:  

* *DA* = *BV* x (1 – (1 –P)<sup>D</sup>)

The depreciation values are:  

| Date     | Calculation                                                |
| -------- | -----------                                                |
| 06/30/20 |DA = 100,000.00 x (1 -(1 - 0.25)<sup>0.5</sup>) = 13,397.46 |
| 12/31/20 |DA = 86,602.54 x (1 - (1 - 0.25)<sup>0.5</sup>) = 11,602.54 |
| 06/30/21 |DA = 75,000.00 x (1 - (1 - 0.25)<sup>0.5</sup>) = 10,048.09 |
| 12/31/21 |DA = 64,951.91 x (1 - (1 - 0.25)<sup>0.5</sup>) = 8,701.91  |
| ...      |                                                            |

## DB1/SL depreciation

DB1/SL is an abbreviated combination of Declining-Balance 1 and Straight-Line. The calculation continues until the book value equals the final rounding amount, or the salvage value that you entered.  

The **Calculate Depreciation** batch job calculates a straight-line amount and a declining balance amount, but only the greater of the two amounts are transferred to the journal.  

You can use various percentages to calculate declining-balance.  

If you use this method, you must enter the estimated useful lifetime and a declining balance percentage on the **FA Depreciation Books** page.  

> [!NOTE]
> If you use any of the declining balance depreciation methods, and you want to run depreciation for multiple years, you must run each year's depreciation separately. If you run depreciation for the whole period from acquisition date to the end of the last fiscal year or last accounting period, it's likely that the results are incorrect. For example, if you imported legacy data and you use the actual acquisition dates for your assets and want to catch up on accumulated depreciation. For declining balance methods, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates the allowed depreciation per year, starting with the registered book value for each year. It can't do a multi-year depreciation in one step.
>
> The **Fixed asset - Projected Value** report can project depreciations for multi-year periods, which might be confusing compared to the results you get if you run depreciations for multiple years using one of the declining balance methods. 

### Example - DB1-SL depreciation

A fixed asset has an acquisition cost of LCY 100,000. On the **FA Depreciation Books** page, the **Declining-Balance %** field contains 25 and the **No. of Depreciation Years** field contains **8**. The **Calculate Depreciation** batch job is run biannually.  

The fixed asset ledger entries look like this:  

| Date | FA Posting Type | Days | Amount | Book Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 01/01/20 |Acquisition Costs |(Depreciation starting date) |100,000.00 |100,000.00 |
| 06/30/20 |Depreciation |180 |-12,500.00 |87,500.00 |
| 12/31/20 |Depreciation |180 |-12,500.00 |75,000.00 |
| 06/30/21 |Depreciation |180 |-9,375.00 |65,625.00 |
| 12/31/21 |Depreciation |180 |-9,375.00 |56,250.00 |
| 06/30/22 |Depreciation |180 |-7,031.25 |49,218.75 |
| 12/31/22 |Depreciation |180 |-7,031.25 |42,187.50 |
| 06/30/23 |Depreciation |180 |-5,273.44 |36,914.06 |
| 12/31/23 |Depreciation |180 |-5,273.44 |31,640.62 |
| 06/30/24 |Depreciation |180 |-3,955.08 |27,685.54 |
| 12/31/24 |Depreciation |180 |-3,955.08 |23,730.46 |
| 06/30/25 |Depreciation |180 |-3,955.08 |19,775.38 SL |
| 12/31/25 |Depreciation |180 |-3,955.08 |15,820.30 SL |
| 06/30/26 |Depreciation |180 |-3,955.08 |11,865.22 SL |
| 12/31/26 |Depreciation |180 |-3,955.07 |7,910.15 SL |
| 06/30/27 |Depreciation |180 |-3,955.08 |3,955.07 SL |
| 12/31/27 |Depreciation |180 |-3,955.07 |0.00 SL |

`SL` after the book value means that the straight-line method was used.  

Calculation method:  

* Year 1 (2020):  

    *Declining-balance amount: 25% of 100,000 = 25,000 = 12,500 + 12,500*  

    *Straight-line amount = 100,000 / 8 = 12,500 = 6,250 + 6,250*  

    The declining-balance amount is used because it's the greater amount.  
* ...
* Year 5 (2025):  

    *Declining-balance amount: 25% of 23,730.46 = 4,943.85= 2,471.92 + 2,471.92*  

    *Straight-line amount = 23,730.46/3 = 7,910.15 = 3,995.07 + 3,995.08*  

    The straight-line amount is used because it's the greater amount.  

## Half-Year Convention depreciation

The Half-Year Convention method is only applied if you turn on the **Use Half-Year Convention** toggle for the fixed asset on the **Fixed Asset Card** page.  

You can use this depreciation method with the following depreciation methods:  

* Straight-Line  
* Declining-Balance 1  
* DB1/SL  

When you apply the Half-Year Convention method, a fixed asset has six months of depreciation in the first fiscal year, regardless of the contents of the **Depreciation Starting Date** field.  

> [!NOTE]  
> The estimated life of the fixed asset that is remaining after the first fiscal year always contains a half-year using the Half-Year Convention Method. Thus, for the Half-Year Convention method to be applied correctly, the **Depreciation Ending Date** field on the **FA Depreciation Book** page must always contain a date which is exactly six months before the final date of the fiscal year in which the fixed asset fully depreciates.  

### Example - Half-Year Convention depreciation

A fixed asset has an acquisition cost of LCY 100,000. The **Depreciation Starting Date** is 03/01/20. The estimated life is five years, so the **Depreciation Ending Date** must be 06/30/25. The **Calculate Depreciation** batch job is run annually. This example is based on a calendar fiscal year.  

The fixed asset ledger entries look like this:  

| Date | FA Posting Type | Days | Amount | Book Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 03/01/20 |Acquisition Cost |(Depreciation starting date) |100,000.00 |100,000.00 |
| 12/31/20 |Depreciation |270 |-10,000.00 |90,000.00 |
| 12/31/21 |Depreciation |360 |-20,000.00 |70,000.00 |
| 12/31/22 |Depreciation |360 |-20,000.00 |50,000.00 |
| 12/31/23 |Depreciation |360 |-20,000.00 |30,000.00 |
| 12/31/24 |Depreciation |360 |-20,000.00 |10,000.00 |
| 12/31/25 |Depreciation |180 |-10,000.00 |0.00 |

## Example - DB1/SL depreciation using Half-Year Convention

A fixed asset has an acquisition cost of LCY 100,000. The **Depreciation Starting Date** is 11/01/20. The estimated life is five years, so the **Depreciation Ending Date** must be 06/30/25. On the **FA Depreciation Books** page, the **Declining-Balance %** field contains 40. The **Calculate Depreciation** batch job is run annually. This example is based on a calendar fiscal year.  

The fixed asset ledger entries look like this:  

| Date | FA Posting Type | Days | Amount | Book Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 11/01/20 |Acquisition Cost |(Depreciation starting date) |100,000.00 |100,000.00 |
| 12/31/20 |Depreciation |60 |-20,000.00 |80,000.00 |
| 12/31/21 |Depreciation |360 |-32,000.00 |48,000.00 |
| 12/31/22 |Depreciation |360 |-19,200.00 |28,800.00 |
| 12/31/23 |Depreciation |360 |-11,520.00 |17,280.00 |
| 12/31/24 |Depreciation |360 |-11,520.00 |5,760.00 SL |
| 12/31/25 |Depreciation |180 |-5,760.00 |0.00 SL |

`SL` after the book value means that the straight-line method was used.  

Calculation method:  

* Year 1:  

    *Declining-balance amount = Full year amount = 40% of 100,000 = 40,000.* Thus, for half a year 40,000 / 2 = 20,000  

    *Straight-line amount = Full year amount = 100,000 / 5 = 20,000.* Thus, for half a year = 20,000 / 2 = 10,000  

    The declining-balance amount is used because it's the greater amount.  
* ...
* Year 5 (2024):  

    *Declining-balance amount = 40% of 17,280.00 = 6,912.00*  

    *Straight-line amount = 28,800 / 1.5 = 11,520.00*  

    The straight-line amount is used because it's the greater amount.  

## Duplicate entries to other depreciation books

If you have three depreciation books, B1, B2 and B3, and you want to duplicate entries from B1 to B2 and B3, you can turn on the **Part of Duplication List** toggle on the depreciation book cards for B2 and B3. For example, this setting can be useful in the following situations:

* Depreciation book B1 integrates with the general ledger and uses the fixed asset G/L journal.
* Depreciation books B2 and B3 don't integrate with the general ledger and use the fixed asset journal.  

When you make an entry in B1 in the fixed asset G/L journal, and turn on the **Part of Duplication List** toggle, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] duplicates the entry in book B2 and B3 in the fixed asset journal when you post the entry.  

> [!NOTE]  
> You can't duplicate in the same journal and journal batch as you're duplicating from. If you post entries in the fixed asset G/L journal, you can duplicate them in the fixed asset journal or in the fixed asset G/L journal using another batch.  

> [!NOTE]  
> You can't use the same number series in the fixed asset G/L journal and the fixed asset journal. When you post entries in the fixed asset G/L journal, you must leave the **Document No.** field empty. If you enter a number in the field, the number is duplicated in the fixed asset journal. You must manually change the document number before you can post the journal.  

## Manual depreciation

Use the manual method for assets that aren't subject to depreciation, for example, land. You must enter depreciation in the fixed asset G/L journal. The **Calculate Depreciation** batch job omits fixed assets that use the manual depreciation method.

## User-defined depreciation

If the built-in depreciation methods don't meet your needs, you can define your own depreciation method by using depreciation tables. To learn more about applying a user-defined depreciation method, go to [Set Up User-Defined Depreciation Method](fa-how-setup-user-defined-depreciation-method.md).

# Work with Service Contracts and Service Contract Quotes
You can create a service contract either manually or from a service contract quote. You can use a service contract quote as a forerunner of a service contract, in which your company makes an offer to the customer and obtains customer approval before you can convert it to a service contract. The procedures for creating either a service contract or service contract quote are similar.  

## To create a service contract or service contract quote  
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Contracts** or **Service Contract Quotes**,and then choose the related link.  
2. Create a new service contract or service contract quote.  
3. Fill in the **No.** field. A dialog box opens, asking whether you want to fill it with the common data from a contract template. If you want to create such a service contract or service contract quote, choose the **Yes** button. The **Service Contract Template List** page opens.  
4. Select the appropriate template, and then choose **OK** to use it to create the service contract or service contract quote.  
5. In the **Customer No.** field, choose the customer.  
6. If you do not want an annual amount difference to be distributed automatically, choose the **Allow Unbalanced Amounts** check box. The values in the **Annual Amount** and **Calcd. Annual Amount** fields are not automatically equalized. If you want application to do automatically distribute any annual amount difference that might occur from a change in the service contract, leave the **Allow Unbalanced Amounts** check box clear.  
7. Add contract lines to the service contract or service contract quote.  
8. Fill in the rest of the fields as necessary.  

## To convert a service contract quote to service contract  
When a customer has accepted a service contract quote, you convert it to a service contract. At the same time, you can create a service invoice for the starting period of the contract if the starting date of the contract is before the beginning of the next invoice period.

After you complete the following steps, a service contract is created with the status **Signed**. If a service invoice is created for the starting period of the contract, the invoiced amount is calculated in the following way, depending on whether the contract is detailed or not.  

For detailed contracts, the invoiced amount is calculated as follows:  

* Invoiced amount = sum of the invoiced amount for each contract line.  
* Invoiced amount for each contract line = ((quote value ÷ 12) × number of months in the starting period) + ((quote value ÷ number of days in the year) × number of days left in the starting period).  
* If the contract line expires before the starting period ends, the expiration date becomes the ending date of the starting period for the line.  

For contracts that are not detailed, the invoiced amount is calculated as follows:  

* Invoiced amount = (annual amount ÷ number of days in the year) × number of days in the starting period.  
* If the contract expires before the starting period ends, the expiration date becomes the ending date of the starting period.    

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Contract Quotes**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the service contract quote you want to convert to a service contract.  
3. Choose the **Make Contract** action.  
4. If the starting date of the contract is before the beginning of the next invoice period, you are asked if you want to create an invoice for the starting period of the contract. Choose **Yes**.  

 The service invoice is posted to the service account of the contract, even if the contract is prepaid.

## To create contract service credit memos
You can use a contract service credit memo when a customer cancels a prepaid service contract or removes a service item from a prepaid contract. You can also use it to correct an erroneous service invoice.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Credit Memos**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Create a new service credit memo.  
3. Fill in the **No.** field.  
4. In the **Customer No.** field, enter the number of the customer in the service contract.  

     The **Invoicing** FastTab shows information copied from the **Customer** card. If you want to post the credit memo to a different customer than the one specified on the **General** FastTab, enter the number of that customer in the **Bill-to Customer No.** field.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  You can compare the credit memo to the original posted document on the **Posted Service Invoices** page. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Posted Service Invoices**, and then choose the related link.  

5. Fill in the **Posting Date** and **Document Date** fields.  
6. On the credit memo lines, enter information about the items that have been returned or removed, or the allowance that will be sent. You can also use the **Get Prepaid Contract Entries** batch job.  

 To automatically create a credit memo when contract lines are removed from a service contract, on the **Service Contract** page, on the **Invoice Details** FastTab, select the **Automatic Credit Memos** check box.  

 To manually create a credit memo when contract lines are removed from a service contract, on the **Service Contract** page, choose the **Credit Memo** action.  

## Updating and evaluating contracts
Sometimes you have to change the terms of a contract after it has been created. In most cases, you open the relevant contract on the **Service Contract** page, and change it as necessary.  

You can change the status of the contract, initially set to **Locked**, add and remove contract lines, and cancel a contract. If you want to see how your business is doing as measured by gain and loss, you can do quick business analysis using the contract trendscape feature.

## To add a contract line to a service contract or contract quote  
When a customer purchases a new item and wants to include it in the existing service contract or contract quote, you can register the item as a service item and then add it as a new contract line to the contract or contract quote.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Contracts**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the relevant service contract or service contract quote that you want to add a new contract line for.  
3. Choose the **Open Contract** action to open the service contract or service contract quote for editing.  
4. On the **Invoice Details** FastTab, select the **Allow Unbalanced Amounts** field if you want to change the annual amount and distribute the annual amount difference manually on the contract lines. Otherwise, clear the check box in the **Allow Unbalanced Amounts** field. This will distribute the annual amount difference automatically on the contract lines after you change the annual amount.  
5. On the **Lines** FastTab, add a service item or item, or text description, on each contract line. Alternatively, you can add contract quote lines. Note that you can create multiple contracts per service item to have it included in different service contracts or contract quotes at the same time.  
6. Verify and correct the numbers in the **Line Discount %**, **Line Discount Amount**, **Response Time**, **Service Period**, and other fields as needed.

## To remove contract lines  
You may need to remove contract lines from the service contract as you remove corresponding service items from the service contract. Usually you remove a contract line that is expired or corresponds to the service item that has broken down.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Contracts**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the service contract from which you want to remove contract lines.  
3. Choose the **Open Contract** action to open the service contract for editing.  
4. Choose the contract line you want to remove. Fill in the **Contract Expiration Date** field with the date as of which you want to remove the line. For example, you could enter the date when the service item broke down.  
5. Choose the **Remove Contract Lines** action. The **Remove Lines from Contract** page opens.  
6. Fill in the default filters: **Contract No.**, **Service Item No.**, and **Contract Type**. If needed, you can apply more filters or change the existing ones.  
7. Fill in the fields on the **Options** FastTab, and then choose the **Delete Lines** action.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  If the contract is not detailed, you must update the value in the **Annual Amount** field on the **Invoice Details** FastTab on the **Service Contract** page, reflecting the loss of the service item from the contract.  
>   
>  If the contract is detailed and prepaid, and you have posted invoices for the contract, you can create a credit memo for the contract. Choose the **Create Credit Memo** action. This is unnecessary if the check box in the **Automatic Credit Memos** field on the **Invoice Details** FastTab is selected. In that case, a credit memo is created automatically when you remove a contract line.

## Service Line Cost and Value
On a service contract lines, the amounts in the **Line Cost** and **Line Value** are calculated as described in the following tables.

| Line Cost Options | Description|
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
|**Service item** | The cost is automatically retrieved from the **Default Contract Cost** field in the **Service Item** table and copied into the **Line Cost** field. The following formula is used to calculate the line cost:<br /><br /> Sales Unit Cost × Contract Value % ÷ 100|  
|**Item** | The cost is automatically retrieved from the **Unit Cost** field in the **Item** table and the **Contract Value %** field value in the **Service Mgt. Setup** table. The following formula is used to calculate the line cost:<br /><br /> Unit Cost × Contract Value % ÷ 100|  
|**Text description** | The value in the **Line Cost** field is set to zero.|  

| Line Value Options | Description|
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
|**Service item** | The price is automatically retrieved from the **Default Contract Value** field in the **Service Item** table and copied into the **Line Value** field.|  
|**Item** | Depending on the value in the **Contract Value Calc. Method** field in the **Service Mgt. Setup** table, the amount is retrieved from either the **Unit Price** or the **Unit Cost** field in the **Item** table. After that, this value is multiplied by the contents of the **Contract Value %** field in the **Service Mgt. Setup** table and divided by 100. This amount is copied into the **Line Value** field.<br /><br /> **NOTE:** If the **Contract Value Calc. Method** field is set to **None**, the contents of the **Line Value** field are not calculated.|  
|**Text description** | The contents of the **Line Value** field are set to zero.|  

## To add a contract discount to service contract quotes  
You can add contract discounts on services for contract quotes and service contracts. The discounts can be on spare parts in particular service item groups, on resource hours for resources in particular resource groups, and on particular service costs.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Contract Quotes**, and choose the related link.  
2. Choose the quote to add discounts for.  
3. Choose the **Service Discounts** action. The **Contract/Service Discounts** page opens.  
4. To create a new contract discount, choose the **New** action.  
5. Fill in the fields on the line as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)].  

> [!Tip]  
>  To add contract discounts directly to a service contract, perform similar steps from the **Service Contract** page.  

## To change the owner of a service contract  
You may need to change the owner of a service contract. If a service item in a service contract is registered in noncanceled multiple contracts owned by the same customer, then the owner of all service contracts that include this service item and of all other service items included in these contracts is updated automatically.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  In this case, only noncanceled contracts are considered. The status of the contract quotes is not taken into account.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  Service items and contracts can be related. Changing the owner of a service contract can affect these relationships.  
>   
>  For example, suppose service item No. 8 is included in contracts SC00003 and SC00015. Contract SC00015 also contains service item No. 15, which is also included in the contract SC00080. In this case, the owner for all three contracts and service items will be changed.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Contracts**, and then choose the related link. Open the relevant service contract whose owner you want to change.  
2. Choose the **Open Contract** action to open the contract for editing.  
3. Choose the **Change Customer** action. The **Change Customer in Contract** page opens.  
4. In the **Contract No.** and **Service Item No**. fields you can see the numbers of the contract and service item owned by the selected customer. If the customer owns more than one contract with more than one service item included, then the value of these fields will be **Multiple**. To see the list of related contracts or service items, select these field values.  
5. In the **New Customer No.** field, choose the new customer.  
6. In the **New Ship-to Code** field, choose the address.  
7. Choose the **OK** button to change the customer and ship-to code of the service contracts.  
8. Choose the **Lock Contract** action to lock the contract and to make sure that the changes will be part of the contracts.  

## To update a service contract price  
You can update the prices on service contracts by specifying a price update percentage.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Update Service Contract Prices**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the service contract.  
3. In the **Update to Date** field, enter a date. The batch job will update prices for contracts with next price update dates on or before this date.  
4. In the **Price Update %** field, enter the percentage that you want to update the prices by.  
5. In the **Action** field, select **Update Contract Prices**.  

## To post prepaid contract entries  
If you work with prepaid service contracts, you must regularly post prepaid contract entries, thereby transferring the prepaid payments from the prepaid contract accounts to the regular contract accounts.  

Before you can post prepaid contract entries, you must specify a number series in the **Prepaid Posting Document Nos.** field on the **Service Mgt. Setup** page.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Post Prepaid Contract Entries**, and then choose the related link.  
2. In the **Post until Date** field, enter a date. The batch job posts prepaid service ledger entries with posting dates up to this date.  
4. In the **Posting Date** field, enter the date you want to use as the posting date on the general journal line.  
5. In the **Action** field, choose **Post Prepaid Transactions**.  
6. Choose **OK** to post the entries.

## Changing the Service Contract Status
After the service contract is signed, the **Change Status** field value is automatically set to **Locked**. If you want to modify information in the service contract or service contract quote, first you have to change the status of the contract or contract quote from **Locked** to **Open**. Note that you cannot create service invoices for the service contract with the **Open** change status. After the contract or contract quote is modified, you have to change the status back to **Locked** to make it possible to create service invoices and ledger entries for the service contract, which includes the changes that you made to it.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  The **Change Status** field is not related to the **Release Status** field on the service order header, which governs the warehouse handling of service items.  

## To cancel a service contract  
You may need to cancel a service contract when the contract has expired or has been canceled by you or the customer.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  You cannot reopen a contract after it is canceled.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Contracts**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the relevant service contract to cancel.  
3. Choose the **Open Contract** action to open the service contract for editing.  
4. In the **Cancel Reason Code** field, choose the relevant reason code. To add more reason codes, choose the **Advanced** action.  

     If the check box in the **Use Contract Cancel Reason** field on the **Service Mgt. Setup** page is selected, you must specify a cancel reason code when canceling contracts.  

5. In the **Status** field, choose **Canceled**.  
6. If there are unposted invoices, credit memos, or opened prepaid entries for the contract, a confirmation message will appear. In the message box, choose **No** to return to the contract and post the documents, or **Yes** to continue the cancellation process.  

## Filing a service contract or contract quote  
You can file service contracts and contract quotes at any time to record and archive a copy of the contract or contract quote. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] files service contracts automatically when you convert contract quotes to service contracts or cancel service contracts. You can file a contract or quote yourself by choosing the **File Contract** action in the **Service Contracts** or **Service Contract Quotes** pages. If you want to view your archived contracts of quotes by searching for **Filed Contracts**.

# Cross-Dock Items

Cross-dock items are items you receive and ship without putting them away. The put-away and pick processes require limited handling of items. You can cross-dock items for shipments and for production orders.

## Cross-dock bins and zones

If you're using bins, set up at least one cross-dock bin, and then specify the bin in the **Cross-Dock Bin Code** field on your locations. If you're using directed put-away and picks, set up a cross-dock zone.

When you prepare a shipment or pick items for production and you're using bins, the item is automatically picked from a cross-dock bin before any other bin. You must look in the cross-dock area to see whether the items you need are available there before you get the items in their usual storage area.  

If you've calculated cross-dock quantities, put-away lines to the cross-dock bin for cross-dock calculations are created when you post the receipt. Other put-away lines are created as usual.  

## Cross-dock select lines for a receipt

If you want to post the cross-dock items right away to make them available for picking, you must also register a put-away for the other items originating from the receipt line, namely those that need to be stored. If only some items on a receipt line are being cross-docked, you must therefore make an effort to put away the remaining items as quickly as possible. Alternatively, your warehouse policy could be to encourage cross-docking of entire receipt lines whenever possible.

In the put-away instruction, delete the Take and Place instruction lines for each receipt line for the items to put away. You can recreate the instruction lines later as put-away lines from the put-away worksheet or the posted receipt. After you delete the instruction lines you can put away and register the lines for cross-dock items.  

## About the Put-away Worksheet page

If you turn on the **Use Put-away Worksheet** toggle on the **Location Card** page, and post your receipt with calculated cross-docks, all receipt lines become available in the worksheet. The cross-dock information is lost and can't be recreated. Therefore, to use cross-dock functionality, you should relay lines to the put-away worksheet by deleting put-away instructions rather than using the automatic relay function provided in the **Use Put-away Worksheet** field.  

If you post the warehouse receipt and the **Use Put-away Worksheet** toggle is turned off, the cross-dock items become separate lines on the put-away instructions. The **Cross-Dock Information** field on each put-away line shows whether the line contains the following:

* Cross-dock items.
* All of the items from a receipt must be stored.
* Some items from a receipt must be stored, and some are to be cross-docked.

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't keep separate records for cross-docked items. It registers them as ordinary put-away instructions.  

## To set up the warehouse for cross-docking  

1. If you're using bins, set up at least one cross-dock bin. If you're using directed put-away and picks, set up a cross-dock zone.  

    A cross-dock bin has the **Cross-Dock Bin** field selected. To learn more about bins, go to [Create Bins](warehouse-how-to-create-individual-bins.md).  

    If you are using zones, create a zone for your cross-dock bins, and select the **Cross-Dock Bin Zone** field. If you are using directed put-away and picks, select bin type with **Pick** selected, for example you can use *PICK* or *PUTPICK*. To learn more about zones and bin types, go to [Set Up Locations to Use Bins](warehouse-how-to-set-up-locations-to-use-bins.md) and [Set Up Bin Types](warehouse-how-to-set-up-bin-types.md).  

2. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Location**, and then choose the related link.  
3. On the **Location** page, select the location that you want to set up the warehouse for cross-docking, and then choose the **Edit** action.  
4. On the **Warehouse** FastTab, turn on the **Use Cross-Docking** toggle and fill in the **Cross-Dock Due Date Calc.** field with the time to search for cross-dock opportunities.

    The **Use Cross-Docking** option is only available if the **Require Receipt**, **Require Shipment**, **Require Pick**, and **Require Put-away** fields are selected.  

5. If you're using bins, on the **Bins** FastTab, fill in the **Cross-Dock Bin Code** field with the code of the bin you would like to use as the default cross-dock bin.  
6. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Stockkeeping Unit**, and select the related link.  
7. For each item or stockkeeping unit that you want to be able to cross-dock, select the item, and then choose the **Edit** action.
8. On the **Stockkeeping Unit Card** page, select the **Use Cross-Docking** check box.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  Cross-docking is only possible if your location is set up to require warehouse receive and put-away processing.  

## To cross-dock items without viewing the opportunities  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Warehouse Receipts**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Create a warehouse receipt for an item that's arrived and can be cross-docked. To learn more about receiving, go to [Receive Items](warehouse-how-receive-items.md).  
3. Fill in the **Qty. to Receive** field, and then choose the **Calculate Cross-Dock** action.  

    Outbound source documents requesting the items that are scheduled to leave the warehouse within the date formula time period are identified. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates quantities so that you can cross-dock as much as possible and avoid having to put items away, without piling up too many items in the cross-dock area. The value in the **Qty. to Cross-Dock** field is the sum of all the outbound lines for the item within the look-ahead period minus the quantity that is already placed in the cross-dock area, or it is the value in the **Qty. to Receive** field on the receipt line, whichever is smaller. You can't cross-dock more than you have received.  

4. To cross-dock the quantity as suggested, post the receipt. You can also decide to change the quantity to cross-dock to a higher or lower value and then post the receipt.  

    The amounts to be cross-docked now appear as lines in the put-away instruction, assuming the **Use Put-away Worksheet** field is cleared. The quantities not cross-docked also become lines in the put-away instruction.  

    If you have bins, the cross-docked items have been assigned to the default cross-dock bin defined on the location card.  

5. Delete the **Take** and **Place** lines for items that you won't cross-dock.  
6. Print the put-away instruction for the remaining lines, and place the quantities of the receipt that need to be stored in the appropriate bins or in the appropriate area of the warehouse. Place the cross-dock items in the area or bin designated for them by warehouse policy. Sometimes, warehouse policy might require that you to just leave them in the receiving area.  
7. To register the cross-docked items as being put-away and available for picking, choose the **Register** action.  

## To cross-dock items after viewing the opportunities  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Warehouse Receipts**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Create a warehouse receipt for an item that has arrived and can be cross-docked.  

    You want to view the source document lines that are requesting the item before you post the receipt.  
3. Choose the **Calculate Cross-Dock** action.  

   On the **Cross-Dock Opportunities** page you can see the most important details about the lines requesting the item, such as type of document, quantity requested, and due date. This information might help you to decide how much to cross-dock, where to place the items in the cross-dock area, or how to group them.  

4. Choose **Autofill Qty. to Cross-Dock** action to show how the quantities on the receipt lines are calculated. When you change the number of items in the **Qty. to Cross-Dock** field on each line, the calculation updates. The update doesn't mean that the shipment or production order will actually receive the items being suggested for cross-docking. It's for testing purposes only. The process can be informative, however, if more than one unit of measure is involved.  
5. To reserve a quantity of the item for an order line, choose the line, and then choose the **Reserve** action. On the **Reservation** page, reserve available quantity of the item. The reservation is like any other reservation and doesn't have higher priority because it was created in connection with cross-docking. To learn more about reservations, go to [Reserve Items](inventory-how-to-reserve-items.md).   
6. When you're finished recalculating or reserving, choose the **OK** button to bring the calculation to the **Qty. to Cross-Dock** field on the receipt line, or choose the **Cancel** button to return to the warehouse receipt and calculate the cross-dock again.  
7. Post the receipt. You can continue in the put-away instruction as described in steps 3 through 7 in [To cross-dock items without viewing the opportunities](#to-cross-dock-items-without-viewing-the-opportunities).  

    [!INCLUDE [preview-posting-inventory](includes/preview-posting-inventory.md)]

    > [!NOTE]  
    > In the warehouse put-away, you can continue to change the quantities that are being put away in storage or cross-docked, as necessary. For example, you might decide to cross-dock an extra quantity to expedite the cross-dock registration.  

## To view cross-docked items in a shipment or pick worksheet  

If you're using bins, when you open a shipment or the pick worksheet the quantity of each item in the cross-dock bins updates. When the item is available in the cross-dock bin, you can create a pick for the items on the shipment. In the pick worksheet, you can edit the lines as needed.  

When a production order is released, the lines are available in the pick worksheet and the **Qty. on Cross-Dock Bin** field shows whether the items have arrived and are in the cross-dock bins. When you create a pick instruction, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] suggests that you pick the cross-docked items first. Items in storage bins are suggested afterward.  

If you aren't using bins, remember to check the cross-dock area from time to time, or rely on notifications from receipts that items for production have arrived.

# Work on Service Tasks
After you have created a service order or service quote, registered service item lines, and allocated resources to the service items in the order or quote, you can start repairing and maintaining the service items.  

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] features a **Service Tasks** page that gives an overview of all the service items that need attention. Think of it as your service dashboard where you can see what orders are pending, look for and register spare parts, and keep your inventory up-to-date.  

To track changes and get a graphical view of your service business, use [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] statistics tools for quick, automatically generated charting and analysis.  

## To work on a service task  
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Tasks**, and then choose the related link.
2. If you want a list of service tasks a certain resource or resource group is allocated to, fill in the **Resource Filter** or **Resource Group Filter** field and select <kbd>Enter</kbd>.  
3. If you want a list of service tasks with a certain response date or response dates within a certain time period, fill in the **Response Date Filter** field and select <kbd>Enter</kbd>.  
4. If you want a list of service tasks with a certain allocation status or repair status, fill in the **Allocation Status Filter** or **Repair Status Code Filter** field and select <kbd>Enter</kbd>.  
5. Select the service task you want to work on. Choose the **Item Worksheet** action. The **Service Item Worksheet** page opens.  
6. Register standard texts, spare parts, resource hours, and costs as appropriate using the corresponding options in the **Type** field:  \<Blank\>, **Item**, **Resource**, and **Cost**.  
7. In the **Repair Status** field, select the appropriate status.  

   > [!NOTE]  
   >  Fill in the **Repair Status** field with the **Finished** or **Partly Serviced** status if the service item has been completely serviced or another resource will continue servicing. The **Finished** or **Reallocation Needed** status is specified automatically for the allocation entry corresponding to the service item.  

## To register service operations  
When performing a service on a service order, you can register the details specifying the items used, costs incurred, and the time spent. The data you specify is stored on the **Service Item Worksheet** page. You can update the data when necessary.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 2.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the service order to register the service for, and choose the item line.  
3. Choose the **Service Item Worksheet** action  
4. On the lines, specify the items used, costs incurred, and the time spent on the service.  

   > [!NOTE]  
   >  You can also register service directly on the service lines linked to the service order.  

## To register spare parts  
When working on service items in service orders, you may need to use spare parts for the service. The following procedure shows how to register the spare parts you use on the **Service Item Worksheet** page.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 3.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Tasks**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the line that includes the relevant service item, and then choose the **Item Worksheet** action.  
3. Enter a new service line.  
4. In the **Type** field, choose **Item**.  
5. In the **No.** field, choose the relevant spare part.  
6. In the **Quantity** field, enter the quantity of items you want to use.  

 You can use a similar procedure to register the spare parts on the **Service Lines** page, which you can open from the **Service Order** page.  

## To register spare parts from a service order  
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 4.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the service order you want to register spare parts for.  
3. Choose the line that includes the relevant service item. Choose **Actions**, choose **Order**, and then choose **Service Lines**.  
4. enter a new service line.  

## To replace a service item or a service item component  
When you service a service item that is composed of components, you may need to replace a faulty component with a new one. Every time that you enter a spare part for a service item with components, you have the option of replacing a component or creating a new one. The new item is not registered as a component of the service item until you post this service line or the service order.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 5.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Tasks**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the line that includes the service item, and then choose the **Item Worksheet** action.  
3. Enter a new service line.  
4. In the **Type** field, choose **Item**.  
5. In the **No.** field, choose the component to replace.  
6. Select <kbd>Enter</kbd>. A dialog box opens with three options: **Replace Component**, **New Component**, and **Ignore**. The following table describes the options.  

    |Option | Description|  
    |----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Replace Component**|Changes the status of the component you are replacing to not active, and it will appear on the replaced component list for the service item.|  
    |**New Component**|Enters the new component in the component list of the service item.|  
    |**Ignore**|Does nothing to the component list of the service item.|  

7. Choose **Replace Component**.  
8. Choose the component to replace, and then choose **OK**.  

## To change the response time for a service item line  
When you register a service item line in a service order or quote, depending on whether the service item is on a service contract the response time in hours is automatically entered and the response date and time are calculated accordingly. You can change the response time in hours and the response date and time if you need to.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 6.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Orders** or **Service Quotes**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the service order or quote to open the card.  
3. On the service item line you want to change the response time for, either in the **Response Time (Hours)** field or in the **Response Date** and **Response Time** fields, enter the new response hours or response date and time.  

## To register fault/resolution codes  
After repairing a service item, you can register both the fault code and the resolution code for the item by selecting a combination from the existing fault/resolution codes relationships. The fault and resolution codes will appear in the corresponding fields on the **Service Item Worksheet** page. You can also register the codes directly in this page.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 7.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Tasks**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the line that includes the relevant service item, and then choose the **Item Worksheet** action.  
3. On the **Service Item Worksheet** page, choose **Fault/Resol. Codes Relationships**. The **Fault/Resolution Codes Relationships** page opens.  

  >  [!NOTE]
  >  Filters are set on the relationships that are shown on the page by copying the service item group and the fault codes from the **Service Item Worksheet** page.  

4. Fill out the line. Choose the combination of fault and resolution codes, and then choose **OK** to copy it to the service item. If an appropriate combination cannot be found, you can create a new combination on the page.

# Design Details: Balancing supply and demand

To understand how the planning system works, it's important to understand its prioritized goals:  

* Any demand will be met by sufficient supply.  
* Any supply serves a purpose.  

Generally, these goals are achieved by balancing supply with demand.  

## Supply and demand

The term *supply* refers to any kind of positive or inbound quantity, such as:

* Inventory
* Purchases
* Assembly
* Production
* Inbound transfers
* Sales returns  

The term *demand* refers to any kind of gross demand, such as:

* An item for a sales order
* A component for a production order

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] also lets you use more technical types of demand, such as negative inventory and purchase returns.

To sort the sources of supply and demand, the planning system organizes them on two timelines called inventory profiles. One profile is for demand events, and the other is for the corresponding supply events. Each supply event represents one entity on an order, such as:

* A sales order line
* An item ledger entry
* A production order line

When inventory profiles are loaded, the demand-supply sets are balanced to output a supply plan that fulfills the listed goals.

Inventory levels and planning parameters are other types of supply and demand. These types undergo integrated balancing to replenish stock items. Learn more at [Design Details: Handling Reordering Policies](design-details-handling-reordering-policies.md).

## The concept of balancing, in brief

Demand comes from your customers. Supply is what you create and remove to establish balance. The planning system starts with the demand and then tracks backwards to the supply.  

Inventory profiles contain information about the demands and supplies, quantities, and timing. These profiles make up the two sides of the balancing scale.  

The objective of planning is to balance the supply and demand of an item to ensure that supply will match demand as defined by the planning parameters and rules.  

:::image type="content" source="media/nav_app_supply_planning_2_balancing.png" alt-text="Overview of balancing supply and demand.":::

## Process orders before the planning start date

To avoid that a supply plan shows unreasonable suggestions, the planning system won't plan anything in the period before the planning starting date. The following rule applies to that period:

* All supply and demand before the starting date of the planning period are considered part of inventory or shipped.  

With a few exceptions, the planning system won't suggest any changes to supply orders in the period or create order tracking links for that period. The following are exceptions to this rule:  

* The inventory that's projected to be available, including the sum of supply and demand in the period, is below zero.  
* Backdated orders require serial or lot numbers.  
* The supply-demand set is linked by an order-to-order policy. 

If the initial available inventory is below zero, the planning system suggests an emergency supply order on the day before the planning period to cover the missing quantity. So, the projected and available inventory will always be at least zero when planning for the future period begins. The planning line for this supply order will display an Emergency warning icon and provide additional information.

### Serial and lot numbers and order-to-order links are exempt from the previous period  

If serial or lot numbers are required or an order-to-order link exists, the planning system disregards the rule about the previous period. It will include back-dated quantities from the starting date and might suggest corrective actions if supply and demand aren't synchronized. These demand-supply sets must match to ensure that a specific demand is fulfilled.

## Load inventory profiles

To sort the sources of supply and demand, the planning system organizes them on two timelines called inventory profiles.  

Supply and demand with due dates on or after the planning starting date are loaded into each inventory profile. When loaded, the supply and demand types are sorted according to overall priorities, such as:

* Due date
* Low-level codes
* Location
* Variant

Order priorities are applied to the different types to fulfill the most important demand first. Learn more at [Prioritizing Orders](design-details-balancing-demand-and-supply.md#prioritize-orders).  

Demand can also be negative. Treat negative demand as supply. However, unlike typical supply, negative demand is considered fixed supply. The planning system can take it into account, but will not suggest changes to it.  

In general, the planning system considers all supply orders after the planning starting date as subject to change in order to fulfill demand. However, after a quantity is posted from a supply order the planning system can't change it. The following orders can't be replanned:  

* Released production orders where consumption or output has been posted.  
* Assembly orders where consumption or output has been posted.  
* Transfer orders where shipment has been posted.  
* Purchase orders where receipt has been posted.  

Apart from loading the supply and demand types, certain types are loaded with attention to special rules and dependencies. The following sections in this article describe these rules and dependencies.  

### Item dimensions are separated  

The supply plan must be calculated for each combination of the item dimensions, such as variant and location. Only the combinations that carry a demand and/or supply need to be calculated.  

The planning system looks for combinations in the inventory profile. When it finds a new combination, it creates an internal control record that holds the information about the combination. The planning system then inserts the SKU as the control record, or outer loop. As a result, the planning parameters are set according to a combination of variant and location, and the system can proceed to the inner loop. 

> [!NOTE]  
> You don't have to enter a SKU record when you enter demand and/or supply for a particular combination of variant and location. Therefore, if a SKU doesn't exist for a given combination, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates a temporary SKU record based on data from the item. If the **Location Mandatory** is toggle is turned on on the **Inventory Setup page**, you must either create a SKU or turn on the **Components at Location** toggle. Learn more at [Planning With or Without Locations](production-planning-with-without-locations.md).  

### Serial and lot numbers are loaded by specification level  

Serial and lot numbers are loaded into the inventory profiles along with the supply and demand they're assigned to.  

Supply and demand attributes are arranged by order priority and by their level of specification. Because serial and lot number matches reflect the level of specification, a more specific demand will match before a less specific demand. For example, a specific demand might be a lot number specified for a sale line. A less specific demand might be a sale from any lot number.

> [!NOTE]  
> The only dedicated prioritization rules for serial and lot-numbered supply and demand are the level of specification defined by their combinations and how item tracking is set up for the items.  

During balancing, the planning system regards supply that has serial and lot numbers as inflexible. The system won't increase or reschedule such supply orders. The one exception to this is if they're used in an order-to-order relation. Learn more at [Order-to-order links are never broken](#order-to-order-links-are-never-broken). This exception protects the supply from receiving several, possibly conflicting, action messages when it has varying attributes. For example, varying attributes might be when the supply has a collection of different serial numbers.  

Another reason why serial and lot-numbered supply are inflexible is because serial and lot numbers are often assigned late in the process. It could be confusing if changes are suggested at that point.  

Serial and lot number balancing doesn't respect the rule about not planning anything before the planning starting date. If supply and demand aren't synchronized, the planning system will suggest changes or new orders, regardless of the planning starting date.  

### Order-to-order links are never broken

When planning an order-to-order item, the linked supply must only be used for what it was originally intended. The linked demand shouldn't be covered by any other supply, even if the supply is available in time and quantity. For example, you can't use an assembly order that's linked to a sales order in an assemble-to-order scenario to cover another demand.  

Order-to-order supply and demand must balance precisely. The planning system will ensure the supply without regarding order sizing parameters, modifiers, and quantities in inventory (other than quantities relating to the linked orders). For the same reason, the system will suggest decreasing excess supplies if the linked demand is decreased.  

This balancing also affects the timing. The limited horizon that is given by the time bucket is not regarded; the supply will be rescheduled if the timing of the demand has changed. However, dampener time will be respected and will prevent order-to-order supplies from being scheduled out, except for the internal supplies of a multi-level production order (project order).  

> [!NOTE]  
> Serial and lot numbers can also be specified on order-to-order demand. In that case, the supply is not inflexible, which is normally is for serial and lot numbers. In this case, the system will increase or decrease according to changes in demand. If one demand has varying serial and lot numbers, such as more than one lot number, one supply order will be suggested for each lot.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Forecasts should not lead to creating supply orders that are bound by an order-to-order link. If the forecast is used, it should only be used as a generator of dependent demand in a manufacturing environment.

### Component need is loaded according to production order changes

When handling production orders, the planning system must monitor the needed components before loading them into the demand profile. Component lines that result from a changed production order will replace the lines of the original order. The change ensures that the planning system doesn't duplicate planning lines for a component need.  

### Consume safety stock

Safety stock quantity is a demand that's loaded into the inventory profile on the planning starting date.  

Safety stock is a quantity of inventory that's set aside to meet uncertainties in demand during replenishment. However, it can be consumed to fulfill a demand. In that case, the planning system will ensure that the safety stock is quickly replaced. The system suggests a supply order to replenish the safety stock quantity on the date it's consumed. The planning line will display an Exception warning icon explaining that the safety stock has been partly or fully consumed by an exception order for the missing quantity.  

### Forecast demand is reduced by sales orders

Demand forecasts express anticipated future demand. While actual demand is entered, typically as sales orders for produced items, it consumes the forecast.

The forecast itself is not reduced by sales orders. However, the forecast quantities that are used in the planning calculation are reduced by the sales order quantities before the remaining quantity enters the demand profile. For sales during a period, planning includes both open sales orders and item ledger entries from shipped sales. The exception to this rule is when they come from a blanket order.  

You must define a valid forecast period. The date on the forecasted quantity defines the start of the period, and the date on the next forecast defines the end of the period.  

The forecast for periods prior to the planning period isn't used, regardless of whether it was consumed. The first forecast figure of interest is either the planning starting date, or the closest date to it.  

The forecast can be for different types of demand:

* Independent demand, such as sales orders
* Dependent demand, such as production order components.

An item can have both types of forecast. During planning, consumption happens separately, first for independent demand and then for dependent demand.  

### Blanket order demand is reduced by sales orders

Forecasting is supplemented by blanket sales orders as a way to specify future demand from a specific customer. As with the (unspecified) forecast, actual sales should consume the anticipated demand, and the remaining quantity should enter the demand inventory profile. Consumption doesn't reduce the blanket order quantity.

The planning calculation includes open sales orders linked to the specific blanket order line, but it doesn't include any valid time period. Also, it doesn't include posted orders because the posting procedure has already reduced the outstanding blanket order quantity.

## Prioritize orders

Within a given SKU, the requested or available date represents the highest priority. Today's demand should be dealt with before the next week's demand. But, in addition to this overall priority, the planning system will make the following suggestions according to order priorities:

* Which type of demand you should fulfill first.
* What source of supply should be applied before applying other sources of supply.  

Loaded supply and demand contribute to a profile for projected inventory according to priorities.  

### Priorities on the demand side  

1. Already shipped: Item Ledger Entry  
2. Purchase return order  
3. Sales order  
4. Service order  
5. Production component needs  
6. Assembly order line  
7. Outbound transfer order  
8. Blanket order (that has not already been consumed by related sales orders)  
9. Forecast (that has not already been consumed by other sales orders)  

> [!NOTE]  
> Purchase returns aren't usually involved in supply planning; they should always be reserved from the lot that's going to be returned. If not reserved, purchase returns play a role in availability and are highly prioritized to avoid that the planning system suggests a supply order just to serve a purchase return.  

### Priorities on the supply side  

1. Already in inventory: Item Ledger Entry (Planning Flexibility = None)  
2. Sales return order (Planning Flexibility = None)  
3. Inbound transfer order  
4. Production order  
5. Assembly order  
6. Purchase order  

### Priority related to the state of supply and demand  

In addition to the priorities from the type of supply and demand, there are other things that affect planning flexibility. For example, warehouse activities, and the status of the following orders:

* Sales
* Purchase
* Transfer
* Assembly
* Production

The status of these orders has the following effects: 

1. Partly handled (Planning Flexibility = None)  
2. Already in process in the warehouse (Planning Flexibility = None)  
3. Released – all order types (Planning Flexibility = Unlimited)  
4. Firm Planned Production Order (Planning Flexibility = Unlimited)  
5. Planned/Open – all order types (Planning Flexibility = Unlimited)

## Balancing supply with demand

The planning system balances supply and demand by suggesting actions to revise supply orders that aren't balanced. This balance happens for each combination of variant and location.  

Imagine that each inventory profile contains two strings:

* A string of demand events, sorted by date and priority
* A corresponding string of supply events

Each event refers to its source type and identification. The rules for balancing the item are straightforward. Matching supply and demand can occur at any point in the process, as follows:  

1. No demand or supply exists for the item => the planning has finished (or should not start).  
2. Demand exists but there's no supply => supply should be suggested.  
3. Supply exists but there's no demand for it => supply should be canceled.  
4. Both supply and demand exist => questions should be asked and answered before [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can ensure that the supply can meet the demand.

    If the timing of the supply isn't suitable, perhaps the supply can be rescheduled, as follows:  

    1. If the supply is placed earlier than the demand, perhaps the supply can be scheduled out so that inventory is as low as possible.  
    2. If the supply is placed later than the demand, perhaps the supply can be scheduled forward. Otherwise, the system will suggest new supply.  
    3. If the supply meets the demand on the date, the planning system can investigate whether the quantity of the supply can cover the demand.  

    When the timing is in place, the quantity to supply can be calculated as follows:  

    1. If the supply quantity is less than the demand, the supply quantity could be increased (or not, if you have a maximum quantity policy).  
    2. If the supply quantity is greater than the demand, the supply quantity can be decreased (or not, if you have a minimum quantity policy).  

    At this point, one of these two situations exist:  

    1. The current demand can be covered, in which case it can be closed and planning for the next demand can start.  
    2. The supply has reached its maximum, leaving some of the demand quantity uncovered. In this case, the planning system can close the current supply and proceed to the next one.  

 The procedure starts all over with the next demand and the current supply, or vice versa. The current supply might be able to cover this next demand as well, or the current demand has not yet been fully covered.  

### Rules for actions for supply events

For top-down calculations in which supply must fulfill demand, the demand is taken as a given. It's outside the control of the planning system. However, the planning system can manage the supply side and will make the following suggestions:

* Create new supply orders
* Reschedule existing orders or change their quantities
* Cancel supply orders that are no longer needed  

To exclude a supply order from the planning suggestions, you can state that it has no planning flexibility (Planning Flexibility = None). Then, excess supply from that order will be used to cover demand, but no action will be suggested. 

In general, all supply has a planning flexibility that's limited by the conditions of each of the suggested actions.  

* **Reschedule Out**: The date of an existing supply order can be scheduled out to meet the demand due date unless:

  * It represents inventory (always on day zero).  
  * It has an order-to-order linked to another demand.  
  * It's outside the window for rescheduling in the time bucket.
  * There's a closer supply that could be used.  
  * On the other hand, the user may decide not to reschedule because:
  * The supply order is tied to another demand on a previous date.  
  * The needed rescheduling is so minimal it's negligible.  

* **Reschedule In**: The date of an existing supply order can be scheduled in, except under the following conditions:

  * It's linked directly to some other demand.  
  * It's outside the window for rescheduling defined by the time bucket.

> [!NOTE]  
> When planning an item using a reorder point, you can reschedule the supply order. This often happens in forward-scheduled supply orders triggered by a reorder point.

* **Increase Quantity**: The quantity of an existing supply order can be increased to meet the demand unless the supply order is linked directly to a demand by an order-to-order link.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Although you can increase the supply order, the increase might be limited due to a defined maximum order quantity.  

* **Decrease Quantity**: An existing supply order with a surplus compared to an existing demand can be decreased to meet the demand.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Although the quantity can be decreased, there might be surplus compared to the demand due to a defined minimum order quantity or order multiple. 

* **Cancel**: As a special incident of the decrease quantity action, the supply order can be canceled if it's been decreased to zero. 
* **New**: If there aren't any supply orders, or an existing order can't be changed to meet the quantity needed on the due date for the demand, a new supply order is suggested.  

### Determine the supply quantity  

You define the planning parameters that control the suggested quantity of each supply order.  

When the planning system calculates the quantity of a new supply order or the quantity to change on an existing order, the suggested quantity might differ from the actual demand.  

If a maximum inventory or fixed order quantities are selected, the suggested quantity might be increased to meet the fixed quantity or the maximum inventory. If a reordering policy uses a reorder point, the quantity may be increased at least to meet the reorder point. 

The suggested quantity might be modified in this sequence:  

1. Down to the maximum order quantity.  
2. Up to the minimum order quantity.  
3. Up to meet the nearest order multiple.

### Order tracking links during planning  

For order tracking during planning, the planning system rearranges the order tracking links for the combinations of items, variants, and locations. The system rearranges the tracking links for the following reasons:

* To verify its suggestions for covering all demand, and ensure that all supply orders are needed.  
* The order tracking links must be rebalanced regularly.  

Over time, order tracking links become out of balance. The links become out of balance because the order tracking network isn't rearranged until a demand or supply event is closed.

Before balancing supply by demand, the planning system deletes all order tracking links. During the balancing process, when a demand or supply event is closed, it creates new order tracking links between the supply and demand.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Even if the item isn't set up for dynamic order tracking, the planning system will create balanced order tracking links.

## Close balanced supply and demand

Balancing supply has three possible outcomes:

* The required quantity and date of the demand events are met and planning for them can be closed. The supply event stays open and might be able to cover the next demand. Keeping the supply event open lets the balancing procedure start over with the current supply event and the next demand.  
* The supply order can't be modified to cover all of the demand. The demand event is still open with an uncovered quantity that might be covered by the next supply event. Therefore the current supply event is closed, and balancing can start over with the current demand and the next supply event.  
* All of the demand is covered and there isn't a next demand (or there wasn't any demand at all). Surplus supply might be decreased (or canceled) and then closed. Any other supply events should also be canceled.  

Finally, the planning system will create an order tracking link between the supply and the demand.  

### Create the planning line (Suggested Action)  

If a **New**, **Change Quantity**, **Reschedule**, **Reschedule and Change Quantity**, or **Cancel** action is suggested to revise the supply order, the planning system creates a planning line in the planning worksheet. For order tracking, the planning line is created not only when the supply event is closed, but also if the demand event is closed. This is true even though the supply event is still open and might be changed when the next demand event is processed. The planning line may be changed again when it's created.

To reduce the load on the database when handling production orders, the planning line can be maintained in three levels:

* Create only the planning line with the current due date and quantity but without the routing and components.  
* Include routing: the planned routing includes calculation of starting and ending dates and times. Include routing is demanding in terms of database accesses. To determine the ending and due dates, it might be necessary to calculate the routing even if the supply event hasn't been closed. For example, if you're doing forward scheduling.  
* Include BOM explosion: can happen just before the supply event is closed.

# Apply payments automatically and reconciling bank accounts
You must regularly reconcile your bank, receivables, and payables accounts by applying payments recorded in the bank to their related open (unpaid) invoices and credit memos or other open entries in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

You can perform this task on the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page, for example, by importing a bank statement file or feed to quickly register the payments. Payments are applied to open customer or vendor ledger entries based on matches between payment text and entry information. You can review and change automatic applications before you post the journal. You can choose to close any open bank account ledger entries related to the applied ledger entries when you post the journal. The bank account is automatically reconciled when all payments are applied.

On the **Payment Application Rules** page, you can set up prioritized rules that govern how payment text is automatically matched with entry information.

You can also reconcile bank accounts without simultaneously applying payments. You perform this work on the **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** page. For more information, see [Reconcile Bank Accounts](bank-how-reconcile-bank-accounts-separately.md).

To import bank statements as a bank feed, you must first set up and enable the Envestnet Yodlee Bank Feed service, and then link your bank accounts to the related online bank accounts. For more information, see [set up the Envestnet Yodlee bank feeds service](bank-how-setup-bank-statement-service.md).  

> [!TIP]
> You can also import bank statement files in comma or semicolon delimited format (.CSV). Use the **Set up a bank statement file format** assisted setup to define bank statement import formats and attach the format to a bank account. You can then use these formats when you import bank statements in the **Bank Account Reconciliation** page.

Alternatively, you can use the AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals extension to convert a bank statement file, from any format, to a data stream that you can import into [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For more information, see [use the AMC banking 365 fundamentals extension](ui-extensions-amc-banking.md).

# Design Details: Posting Date on Adjustment Value Entry

This article provides guidance for users of the Inventory Costing functionality in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], and in particular for how the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job identifies and assigns a posting date to the value entries that the batch job is about to create.

## How posting dates are assigned

The **Adjust Cost – Item Entries** batch job assigns a posting date to the value entry it is about to create in the following steps:  

1. Initially the Posting Date of the entry to be created is the same date as the entry it adjusts.  

2. The Posting Date is validated against Inventory Periods and/or General Ledger Setup.  

3. Assignment of Posting Date; If the initial Posting Date is not within allowed posting date range the batch job will assign an allowed Posting Date from either General Ledger Setup or Inventory Period. If both Inventory Periods and allowed posting dates in General Ledger Setup are defined, the later date of the two will be assigned to the Adjustment Value Entry.  

Let’s review this process more in practice. Assume we have an Item Ledger Entry of Sale. The item was shipped on September 5, 2020 and it was invoiced the day after.  

#### Item Ledger Entry

|Entry No.  |Item No.  |Posting Date  |Entry Type  | Document No. |Location Code  |Quantity  |Cost Amount (Actual)  |Invoiced Quantity  |Remaining Quantity  |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|319     |A         |2020-09-05     |  Sale       |102033     |  Blue       | -1    |    -11     |-1     |    0     |

Below are the related value entries:

- **Entry No. 379** represents the shipment and carry the same Posting Date as the parent Item ledger Entry.  
- **Entry No. 381** represents the invoice.  
- **Entry No. 391** is an Adjustment of the invoicing Value Entry (Entry No. 381 above).  

|Entry No.  |Item No.  |Posting Date  |Item Ledger Entry Type  |Entry Type  |Document No.  |Item Ledger Entry No.  |Location Code  |Item Ledger Entry Quantity  |Invoiced Quantity  |Cost Amount (Actual)  |Cost Amount (Expected)  |Adjustment  |Applies-to Entry  |Source Code  |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|--------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|379     |  A       |    2020-09-05     |    Sale     | Direct Cost   | 102033        |319     | Blue        | -1       |0         |  0       |     -10   |No   |0    |Sales          |
|381     |  A       |    2020-09-06     |    Sale     | Direct Cost   | 103022        |319     | Blue        |  0       |-1        |-10       |    10     | No  |0      |       Sales   |
|391     |  A       |    2020-09-10     |    Sale     | Direct Cost   | 103022        |319     | Blue        |  0       |0         |-1        |    0     |Yes   |    181   | INVTADJMT   |

To assign the posting date for **Entry No. 391** the following steps were applied:

1. The **Adjustment Value Entry** to be created (**Entry No. 391**) is assigned same **Posting Date** as the entry it adjusts.

2. The **Adjust Cost – Item Entries** batch job determines if the initial Posting Date of the Adjustment Value Entry is within allowed posting date range based upon Inventory Periods and/or General Ledger Setup.  

Let’s review the above mentioned Sale by adding setup of allowed posting date ranges.  
  
#### Inventory Periods

|Ending Date  |Name  |Closed  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|2020-01-31     |January 2020      |  Yes    |
|2020-02-28     |February 2020     |  Yes    |
|2020-03-31     |March 2020        |  Yes    |
|2020-04-30     |April 2020        |  Yes    |
|2020-05-31     |May   2020        |  Yes    |
|2020-06-30     |June   2020       |  Yes    |
|2020-07-31     |July  2020        |  Yes    |
|2020-08-31     |August   2020     |  Yes    |
|2020-09-30     |September   2020  |         |
|2020-10-31     |October   2020    |         |
|2020-11-30     |November   2020   |         |
|2020-12-31     |December   2020   |         |

The first allowed posting date is the first day in the first open period, which is September 1, 2020.  

#### General Ledger Setup

|Field|Value  |
|---------|---------|
|Allow Posting From:  |  2020-09-10      |
|Allow Posting To:    |  2020-09-30      |
|Register Time:       |         |
|Local Address Format:|   Post Code      |  

The first allowed posting date is the date stated in field **Allow Posting From**: September 10, 2020. If both Inventory Periods and allowed posting dates in **General Ledger Setup** are defined, the later date of the two will define the allowed posting date range.  

**Assignment of an allowed posting date**  

The initial assigned Posting Date was September 6 as illustrated in step 1. However, in the second step the Adjust Cost – Item entries batch job identifies that earliest allowed Posting Date is September 10 and thereby assigns September 10 to the Adjustment Value Entry (**Entry No. 391**), below.  


|Entry No.  |Item No.  |Posting Date  |Item Ledger Entry Type  |Entry Type  |Document No.  |Item Ledger Entry No.  |Location Code  |Item Ledger Entry Quantity  |Invoiced Quantity  |Cost Amount (Actual)  |Cost Amount (Expected)  |Adjustment  |Applies-to Entry  |Source Code  |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|379     |  A       |    2020-09-05     |    Sale     | Direct Cost   | 102033        |319     | Blue        | -1       |0         |  0       |     -10   |No   |0    |Sales          |
|381     |  A       |    2020-09-06     |    Sale     | Direct Cost   | 103022        |319     | Blue        |  0       |-1        |-10       |    10     | No  |0      |       Sales   |
|391     |  A       |    **2020-09-10**     |    Sale     | Direct Cost   | 103022        |319     | Blue        |  0       |0         |-1        |    0     |Yes   |    181   | INVTADJMT   |

## Common problems with the "Adjust Cost - Item entries"-batch job

There are two scenarios that the support team encounters frequently enough for them to warrant their own problem resolution articles.

### Error message: "Posting Date is not within your range of allowed posting dates…"

If you encounter this error you need to adjust the dates for which the user is allowed to post entries. To learn more, see [Error Message "Posting Date is not within your range of allowed posting dates"](design-details-inventory-adjustment-value-entry-allowed-posting-dates.md).

### Posting Date on Adjustment Value Entry versus Posting Date on entry causing the adjustment such as Revaluation or Item charge

To learn more, see [Posting Date on Adjustment Value Entry Compared to the Source Entry](design-details-inventory-adjustment-value-entry-source-entry.md).

# Manage Saved Settings for Reports and Batch Jobs

When running reports, users are typically presented with a page that lets them select options and set filters to change the data that is included in the generated report. This page is called the *request page*. A report can include one or more *saved settings* that users can apply to the report from the request page. *Saved settings* are basically predefined options and filters. Using saved settings is a fast and reliable way to consistently generate reports that contain the correct data. For more information, see [Use saved settings](ui-work-report.md#SavedSettings).

> [!NOTE]
> This topic refers to *reports*, but similar information applies to *batch jobs*.

If you have the proper permissions, you can view, create, and modify the saved settings for all reports for all users in a company. You can assign saved settings for a report to individual users or to all users in the company.

## Manage saved settings

You manage saved settings on the **Reports Settings** page. There are two ways to open this page:

- Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Report Settings**, and then choose the related link.
- In a report's request page, choose the lookup in the **Use default values from** field, and then choose the **Select from full list** action.

    This field is only visible if you have run the report at least once earlier. The list will only show settings that are available to you, either because they are your own settings, or because the settings are shared with you.

The **Report Settings** page displays all the existing saved settings entries for all users. If there is a user name in the **Assigned to** field, only that user can use the saved settings for the associated report. If there is a check mark in the **Share with all users** field, all users can use the saved settings for the report.  

> [!TIP]
> When a user has run a report that supports shared settings, their settings are saved and added to this list. In most cases, the admin can then edit those settings and choose to share the settings with all users.
>
> However, in some cases, settings cannot be shared, and the admin cannot change them either. Most batch jobs do not support shared settings.  

## Create or modify saved settings for all users

From the **Report Settings** page, you can:

- Choose the **New** action to create a new saved settings entry from scratch.
- Select a saved settings entry from the list, and choose the **Copy** action to create a copy.
- Select a saved settings entry from the list, and choose the **Edit** action to modify a saved settings entry.

> [!Important]
> Consider the name that you give a saved settings entry. If you create a saved settings entry for all users, and you give it the same name as an existing saved settings entry that is assigned to a specific user only, then that user will not be able to use the saved settings entry that is assigned to everyone.  In the **Saved Settings** section on the request page, the user will see two saved settings entries with the same name. However, no matter which option they choose, the user-specific saved settings entry will be used.

> [!NOTE]
> The ability to save settings is available only on reports where the [SaveValues property](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/properties/devenv-savevalues-property) of the report's request page is set to **Yes**. The **SaveValues** property is set by the developer.

# Run Batch Jobs and XMLports

A batch job is a routine that processes data in batches, for example the **Adjust Exchange Rates** batch job. There are batch jobs that perform periodic accounting activities, such as closing the income statement at the end of a fiscal year. Many batch jobs do calculation work, such as calculation of finance charges, exchange rate adjustment, and calculation of unit prices.

A batch job is like a report, except the batch job uses the result of its work to update information directly, instead of printing the results.

You can schedule when a batch job runs. For more information, see [Use Job Queues to Schedule Tasks](admin-job-queues-schedule-tasks.md).

## To run a batch job
1. To open the request page for the relevant batch job, choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter the name of the batch job, and then choose the related link.
2. If there is an **Options** FastTab for the batch job, fill in the fields to determine what the batch job will do.
3. The page may contain one or more FastTab with filters, which you can use to limit the data included in the batch job. You can enter criteria in the suggested filters or add more filters.
4. Choose the **OK** button to start the batch job.

# Troubleshooting: Accessing Camera and Location

You might come across some issues when trying to access the camera and location information of a device from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. You can find the possible causes behind these problems and how to work around them listed below.

## Device must have Camera and Location Capabilities

In order to access the camera or a user's location from a device, the device must have a physical camera or the capability to retrieve location information, respectively.

If your device has camera and location capabilities but you still encounter problems, it is possible that some drivers need updating or reinstalling. Even if you are unsure, we always recommend you update your device operating system, drivers, and browser to the latest version for the best experience.

## Access Permissions not Enabled

You must enable general access to camera and location from your device's privacy settings and explicitly give permission to  [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to access them. For example, to see or change permissions for a device running on Windows, go to **Settings**, choose **Privacy**, and then **App permissions**. 

For mobile devices, you must give camera and location access permissions to the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Mobile App. To do so for an iOS device, go to **Settings**, choose **Privacy**, and then **Camera** or **Location**. For Android devices go to **Settings**, choose **Apps & Notifications**, **Advanced**, **Permission Manager**, and then **Camera** or **Location**.

In addition, if you are using [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in a browser, you must also grant the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] site permission to access the camera or location information. To see or change a site's permissions in the Microsoft Edge browser, go to **Settings**, choose **Site Permissions**, and then **Camera** or **Location**. Note that this might be different for other browsers.

By default, the device or browser will pop up a request to access these capabilities when the user activates them for the first time.

> [!NOTE]  
> Some old browsers do not grant access to camera and location. For example, camera is not available in Internet Explorer or the legacy Edge browser.

## Web Client Connection not Secure

The camera and location capabilities are only available when accessing the Web Client through SSL secured HTTP connections, using the `https://` URI scheme. 

The only exception is connecting to `http://localhost`, used for development and test purposes.


## Work with Virtualization Technologies

When connecting to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] through Remote Desktop or another virtualization, the access to camera or location might not be available. If this is the case, use the physical system instead.

## Antivirus Software
Some antivirus software block access to camera and location by default. Remember to check your antivirus software settings.

# Remove and reapply item ledger entries
On the **Application Worksheet** page, you can view and manually change certain item application entries that are created automatically during inventory transactions.  

When you post a transaction where items are moved in or out of inventory, an item application is created between each inventory increase and inventory decrease. These applications determine the flow of costs from the goods that are received in inventory to the cost of goods going out of inventory. Because of the way the unit cost is calculated, an incorrect item application could lead to a skewed average cost and a skewed unit cost. For more information, see Design Details: Item Application.

The following scenarios might require that you undo an application or reapply item ledger entries:

- You have forgotten to make a fixed application.
- You have made an incorrect fixed application.
- You have to return an item to which a sale has already been applied.

If possible, use a document to reapply an item ledger entry. For example, if you must make a purchase return of an item to which a sale has already been applied, you can reapply by creating and posting the purchase return document by using the correct application in the **Appl.-to Item Entry** field on the purchase return line. You can use the **Get Posted Document Lines to Reverse** function or the **Copy from Document** function in the purchase return document to make this easier. When you post the document, the item ledger entry is automatically reapplied. For more information, see [Process Purchase Returns or Cancellations](purchasing-how-process-purchase-returns-cancellations.md).

If you can't use a document to reapply, such as when you have to correct a fixed application, then use the **Application Worksheet** page to correct an application.

> [!Warning]  
> The following are important considerations to remember when you are working with the application worksheet:
    - You should not leave application entries unapplied for long periods of time because other users cannot process the items until you reapply the application entries or close the **Application Worksheet** page. Users who try to perform actions that involve a manually unapplied application entry receive the following error message: “You cannot perform this action because entries for item XXX are unapplied in the Application Worksheet by user XXX.”
    - You should only reapply item ledger entries during nonworking hours to avoid conflicts with other users who are posting transactions with the same items.
    - When you close the application worksheet, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] performs a check to make sure that all entries are applied. For example, if you remove a quantity application but do not create a new application, and then you close the application worksheet, a new application is created. This helps keep the cost intact. However, if you remove a fixed application, a new fixed application is not automatically created when you close the worksheet. You must do this manually by creating a new application in the worksheet.
    - It is possible to remove applications from more than one entry at a time in the application worksheet. However, because applying entries affects the set of entries that are available for application, you cannot create an application for more than one entry at a time.
    - The application worksheet cannot make an application in the following situation: If there is not enough quantity on stock to apply, the application worksheet cannot make an application when you are trying to apply an inventory decrease entry without item tracking information to an inventory increase entry with item tracking information.

## To remove an item application by using the Application Worksheet

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Application Worksheet**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  The **Application Worksheet** page opens displaying existing item ledger entries for all items.  
3.  Enter filters on the **General** FastTab to make it easier to find the item ledger entry for which you want to change the application.  
4.  Select the item ledger entry, and then choose the **Applied Entries** action. The **View Applied Entries – Applied Entries** page opens to show the item ledger entry or entries that are currently applied to the selected entry.  
5.  Select the item ledger entry for which you want to remove the application.  
6.  Choose the **Remove Application** action. This removes the item application entry that links the two item ledger entries and moves it to the **View Applied Entries – Unapplied Entries** page.  
7.  Close the **View Applied Entries – Applied Entries** page.  

 The **Remaining Quantity** field of the two item ledger entries is increased by the quantity that has been unapplied. The removed item ledger entry is now available for reapplication on the **View Applied Entries – Unapplied Entries** page.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  You should not leave application entries unapplied for longer periods of time because other users cannot process the affected items until you reapply the application entries or close the **Application Worksheet** page. The following error message is displayed if you try to perform actions that involve a manually unapplied application entry:  
>   
>  **You cannot perform this action because entries for item \<item\> are unapplied in the Application Worksheet by user \<user\>.**  

## To reapply an item application by using the Application Worksheet

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 2.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Application Worksheet**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  The **Application Worksheet** page opens displaying existing item ledger entries for all items.  
3.  To reapply entries that were removed since the worksheet was opened, select the item ledger entry that you want to reapply, and then choose the **Reapply** action.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  This reapplication to the original balance also occurs automatically when you close the **Application Worksheet** page.  
4.  To apply an available open item ledger entry to another entry, select the item ledger entry that you want to apply. Choose the **Unapplied Entries** action. The **View Applied Entries – Unapplied Entries** page opens.  
5.  Select one or more item ledger entries that you want to apply to the entry selected on the **Application Worksheet** page, and then choose the **OK** button.  

     An item application entry is created between the two item ledger entries. The **Remaining Quantity** fields of the two entries are reduced by the applied quantity.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  If you have chosen to make an application that would create an infinite loop in the cost adjustment process, then the application that you proposed is not made. This can occur when the original entries created negative stock. The application is not made. Therefore, you must select a different entry for the application.  
6.  If the **Automatic Cost Adjustment** field in the **Inventory Setup** is set to **Always**, then the cost adjustment batch job is automatically run after you make a reapplication. Otherwise, run the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job to make sure that all costs are up to date.

# Design Details: Expected Cost Posting
Expected costs represent the estimation of, for example, a purchased item’s cost that you record before you receive the invoice for the item.  

 You can post expected cost to inventory and to the general ledger. When you post a quantity that is only received or shipped but not invoiced, then a value entry is created with the expected cost. This expected cost affects the inventory value, but is not posted to the general ledger unless you set up the system up to do so.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  Expected costs are only managed for item transactions. Expected costs are not for immaterial transaction types, such as capacity and item charges.  

 If only the quantity part of an inventory increase has been posted, then the inventory value in the general ledger does not change unless you have selected the **Expected Cost Posting to G/L** check box on the **Inventory Setup** page. In that case, the expected cost is posted to interim accounts at the time of receipt. After the receipt has been fully invoiced, the interim accounts are then balanced and the actual cost is posted to the inventory account.  

 To support reconciliation and traceability work, the invoiced value entry shows the expected cost amount that has been posted to balance the interim accounts.  

## Prerequisites for posting expected costs

To make it possible to post expected costs you need to do the following:
1. On the **Inventory Setup** page, select the **Automatic Cost Posting** check box and the **Expected Cost Posting to G/L** check box.
2. Set up which interim accounts to use during the expected cost posting process.  

  On the **Inventory Posting Setup** page, verify the **Inventory Account** and the **Inventory Account (Interim)** fields for the **Location Code and Invt. Posting Group Code** of the item you will be purchasing. To learn more about these accounts see [Design Details - Accounts in the General Ledger](design-details-accounts-in-the-general-ledger.md).
3. On the **General Posting Setup** page, verify the **Invt. Accrual Acc. (Interim)** field for the **Gen. Bus. Posting Group** and the **Gen. Prod. Posting Group** you will be using.
4. When you create a purchase order the default is that the **Vendor Invoice No.** field is required. You need to turn that off on the **Purchase & Payables Setup** page, by unselecting the **Ext. Doc. No. Mandatory** field.

## Example  

> [!NOTE]  
> The account numbers used in this example are there for reference only, and will be different in your system. Set them up as directed in the Prerequisites above.

You post a purchase order as received. The expected cost is LCY 95.00.

# Manage permissions through user groups (legacy)

[!INCLUDE [2023rw1-sec-group-long](includes/2023rw1-sec-group-long.md)]

User groups help you manage permission sets across the company. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online includes default user groups that are assigned to users automatically based on their license. You can add users manually to a user group, and you can create new user groups as copies of existing ones.  

You start by creating a user group. Then you assign permission sets to the group to define which object users of the group can access. When you add user to the group, the permission sets defined for the group applies to the user.

Permission sets assigned to a user through a user group stay synchronized. A change to the user group permissions is automatically propagated to the users. If you remove a user from a user group, the involved permissions are automatically revoked.

## Add users to a user group

The following procedure explains how to create user groups manually. To learn how to create user groups automatically, go to [To copy a user group and all its permission sets](#copy-a-user-group-and-all-its-permission-sets).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **User Groups**, and then choose the related link.

    1. Alternatively, on the **Users** page, choose the **User Groups** action.
2. On the **User Group** page, choose the **User Group Members** action.
3. On the **User Group Members** page, choose the **Add Users** action.

## Copy a user group and all its permission sets

To quickly define a new user group, you can copy all permission sets from an existing user group to your new user group.

> [!NOTE]
> The user group members aren't copied to the new user group. You must add them manually afterwards. To learn more, go to [To add users to a user group](#add-users-to-a-user-group).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **User Groups**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the user group that you want to copy, and then choose the **Copy User Group** action.
3. In the **New User Group Code** field, enter a name for the group, and then choose the **OK** button.

The new user group is added to the **User Groups** page. Proceed to add users. To learn more, go to [To add users to a user group](#add-users-to-a-user-group) section.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> A validation error displays if you try to assign a user group that refers to a permission set which was defined in an extension that you uninstalled. It's because the App ID of the extension is validated whenever something references it. To assign that user group to a user, either:
>
> - Reinstall the extension.
> - Remove the reference of the uninstalled extension from the permission set.
> - Remove that permission set from the user group.

## Assign permission sets to user groups

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **User Groups**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the user group that you want to assign permission to.  

    Any permission sets that are already assigned to the user are displayed in the **Permission Sets** FactBox.
3. Choose the **User Permission Sets** action to open the **User Permission Sets** page.
4. On the **User Permission Sets** page, on a new line, fill in the fields as necessary.

## Assign a permission set on the Permission Set by User Group page

The following procedure explains how to assign permission sets to a user group on the **Permission Set by User Group** page.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Users**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Users** page, select the relevant user, and then choose the **Permission Set by User Group** action.
3. On the **Permission Set by User Group** page, select the **[user group name]** field on a line for the relevant permission set to assign the set to the user group.
4. Select the **All User Groups** checkbox to assign the permission set to all user groups.

You can also assign permissions sets directly to a user.
license configurations on the **License Configuration** page. Choose a license, and then delete all permission sets assigned to it.

## Convert users groups to security groups

> [!NOTE]
> Security groups replace user groups in 2024 release wave 2 (version 25) and later. If you're using on-premises version 22, 23, or 24, use the assisted setup guide to convert user groups to permission sets and transition to security groups.

Security groups are very similar to the user groups that are currently available. However, user groups are only relevant for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Security groups are based on groups in Microsoft Entra ID or Windows Active Directory, depending on whether you're using [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online or on-premises, respectively. Groups benefit administrators because they can use them with other Dynamics 365 apps. For example, if salespeople use [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and SharePoint, administrators don't have to recreate the group and its members.

### Convert user groups to permission sets

In 2023 release wave 1 and later, you can convert user groups to permission sets in your tenant. The permission sets provide the same functionality as user groups. Here are some examples:

* You can use the **Users** FactBox to manage permissions for users.
* You can drill down on the permission set name to add other permission sets to the set you're working on. To learn more, go to [To add other permission sets](ui-define-granular-permissions.md#to-add-other-permission-sets).

Use the **User Group Migration** assisted setup guide to convert your groups. To start the guide, on the **Feature Management** page, find **Feature: Convert user group permissions**, and then choose **All Users** in the **Enabled For** field. The assisted setup guide offers the following options for the conversion.

|Option  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|Assign to user     | Assign the permissions in user groups directly to the users who were assigned to the group, and remove their user group assignments.        |
|Convert to a permission set     | Create a new permission for the permissions in each user group. The new permission set is assigned to all members of each user group.          |

### License configurations still apply

You can configure permissions in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] based on licenses. Those permissions are directly assigned to new users. These configurations still apply, even if you start using security groups.

To use security groups exclusively, we recommend that you remove the license configurations. To learn more about license configurations, go to [Create Users According to Licenses](ui-how-users-permissions.md).

You can remove license configurations on the **License Configuration** page. Choose a license, and then delete all permission sets assigned to it.

# Reconcile bank accounts with Copilot

This article explains how bank account reconciliation assist can help you reconcile bank transactions with ledger entries in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central.

## About bank account reconciliation assist

Bank account reconciliation assist is a set of AI-powered features that help you reconcile bank accounts. It offers two distinct tasks through Copilot:

- Improved matching of transactions with ledger entries

    As you might already know, the **Match Automatically** button on the **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** page automatically matches most bank transactions with ledger entries. We refer to this operation as *automatch*. Although automatch works well, the algorithms that it uses can sometimes result in many unmatched transactions. Copilot uses AI technology to inspect those unmatched transactions and identify more matches, based on the dates, amounts, and descriptions. For example, if a customer paid multiple invoices in one lump sum that you have registered as individually paid invoices, Copilot reconciles the single bank statement line with the multiple bank ledger entries.

    [Learn more about this task](#reconcile-bank-accounts-with-copilot).

- Suggested general ledger (G/L) accounts

    For residual bank transactions that can't be matched to any ledger entries, Copilot compares the transaction description with G/L account names and then suggests the most likely G/L account to post to. For example, if unmatched transactions have the narrative *Fuel Stop 24*, Copilot might suggest that you post them to the *Transportation* account.

    [Learn more about this task](#post-unmatched-bank-transaction-amounts-to-suggested-gl-accounts).

## Supported languages

[!INCLUDE[copilot-language-support](includes/copilot-language-support.md)]

## Prerequisites

- The **Bank account reconciliation** capability is activated. An administrator must complete this task. Learn more in [Configure Copilot and agent capabilities](enable-ai.md).
- You're familiar with bank account reconciliation in Business Central. Learn more in [Reconcile Bank Accounts](bank-how-reconcile-bank-accounts-separately.md).

## Reconcile bank accounts with Copilot

<!-- Similar to the **Match Automatically** capability on the **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** page, Bank account reconciliation assist can also automatically matches transactions in banks statements with bank entries. The difference is that **Match Automatically** uses a native rules-based algorithm, while Bank account reconciliation assist is based AI technology though Copilot. Bank account reconciliation assist is intended to supplement the **Match Automatically** capability. While **Match Automatically** is fairly successful at matching transactions, there are some instances where it can't&mdash;which is where Bank account reconciliation assist comes. By using the **Reconcile with Copilot** action on **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** page, you can find even more matches.-->

Copilot in bank account reconciliation is intended to supplement the automatch operation. Therefore, when you use Copilot, the automatch operation runs first to make the initial matches. Then Copilot runs to try to match transactions that the automatch operation didn't handle.

You can use two approaches to reconcile bank accounts with Copilot:

- Use Copilot to start a new reconciliation on a bank account, directly from the **Bank Account Reconciliations** list.
- Use Copilot on a new or existing reconciliation on a **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** card.

# [From the Bank Account Reconciliation list](#tab/fromlist)

For this approach, you create and reconcile a new bank account reconciliation from scratch. This approach requires that you select the bank account. If the bank account isn't linked to an online account, you must also import the bank statement file.

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Bank Account Reconciliations**, and then select the related link.
1. Select ![Shows the copilot icon](media/copilot-icon.png) **Start a Copilot prompt action** > **Reconcile** to open the **Reconcile with Copilot** window.
1. Set the **Perform reconciliation for this bank account** field to the bank account that you want to reconcile.

    ![Screenshot that shows the Reconcile with Copilot window for reconciling from scratch.](media/reconcile-bank-accounts-new-copilot.svg)

1. If the selected bank account isn't linked to an online bank account, you must import the bank statement file. To import the file, either select the value in the **Use transaction data from** field or select the paper clip button next to the **Generate** button. Then use **Select the file to import** to import the bank statement file by either dragging it from your device or browsing your device.
1. To reconcile with Copilot, select **Generate**.

    Copilot starts to generate proposed matches. When it finishes, the **Reconcile with Copilot** window shows the results of the matching process.

1. Review the proposed matches as described in the next section.

# [From a Bank Acc. Reconciliation card](#tab/fromcard)

For this approach, you use Copilot either on a new bank account reconciliation that you manually create or by editing an existing reconciliation.

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Bank Account Reconciliations**, and then select the related link.
1. Follow one of these steps:

    - Select **New** to start a new reconciliation. Add the statement lines, either manually or by using **Suggest Lines** action to get a copy of the bank ledger entries as a starting point.
    - Select and open an existing reconciliation in the list.

1. On the **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** card, select ![Shows the Copilot icon](media/copilot-icon-rainbow.png) > **Reconcile with Copilot** in the upper-right corner.

    ![Screenshot that shows the Reconcile with Copilot button on a Bank Acc. Reconciliation card.](media/bank-reconciliation-copilot-card.png)

    Copilot starts to generate proposed matches. When it finishes, the **Reconcile with Copilot** window shows the results of the matching process.

1. Review the proposed matches as described in the next section.
---

### Review, save, or discard proposed matches

After you run Copilot, the **Reconcile with Copilot** window shows the detailed results, including any proposed matches. At this point, no match that Copilot proposed has been saved. Therefore, you have an opportunity to inspect the proposals and save or discard them as you want.

![Screenshot that shows proposed matches in the Reconcile with Copilot window.](media/bank-reconciliation-copilot-window.png)

The **Reconcile with Copilot** window is divided into two sections. The upper section provides some general details about the result. The lower section, **Match proposals**, lists the matches that Copilot proposed.

The following table describes the fields in the upper section.

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| Auto-matched | The number of bank statement lines that the automatch operation matched. Select the value to view the reconciliation card. |
| Copilot matched | The number of bank statement lines that Copilot proposed matches for. You can view details of the matches in the **Match proposals** section. |
| Statement Ending Balance | The ending balance that is shown on the bank statement that you're reconciling with. |
| Post if fully applied | Turn on this option to automatically post the bank account reconciliation when all lines (100 percent) are matched and you select **Keep it**. |

In the **Match proposals** section, review the proposed matches line by line. Then take the appropriate action:

- To discard a single proposed match, select it in the list, and then select **Delete Line**.
- To discard all proposed matches and close the **Reconcile with Copilot** window, select the ![Discard button.](media/copilot-delete-trash-can.png) **Discard it** button next to the **Keep it** button at the bottom of the window.
- To automatically post the fully matched reconciliation when you save it, turn on the **Post if fully applied** option.
- To save the matches that are currently shown in the **Reconcile with Copilot** window, select **Keep it**.

## Post unmatched bank transaction amounts to suggested G/L accounts

This section explains how to use Copilot to post unreconciled bank account statement line amounts (as specified in the **Difference** field) to a G/L account. This task can be done only from an existing reconciliation.

1. Go to the **Bank Account Reconciliations** list, and open the existing reconciliation that includes the unreconciled lines.

    This step gives you a clear view of any unreconciled bank statement lines that must be transferred to the G/L account.

1. In the **Bank statement lines** pane, identify the unmatched bank statement lines, and select one or more lines that you want to reconcile.

    Copilot focuses on the selected lines to post new payments to the G/L account.

1. Select ![Shows the Copilot icon](media/copilot-icon-rainbow.png) > **Post Difference to G/L Account** to start the process.

    ![Screenshot that shows the Post Difference to G/L Account button on the Bank Acc. Reconciliation card.](media/bank-reconciliation-transfer-gl-copilot-card.png)

    Copilot starts to generate proposals for posting new payments.

1. After Copilot finishes generating proposals, the **Copilot Proposals for Posting Differences to G/L Accounts** window appears.

    The **Match proposals** section of this window shows the proposals. The experience resembles the experience for reconciling with Copilot.

    ![Screenshot that shows Copilot Proposals for Posting Differences to G/L Accounts window.](media/bank-reconciliation-gl-transfer-proposed-matches-v2.png)

    To post the differences as regular journal entries, you must specify the general journal template and batch to use. This allows you to reverse the transaction if you need to later.

1. Review the proposals line by line to ensure the accuracy of the suggested payments for posting.

    - If you drill down on the proposal by selecting it in the list, you're taken to a list of accounts. From there, you can select another account. You can do this type of manual correction only when you use the **Post Difference to G/L Account** flow, not the matching flow.
    - If you select **Save** next to a proposal, you can add the mapping to the **Text-to-Account Mapping** page. Then, the next time that this text appears during matching, it's mapped to the proposed account.

1. Discard or save proposals.

    - To discard a specific proposal, select it in the list, and then select **Delete Line**. To discard all proposals and close Copilot, select the ![Discard button.](media/copilot-delete-trash-can.png) **Discard it** button next to the **Keep it** button at the bottom of the window.
    - If the proposals meet your requirements, and you want to save them, select **Keep it**.

         This step confirms the transfer of the currently selected proposals from the bank account ledger to the G/L account. It posts new payments to the proposed G/L accounts and applies corresponding lines to the resulting bank account ledger entries.

# Allocation Status and Repair Status of Service Items
The repair status of service items and the allocation status of the allocation entries for the service items have a certain relationship in Service Management. The allocation status changes when you change the repair status of the service item to **Finished** or **Partly Serviced** and when you convert a service quote to a service order. The repair status of the service item changes when you cancel the service item allocation or reallocate the service item to another resource. You can view the repair status of service items on the **Service Tasks** page and you can update the repair status in the **Repair Status Code** field on the **Service Item Worksheet** page. You can view the allocation status in the **Status** field on the **Resource Allocations** page.  
  
## Changing Repair Status  
When you change the repair status of a service item on a service item line, there is a search for a corresponding allocation entry for this service item that has the status **Active**. If such an allocation entry is found, the status is updated in one of the following ways:  
  
* If you change the repair status to **Finished**, the allocation status is changed from **Active** to **Finished**.  
* If you change the repair status to **Partly Serviced**, that is, some of the service has been completed, or **Referred**, that is, no service has been done, the allocation status is changed from **Active** to **Reallocation Needed**.  
* When a service order allocation entry is created that indicates that no resource has been allocated, the **Status** field on the **Resource Allocation** page is set to **Nonactive**.  
* The allocation entry status is set to **Canceled** when you reallocate the referred service item in the service order allocation entry, which indicates that the allocated resource or resource group has not attempted the service task.  
  
The allocation status reflects when the service process is finished, or when another resource is necessary in order to finish the service of the service item.  
  
## Converting Service Quotes to Service Orders  
When you convert a service quote to a service order, the service order, the service items in the order and their allocation entries are updated in the following ways:  
  
* The repair status of the service items is changed to **Initial**.  
* The service order status is changed to **Pending**.  
* There is a search for allocation entries for all the service items in the service order that have the status **Active**. If such allocation entries are found, their allocation status is changed from **Active** to **Reallocation Needed**.  
  
## Canceling Allocations  
When you cancel an allocation for a service item, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] updates the allocation status of the corresponding allocation entry from **Active** to **Reallocation Needed**.

The repair status of the service item in the allocation entry is updated in the following ways:  
  
* If the repair status is **Initial**, the repair status is changed to **Referred** (no service has been started).  
* If the repair status is **In Process**, the repair status is changed to **Partly Serviced** (some service has been completed).  
  
## Reallocating an Active Allocation Entry  
When you reallocate a service item in an allocation entry that is **Active**, the allocation entry is updated in the following ways:  
  
* If service was started when the allocation was **Active** (that is, if the repair status of the service item in the entry was changed to **In Process**), the allocation status is changed from **Active** to **Finished**.  
* If service was not started when the allocation was **Active**, the allocation status is changed from **Active** to **Canceled**.  
  
The repair status of the service item in the allocation entry is updated in the same way as if you had canceled the allocation:  
  
* If the repair status is **Initial**, the repair status is changed to **Referred** (no service has been started).  
* If the repair status is **In Process**, the repair status is changed to **Partly Serviced** (some service has been completed).  
  
A new allocation entry that contains the new resource is created that has the status **Active**.  
  
## Reallocating a Service Item  
When you reallocate a service item in an allocation entry that has the status **Reallocation Needed**, the allocation entry is updated in the following ways:  
  
* If service was started when the allocation was **Active** (that is, if the repair status of the service item in the entry was changed to **In Process**), the allocation status is changed from **Reallocation Needed** to **Finished**.  
* If service was not started when the allocation was **Active**, the allocation status is changed from **Reallocation Needed** to **Canceled**.  
  
A new allocation entry that contains the new resource is created that has the status **Active**.

# Administration Tasks

Central administration tasks are usually performed by one role in the company. The scope of these tasks can depend on the company's size and the administrator's job responsibilities. These tasks can include managing database synchronization of job and email queues, setting up users, and customizing the user interface.  

Entering the correct setup values from the start is important to the success of any new business software. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes a number of setup guides that help you set up core data. For more information, see [Setting Up Business Central](setup.md).

> [!NOTE]
> You can use the data migration tools to migrate existing data to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online. Alternatively, you can set up a new company in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with configuration packages to shorten deployment times, improve quality of implementation, introduce a repeatable approach to implementations, and enhance productivity by automating and simplifying recurring tasks. For more information, see [Migrate On-Premises Data to Business Central Online](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/migrate-data).

You can support your setup decisions with some general recommendations for selected setup fields that are known to potentially cause the solution to be inefficient if defined incorrectly.  

A super user or an administrator can set up the Data Exchange Framework to enable users to export and import data in bank and payroll files, for example for various cash management processes. For more information, see [Exchanging Data Electronically](across-data-exchange.md).

The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the articles that describe them.

# Set Up Multiple Interest Rates for Delayed Payment

You can use different interest rates for different periods for delayed payments in trade transactions. [!INCLUDE [multiple-interest-rates-def](includes/multiple-interest-rates-def.md)]

For example, a government specifies the maximum interest to be levied for a consumer. This interest rate can be changed twice a year on 01 January and 01 July. The interest rate between businesses (B2B) is agreed by the parties and there is no limit to that customer group. The announced rate is usually four percent more than the normal bank interest.

When you create finance charge terms and reminder terms, for delayed payment penalty, you can specify multiple interest rates so that the penalty fee is calculated from different interest rates in different periods.  

## To set up multiple interest rates

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Finance Charge Terms**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Finance Charge Terms** page, select the required finance term, and then choose the **Interest Rates** action.  
3. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
4. Choose the **OK** button.  
5. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Reminder Terms**, and then choose the related link.  
6. On the **Reminder Terms** page, select the required reminder term, and then choose the **Levels** action.  
7. On the **Reminder Levels** page, for the relevant reminder levels, select the **Calculate Interest** field.  

When you issue a finance charge memo, the memo shows the finance charges with multiple interest rates for a specific time period. The memo also contains the contact details of the customer, the company issuing the memo, the additional amount, and the total amount. The opening entry on the memo is displayed in bold. The finance charges are calculated with multiple interest rates for a specific time period and are printed after the opening entry of the memo.

# Suggest vendor payments

On the **Payment Journal** page, you can use the **Suggest Vendor Payments** batch job to suggest payment lines. Based on your settings, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] suggests lines for:

- Payments that are due soon.
- Payments where a payment discount is available.

To benefit fully from payment suggestions, you must prioritize your vendors. To learn more about prioritizing vendors, go to [Prioritize Vendors](purchasing-how-prioritize-vendors.md).  

> [!NOTE]  
> The batch job excludes vendor ledger entries that are **On Hold** or that are already applied and have a value in the **Applies-to ID** field.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> If you want to take advantage of payment discounts, and have entered an available amount, the amount will be used for:  
>
> * Prioritized overdue vendor entries first, in order of priority.
> * Overdue vendor entries that aren't prioritized.  
> * Open vendor entries that qualify for payment discounts. The entries are arranged by vendor number.  

## Use the Suggest Vendor Payments action

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Payment Journals**, and then select the related link.  
2. Open the journal, and then select the **Suggest Vendor Payments** action.  
3. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  
4. Select the **OK** button.  

## Insert the due date as posting date on payment journal lines

When you use the **Suggest Vendor Payments** batch job to create payment lines for your vendors, you can fill two special fields to ensure that the generated lines use the due date to calculate the posting date. These fields are **Calculate Posting Date from Applies-to-Doc. Due Date** and **Applies-to-Doc. Due Date Offset**.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> You can't use the **Calculate Posting Date from Applies-to-Doc. Due Date** field together with the **Find Payment Discounts** field or the **Summarize per Vendor** field. If the posting date is based on the due date, some payment discounts might not calculate correctly because the posting date is after the payment discount date.  

Also, if the calculated posting date is in the past, then the posting date is moved up to the work date and a warning displays.  

You can also manually create payment lines using the due date to calculate the posting date. After you apply vendor ledger entries, you can use the **Calculate Posting Date** action to update the posting date on the journal line with the due date of the related purchase invoice. To learn more about this manual process, go to [Apply Purchase Transactions Manually](payables-how-apply-purchase-transactions-manually.md).  

> [!NOTE]  
> If the purchase invoice is overdue, the posting date is set to the work date and the font on the line changes to red.

# Register consumption and output for a released production order

Use the **Production Journal** page to register consumption output for a released production order. The journal combines the functions of the separate consumption journal and output journals into one journal. You open the combined journal from a released production order. Its purpose is to manually post the consumption of components, the quantity of end items produced, and the time spent on operations. The values post to ledger entries under the released production order. Consumption quantities post as negative item ledger entries, output quantities post as positive ledger entries, and time spent posts as capacity ledger entries. The posted values also display at the bottom of the journal as actual quantities.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Because consumption data is processed together with output data, this journal displays linked components and operations in a logical process structure. Components are indented under their respective operation. This linking requires that you use routing link codes. To learn more about routing links, go to [To create routing links](production-how-to-create-routings.md#to-create-routing-links).  

> [!NOTE]  
> Components without routing link codes list first in the journal.  

## To register consumption and output  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon enter **Released Prod. Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open a released production order line that's ready to register. On the **Lines** FastTab, choose the **Line** action, and then choose the **Production Journal** action.  

    The **Production Journal** page shows journal lines for the production order line according to the **Prod. Order Component** and **Prod. Order Routing** pages. These lines come from the production BOM and routing assigned to the item that is being produced. To learn more, go to [Create Production BOMs](production-how-to-create-routings.md).  

3. In the **Posting Date** field, enter a posting date that applies to all lines. The work date is entered by default. The field is meant as a quick way to align posting dates on all lines, if relevant.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > Posting dates on individual lines override this field.  

4. In the **Flushing Method Filter** field, you can choose to also view consumption and output that is posted automatically according to the flushing methods defined for the item and resource respectively. To learn more, go to [Enable Flushing of Components According to Operation Output](production-how-to-flush-components-according-to-operation-output.md).

5. Enter the consumption and output quantities.  
  
    On each type of line in the journal, only the relevant fields are shown. Other fields are blank and you can't edit them.  

    When you open the journal, it shows the quantities to post. If nothing is posted so far, all quantity fields show the expected quantities from the production order. If partial postings were done, the quantity fields on the lines show the remaining quantities. The quantities and times already posted for the order display at the bottom of the journal as actual entries.  

    > [!TIP]
    > For the quantities in the **Output Quantity** field, you can specify which values to preset when you first open the journal. On the **Manufacturing Setup** page, on the **General** FastTab, enter the value in the **Preset Output Quantity** field.

    > [!NOTE]  
    > Only the output quantity on the last journal line of entry type **Output** adjusts the inventory level when posting the journal. Therefore, don't post the journal with the expected output quantity preset on the last output line until all end items are produced.  

6. Select the **Finished** field of output lines to indicate that the operation is finished. This field is related to the **Routing Status** field on a production order routing line.  
7. Choose the **Post** action to register the quantities and then close the journal.  

    [!INCLUDE [preview-posting-inventory](includes/preview-posting-inventory.md)]

    If values remain to be posted, the journal contains the remaining values the next time you open it. Posted values show as actual values in the bottom of the journal.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > If an item that's being consumed is blocked, the journal doesn't post consumption quantities for it. If a machine or work center is blocked, the journal doesn't post output quantities or process times for the output line.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > If you close the journal without posting, the changes are lost.  

> [!WARNING]  
> Only one person can use the **Production Journal** page at a time. For example, User 2 opens the page and enters data when User 1 is already working on the page. User 2 might lose their data when User 1 closes the page.

# Maintain fixed assets

Maintenance costs are operating expenses for the things you do to preserve the condition of your fixed assets. Unlike capital improvements, maintenance doesn't increase the value of your assets.

Each time you send a fixed asset for service, you record information such as the service date, the vendor who did the work, and the service agent's phone number. You enter maintenance information on several pages:

* Fixed Asset Card
* Purchase Order
* Purchase Invoice
* Fixed Asset G/L Journal

Indexation is used to adjust values for general price-level changes. Use the **Index Fixed Assets** action to recalculate maintenance costs.

## Record a maintenance cost directly on a fixed asset

Every time you do maintenance for an asset, such as a service visit, you can record it on the **Maintenance Registrations** page.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Fixed Assets**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the fixed asset that you want to record maintenance for, and then choose the **Maintenance Registration** action.
3. On the **Maintenance Registration** page, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  

## Post maintenance costs from a fixed asset G/L journal

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Depreciation Book List**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the depreciation book that is assigned to the fixed asset, and then choose the **Edit** action.
3. On the **Depreciation Book Card** page, make sure the **Maintenance** checkbox isn't selected so that you don't post maintenance costs to the general ledger.
4. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **FA G/L Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
5. Create an initial journal line and fill in the fields as necessary.
6. In the **FA Posting Type** field, select **Maintenance**.
7. Choose the **Insert FA Bal. Account** action. A second journal line is created for the balancing account that is set up for maintenance posting.

    > [!NOTE]  
    > Step 7 only works if you set up the following: On the **FA Posting Group Card** page for the posting group of the fixed asset, the **Maintenance Account** field contains the general ledger debit account and the **Maintenance Bal. Account** field contains the general ledger account to which you want to post balancing entries for appreciation. For more information, see [To set up fixed asset posting groups](fa-how-setup-general.md#to-set-up-fixed-asset-posting-groups).
8. Choose the **Post** action.

## Record maintenance cost from a purchase invoice

The following steps describe how to record maintenance costs for a fixed asset from a purchase invoice. The steps are similar for purchase orders.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Invoice**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **General** FastTab, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
3. On the **Lines** FastTab, in the **Type** field, choose **Fixed Asset**.
4. In the **No.** field, choose the asset, and then specify the quantity and cost.
5. In the **FA Posting Type** field, choose **Maintenance**.
6. Post the purchase invoice.

## Follow up on service visits

You can print the **Maintenance - Next Service** report to list the assets that are scheduled for service. You can also use this report when you want to update the **Next Service Date** field on fixed asset cards.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Maintenance Next Service**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the **Starting Date** and **Ending Date** fields.  
3. Choose the **Print** or **Preview** button.


## Monitor maintenance costs

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides dedicated reports and statistics pages for use in analyzing fixed assets maintenance.  

To learn more about the built-in reports for fixed asset maintenance, go to [Fixed assets maintenance reports](fa-reports.md#fixed-assets-maintenance-reports).

# Delete Approval Workflows

If you're certain a workflow is no longer being used, you can delete it. All workflow step instances defined in the workflow must have a **Completed** status.

> [!CAUTION]
> When you delete a workflow, all information in the workflow is lost.

On the **Workflow** page, you create a workflow by listing the involved steps on the lines. Each step consists of a workflow event, moderated by event conditions, and a workflow response, moderated by response options. You define workflow steps by filling fields on workflow lines using fixed lists of event and response values representing scenarios supported by the application code.

# Use Dynamics 365 Sales from Business Central

If you use [!INCLUDE [crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] for customer engagement, you can enjoy seamless integration in the lead-to-cash process by using [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] for backend activities:

* Process orders
* Manage inventory
* Do your finances

Before you can use the integration capabilities, your system administrator must set up the connection and define users in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]. To learn more, go to [Integrating with Dynamics 365 Sales](admin-prepare-dynamics-365-for-sales-for-integration.md).

> [!NOTE]
> These steps describe the process of integrating online versions of [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. To learn more about on-premises configurations, go to [Preparing Dynamics 365 Sales for Integration on-premises](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/prepare-dynamics-365-for-sales-for-integration).

Integrating the applications lets you access data in Sales from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], and in some cases the other way around. You can work with and synchronize data that both services have in common. For example, customers, contacts, and sales information. Synchronization keeps data up to date in both applications.  

For example, a sales person in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] can use the price lists from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] when they create a sales order. When they add the item to the sales order line in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)], they can check the inventory level (availability) of the item from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

Conversely, order processors in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can handle sales orders that are automatically or manually transferred from [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]. For example, they can create and post sales order lines for items or resources that were entered in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] as write-in products. To learn more, go to [Handling Sales Order Data](marketing-integrate-dynamicscrm.md#handle-sales-order-data).

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] integrates only with [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]. Other Dynamics 365 applications that change the standard workflow or data model in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)], for example Project Service Automation, can break the integration between [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)].

## Couple records

The assisted setup guide lets you choose the data to synchronize. Later, you can also set up synchronization for specific records, which is referred to as *coupling*. For example, you can couple a specific account in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] with a specific customer in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. This section describes what to consider when you couple records.

For example, if you want to see accounts in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] as customers in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you must couple the two types of records. To do that, on the **Customers** list page in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], use the **Set Up Coupling** action. Then specify which [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] customers to match to which accounts in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)].

You can also create (and couple) an account in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] based on, for example, a customer record in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] using **Create Account in Dynamics 365 Sales**, or vice versa, using **Create Customer in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]**.

When you set up coupling between two records, you can also manually request current record, for example a customer, to be overwritten immediately by account data from Sales (or from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]) using **Synchronize Now** action. The **Synchronize Now** action asks whether to overwrite Sales or [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] record data.

In some cases you must couple certain sets of data before other sets of data, as shown in the following table.

|Data|What to couple first|
|-----|----|
|Customers and accounts|Couple salespeople with [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] users|
|Items and resources|Couple units of measure with [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] unit groups|
|Items and resource prices|Couple customer price groups with [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] prices|

> [!NOTE]  
> If your prices or customers use foreign currencies, make sure that you couple currencies to Sales transaction currencies.

In [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)], sales orders depend on information such as customers, units of measure, currencies, customer price groups, and items and/or resources. For the integration with sales orders to work you must couple customers, units of measure, currencies, customer price groups, and items and/or resources.

## Fully synchronize records

At the end of the assisted setup guide, you can choose the **Run Full Synchronization** action to start synchronizing all [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] records with all related records in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]. On the **Dynamics 365 Sales Full Synch Review** page, you choose the **Start** action. Full synchronization can take some time to complete, but you can continue to work in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] while it runs in the background.

To check the progress of individual jobs in a full synchronization, on the **Dynamics 365 Sales Full Synch Review** page, choose a record to view details. To update the status during synchronization, refresh the page.

From the **Microsoft Dynamics 365 Connection Setup** page, you can get details about full synchronization at any time. From here, you can also open the **Integration Table Mappings** page to see details about the tables in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and Sales that must be synchronized.

## Synchronize on a recurring schedule

The integration provides a few default jobs in the job queue that synchronize data for you. The jobs synchronize data every 30 minutes, but you can change that schedule. To learn more about the default synchronization jobs, go to [Synchronization jobs for a Sales integration](admin-prepare-dynamics-365-for-sales-for-integration.md#synchronization-jobs-for-a-sales-integration). To learn more about the job queue, go to [Use job queues to schedule tasks](admin-job-queues-schedule-tasks.md).

## Handle sales order data

Sales orders that people submit in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] transfer to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] if you select the **Automatically Create Sales Orders** checkbox on the **Microsoft Dynamics 365 Connection Setup** page.

Alternatively, you can manually convert submitted sales orders from [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] by using the **Create in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]** action on the **Sales Orders - Dynamics 365 for Sales** page.

On such sales orders, the **Name** field on the original order is transferred and mapped to the **External Document Number** field on the sales order in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

The same is true if the original sales order contains write-in products, meaning items or resources that aren't registered in either app. In that case, you must fill in the **Write-in Product Type** and **Write-in Product No.** fields on the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page so that sales of nonregistered products are mapped to a specified item or resource number.

> [!NOTE]
> You can't map write-ins to items or resources in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] that are coupled with a product in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]. To allow for write-ins, we recommend that you create an item or resource specifically for that purpose, and don't couple it with a product in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)].

If the description of the item on the original sales order is long, another sales order line of the type **Comment** is created to hold the full text on the sales order in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

Updates to fields on sales order headers, such as the **Last Shipment Date** or **Requested Delivery Date** fields, that are mapped in the **SALESORDER-ORDER** integration table mapping periodically synchronize to [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]. Processes such as releasing, shipping, and invoicing a sales order are posted to the sales order timeline in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]. When sales orders in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] are completely shipped, the **Last Shipment Date** field updates, and the status of the order in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] is set to **Fulfilled**. For more information, see [Introduction to activity feeds](/dynamics365/sales-enterprise/manage-activities). To learn how to enable posting and activities for orders in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)], go to [Set up the Notes control to access information about posts for a custom entity](/dynamics365/customerengagement/on-premises/customize/notes-control-legacy) in the Customer Engagement documentation. The article refers to Customer Engagement on-premises, but the steps are the same for the online version.

> [!NOTE]  
> Periodical synchronization based on the **SALESORDER-ORDER** integration table mapping works only when sales order integration is enabled. To learn more, go to [Connection settings on the Sales Connection Setup Page](admin-prepare-dynamics-365-for-sales-for-integration.md). Only sales orders created from submitted sales orders in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] synchronize. To learn more, go to [Enable Sales Order Processing Integration](/dynamics365/sales-enterprise/developer/enable-sales-order-processing-integration).

<!--> [!VIDEO https://go.microsoft] -->

If someone changes the price of a product in [!INCLUDE [crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] and you include the item in sales orders in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates a new sales price list for each order. To learn more about price lists, go to [Handle sales prices](#handle-sales-prices).

Sales orders in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] synchronize when their status is **Submitted**. Sales orders from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] synchronize when their status is **Released**. The exception to this rule is when a prepayment is needed to complete a sales order in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. If an order is waiting prepayment, sales orders from [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] synchronize with a status of **Open** to let you complete the prepayment process. When you register the prepayment, the sales order's status changes to **Released** and synchronization continues.

## Handle sales quotes data

Sales quotes that are activated in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] are transferred to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] if you select the **Automatically Process Quotes** checkbox on the **Microsoft Dynamics 365 Connection Setup** page.

Alternatively, you can manually convert activated sales quotes from [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] by using the **Process in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]** action on the **Sales Quotes - Dynamics 365 Sales** page.
On such sales quotes, the **Name** field on the original quote is transferred and mapped to the **External Document Number** field on the sales order in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Also **Effective To** field on quote is transferred and mapped to the  **Quote Valid Until** field on sales quote in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

Sales quotes go through many revisions while they're being finalized. Both manual and automatic processing of sales quotes in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] ensures that previous versions of sales quotes are archived before processing new revisions of sales quotes from [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)].

When you choose **Process** in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] for a quote that is in state **Won**, a sales order is created in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] only if a corresponding sales order is submitted in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]. Otherwise, the quote is only released in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. If a corresponding sales order is submitted in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] later, and a sales order is created from it, the **Quote No.** is updated on the sales order and the quote is archived.

## Handle posted sales invoices, customer payments, and statistics

After you fulfill a sales order, invoices are created for it. When you invoice a sales order, you can transfer the posted sales invoice to [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] if you select the **Create Invoice in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]** checkbox on the **Posted Sales Invoice** page. Posted invoices transfer to [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] with the status, **Billed**.

When the customer payment is received for the sales invoice in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the sales invoice status changes to **Paid**. The **Status Reason** field is set to **Partial**, if partially paid, or **Complete** if fully paid, when you choose the **Update Account Statistics** action on the Customer Card page in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The **Update Account Statistics** action refreshes values, such as the **Balance** and **Total Sales** fields in the **[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Account Statistics** FactBox in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]. Alternatively, you can run the Customer Statistics and POSTEDSALESINV-INV scheduled jobs for both of these processes in the background.

## Handle sales prices

> [!NOTE]
> In 2020 release wave 2, we released streamlined processes for setting up and managing prices and discounts. If you're a new customer using that version, you're using the new experience. If you're an existing customer, whether you're using the new experience depends on whether your administrator enabled the **New sales pricing experience** feature update in **Feature Management**. To learn more, go to [Enabling Upcoming Features Ahead of Time](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/feature-management).

The steps to complete this process differ, depending on whether your administrator enabled the new pricing experience.

> [!NOTE]
> If the standard price synchronization doesn't work for you, we recommend using integration customization capabilities. To learn more, go to [Customizing an Integration with Microsoft Dataverse](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/administration-custom-cds-integration).

#### [Current Experience](#tab/current-experience/)
In the current pricing experience, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] synchronizes sales prices that: 

* Apply to all customers. Default sales price lists are created based on the price in the **Unit Price** field on the **Item Card** page for the items.
* Apply to a specific customer price group. For example, sales prices for your retail or wholesale customers. To synchronize prices based on a customer price group, follow these steps:

    1. Couple the items for which the customer price group sets prices.
    2. On the **Customer Price Groups** page, couple the customer price group by choosing **Related**, then **Dynamics 365 Sales**, **Coupling**, and then **Set up coupling**. The coupling creates an active price list in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with the same name as the customer price group in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]. It also automatically synchronizes all items for which the customer price group defines the price.

:::image type="content" source="media/customer-price-group.png" alt-text="Customer Price Group page.":::

#### [New Experience](#tab/new-experience/)  

The new pricing experience synchronizes price lists that meet the following criteria:

* **Allow Updating Defaults** is turned off.
* The price type is **Sale**.
* The amount type is **Price**.
* The product type on the lines must be **Item** or **Resource**. 
* A minimum quantity isn't specified.

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] synchronizes sales prices that apply to all customers. Default sales price lists are created based on the price in the **Unit Price** field on the **Item Card** page for the items.

To synchronize price lists, on the **Sales Price List** page, choose **Related**, **Dynamics 365 Sales**, **Coupling**, and then **Set up coupling**.

# Post service orders and credit memos

After you create a service order, when you're ready you can post it. The order must contain at least one service item line and one service line. If the order has more than one service line, all lines post at the same time.  

If you have a large number of service orders, you can save time by using a batch job to post them. You can run the batch job from any service order.

> [!Tip]
> Before you post a service document, it's a good idea to use the **Test Report** action to to check for errors or missing information. If there are errors, you must correct the problem. You can print a new test report to verify the fix, and then post the document.

## To post a service order

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the service order.  
3. On the **Service Order** page, choose one of the following actions.  

    |**Action**|**Result**|  
    |------------------|----------------|  
    |**Test Report** | Checks all parts of the document and presents the result in a report. If the report indicates any errors or a lack of information, you must correct the problem. You can then print a new test report.|  
    |**Post** | Posts the order without printing a shipment or an invoice.|  
    |**Post and Print** | Posts the order and prints a shipment (if you ship the order without invoicing it) or an invoice (if you invoice the order).|  
    |**Post Batch** | Posts multiple service orders at one time once.|  

4. For the **Post** action, there are several options that control what happens.  

    |**Posting Option**|**Result**|  
    |------------------------|----------------|  
    |**Ship** | Posts shipment of the items.|  
    |**Invoice** | Invoices items that have already been shipped.|  
    |**Ship and Invoice** | Invoices and ships the items.|  
    |**Ship and Consume** | Posts shipment and consumption on the order. It updates the relevant quantities on the service lines of the order and on the previously posted service shipment document.|  

You can post consumption only if the line contains a quantity that shipped but isn't invoiced or consumed.  

When you post the order, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates the corresponding ledger entries and posted documents and updates the service order.  

## To batch post service orders

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **Post Batch** action.  
3. You can set a filter to select specific service order numbers or an interval of order numbers for the batch job to process.  
4. Choose **OK** to start the batch job.  

## To post a service credit memo  

After you create a service credit memo, you can post it when you're ready. If there are errors or a lack of information on the credit memo while posting, an error message displays and stops the process.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Credit Memos**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Create a new service credit memo. Choose the **New** action.  
3. Fill in the necessary fields.  
4. Choose the **Post** action. If you want to print the credit memo at the same time as your post, choose the **Post and Print** action instead.  
5. To test credit memos before you post them, choose **Test Report**. When you run the report, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] verifies the posting dates in the document.  
6. To post several service credit memos at the same time, run the **Batch Post Service Cr. Memos** batch job. Using the batch job is helpful when you have to post a lot of credit memos.  

> [!NOTE]  
> It is important to enter all the necessary information on the credit memos before you batch post them. Otherwise, it is possible that they will not be posted. When the batch job finishes, a message shows how many of the service credit memos it posted.  

## To post consumption from a service order  

The following procedure describes how to post the items, resource hours, and costs used for a specific service operation for which you won't charge your customer. You can post consumed items, hours, or costs only for a posted shipment that has no posted invoices or consumption.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the service order to post consumption for.  
3. Choose the service item. Choose the **Service Lines** action.  
4. Find the required entries, and specify the quantities for which you'll post consumption in the **Qty. to Consume** field. The quantity can't be larger than the quantity already shipped and the quantity remaining but not invoiced after partial invoicing of this shipment.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > To register consumption for a project, fill in the **Project No.**, **Project Task No.**, and the **Project Line Type** fields on the service line.  

5. Choose the lines to post, and then choose the **Post** action. On the page that opens, select **Ship and Consume**.  

The service is posted as either partially or fully consumed, depending on the value in the **Qty. to Consume** field, and the relevant ledger entries are created. Also, previously posted service shipment documents are updated chronologically with the consumed quantities. The relevant quantities are updated on the service lines of the order.  

## To post shipments from service orders  

After you specify the details of a service, you can adjust and post the quantities of items used, time spent, and costs incurred. As a result, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] makes the necessary changes to reflect the new state of your inventory and current status of the specific order processing.  

The following procedure shows how to post shipment of service line items in locations that aren't set up to require warehouse handling.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Order**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the service order, and then choose the **Service Lines** action.  
3. On the **Service Lines** page, find the required entries and then specify the quantity to post in the **Qty. to Ship** field.  

   > [!NOTE]  
   > The quantity to ship value depends on whether you want to fully or partially post the shipment. If you choose to ship fully, the value in the **Qty. to Ship** field must be equal to the value in the **Quantity** field. When you post a partial shipment, you must specify the quantity you want to ship initially. If you already shipped part of the service on the order, make a note of the value in the **Quantity Shipped** field. The maximum quantity you can enter in the **Quantity to Ship** field is the number of units that haven't shipped.  

4. Choose the **Post** action, and then choose **Ship**.

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates ledger entries (in the warranty ledger, item ledger, service ledger, or G/L), produces the posted service shipment document, and updates the relevant fields on the service lines of the service order.  

If the location is set up to require warehouse handling, shipping and moving service line items works in the same way as they do for other source documents. The only difference is that service line items can be consumed either externally or internally, and therefore require two different release functions. To learn more about shipping service line items in advanced warehouse configurations, go to [Picking Items for Warehouse Shipments](warehouse-how-to-pick-items-for-warehouse-shipment.md).  

## Combine shipments from multiple service orders into a single service invoice

If needed, you can gather posted shipments that you haven't invoiced in a single invoice. For example, combining shipments can reduce the overall number of invoices to process, which can lower administrative costs and save time for your bookkeeping team. To learn more, go to [Combine shipments on a single invoice](sales-how-to-combine-shipments-on-a-single-invoice.md).

## To undo posted consumption  

You can cancel the consumption on the service orders. For example, because it was posted by mistake.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Posted Service Shipments**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the posted service shipment for which the erroneous consumption was posted.  
3. Choose the **Service Shipment Lines** action.  
4. Choose the lines that contain the incorrect consumption, and then choose the **Undo Consumption** action.  

 A balancing service shipment line is inserted with negative values in the quantity fields for the selected lines.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
> You can't undo service consumption if:  

> * The service order has been closed.  
> * It was posted to a project, so there are project ledger entries linked to it.  

## To post service lines  

If you have to work on a service order for a considerable time without posting it, you might want to post some of the service lines linked to it as a way, for example, of keeping your inventory updated. You can post by specifying the relevant quantities on the lines to be posted. You might choose to post the lines one by one or by selecting several lines at a time.  

The following procedure describes shipment posting directly from a service order in locations without warehouse handling set up. If the location is set up to require warehouse handling, then shipment posting happens in a different warehouse document, depending on the location setup.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the service order, and then choose the **Service Lines** action.  
3. On the lines you're going to post, fill in the **Qty. to Ship**, **Qty. to Invoice**, and **Qty. to Consume** fields, depending on how you post the lines.  
4. Choose the **Post** action.

# Set up reminder terms and levels

You can use reminders to inform customers about overdue amounts and to request payment. [!INCLUDE [reminder-terms](includes/reminder-terms.md)]

> [!TIP]
> After you set up reminder terms and levels, you can include them in automated processes for creating, issuing, and sending reminders. To learn more about the automated process, go to [Automate reminders in collections](finance-automate-reminders.md).

## Reminder terms

If customers have overdue payments, you must decide when and how to send a reminder. In addition, you might want to debit their accounts for interest or fees. You can set up any number of reminder terms.  

> [!NOTE]
> If you want to calculate interest on overdue payments, you can do so when you create reminders. If, however, you just want to calculate interest and inform your customers about this without sending a reminder, use a [finance charge memo](finance-setup-finance-charges.md). To learn more, go to [Reminders](receivables-collect-outstanding-balances.md#reminders) or [Finance Charges](receivables-collect-outstanding-balances.md#finance-charges).

### Set up attachment and email body texts for communications

On the **Reminder Terms Setup** page, you can set up attachment texts and standard email messages to use either for all reminder levels, or create specific messages for each level. For example, the message you send for the first reminder level might have a different tone or content than the second or third. To create attachment and email message texts for all levels, choose **Customer Communication** at the top of the page. To create messages for specific lines, on the **Reminder Level** FastTab, choose a line and then choose the **Customer Communication** action on the FastTab.

By default, attachment and email texts use your language setting. If you issue reminders to customers in other countries, however, you might want to communicate in different languages. You can create texts for each language that [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports by using the **Add text for language** action. If you do, ensure that the languages are the same for attachment texts and email texts. If they don't match, and the reminder term has more than one level, the automation might not be able to customize the message for one or more levels. To verify that the languages match, use the **Overview communications** action and compare the communications for the texts.

When you send an email, the reminder is a report you attach to the email. You define the report that generates the reminder on the **Report Selection Reminder/Finance Charge** page, where you also select the report that holds the email body text in the **Email Body Layout Name** field. When you send emails to your customers, the texts on the **Email Text** FastTab are inserted in the report selected in the **Email Body Layout Name** field. The standard report has a text field for this text. If you want, you can edit this report, for example, to add or remove content. Edit the layout of these reports on the **Report Layouts** page. To learn more about report layouts, go to [Get Started Creating Report Layouts](ui-get-started-layouts.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Communicating by email directly from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] requires that you're set up to do that. To learn more about connecting email accounts with [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], go to [Set up email](admin-how-setup-email.md).

### Set up reminder terms

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Reminder Terms**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  
3. To use more than one combination of reminder terms, set up a code for each one.

## Reminder levels

For each reminder term, you can define an unlimited number of reminder levels, though most companies use only two or three levels. The first time a reminder is created for a customer, the setting from level 1 is used. When the reminder is issued, the level number is registered on the reminder entries that are created and linked to the individual customer ledger entries. If it's necessary to remind the customer again, all reminder entries linked to open customer ledger entries are checked to locate the highest level number. The conditions from the next level number will then be used for the new reminder.

If you create more reminders than you define levels for, the conditions for the highest level are used. You can create as many reminders as are allowed by the **Max. No of Reminders** field in the reminder terms.

### To set up reminder levels

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Reminder Terms**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Reminder Terms** page, select the line with the terms you want to set up levels for, and then choose the **Levels** action.  
3. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  

    > [!TIP]
    > The setting of the **Calculate Interest** field determines if interest will appear on the reminder when the reminder is issued. However, the **Post Interest** field in the **Reminder Terms** page determines if the calculated interest must be posted to G/L and customer accounts.
    >
    > To indicate that interest should be calculated, choose the **Calculate Interest** field.

    Optionally, for each reminder level, specify extra fees in both local and foreign currencies. You can define many extra fees in foreign currencies for each code on the **Reminder Levels** page.  

    The extra fees can be calculated in three different ways that are defined by the value of the **Add. Fee Calculation Type** field.  

    - **Fixed**

        Fees are calculated based on the values of the **Additional Fee** fields on the line for the reminder level itself.  
    - **Single Dynamic**

        Fees are calculated based on the values of the fields on the relevant line in the **Additional Fee Setup** page for that reminder level.
    - **Accumulated Dynamic**

        Fees are calculated based on the values of the fields on the combined lines in the **Additional Fee Setup** page for that reminder level.

4. Choose the **Currencies** action.
5. On the **Currencies for Reminder Levels** page, define for each reminder level code and corresponding reminder level number a currency code and an extra fee.

    > [!NOTE]  
    > When you create reminders in a foreign currency, the foreign currency conditions that you set up here will be used to create reminders. If there are no foreign currency reminder conditions set up, the LCY reminder conditions that are set up on the **Reminder Levels** page will be used and then converted to the relevant currency.

    For each reminder level, you can specify text that will be printed before (**Beginning Text**) or after (**Ending Text**) on the entries on the reminder.

6. Choose the **Beginning Text** or **Ending Text** actions respectively, and fill in the **Reminder Text** page.
7. To automatically insert related values in the reminder text, you can enter the following placeholders in the **Text** field.  

    |Placeholder|Value|  
    |-----------------|-----------|  
    |%1|Content of the **Document Date** field on the reminder header|  
    |%2|Content of the **Due Date** field on the reminder header|  
    |%3|Content of the **Interest Rate** field on the related finance charge terms|  
    |%4|Content of the **Remaining Amount** field on the reminder header|  
    |%5|Content of the **Interest Amount** field on the reminder header|  
    |%6|Content of the **Additional Fee** field on the reminder header|  
    |%7|The total amount of the reminder|  
    |%8|Content of the **Reminder Level** field on the reminder header|  
    |%9|Content of the **Currency Code** field on the reminder header|  
    |%10|Content of the **Posting Date** field on the reminder header|  
    |%11|The company name|  
    |%12|Content of the **Add. Fee per Line** field on the reminder header|  

    For example, if you write **You owe %9 %7 due on %2.**, the reminder contains the following text: **You owe USD 1.200,50 due on 02-02-2024.**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates the due date according to the date formula that you enter. To learn more, go to [Use Date Formulas](ui-enter-date-ranges.md#use-date-formulas).

8. To specify the language for an email message, choose the **Add text for language** action. The **Language Code** field updates to show your selection. On the **Email Text** FastTab, enter the content of the message in the selected language.

After you set up the reminder terms, you can assign them to customers on Customer Card pages. To learn more, go to [Register New Customers](sales-how-register-new-customers.md).

# Plan for New Demand Order by Order

This planning task can be performed on the **Order Planning** page, which displays all new demand along with availability information and suggestions for supply. It provides the visibility and tools needed to effectively plan demand from sales lines and component lines and then create different types of supply orders directly.  

You can enter the **Order Planning** page in two ways depending on your focus: From an order that you want to plan for specifically or in batch mode because you want to plan for all and any new demand.  


## To plan for new production order demand

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Planned Production Orders**, and then choose the related link. (You can perform these steps for planned, firm planned, or released production orders).
2. Open the production order you want to plan for, and then choose the **Planning** action.  
3. On the **Order Planning** page, choose the **Calculate Plan** action.  

The page displays planning lines according to the view filter **Production Demand**, meaning unfulfilled component lines of all existing production orders. Demand for only the one production order is not shown because it is necessary to plan for one production order with an overview of demand for potentially earlier components lines. Planning lines for the production order in context are expanded.  

## To plan for any new demand

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Order Planning**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Order Planning** page, choose the **Calculate Plan** action.
3. Choose the **Expand (+)** button in front of the date in the **Demand Date** field to see the underlying planning lines that represent demand lines with insufficient availability.  
4. For each expanded planning line, that is, demand line, you can see values in information fields at the bottom of the page.  

    |Option|Description|  
    |----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Qty. on Other Locations**|Shows if the item exists on another location. You can then look up and select it.|  
    |**Substitutes Exist**|Shows if a substitute item is created for the item. You can then look up and select it. Note that this feature only applies to components, that is, from demand lines of type **Production**.|  
    |**Quantity Available**|Shows the total availability of the item, that is, the Projected Available Balance.|  
    |**Earliest Date Available**|Shows the arrival date of an inbound supply order that can cover the needed quantity on a date later than the demand date.|  

5. In the **Replenishment System** field, select which type of supply order to create.  

    The default value is that of the item card, or SKU card, but you can change it to one of three options:  

    |Option|Description|  
    |----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Purchase**|Creates a purchase order.|  
    |**Transfer**|Creates a transfer order.|  
    |**Prod. Order**|Creates a production order.|  

    In the **Supply From** field you must select a value according to the selected replenishment system.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  If the field is not filled in, the system will display an error message when you use the **Make Supply Order** function, and no supply order will be created for the planning line in question. This, however, is not the case if the replenishment system is **Prod. Order**.  

6. From the **Supply From** field, you can look up in the relevant list and select where the supply should come from:  

    - If replenishment system is **Purchase**, the look-up button in this field looks up on the **Item Vendor Catalog** page.  
    - If replenishment system is **Transfer**, the look-up button in this field looks up on the **Location List** page.  

    In case the item exists in another location, the **Qty. on Other Location** field at the bottom shows a value and you can then look up and select the location from which the item should be supplied when you make the transfer order.  

    If a substitute exists for the demanded item, the **Substitute Exists** field is set to **Yes**, and you can then look up to the **Item Substitution Entries** page and select the substitute.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > Be aware that item substitutions will not automatically cause an item to be replaced by another item, for example when creating a sales order or in a BOM. Instead, you will be alerted to the fact that a substitution is available to you.

7. Select the **Reserve** check box if you want to make a reservation between the supply order you are creating and the demand line that it is created for. It is empty by default.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  You can only select this check box if the item has **Optional** or **Always** in the **Reserve** field on its item card.  

8. In the **Qty. to Order** field, you can enter the quantity that will go on the supply order you are creating.   
    The default value is the same quantity as that in the **Needed Quantity** field. But you may decide to order more or less than this quantity based on your knowledge of the demand situation. If, for example, you see on the **Order Planning** page that several unrelated demand lines are for the same purchased item, and they are due around the same date, you can consolidate these by entering the total needed quantity in the **Qty. to Order** field of one line, and then delete the other, obsolete planning lines for that item.  

9. In the **Due Date** and **Order Date** fields, you can enter the dates that should apply to the created supply orders.  

    These two fields are interrelated according to the **Default Safety Lead Time** field, which can be found on the **Manufacturing Setup** page. By default, the due date is the same as the demand date, but you can change this as you like.  

> [!NOTE]  
> If you enter a date later than the demand date, you will receive a warning message.  

## To make supply orders

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Planned Production Orders**, and then choose the related link. You can perform these steps for a planned, firm planned, or released production order.  
2. Open the production order you want to plan for, and then choose the **Planning** action.  
3. Place the cursor on a relevant planning line, and then choose the **Make Orders** action.  
4. On the **Make Supply Orders** page, on the **Order Planning** FastTab, in the **Make Orders for** field, select one of the following options.  

    |Option|Description|  
    |----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**The Active Line**|Make a supply order only for the line where the cursor is placed.|  
    |**The Active Order**|Make supply orders for all lines in the order where the cursor is placed.|  
    |**All Lines**|Make supply orders for all lines on the **Order Planning** page.|  

5. On the **Options** FastTab, define what kind of supply orders, or requisition worksheet lines, should be made.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  The settings you last made on the **Make Supply Orders** page will be saved under your user ID so that they are the same the next time you use the page.  

6. Choose the **OK** button to make the suggested supply orders or requisition worksheet lines.  

You have now planned for the unfulfilled demand by making respective supply orders. Details about specific work flows when using the **Order Planning** page would depend on a company’s internal policies.  

When you have finished your planning work on the **Order Planning** page, for example defined an alternative way to supply the quantity, you can proceed to create supply orders for one or more of the planning lines.  

> [!NOTE]  
> The supply orders you create may introduce new dependent demand, for example for underlying production orders, and you should therefore choose **Calculate Plan** again to find and resolve this before moving down the list.

# The Service Declaration Extension

In some EU countries/regions, authorities require that businesses report the export of services to other EU countries/regions. The **Service Declaration** extension lets you collect information about service trade in the EU and report it to the authorities. Although its name is **Service Declaration**, you can also use it as **Intrastat for Services**. This extension is available for all EU countries/regions as a W1 version, and it can be used as-is in Belgium. For other countries/regions, an extension based on the country/region is required. If a country/region only needs a different format, you can use the report configuration in the **Data Exchange Framework** to change the format.

## Enable the Service Declaration extension

After you install the extension in your environment, you need to enable it.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Set up an IRS 1096 feature**, and then choose the related link.
2. Follow steps in the assisted setup guide. The most of fields are configured by default.
3. Add only **Service Transaction Types** in the second step by choosing the **Open the service transaction types page to specify the list of codes** option.
4. Before you start, check the **Total number of codes** to understand how many service transaction types are already specified.
5. Choose **Finish** in the last step to finish the configuration.

## Set up the Service Declaration extension

You can set up the extension manually, or by using a reporting file on the **Data Exchange Definitions** page.

### To set up Service Declaration manually

   2. Select the **Mapping Codeunit**.
8. On the **Field Mapping** FastTab, add the columns you previously configured in the **Column Definitions** FastTab, and then add the following:
   1. Specify the **Field ID** for each of the columns.
   2. Specify the **Transformation Rule** for each column as needed. The rule transforms imported text to a supported value before it can be mapped to a specified field in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. When you choose a value in this field, the exact value is entered in the **Transformation Rule** field in the **Data Exch. Field Mapping Buf.** table, and vice versa.
9. To group entries based on columns, choose the fields to use for grouping on the **Field Grouping** FastTab.

> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE[prod_long](includes/prod_long.md)] comes with a preconfigured data exchange definition for **Service Declaration** for all localized countries/regioins.

2. Select the item charge you want to configure.
3. In the **Service Transaction Type Code** field, specify the code for a **Service transaction type**.
4. If you don’t want to include this item charge in service declarations, select the **Exclude From Service Declaration** field.

## Create new service declaration

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Declarations**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action.
3. On the **General** FastTab, fill in the following fields:
    1. In the **Config. Code** field, specify the configuration code that is used to suggest lines and create files. You need to choose one as a **Service Declaration**.
    2. In the **Starting Date** and **Ending Date** fields, specify the start and end dates of the period to include in the service declaration.
4. Choose the **Suggest lines** action to start a batch job that collects lines from documents and fills in the service declaration lines.

The batch job retrieves all entries from applicable purchase and sales documents in the required period and adds them on the service declaration lines. Hover over fields in lines to read a short description.

## Modify a service declaration

If needed, you can modify the lines or add new ones.

1. On the **Service Declaration** page, choose the **New Line** action in the **Lines** FastTab.

4. Choose the **Create File** action.
5. The service declaration file is saved in the required format.

## Other considerations

When you're using the **Service Declaration** extension, there are a few more things to consider. For example, it's important that your groups match requirements from authorities. It's also important that services are included correctly on sales and purchase documents.

### Grouping lines

On service declaration lines, there's no grouping by any field. All entries are copied from the original document as a source.

Grouping required by authorities is provided in the exported file. You must configure the groups in the **Data Exchange Definition**, which is fully configurable. Learn more at [Set Up Data Exchange Definitions](across-how-to-set-up-data-exchange-definitions.md).

### Using services in document lines

When you create a purchase, sales, or service  invoice, there are two fields related to service declarations on their lines. Both fields are filled in with the default values from your item, resource, or item charge set ups.

- **Service Transaction Type Code** - Specifies the code for a service transaction type.
- **Applicable For Service Declaration** - Specifies whether an item or resource is applicable for a service declaration.

You can change the values in these fields, but if you select the **Applicable For Service Declaration** field, you must specify a value in the **Service Transaction Type Code** field. If you don't, you can't post the document.

If you specify a value in the **Service Transaction Type Code** field but don’t select the **Applicable For Service Declaration** field, you can post the document, but the line isn't calculated.

# Couple and synchronize records between Dataverse and Business Central

This article describes how to couple one or more records in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with records in Dataverse or [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]. Coupling records lets you view Dataverse information from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], and vice versa. The coupling also enables you to synchronize data between the records. You can couple existing records, or create and couple new records.

> [!NOTE]
> Coupling and synchronizing data is available only if your system administrator creates a connection between [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and Dataverse or [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]. A quick way to check is to open the **Customer** card and look for the **Set Up Coupling** action. If the action is available, the apps are connected.

<!--## Video Example

This video shows coupling and synchronizing data in the context of an integration with [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)].

> [!VIDEO https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2098376] -->

## To couple a record  

1. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], open the card for the record you want to couple. For example, the Customer Card or Contact Card pages.  

    You can also just open the list page and select the record that you want to couple.  

2. Choose the **Set Up Coupling** action.  
3. Fill in the fields, and then choose **OK**.  

## To synchronize a single record  

1. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], open the card for the record you want to couple. For example, the Customer Card or Contact Card pages.  
2. Choose the **Synchronize Now** action.  
3. If a record can synchronize in one direction, select the option that specifies the direction of data update, and then choose **OK**.  

## To synchronize a single record from [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]  

1. In [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)], open the form for the record you want to couple. For example, the Account or Contact pages.  
2. Choose the **[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]** action in the ribbon to open and couple records automatically.

    > [!Note]
    > You can synchronize a single record from [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] automatically only when **Sync. Only Coupled Records** is disabled and the synchronization direction is set to **Bidirectional** or **From Integration Table** on the **Integration Table Mapping** page for the record. To learn more, go to [Mapping the Tables and Fields to Synchronize](admin-how-to-modify-table-mappings-for-synchronization.md#create-new-records).

## To couple multiple records using match-based coupling

Specify the data to synchronize for an entity, such as a customer or contact, by coupling records based on matches. Refine the matches by making the search case sensitive, and assigning a priority for each match. If no match is found, you can also specify that you want to create the entity in Dataverse. To learn more, go to [Customize the match-based coupling](admin-how-to-set-up-a-dynamics-crm-connection.md#customize-the-match-based-coupling).  

> [!NOTE]
> The match-based coupling process skips records that are already matched. To include those records when you run match-based coupling, uncouple the records and then try again. To learn more about uncoupling records, go to [Uncoupling Records](#uncoupling-records).

1. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], open the list page for the record, such as the Customers or Contacts list pages.
2. Choose the **Match-Based Coupling** action.
3. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

## To synchronize multiple records  

1. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], open the list page for the record, such as the Customers or Contacts pages.  
2. Select the records that you want to synchronize, and then choose the **Synchronize Now** action.  
3. If records can synchronize in one direction, select the option that specifies the direction, and then choose **OK**.  

## Bulk-insert and couple records

If you have many Dataverse entities that correspond to records in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can insert and couple them in-bulk. For example, you might want to bulk-insert and couple records when you're setting up synchronization for the first time.

Use the **Data import wizard** in the **Microsoft Power Platform admin center**.

The following example describes how to bulk-insert and couple customers with accounts in Dataverse. Use the same process for other types of entities, such as vendors, items, and resources.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customers**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **Open in Excel** action to open customer data in Excel.
3. To map and import data to the **Account** entity in Dataverse, follow the steps described in [Import data (all record types) from multiple sources](/power-platform/admin/import-data-all-record-types).  

    If the Account entity has a **bcbi_companyid** column, when you map the data columns make sure that the import assigns the appropriate company ID in the column for every imported record. To find the company ID in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], follow these steps:

    1. Open the **Integration Table Mappings** page.
    2. Choose the **CUSTOMER** mapping, and then choose **Edit List**.
    3. Choose the assist edit :::image type="icon" source="media/assist-edit-icon.png" border="false"::: button in the **Integration Table Filter** field. This shows the default filter for customer mapping, and it contains the company ID. The company ID is the first part of the value. Copy only that part, and disregard the 0s. The following example highlights the part to copy.

    :::image type="content" source="media/dataverse-company-id-guid.png" alt-text="Shows the part of the company ID to copy.":::

    > [!NOTE]
    > Not all of the names of Dataverse entities and [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] records match. Depending on what you're importing, double-check that the following columns have the following values after you import:
    >
    >* For customers, the **CustomerTypeCode** column should contain **Customer**.
    >* For vendors, the **CustomerTypeCode** column should contain **Vendors**. 
    >* For items, **ProductTypeCode** column should contain **Sales Inventory**.
    >* For resources, the **ProductTypeCode** column should contain **Service**.
 
4. After you import data to the Dataverse environment, in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], follow the steps [To couple multiple records using match-based coupling](#to-couple-multiple-records-using-match-based-coupling) to couple the Dataverse entities with [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] records.

## Uncoupling Records

You can uncouple one or more records from list pages or the **Coupled Data Synchronization Errors** page by choosing one or more lines and choosing **Delete Coupling**. You can also remove all couplings for one or more table mappings on the **Integration Table Mappings** page.
