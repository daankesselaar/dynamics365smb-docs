# Inventory Overview (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Inventory Overview** report provides a high-level summary of your inventory. It shows key metrics, such as:

- Inventory (Quantity)
- Scheduled receipts
- Gross requirements
- Project available balance

The report can give you a high-level understanding of your inventory on a location by location basis, along with quantities across different types of documents.

# Use item charges to account for additional trade costs

To ensure correct valuation, your inventory items must carry any added costs, such as freight, physical handling, insurance, and transportation that you incur when purchasing or selling the items. For purchases, the landed cost of a purchased item consists of the vendor's purchase price and all other direct item charges that can be assigned to individual receipts or return shipments. For sales, knowing the cost of shipping sold items can be as vital to your company as knowing the landed cost of purchased items.

In addition to recording the added cost in your inventory value, you can use item charges for the following tasks:

* Identify the landed cost of an item for making more accurate decisions on how to optimize the distribution network.
* Break down the unit cost or unit price of an item for analysis purposes.
* Include purchase allowances into the unit cost and sales allowances into the unit price.

Before you can assign item charges, you must set up item charge numbers for the different types of item charges. The numbers include to which G/L accounts to post costs related to sales, purchases, and inventory adjustments. An item charge number contains a combination of general product posting group, tax group code, VAT product posting group, and item charge. When you enter the item charge number on a purchase or sales document, the G/L account is retrieved. The account retrieved is selected based on the setup of the item charge number and the information on the document.

For both purchase and sales documents, you can assign an item charge in two ways:

* On the document that lists the items that the item charge relates to. Typically, you do this for documents that aren't yet fully posted.
* On a separate invoice by linking the item charge to a posted receipt or shipment where the items that the item charge relates to are listed.

> [!NOTE]  
> You can assign item charges to orders, invoices, and credit memos, for both sales and purchases. The following procedures describe how to work with item charges for a purchase invoice. The steps are similar for all other purchase and sales documents.

## Example

This video shows how to handle an extra shipping cost as part of inventory costing.

> [!Video https://learn-video.azurefd.net/vod/player?id=35aa5336-39c8-46a2-b8eb-9ac925a17802]

## To set up item charge numbers

You use item charge numbers to distinguish between the different kinds of item charges.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Item Charges**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Item Charges** page, choose the **New** action to create a new line.
3. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

## To assign an item charge directly to the purchase invoice for the item

If you know the item charge when you post a purchase invoice for the item, follow this procedure.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Invoices**, and then choose the related link.
2. Create a new purchase invoice. For more information, see [Record Purchases](purchasing-how-record-purchases.md).
3. Make sure the purchase invoice has one or more lines of type Item.
4. On a new line, in the **Type** field, select **Charge (Item)**.
5. In the **Quantity** field, enter the units of the item charge that you're invoiced for.
6. In the **Direct Unit Cost** field, enter the amount of the item charge.
7. Fill in the remaining fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

    Do the following steps to perform the actual assignment. Until the item charge is fully assigned, the value in the **Qty. to Assign** field is in red font.
8. On the **Lines** tab, choose the **Item Charge Assignment** action.

    The **Item Charge Assignment** page opens showing one line for each line of type Item on the purchase invoice. To assign the item charge to one or more invoice lines, you can use a function that assigns and distributes it for you or you can manually fill in the **Qty. to Assign** field. The following steps describe how to use the Suggest Item Charge Assignment function.

9. On the **Item Charge Assignment** page, choose the **Suggest Item Charge Assignment** action.
10. If there are more than one invoice lines of type Item, choose one of the four distribution options.  

If the item charge is fully assigned, the value in the **Qty. to Assign** field on the purchase invoice is zero.

The item charge is now assigned to the purchase invoice. When you post the receipt of the purchase invoice, the items' inventory values are updated with the cost of the item charge.  

## To assign an item charge from a separate invoice to the purchase invoice for the item

If you received an invoice for the item charge after you posted the original purchase receipt, follow this procedure.

1. Repeat steps 1 through 8 in [To assign an item charge directly to the purchase invoice for the item](payables-how-assign-item-charges.md#to-assign-an-item-charge-directly-to-the-purchase-invoice-for-the-item).
2. On the **Item Charge Assignment** page, choose the **Get Receipt Lines** action.
3. On the **Purch. Receipt Lines** page, select the posted purchase receipt for the item that you want to assign the item charge to, and then choose the **OK** button.
4. Choose the **Suggest Item Charge Assignment** action.

The item charge on the separate purchase invoice is now assigned to the item on the posted purchase receipt, thereby updating the item's inventory value with the cost of the item charge.

## Handle item charges for partial receipts

Let's explore an example of how to handle item charges for a partial receipt.

You have a purchase order with three lines:

* Two lines are for items.
* One line captures item charges allocated across the items by amount.

When the items are delivered, you find that one of the items is missing, so you can't mark that line as received. You can receive and post the purchase invoice for the second item only, and deal with the missing item later.

To handle the item cost for the partial receipt, on the **Item Charge Assignment** page, enter **0** in the **Quantity to Handle** field on the line for the missing item. Then, copy the value from the **Item Charge Qty. to Handle** field to the **Quantity to Invoice** field on the purchase order lines.

When you're ready to handle the item that was missing, update the **Quantity to Handle** field and post the order.

# (Obsolete) Set the Layout Used by a Report

[!INCLUDE[legacy-custom-layouts](includes/legacy-custom-layouts.md)]

A report can be set up with more than one report layout, which you can then switch among as needed.

Depending on the layouts that are available for a report, you can choose to use a built-in RDLC report layout, a built-in Word report layout, or a custom layout. For more information about RDLC and Word report layouts, built-in and custom layouts, and more, see [Manage Report Layouts](ui-manage-report-layouts.md).

When custom report layouts are defined, you can select them from customer and vendor cards to specify that the selected layouts will be used for documents that you crate for the customer or vendor in question. For more information, see [Define Document Layouts for Customers and Vendors](ui-define-customer-vendor-document-layouts.md).

> [!TIP]  
> Document reports (not lists) that use a Word report layout are typically faster than those that use an RDLC report layout. So if you have the option to choose between a Word or RDLC report layout for a document report, use the Word report layout for the best performance.

## To change which report layout to use for a report or document

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Report Layout Selection**, and then choose the related link.
  
   The **Report Layout Selection** page lists all the reports that are available for the company that's specified in the **Company** field at the top of the page. The **Layout Description** <!-- **Selected Layout** -->field specifies the layout that's currently used on the report.
2. Set the **Company** field at the top the company that includes the report.

   This field let's you set a different layouts for same report report in different companies.

3. To change the layout that is used by a report, on the row for the report, set the **Selected Layout** field to one of the following options:
   * **RDLC (built-in)**, uses the built-in RDLC report layout on the report.
   * **Word (built-in)**, uses the built-in Word report layout on the report.
   * **Custom**, uses a custom layout on the report.  

> [!NOTE]
> If you choose a report layout of type **RDLC (built-in)** or **Word (built-in)** and you get an error message that the report does not have a layout of the specified type, then you must choose another layout option or create a custom report layout of the type that you want to use. See the next procedure.

If you selected a built-in RDLC or Word report layout, then no further action is required, and the layout will be used the next time the report is run.

## To change the custom layout to use for a report layout

You may also want to change the currently used custom layout. For more information, see [Create and Modify Custom Report Layouts](ui-how-create-custom-report-layout.md).

All custom report layouts that exist for report layouts in a company are listed on the **Custom Report Layouts** page. On the **Report Layout Selection** page, you can see which custom layouts are available for each report in the **Custom Layouts** FactBox.

1. On the **Report Layout Selection** page, on the line for the report layout that you want to change, choose the lookup button in the **Custom Layout Description** field.
2. On the **Custom Report Layouts** page, select the row for the custom layout that you want to use, and then choose the **OK** button.

The name of the selected custom layout is now shown in the **Custom Layout Description** field and will be used the next time the report or document is previewed, printed, or sent.

You can now go to your customer and vendor cards to specify which of the layouts to use for different documents that you crate for the customer or vendor in question, such as order confirmations or payment reminders. For more information, see [Define Document Layouts for Customers and Vendors](ui-define-customer-vendor-document-layouts.md).

# Create a demand forecast

You can create sales and production forecasts with the **Demand Forecasts** list page. Then, for each forecast, you specify various settings for that forecast in the **Demand Forecast Overview** page.  

Forecasting functionality is used to create anticipated demand; actual demand is created from sales and production orders. During creation of the Master Production Schedule (MPS), the forecast is netted against the sales and production orders. The **Forecast Type** field on the forecast determines which type of requirements to take into consideration in the netting process. If the forecast is for a *sales item*, only sales orders net the forecast. If it is for *components*, only dependent demand from production order components net the forecast.  

Forecasting allows your company to create "what if" scenarios and efficiently and cost-effectively plan for and meet demand. Accurate forecasting can make a critical difference in customer satisfaction levels with regard to order promising dates and on-time delivery.  

You can also define the right level of details in the **Forecast by Location** and **Forecast by Variant** fields in the **Demand Forecast Overview** page. Filters and other settings are stored in the **Demand Forecast Name** table, so you can easily stop and continue your work later. 

## Sales forecasts and production forecasts

The forecasting functionality in application can be used to create sales or production forecasts, in combination or independently. For example, most make-to-order companies do not carry finished goods inventory, because each item is produced when it is ordered. Anticipating orders (sales forecasting) is critical for a reasonable turnaround time on the finished goods (production forecasting). As an example, component parts with lengthy delivery times, if not on order or on inventory, can delay production.  

- The sales forecast is the sales department's best guess at what will be sold in the future, and is specified by item and by period. However, the sales forecast is not always adequate for production.  
- The production forecast is the production planner's projection of how many end items and derived subassemblies to produce in specific periods to meet the forecasted sales.  

In most cases, then, the production planner modifies the sales forecast to fit the conditions of production, yet still satisfies the sales forecast.  

You create forecasts manually on the **Demand Forecast** page. Multiple forecasts can exist in the system, and are differentiated by name and type. Forecasts can be copied and edited as necessary. 

> [!NOTE]
> Only one forecast is valid for planning purposes at any time.

The forecast consists of a number of records each stating item number, forecast date, and forecasted quantity. The forecast of an item covers a period, which is defined by the forecast date and the forecast date of the next (later) forecast record. From a planning point of view, the forecasted quantity should be available at the start of the demand period.  

You must designate a forecast as *Sales Item*, *Component*, or *Both*. The forecast type *Sales Item* is used for sales forecasting. The production forecast is created using the *Component* type. The forecast type *Both* is only used to give the planner an overview of both the sales forecast and the production forecast. With this option, the forecast entries are not editable. By designating these forecast types here, you can use the same worksheet to enter a sales forecast as you do a production forecast, and use the same sheet to view both forecasts simultaneously. Note that the system treats the different inputs (sales and production) differently when calculating planning, based on item, manufacturing, and production setup.  

## Component forecast

The component forecast can be seen as an option forecast in relation to a parent item. This can, for example, be useful if the planner can estimate the demand for the component.  

Because the component forecast is designed to define options for a parent item, the component forecast should be less than or equal to the sales item forecast quantity. If the component forecast is higher than the sales item forecast, the system treats the difference between these two types of forecasts as independent demand.  

## Forecasting periods

The forecast period is valid from its starting date until the date the next forecast starts. The time interval page gives you multiple choices to insert the demand at a specific date in a period. It is therefore recommended not to change the forecast period scope unless you want to move all forecast entries to the starting date of this period.  

## Forecast by locations

On the **Manufacturing Setup** page you can specify whether you want to consider the locations that are defined on forecasts when you calculate plans. 

### Use forecast by locations

If you turn on the **Use Forecast by Location** toggle, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] respects any location codes that are specified for each demand forecast entry and calculate the remaining forecast for each location.  

Consider this example: Your company purchases and sells items on two locations: EAST and WEST. For both locations, you have configured a lot-to-lot reordering policy. You create a forecast for the two locations:

- 10 pieces for location EAST
- 4 pieces for location WEST

Then, you create a sales order with a quantity of 12 on location WEST. The planning system will suggest that you do the following:

- Replenish 10 pieces for location EAST, based on data from the forecast.  
- Replenish 12 pieces for location WEST, based on the sales order. The four pieces that were specified in the forecast are fully consumed by the actual demand of the sales order. For more information, see [Forecast Demand is Reduced by Sales Orders](design-details-balancing-demand-and-supply.md#forecast-demand-is-reduced-by-sales-orders).  

> [!NOTE]  
> If location-based forecasts are viewed in isolation, the overall forecast might not be representative.

### If you don't use forecast by locations

If you turn off the **Use Forecast by Location** toggle, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] ignores the location codes that are specified for each demand forecast entry and aggregate the forecasts into a forecast for empty locations.  

Consider this example: Your company purchases and sells items on two locations: EAST and WEST. For both locations, you configured a lot-to-lot reordering policy. You create a forecast for the two locations:

- 10 pieces for location EAST
- 4 pieces for location WEST

Then, you create a sales order with a quantity of 12 on location WEST. The planning system suggests that you do the following:

- Replenish 12 pieces for location WEST, based on the sales order.  
- Replenish 2 pieces for the empty location. The 10 and 4 pieces that were specified in the forecast are partially consumed by the actual demand of the sales order. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] ignored the location codes that were specified by the user and uses a blank location instead.  

> [!NOTE]  
> You can set a filter by locations, but location-based results might not match planning results without filters.

## To create a demand forecast

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Demand Forecast**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **General** FastTab, select a forecast in the **Demand Forecast Name** field. Multiple forecasts can exist and are differentiated by name and forecast type.  
3. In the **Location Filter** field, select the location to which this forecast will apply.
4. In the **View by** field to change the period that is displayed in each column. You can select from the following intervals: **Day**, **Week**, **Month**, **Quarter**, **Year**, or the **Accounting Period** as set up in your finance area.

> [!NOTE]  
> You should consider which time interval that you want to use for future forecasts so that the time interval is consistent throughout. When you enter a forecast quantity, it is valid on the first day of the time interval that you select. For example, if you select a month, enter the forecast quantity on the first day of the month. If you select a quarter, enter the forecast quantity on the first day of the first month in the quarter.

5. In the **View as** field, select how the forecast quantities are shown for the time interval. If you select **Net Change**, then the net change in balance is displayed for the time interval. If you select **Balance at Date**, then the page displays the balance as of the last day in the time interval.  
6. In the **Forecast Type** field, select **Sales Item**,  **Component**, or **Both**. If you select **Sales Item** or **Component**, then you can edit the quantity by period. If you select **Both**, then you cannot edit the quantity, but you can choose the drop-down arrow button and view the demand forecast entries.  
7. Specify a **Date Filter** if you want to limit the amount of data displayed.  
8. On the **Demand Forecast Matrix** FastTab, enter the forecasted quantities by typing a quantity in the cell representing an item on a particular date or period. Note that in empty cells, the lookup button opens an empty page indicating that you must enter a value manually.   

> [!NOTE]  
> You can also edit an existing forecast. On the **Demand Forecast Matrix** page, choose the **Copy Demand Forecast** action and populate the **Demand Forecast** page with an existing forecast. You can then edit quantities as appropriate.

# Develop Business Central report layouts and datasets

Reports in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] have a report object that defines their dataset and layouts. The dataset provides the data in the report, and the layouts control how the data is presented.  

## Developing report layouts

Want to modify the layout of a report? For Excel and Word layouts, you can do that yourself. If you want pixel-perfect RDLC layouts though, you might need help from a developer. 

The following table provides links to articles that describe options for customizing reports.

# Design details: table structure

To understand how dimension entries are stored and posted, it's important to understand the table structure.  

## Table 480, Dimension Set Entry  

You can't change this table. After data is written to the table, you can't delete or edit it.

|Field No.|Field Name|Data Type|Comment|  
|---------------|----------------|---------------|-------------|  
|1|**ID**|Integer|>0.0 is reserved for the empty dimension set. References field 3 in table 481.|  
|2|**Dimension Code**|Code 20|Table relation to table 348.|  
|3|**Dimension Value Code**|Code 20|Table relation to table 349.|  
|4|**Dimension Value ID**|Integer|References field 12 in table 349. It's the secondary key that is used when traversing table 481.|  
|5|**Dimension Name**|Text 30|CalcField. Lookup to table 348.|  
|6|**Dimension Value Name**|Text 30|CalcField. Lookup to table 349.|  

## Table 481, Dimension Set Tree Node  
You can't change this table. It's used to search for a dimension set. If the dimension set isn't found, a new set is created.  

|Field No.|Field Name|Data Type|Comment|  
|---------------|----------------|---------------|-------------|  
|1|**Parent Dimension Set ID**|Integer|0 for top level node.|  
|2|**Dimension Value ID**|Integer|Table relation to field 12 in table 349.|  
|3|**Dimension Set ID**|Integer|AutoIncrement. Used in field 1 in table 480.|  
|4|**In Use**|Boolean|False if not in use.|  

## Table 482 Reclas. Dimension Set Buffer  
This table is used when you change a dimension value code, for example, on an item ledger entry by using the **Item Reclassification Journal** page.  

|Field No.|Field Name|Data Type|Comment|  
|---------------|----------------|---------------|-------------|  
|1|**Dimension Code**|Code 20|Table relation to table 348.|  
|2|**Dimension Value Code**|Code 20|Table relation to table 349.|  
|3|**Dimension Value ID**|Integer|References field 12 in table 349.|  
|4|**New Dimension Value Code**|Code 20|Table relation to table 349.|  
|5|**New Dimension Value ID**|Integer|References field 12 in table 349.|  
|6|**Dimension Name**|Text 30|CalcField. Lookup to table 348.|  
|7|**Dimension Value Name**|Text 30|CalcField. Lookup to table 349.|  
|8|**New Dimension Value Name**|Text 30|CalcField. Lookup to table 349.|  

## Transaction and Budget Tables  
In addition to other dimension fields in the table, this field is important:  

|Field No.|Field Name|Data Type|Comment|  
|---------------|----------------|---------------|-------------|  
|480|**Dimension Set ID**|Integer|References field 1 in table 480.|  

### Table 83, Item Journal Line  
In addition to other dimension fields in the table, these fields are important.  

|Field No.|Field Name|Data Type|Comment|  
|---------------|----------------|---------------|-------------|  
|480|**Dimension Set ID**|Integer|References field 1 in table 480.|  
|481|**New Dimension Set ID**|Integer|References field 1 in table 480.|  

### Table 349, Dimension Value  
In addition to other dimension fields in the table, these fields are important.  

|Field No.|Field Name|Data Type|Comment|  
|---------------|----------------|---------------|-------------|  
|12|**Dimension Value ID**|Integer|AutoIncrement. Used for references in table 480 and table 481.|  

### Tables That Contain the Dimension Set ID Field
 The **Dimension Set ID** field (480) exists in the following tables. For the tables that store posted data, the field only provides a noneditable display of dimensions, which is marked as Drill-down. For the tables that store working documents, the field is editable. The buffer tables that are used internally don't need editable or noneditable capabilities.  

 Field 480 is noneditable in the following tables.

# Set Up Universal Print Printers

[!INCLUDE[azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id](~/../shared-content/shared/azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id.md)]

Universal Print is a Microsoft 365 subscription-based service that runs entirely on Microsoft Azure. It gives you centralized printer management through the Universal Print portal. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] makes printers set up in Universal Print available to client users through the **Universal Print Integration** extension.

![Universal Print setup.](media/Universal-Print-arch.png)

The complete setup requires you work in both Microsoft Azure, using the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), and in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The setup is divided between two main tasks as described in this article:

1. In Microsoft Azure, set up Universal Print and add the printers you want to use in Business Central to a print share. Go to [this section](#set-up-universal-print-and-printers-in-microsoft-azure).
2. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], add the printers from the print shares in Universal Print. Go to [this section](#add-printers-in-business-central-online) for online or [here](#add-printers-in-business-central-on-premises) for on-premises.

## Prerequisites

- Supported printers

  [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports the same printers as Universal Print, which can be either Universal Print–compatible or non-compatible printers. Non-compatible printers can't communicate with Universal Print directly, so they require extra connector software, which is provided by Universal Print. Some older printers may not be supported. 

- Universal Print:

  - A Universal Print subscription/license for your organization.

    Learn more at [License Universal Print](/universal-print/fundamentals/universal-print-license).

  - You have at least the [Printer Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#printer-administrator) role in Microsoft Entra ID.

    To manage Universal Print, your account must have at least the [Printer Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#printer-administrator) role in Microsoft Entra ID. These roles are only needed for managing Universal Print. They aren't required by people setting up and  the printers from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

- [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online and on-premises:

  - [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] 2021 release wave 1 or later.
  - **Universal Print Integration** extension is installed.

    This extension is published and installed by default as part of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online and on-premises. You can verify whether it's installed on the **Extension Management** page. Learn more at [Installing and Uninstalling Extensions in Business Central](ui-extensions-install-uninstall.md).
- [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises only:
  - Microsoft Entra ID or NavUserPassword authentication is configured.
    > [!NOTE]
    >  Universal Print extension doesn't support service-to-service (S2S) authentication. It requires a signed-in user to send print jobs to the Universal Print service through Graph API.
  - An application for Business Central is registered in your Microsoft Entra tenant and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

    Like other Azure services that work with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], Universal Print requires an app registration for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in Microsoft Entra ID. The app registration provides authentication and authorization services between [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and Universal Print.

    Your deployment may already use an app registration for other Azure services, like Power BI. If so, then use the existing app registration for Universal Print as well, instead of adding a new one. The only thing you'll need to do, in this case, is modify the app registration to include the relevant print permissions for Microsoft Graph API: **PrinterShare.ReadBasic.All**, **PrintJob.Create**, and **PrintJob.ReadBasic.** 

    To register an app and set the proper permissions, follow the steps described in [Register an application in Microsoft Entra ID](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/register-app-azure#register-an-application-in-azure-active-directory).

## Set up Universal Print and printers in Microsoft Azure

Before you can start managing Universal Print printers in Business Central, there are several tasks to get Universal Print up and running in Azure with the printers you want to use.

For detailed instructions on how to get set up, see [Get started: Set up Universal Print](/universal-print/fundamentals/universal-print-getting-started) in the Universal Print documentation. Here's an overview of the steps you'll need to complete. Most of these steps are done in the Azure portal.

1. Assign Universal Print licenses to yourself and other users.

    How you assign the license depends on whether you're integrating with Business Central online or on-premises.

    - With [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, you assign licenses using the Microsoft 365 admin center.

      Learn more at [Microsoft Admin Center Help - Assign licenses to users](/microsoft-365/admin/manage/assign-licenses-to-users).

    - With [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, you assign licenses in your tenant using the Azure portal.

      Learn more at [Assign or remove licenses in the Azure portal](/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/license-users-groups).

2. Install the Universal Print connector for registering printers that can't communicate with Universal Print directly.

    Most in-market printers can't communicate with Universal Print directly, so you'll need to install the Universal Print connector. Learn more at [Installing the Universal Print Connector](/universal-print/fundamentals/universal-print-connector-installation).

3. Register your printers in Universal Print.

    Registering a printer makes Universal Printer aware of the printer.

    - For printers that can communicate directly with Universal Print, follow the steps provided by the printer manufacturer.

    - For other printers, register the printers by using the Universal Print connector. 

      Learn more at [Printer registration](/universal-print/fundamentals/universal-print-connector-printer-registration).

4. Change printer properties (optional)

    After a printer is registered, you can view and modify printer properties, such as default preferences.

    Learn more at [Managing Printer Settings using the Universal Print Portal](/universal-print/reference/portal/printer-settings).

5. Share the printers with users.

    Any printer you want to use in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will need to be added to a *printer share* in Universal Print. Any user who needs access to the printer must be added as a member of the printer share. Learn more at [Share a Printer](/universal-print/reference/portal/share-printers).

    > [!TIP]
    > You can always add or remover users later. Learn more at [Configure user permssions for printer share](/universal-print/reference/portal/share-printers#configure-user-permissions-for-a-printer-share).

6. Enable document conversion.

    Universal Print renders content for print in XPS format. Some legacy in-market printers don't support XPS content rendering&mdashin many cases, only PDF format. Printing to these printers will fail unless Universal Print is set up to convert documents to the printer-supported format.

    Learn more at [Document conversion](/universal-print/reference/portal/settings#2-document-conversion).

Now, you're ready to add the printers to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], set up default printers for reports, and print.  

## Add printers in Business Central online

After printers are set up and shared in Universal Print, you're ready to add them to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] for use. There are two ways to add Universal Print printers. You can add the printers all at once or individually, one at a time.

Adding printers individually let's you set up the same Universal Print printer in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] more than once. Then, for each added printer, you can change the print settings, like paper tray, size, and orientation. This way, you can set up printers for different reports and documents with special output requirements.

> [!NOTE]
> Are you using [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises? If so, go to the [next section](#add-printers-in-business-central-on-premises), the first time setup is slightly different.  
<!-- To Do Adding printers individually lets you duplicate printers with custom , like different paper trays and paper size and orientation.  To add printers individually, you'll need to know printer's share name in Universal Print. -->

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Printer Management**, then select the related link.
2. Select **Universal Print**, then choose one of the following options:

   - **Add all Universal Print printers** to add all printers not already added. You can use this option even if there are already printers added.
   - **Add a Universal Print printer** to add a specific printer.  
3. Follow the on-screen instructions.

    - If you chose **Add all Universal Print printers**, then the **Add Universal Print Printers** setup starts. 

    - If you chose to **Add a Universal Print printer**, then the **Universal Printer Settings** page appears. Fill in the **Name** field, then select **...** next to the **Print Share in Universal Print** field to select the printer share that contains the Universal Print printer. Fill in the remaining fields as needed. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)].

After a printer has been added, you can view and change its settings from the **Printer Management** page. Just select the printer, then choose **Edit printer settings**.

## Add printers in Business Central on-premises

<!--With [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, unlike online, users aren't automatically authenticated with the registered app in Azure used for the Universal Print service. So, before any Business Central user (including admins) can add or even use Universal Print printers, they'll have to authenticate with the Azure app and grant access to the Universal Print service. The following procedure describes how to initiate this authentication flow. Each user typically only has to do this task once.-->

Before a user can add or use Universal Print printers Business Central, they have to authorize access to the Azure services used by Universal Print and grant it to permission to data and operations like:

- Signing in and reading user profile
- Reading basic print job information
- Creating print jobs

This is typically done the first time they connect to the Azure registered app used for Universal Print. In Business Central online does, this authorization flow is done seamlessly, with no user interaction. But Business Central on-premises operates differently. It requires that you, or any other user who wants to use Universal Print printers, initiate the authentication flow&mdash;usually, one time only. The most direct way is described in the following steps. A less direct way is by connecting to another integrated service that uses the same Azure registered app, like Power BI or OneDrive. Each user typically only has to do this task once.

> [!NOTE]
> If you're an admin, we recommend you complete this task before other users. Then afterwards, inform users who will need to use Universal Print printers how to do it. If the Azure registered app for Universal Print requires admin consent for API permissions, it's easier if you grant consent on behalf of the organization. You can grant admin consent from the Azure Portal or when you run the steps that follow. 

<!-- To Do Adding printers individually lets you duplicate printers with custom , like different paper trays and paper size and orientation.  To add printers individually, you'll need to know printer's share name in Universal Print. -->
### Connect to Universal Print for the first-time

Complete these steps to connect to the Universal Print service for the first-time.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Printer Management**, then select the related link.
2. Select **Universal Print** > **Add all Universal Print printers** to start the **Add Universal Print Printers** assisted setup guide (wizard).
3. Follow the on-screen instructions until you get to the **MICROSOFT ENTRA SERVICE PERMISSIONS** page.

    <!--The MICROSOFT ENTRA SERVICE PERMISSIONS page appears. You'll be prompted to give consent to Azure Services. You'll be lead through the process of verifying your Microsoft Entra ID setup, checking your Universal Print license, and then adding the printers.-->

   ![Shows the MICROSOFT ENTRA SERVICE PERMISSIONS page](media/azure-ad-services-permissions.png "Shows the MICROSOFT ENTRA SERVICE PERMISSIONS page")

4. Select the **Authorize Azure Services** link.

   1. If the **Permission Requested** page appears, read it carefully and select **Accept** to agree and continue. If you're running as an admin, you can select **Consent on behalf of organization** if you want to consent for all users.

      ![Shows the Azure request permissions page](media/azure-ad-permissions-requested.png "Azure request permissions page").

   2. If you're prompted, sign in using your name and password.

5. When authorization completes successfully, you're returned to the **Add Universal Print Printers** page. Select **Next** > **Finish** to complete the setup.

After a printer has been added, you can view and change its settings from the **Printer Management** page. Just select the printer, then choose **Edit printer settings**.

Once you complete the initial sign-in, you can use the Universal Print printers to print reports and other print jobs. For more information, go to [Printing a Report](ui-work-report.md#PrintReport). If you want to add, remove, or change any printers, just go back to the **Print Management** page and select **Universal Print**.

## Common problems and resolutions

In this section, you'll learn about the common problems that users may experience when trying to set up or use Universal Print printers.

### You don't have access to the printer \<your-printer\>.

If a user gets this message when trying to print a document to a Universal Print printer, it may be caused by one of the following conditions:

- The user doesn't have Universal Print licensed assigned to their Microsoft 365 or Azure Active AD account. 
- The user isn't assigned to the printer share in Universal Print.
- (On-premises) The Azure app registration used for Universal Print isn't working or has recently changed since the last time the user signed in.
- (On-premises) The user hasn't yet signed in to Azure registered app for Universal Printer app and consented for the first time.

## There was an error fetching printers shared to you.

If a user gets this message when trying to add a Universal Print printer from the **Printer Management** page, it's typically because they haven't yet signed in to Azure registered app for Universal Printer app and consented for the first time. 
<!--
### Troubleshooting

# Integrate with Microsoft Dataverse via data sync

Business apps often use data from more than one source. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] combines data into a single set of logic that makes it easier to connect [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to other Dynamics 365 applications. For example, [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] or your own application built on [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)]. To learn more about [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)], go to [What is Dataverse?](/powerapps/maker/common-data-service/data-platform-intro).

The following steps provide an overview of the steps to integrate [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

> [!Note]  
> These tasks require the **System Administrator** security role in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

1. Assign licenses for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] to the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] users who will use the integrated apps.

2. Set up a connection to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)]. For more information, see [Connect to Dataverse](admin-how-to-set-up-a-dynamics-crm-connection.md).  

3. Synchronize data between the apps. For more information, see [Synchronizing Business Central and Dataverse](admin-synchronizing-business-central-and-sales.md). 

## Get started with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)]

To get started with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)], you'll need a Microsoft Power Apps account. If you don't already have a Power Apps account, you can get one for free by visiting [powerapps.com](https://make.powerapps.com/?utm_source=padocs&utm_medium=linkinadoc&utm_campaign=referralsfromdoc) and choosing the **Get started free** link. To learn more about how to get started with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)], go to the [Get started with Dataverse](/training/modules/get-started-with-powerapps-common-data-service/) module from Microsoft training.

## Bi-directional or uni-directional data synchronization

You can synchronize data either to or from one Dynamics 365 business app to another, or in both directions in near-real time, through [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)]. For example, if you integrate [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)], a salesperson can create a sales order in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] and the order synchronizes to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Conversely, from [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)], the salesperson can check the availability of the item on the order in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. 

## Standard and custom entities

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] securely stores data in a set of tables, which are sets of records similar to how a table stores data within a database. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] includes a base set of standard tables that cover typical scenarios, but you can also create custom tables specific to your organization. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can view standard and custom tables being synchronized on the Integration Table Mappings page.

## About the Business Central Base Integration Solution

The Base Integration Solution is a key component of the integration. The solution adds the required roles and access levels to the user accounts for the integration, and it creates tables needed to map [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] company to business unit in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)]. 

By default, the **Set up [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] connection** assisted setup guide imports the solution. To do that, the setup guide uses an administrator user account that you specify. This account must be a valid user in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] with the **System Administrator** security role.  

To learn more about user accounts, go to the following articles:

* [Setting Up User Accounts for Integrating with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)]](admin-setting-up-integration-with-dynamics-sales.md) 
* [Create users in Microsoft Dynamics 365 (online) and assign security roles](/dynamics365/customer-engagement/admin/create-users-assign-online-security-roles). 

The administrator account is used only one time during the setup for the configuration changes that the Base Integration Solution makes in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)]. After the solution imports, the account is no longer needed. Integration will continue to use the user account that is automatically created specifically for the integration.

In addition to customizing [!INCLUDE [cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)], the solution also creates a security role in [!INCLUDE [cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] for the integration:

* **Business Central Dataverse Integration** - Allows you to manage the connection between [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and [!INCLUDE [cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)]. Typically, this role is assigned only to the user account that's automatically created for synchronization. To learn more about this role, go to [Setting Up User Accounts for Integrating with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)]](admin-setting-up-integration-with-dynamics-sales.md).

When you set up the connection, you create the integration table mappings that you need to synchronize data. Entities in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] are mapped to tables and table fields in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] through integration tables. To learn more about mappings, go to [Standard Entity Mapping for Synchronization](admin-synchronizing-business-central-and-sales.md#standard-table-mapping-for-synchronization).

## Handle differences in local and base transaction currencies

You can connect to a [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] environment that has a different base currency than the local currency in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. You make the connection in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on the **Dataverse Connection Setup** page or by using the **Set up connection to Dataverse** assisted setup guide.

To be able to connect, ensure that the base transaction currency setting in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] has the currency that set on the **Currencies** page in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], and at least one exchange rate is specified for the currency on the **Currency Exchange Rates** page.

Here's an example. You're connecting [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] with Euro (EUR) set as the local currency on the **General Ledger Setup** page to a [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] environment that has a base transaction currency set to US dollar (USD). You'll need to have USD on the **Currencies** page in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and the appropriate exchange rate. 

When you enable the connection to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)], [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] adds its local currency to the **Currency** entity in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] with the exchange rate from the **Currency Factor** field on the **Currency Exchange Rates** page.

Currency synchronization is unidirectional, from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to [!INCLUDE [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)], monetary amounts convert and synchronize as follows:

* Amounts in the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] base currency convert to the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] local currency based on the latest exchange rate synchronized from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].
* Amounts in the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] local currency synchronize with the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] local currency in one of the other (non-base) currencies in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)].

## What happens when you copy a company

You can safely copy companies that integrate with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]. Copying companies helps reduce the risk of data inconsistencies and can save you valuable time. To learn more about copying companies, go to [Copy a company](about-new-company.md#copy-a-company).

# Set the layout used by a report

> **APPLIES TO:** Business Central online, Business Central on-premises 2022 release wave 1 and later. For earlier versions, go [here](ui-how-change-layout-currently-used-report.md).

A report layout determines the look of a report. It controls which data fields of a report dataset appear, how they're arranged, styled, and more. A report may have more than one layout, which you can then switch among as needed.

When there are multiple companies in the application, the layouts are set on a per-company basis. So the same report in one company can have a different layout in another company.

## Get started

There are a few ways to set which layout a report uses. Each way has advantages, depending on what you're looking to do: 

- From the report request page

  When setting up a report to run, the report request page includes the **Reports Layout** field that shows the current default layout used by the report. You can use this field to temporarily switch to another available layout the report you're running. After you run the report, the layout will revert to the default layout again. For more information, see [Run and Print Reports](ui-work-report.md#switch-the-report-layout).

- From the **Report Layout Selection** page

  The **Report Layout Selection** page displays a list of all reports. This page indicates what the current default layout for a report is. It lets you set layouts in different companies, without having to switch the company you're working with.

- From the **Report Layouts** page
  The **Report Layouts** page displays all available layouts for each report in the current company. It's also used to specify the default layout for reports. It's easy to find a specific layout by sorting or filtering the list. Once you find the layout, you can set it for a report with a single selection.

  > [!NOTE]
  > You can't use the **Report Layouts** page for Word and RDLC layouts that were created by using the legacy **Custom Layouts** feature. In fact, you won't even see these custom layouts listed on the **Report Layouts** page. For these layouts, you can only set them by using **Report Layout Selection** page.

## Set the layout from the Report Layouts page

1. [!INCLUDE[open-report-layouts-page](includes/open-report-layouts-page.md)]
2. Find the layout in the list, select it, then select the **Set Default** action at the top of the page.

## Set the layout from Report Layout Selection page

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Report Layout Selection**, and then choose the related link.
  
   The page lists all the reports that are available for the company that's specified in the **Company** field at the top of the page. The **Layout Description** field specifies the layout that the report currently uses.
2. Set the **Company** field at the top to the company that includes the report.
3. Find and select the report in the list, then do one of the following steps:

   - If the layout that you want to switch to is a different type than the current layout, select the **Layout Type** field, then choose the type of the layout you want to set on the report. 
   - If the layout that you want to switch to the same type as the current layout, select the **Select Layout** action at the top.

4. In the **Report Layouts** page, select the layout, then select **OK**.

## Revert to the original default layout

Reports are designed to use a layout by default. You can switch back to the original default layout from **Report Layout Selection** page. Just select the report, then select the **Restore Default Selection** action at the top of the page.

# Enable Approval Workflows

When you've created an approval workflow and you're sure it's good to go, you must enable it.  

On the **Workflow** page, create a workflow by listing the involved steps on the lines. Each step consists of a workflow event, moderated by event conditions, and a workflow response, moderated by response options. You define workflow steps by filling fields on workflow lines using fixed lists of event and response values representing scenarios supported by the application code. Learn more at [Create Workflows](across-how-to-create-workflows.md).  

## Enable a workflow

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Workflows**, then choose the related link.  
2. Open the workflow that you want to enable.  
3. On the **Workflow** page, turn on the **Enabled** toggle.

# Add Comments to Cards and Documents

You can add extra information to G/L accounts, customers cards, or sales orders to communicate exceptions or special agreements to other users.
Practically all cards and document have a **Comments** action, which opens the **Comment Sheet** page where you can write or read comments. On documents, you can also add comments to individual lines.

Comments on ongoing documents are transferred to the related posted document. For example, a comment on a sales order is transferred to a resulting posted sales shipment.

In addition, you can specify if you want comments to be transferred from one type of document to another resulting type of document, such as from a sales order to a sales invoice. You do this in the **Sales & Receivables** and the **Purchases & Payables** pages respectively.

> [!NOTE]
> Comments are not printed or output to reports or externally-facing documents.

The following describes how to add a comment to an item card. The steps are similar for all other cards and documents, except on document lines, the **Comments** action is placed on a lines action menu.

## To add a comments to an item card

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the relevant item card.
3. Choose the **Comments** action.
4. On the **Comment Sheet** page, enter any text, and then choose the **OK** button.

# Expected Capacity Need (Power BI report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Expected Capacity Need** report provides insights into the capacity you expect to require for each work center. It helps manufacturing managers plan production orders and allocate resources efficiently to meet production demands.

:::image type="content" source="media/manufacturing/expected-capacity-need.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Expected Capacity Need Power BI Report" lightbox="media/manufacturing/expected-capacity-need.png":::

## Use the report

The report is meant for manufacturing managers and supervisors.

Manufacturing managers use the report to view the expected capacity needs of each work center. The data can help you allocate resources efficiently to meet production demands. This report shows the backlog of production orders and the work center availability to meet the demands. You can further break down production orders to see which orders are scheduled for each work center group and take actions to handle the expected capacity need.

Production supervisors use this report to understand the workload on your work center group, and take action to handle the expected capacity need. The report provides insights into the expected capacity need, capacity used, and capacity used variance. These insights help you optimize the use of resources.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The *Expected Capacity Need* report includes the following KPIs and measures: 

- [Expected Capacity Need (Hours)](manufacturing-powerbi-kpis.md#expected-capacity-need-hours)
- [Capacity Used (Hours)](manufacturing-powerbi-kpis.md#capacity-used-hours)
- [Capacity Used Variance (Hours)](manufacturing-powerbi-kpis.md#capacity-used-variance-hours)

[!INCLUDE[click-on-a-kpi-link](includes/click-on-a-kpi-link.md)] 

[!INCLUDE[powerbi-tip-track-kpis](includes/powerbi-tip-track-kpis.md)]

## Data used in the report

The report uses data from the following tables in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]:

- Production Order
- Production Order Routing Line
- Capacity Ledger Entry

# Design Details: Cost Adjustment

The main purpose of cost adjustment is to forward cost changes from cost sources to cost recipients, according to an item’s costing method, to provide correct inventory valuation.  

An item can be sales invoiced before it has been purchase invoiced, so that the recorded inventory value of the sale does not match the actual purchase cost. Cost adjustment updates the cost of goods sold (COGS) for historic sales entries to ensure that they match the costs of the inbound transactions to which they are applied. For more information, see [Design Details: Item Application](design-details-item-application.md).  

The following are secondary purposes, or functions, of cost adjustment:  

* Invoice finished production orders:  

  * Change the status of value entries from **Expected** to **Actual**.  
  * Clear WIP accounts. For more information, see [Design Details: Production Order Posting](design-details-production-order-posting.md).  
  * Post variance. For more information, see [Design Details: Variance](design-details-variance.md).  
  * Update the unit cost on the item card.  

Inventory costs must be adjusted before the related value entries can be reconciled with the general ledger. For more information, see [Design Details: Reconciliation with the General Ledger](design-details-reconciliation-with-the-general-ledger.md).  

## Detecting the Adjustment

The task of detecting if cost adjustment should occur is primarily performed by the Item Jnl.-Post Line routine, while the task of calculating and generating cost adjustment entries is performed by the **Adjust Cost – Item Entries** batch job.  

To be able to forward costs, the detection mechanism determines which sources have changed in costs and to which destination these costs should be forwarded. The following three detection functions exist in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]:  

* Item Application Entry  
* Average Cost Adjustment Entry Point  
* Order Level  

### Item Application Entry

This detection function is used for items that use FIFO, LIFO, Standard, and Specific costing methods and for fixed applications scenarios. The function works as follows:  

* Cost adjustment is detected by marking the source item ledger entries as *Applied Entry to Adjust* whenever an item ledger entry or value entry is posted.  
* Cost is forwarded according to the cost chains that are recorded in the **Item Application Entry** table.  

### Average Cost Adjustment Entry Point

This detection function is used for items that use the Average costing method. The function works as follows:  

* Cost adjustment is detected by marking a record in the **Avg. Cost Adjmt. Entry Point** table whenever a value entry is posted.  
* Cost is forwarded by applying the costs to value entries with a later valuation date.  

### Order Level

This detection function is used in conversion scenarios, production and assembly. The function works as follows:  

* Cost adjustment is detected by marking the order whenever a material/resource is posted as consumed/used.  
* Cost is forwarding by applying the costs from material/resource to the output entries associated with the same order.  

The Order Level function is used to detect adjustments in assembly posting. The following graphic shows the adjustment entry structure:  

![Flow of entries in cost adjustment.](media/design_details_assembly_posting_3.png "Flow of entries in cost adjustment")  

For more information, see [Design Details: Assembly Order Posting](design-details-assembly-order-posting.md).  

## Manual versus Automatic Cost Adjustment

Cost adjustment can be performed in two ways:  

* Manually, by running the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job. You can run this batch job either for all items or for only certain items or item categories. This batch job runs a cost adjustment for the items in inventory for which an inbound transaction has been made, such as a purchase. For items that use the average costing method, the batch job also makes an adjustment if any outbound transactions are created.  
* Automatically, by adjusting costs every time that you post an inventory transaction, and when you finish a production order. The cost adjustment is only run for the specific item or items affected by the posting. This is set up when you select the **Automatic Cost Adjustment** check box on the **Inventory Setup** page.  

It is good practice to run the cost adjustment automatically when you post because unit costs are more frequently updated and therefore more accurate. The disadvantage is that the performance of the database can be affected by running the cost adjustment so often.  

Because it is important to keep the unit cost of an item up to date, it is recommend that you run the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job as often as possible, during nonworking hours. Alternatively, use automatic cost adjustment. This ensures that the unit cost is updated for items daily.  

Regardless if you run the cost adjustment manually or automatically, the adjustment process and its consequences are the same. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates the value of the inbound transaction and forwards that cost to any outbound transactions, such as sales or consumptions, which have been applied to the inbound transaction. The cost adjustment creates value entries that contain adjustment amounts and amounts that compensate for rounding.  

The new adjustment and rounding value entries have the posting date of the related invoice. Exceptions are if the value entries fall in a closed accounting period or inventory period or if the posting date is earlier than the date in the **Allow Posting From** field on the **General Ledger Setup** page. If this occurs, the batch job assigns the posting date as the first date of the next open period.  

## Adjust Cost - Item Entries Batch Job

When you run the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job, you have the option to run the batch job for all items or for only certain items or categories.  

> [!NOTE]  
> We recommend that you always run the batch job for all items and only use the filtering option to reduce the runtime of the batch job, or to fix the cost of a certain item.  

### Example

The following example shows if you post a purchased item as received and invoiced on 01-01-20. You later post the sold item as shipped and invoiced on 01-15-20. Then, you run the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** and **Post Inventory Cost to G/L** batch jobs. The following entries are created.  

#### Value Entries (1) 

|Posting Date|Item Ledger Entry Type|Cost Amount (Actual)|Cost Posted to G/L|Invoiced Quantity|Entry No.|  
|------------|----------------------|--------------------|------------------|-----------------|---------|  
|01-01-20|Purchase|10.00|10.00|1|1|  
|01-15-20|Sale|-10.00|-10.00|-1|2|  

#### Relation Entries in the G/L – Item Ledger Relation Table (1)

|G/L Entry No.|Value Entry No.|G/L Register No.|  
|-------------|---------------|----------------|  
|1|1|1|  
|2|1|1|  
|3|2|1|  
|4|2|1|  

#### General Ledger Entries (1)

|Posting Date|G/L Account|Account No. (En-US Demo)|Amount|Entry No.|  
|------------------|------------------|---------------------------------|------------|---------------|  
|01-01-20|[Inventory Account]|2130|10.00|1|  
|01-01-20|[Direct Cost Applied Account]|7291|-10.00|2|  
|01-15-20|[Inventory Account]|2130|-10.00|3|  
|01-15-20|[COGS Account]|7290|10.00|4|  

Later, you post a related purchase item charge for 2.00 LCY invoiced on 02-10-20. You run the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job and then run the **Post Inventory Cost to G/L** batch job. The cost adjustment batch job adjusts the cost of the sale by -2.00 LCY accordingly, and the **Post Inventory Cost to G/L** batch job posts the new value entries to the general ledger. The result is as follows.  

#### Value Entries (2)  

|Posting Date|Item Ledger Entry Type|Cost Amount (Actual)|Cost Posted to G/L|Invoiced Quantity|Adjustment|Entry No.|  
|------------|----------------------|--------------------|------------------|-----------------|----------|---------|

|01-15-20|[Inventory Account]|2130|-2.00|7|  
|01-15-20|[COGS Account]|7290|2.00|8|  

## Automatic Cost Adjustment

To set up cost adjustment to run automatically when you post an inventory transaction, use the **Automatic Cost Adjustment** field on the **Inventory Setup** page. This field enables you to select how far back in time from the current work date that you want automatic cost adjustment to be performed. The following options exist.  

|Option|Description|
|------|-----------|
|Never|Costs are not adjusted when you post.|  
|Day|Costs are adjusted if posting occurs within one day from the work date.|  
|Week|Costs are adjusted if posting occurs within one week from the work date.|  
|Month|Costs are adjusted if posting occurs within one month from the work date.|  
|Quarter|Costs are adjusted if posting occurs within one quarter from the work date.|  
|Year|Costs are adjusted if posting occurs within one year from the work date.|  
|Always|Costs are always adjusted when you post, regardless of the posting date.|  

The selection that you make in the **Automatic Cost Adjustment** field is important for performance and the accuracy of your costs. Shorter time periods, such as **Day** or **Week**, affect system performance less, because they provide the stricter requirement that only costs posted in the last day or week can be automatically adjusted. This means that the automatic cost adjustment does not run as frequently and therefore affects system performance less. However, it also means that unit costs may be less accurate.  

### Example

The following example shows an automatic cost adjustment scenario:  

* On January 10, you post a purchased item as received and invoiced.  
* On January 15, you post a sales order for the item as shipped and invoiced.
* On February 5, you receive an invoice for a freight charge on the original purchase. You post this freight charge, applying it to the original purchase invoice, which increases the cost of the original purchase.  

If you have set up the automatic cost adjustment to apply to postings that occur within a month or a quarter from the current work date, then the automatic cost adjustment runs and forwards the cost of the purchase to the sale.  

If you have set up the automatic cost adjustment to apply to postings that occur within a day or a week from the current work date, then the automatic cost adjustment does not run, and the cost of the purchase is not forwarded to the sale until you run the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job.

# Receive items with warehouse receipts

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you receive items and put them away using one of four methods, as described in the following table.

|Method|Inbound Process|Require Receipts|Require Put-aways|Complexity Level (Learn more at [Warehouse Management Overview](design-details-warehouse-management.md))|  
|------------|---------------------|--------------|----------------|------------|  
|A|Post receipt and put-away from the order line|||No dedicated warehouse activity.|  
|B|Post receipt and put-away from an inventory put-away document||Turned on|Basic: Order-by-order.|  
|C|Post receipt and put-away from a warehouse receipt document|Turned on||Basic: Consolidated receive/ship posting for multiple orders.|  
|D|Post receipt from a warehouse receipt document and post put-away from a warehouse put-away document|Turned on|Turned on|Advanced|  

To learn more about how to handle inbound items, go to [Inbound Warehouse Flow](design-details-inbound-warehouse-flow.md).

The following article refers to methods C and D in the previous table.

## Receive items with a warehouse receipt

When items arrive at a warehouse that processes warehouse receipts, get the lines of the document that triggered the receipt. If you use bins, you can either accept the default bin or specify the bin to put the items in. The latter might be required when you receive an item for the first time. Then, enter the quantities of the items you received and post the receipt.  

You can create warehouse receipt in one of two ways:

* In a push fashion, when work is done on an order-by-order basis. Choose the **Create Warehouse Receipt** action in the source document, such as a purchase order, sales return order, or transfer order to create a warehouse receipt for a source document.
* In a pull fashion, where you use the **Release** action in the source document, such as a purchase order, sales return order, or transfer order to release the document to the warehouse. A warehouse employee can create a **Warehouse Receipt** for one or more released source documents.

The following procedure describes how to create a warehouse receipt in a pull fashion.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Warehouse Receipts**, then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  

    Fill in the **Location Code** field on the **General** FastTab. When you retrieve source document lines, some of the information is copied to each line.

    For a location that requires bins, fill in the **Bin Code** field. Depending on your setup, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can add the bin code for you. Learn more at [Zone and bin codes](warehouse-how-receive-items.md#zone-and-bin-codes).  

3. You can get source document in two ways:

    1. Choose the **Get Source Documents** action. The **Source Documents - Inbound** page opens. Here you can select one or more source documents released to warehouse that requires receipt.
    2. Choose the **Use Filters to Get Src. Docs.** action. The **Filters to Get Source Docs. - Inbound** page opens. Here you can select Source Document Filter and run it. All released source document lines that meet the filter criteria are added on the **Warehouse Receipt** page. Learn more at [How to Use Filters to Get Source Documents](warehouse-how-receive-items.md#how-to-use-filters-to-get-source-documents).

4. Set the quantity to receive.

    The **Qty. to Receive** field contains the quantity outstanding for each line, but you can change the quantity as needed. 

    To set the value in the **Qty. to Receive** field on all lines to zero, choose the **Delete Qty. to Receive** action. For example, setting the quantities to zero is useful if you're using a barcode scanner to update the received quantities. To add the outstanding quantities from the source document again, choose the **Autofill Qty. to Receive** action.  

    On a warehouse receipt document where the received quantity is higher than ordered, enter the quantity received in the **Qty. to Receive** field. If the increase is within the tolerance specified by an assigned over-receipt code, the **Over-Receipt Quantity** field updates to show the quantity by which the value in the **Quantity** field is exceeded. If the increase is over the tolerance, the over-receipt isn't allowed.

5. Post the warehouse receipt. The quantity fields are updated on the source documents, and the items are added to inventory.  

    [!INCLUDE [preview-posting-shipment](includes/preview-posting-shipment.md)]

    > [!TIP]
    > If you use warehouse put-aways (method D in the table in the beginning of this article), the items are received. However, you can't pick them until they're put away. To learn more about putting away items, go to [Put Items Away with Warehouse Put-aways](warehouse-how-to-put-items-away-with-warehouse-put-aways.md).
    >
    > Otherwise, consider using the **Post and Print** action. The action posts the receipt and prints it as a put-away instruction that shows where to put the item.

    > [!NOTE]  
    > If your warehouse uses cross-docking, you can check whether you can cross-dock items without putting them away. To learn more about cross-docking, go to [Cross-Dock Items](warehouse-how-to-cross-dock-items.md).

## How to use filters to get source documents

From a warehouse receipt, you can use the **Filters to Get Source Docs.** page to retrieve the released source document lines that specify the items to receive.

1. In the warehouse receipt, choose the **Use Filters to Get Src. Docs.** action.
2. To set up a new filter, enter a descriptive code in the **Code** field, then choose the **Modify** action.

    The **Source Document Filter Card - Inbound** page appears.

3. Use the filters to define the type of source document lines to retrieve. For example, you can select types of source documents, such as purchase or transfer orders.
4. Choose **Run**.  

All released source document lines that meet the filter criteria are added on the **Warehouse Receipt** page on which you activated the filters.

You can make an unlimited number of filter combinations. Filters are saved on the **Filters to Get Source Docs.** page, and they're available the next time you need them. You can change the criteria at any time by choosing the **Modify** action.

## Zone and bin codes

To receive items with warehouse class codes other than the class code of the bin in the **Bin Code** field on the document header, clear the **Bin Code** field on the header before you retrieve source document lines for the items.  
<!-- TBD, table with comparison of various options-->

If bins are mandatory for a location, zone and bin codes are added to warehouse receipt documents as follows:

* For advanced configurations that use directed put-away and pick, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses the receipt bin code from the **Location Card** page for the location. If a receipt bin code isn't specified, no bin is specified. If the item and receipt bins don't match, the receipt bin code is blank.
* In other configurations, if a receipt bin code isn't specified, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses the bin code from the source document.

# Manage fixed assets

The fixed assets functionality in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides an overview of your fixed assets and helps ensure that their depreciation is correct. It also helps you track maintenance costs, manage insurance policies, post fixed asset transactions, and generate various reports and statistics.

## What is a fixed asset?

Fixed assets differ from other items in your warehouse. A fixed asset, also known as a capital asset, is a tangible piece of property, plant, or equipment (PP&E) that you own or manage with the expectation that it will continue to help generate income. An asset is fixed when it’s an item that your business won’t consume, sell, or convert to cash within the next calendar year. Fixed assets are different than current assets, which are in cash or slated to be converted to cash within the next 12 months. Fixed assets also differ from your inventory, because inventory is typically consumed within a short time.

## Types of fixed assets

Businesses typically invest in a few types of fixed assets. Some examples are:

- Buildings and facilities
- Computer equipment and software
- Furniture and fixtures
- Machinery
- Vehicles

## Understanding fixed asset accounting

Fixed asset accounting means keeping precise financial records about your capital assets. These records include details about the five stages in an asset's lifecycle. After your initial purchase, each fixed asset’s lifecycle includes at least three of the following stages:

- Acquisition: You add a new fixed asset to your books.
- Depreciation: You record an asset's periodic decline in value, which you use a depreciation method to calculate. To learn more, go to [FA Depreciation Calculation](LocalFunctionality/India/FA_Depreciation.md).
- Revaluation: You record an assessment of the current fair market value of an asset. To learn more, go to [Revalue Fixed Assets](fa-how-revalue.md).
- Impairment: You record a reduction in value due to events or circumstances.
- Disposal: You sell, scrap, or use another way dispose of an asset at the end of its service life.

Audits are also included in the detailed checks of your company’s accounting records after closing the books for the financial year. Whether internal or external, audits are where you might notice inconsistencies or differences between your notes and the actual state of your assets. Audits promote transparency in your assets and accounting if you’re losing more money than anticipated.

## Video overview

The following video covers the basics of fixed assets:

> [!Video https://learn-video.azurefd.net/vod/player?id=32fa27be-9e9a-4637-bc9b-87eb994f5ae0]

## Initial setup of fixed assets

Before you can manage fixed assets, you must complete the following setups:

- Default values
- Fixed asset accounting
- Posting groups and types
- Allocation keys
- Fixed asset journals

To learn more, go to [Setting Up Fixed Assets](fa-setup.md).

## Register fixed assets

For each fixed asset, you must set up a card that contains information about them. For example, you can set up buildings or production equipment as main assets with a component list. You can group assets in various ways, such as by class, department, or location. Then you can acquire, maintain, and sell the fixed assets. You can also set up budgeted assets. Budgeting lets you include any anticipated acquisitions and sales in reports.

## Set up depreciations for your fixed assets

To track fixed asset depreciations and other financial transactions for fixed assets, set up one or more depreciation books for each one. There are a few steps to depreciate assets:

1. Run a report that calculates periodic depreciation.
1. Fill in a journal with the resulting entries.
1. Post the journal.

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports several depreciation methods. To learn more, go to [Depreciation Methods](fa-depreciation-methods.md). You can set up multiple depreciation books for each fixed asset for different purposes, such as one for tax reporting and another for internal reporting.

## Fixed assets maintenance and insurance

You can record maintenance costs and the next service date for each asset. Tracking maintenance expenses can be important for budgeting purposes and deciding whether to replace a fixed asset. You can attach each fixed asset to one or more insurance policies, and verify that policy premiums align with the value of the assets.

## Tips for improving your fixed asset accounting

There are a few things you can implement in your accounting strategy for fixed assets that can help ensure you’re maximizing your earnings.

- Establish a threshold for capitalization. When you purchase an item, determine a fixed amount for capitalization. The amount helps ensure your accounting books are consistent, and makes it easier for you and your team to spot accounting errors.
- Reevaluate equipment lifecycle. It's important to correctly estimate the length of time you can use your fixed assets for their original purpose. Because accounting and depreciation rely on accurate lifecycle estimates, reevaluate when necessary because it might change over time.
- Tag your assets. It’s essential to track and tag your assets throughout their lifecycle because many factors can affect their value. Tagging helps track your items throughout the stages of their lifecycle, and help prevent theft, eliminate misplacement, and support financial statistics.
- Automate insight with fixed asset accounting software. Automating manual activities to track your data with fixed asset accounting software make processes easier to complete. Password protection can help provide access only to the people who need it and are trained for it.

# Period-Over-Period (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Period-Over-Period** report provides valuable insights into your purchasing performance over time. This report compares purchasing amounts for different time periods to the same period in the previous year, so you can identify growth trends and areas for improvement.

For example, if the analysis scope is fiscal months, the report compares the purchasing amount in October 2023 to the purchasing amount in October 2022. If the scope is fiscal years, the report compares the purchasing amount in fiscal year 2023 to the purchasing amount in 2022.

:::image type="content" source="media/purchases/purchases-period-over-period.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Period-Over-Period Power BI report" lightbox="media/purchases/purchases-period-over-period.png":::

## Use the report

The report is meant for business leaders and managers.

CEOs can get insights into your organization's purchase spending over time. By comparing purchase amounts for different time periods to the same period in the previous year, this report helps you identify purchasing trends and growth.

Purchasing managers can use this report to analyze the growth amount and growth percentage, and evaluate spending over the current fiscal year in comparison to the previous fiscal year. This information can help you adjust purchasing plans and allocate budgets effectively.


## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The *Period-Over-Period* report includes the following KPIs and measures: 

- [**Purchase Amount**](purchases-powerbi-kpis.md#purchase-amount)  
- [**Previous Period**](purchases-powerbi-kpis.md#purchase-amount-pp-fiscal)

# Design details: Creating warehouse entries

Warehouse entries contain information about item movements within the warehouse. For example, you create entries when you post a warehouse journal, or any transaction that moves items from one place to another. Each transaction can create several warehouse entries and warehouse register records. Warehouse register records have the first and last warehouse entry numbers. This information lets you identify the warehouse entries that a particular action created. And, conversely, each warehouse entry has a field that points to the warehouse register.

The following image illustrates the relationship between warehouse registers and warehouse entries for three transactions.

:::image type="content" source="media/warehouse register and entries.png" alt-text="Diagram shows the relations between warehouse register records and warehouse entries.":::

## Creating warehouse transactions

When [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates warehouse transactions, it checks the `ConcurrentWarehousingPosting` feature key to determine how to assign entry numbers to warehouse register records and warehouse entries.

### If the feature key is turned off

If the feature key is turned off, both tables are locked. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] finds the last entry in both tables and assigns a number that is one digit higher. For example, if the last entry number is 10, then it assigns the number 11. This method of assignment ensures that warehouse entry numbers are consecutive in the warehouse register, but it blocks other users from registering warehouse transactions.

### If the feature key is turned on

If the feature key is turned on, which it is by default, entry numbers in both tables are assigned from `SequenceNumbers` in the database to allow users to register warehouse transactions at the same time. Using sequence numbers might cause warehouse entry numbers from two or more transactions to overlap, as the following image shows.

:::image type="content" source="media/warehouse register and entries 2.png" alt-text="Diagram shows how warehouse register records and warehouse entries can overlap.":::

## When to turn off the feature key

You might want to turn off the `ConcurrentWarehousingPosting` feature key if you work with a feature or extension that extends warehouse management and the following are true:

* The feature relies on consecutive entry numbers.
* The feature locks tables during a process.

# Detecting Mandatory Fields

When you enter data, you might see a red asterisk next to a field. The asterisk means that the field is required for a certain process. For example, you're about to post a transaction, but you've not filled in an important field.

The visual clue doesn't force you to fill in the field. The red asterisk is a reminder that you're blocked from completing a process.

## Examples

On the **Customer Card** page, the red asterisk appears in the **Name** field, in the **Tax Area Code** field, and in the posting group fields to indicate that you can't post a sales transaction for the customer unless the fields are filled.

On the **Item Card** page, the red asterisk appears in the **Description** field to indicate that you can't enter the item on a document line, such as a sales order, unless this field is filled.

# Design Details: Warehouse Setup

Warehouse functionality in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] contains different levels of complexity, as defined by license permissions in the offered granules. The level of complexity in a warehouse solution is largely defined by the bin setup on location cards, which in turn is license-controlled so that access to bin setup fields is defined by the license. In addition, the application objects in the license govern which UI document to use for the supported warehouse activities.  
<!--
The following warehouse-related granules exist:  

- Basic Inventory (4010)  
- Bin (4170)  
- Put Away (4180)  
- Warehouse Receipt (4190)  
- Pick (4200)  
- Warehouse Shipment (4210)  
- Warehouse Management Systems (4620)  
- Internal Picks and Put-aways (4630)  
- Automated Data Capture System (4640)
- Bin Setup (4660)  

For more information about each granule, see [[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Price Sheets](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=238341) (requires PartnerSource account). -->

The following table shows which granules are required to define different warehouse complexity levels, which UI documents support each level, and which location codes reflect these levels in the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] demonstration database.  

[!INCLUDE [locations-cronus](includes/locations-cronus.md)]

## Bin and Bin Content

A bin is a storage device designed to contain discrete parts. It is the smallest container unit in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Item quantities in bins are referred to as bin content. A lookup from the **Item** field or **Bin Code** field on any warehouse-related document line displays the calculated availability of the item in the bin.  

A bin content can be given a property of Fixed, Dedicated, or Default to define how the bin content can be used. Bins with none of these properties are referred to as floating bins.  

A fixed bin holds items that are assigned to the bin code in question. The Fixed bin property ensures that even if the bin content is momentarily emptied, the bin content does not disappear, and the bin is therefore selected again as soon as it has been replenished.  

A dedicated bin holds bin content that can only be picked for the dedicated resource, such as a machine center, that uses the bin in question. Other non-pick content, such as quantities outbound on a shipment posting, can still be consumed from a dedicated bin. Only bin content considered by the **Create Pick** algorithm is protected in a dedicated bin.  

The Default bin property is used by the system to suggest bins for warehouse activities. At WMS locations, the Default bin property is not used. At locations where bins are required, the property is used in inbound flows to specify where to place items. In outbound flows, the property is used to specify where to take items from.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  If the outbound items are placed in several bins, then items are first taken from the non-default bins, to empty that bin content, and then the remaining items are taken from the default bin.  

There can only be one default bin per item per location.  

## Bin Type

In WMS installations, you can restrict the warehouse activities that are allowed for a bin by assigning a bin type to it. The following bin types exist:  

|Bin Type|Description|  
|------------------|---------------------------------------|  
|RECEIVE|Items posted as received but not yet put away.|  
|SHIP|Items picked for warehouse shipment lines but not yet posted as shipped.|  
|PUT AWAY|Typically, items to be stored in large units of measure but that you do not want to access for picking purposes. Because these bins are not used for picking, either for production orders or shipments, your use of a Put Away type bin might be limited, but this bin type could be useful if you have purchased a large quantity of items. Bins of this type should always have a low bin-ranking, so that when received items are put away, other higher-ranking PUTPICK bins fixed to the item are put away first. If you are using this type of bin, you must regularly perform bin replenishment so that the items stored in these bins are also available in PUTPICK or PICK type bins.|  
|PICK|Items to be used for picking only. The replenishment of these bins can only be made by movement, not by put-away.|  
|PUTPICK|Items in bins that are suggested for both the put-away and pick functions. Bins of this type probably have different bin rankings. You can set up your bulk storage bins as this type of bin with low bin rankings compared to your ordinary pick bins or forward picking area bins.|  
|QC|This bin is used for inventory adjustments if you specify this bin on the location card in the **Adjustment Bin Code** field. You can also set up bins of this type for defective items and items being inspected. You can move items to this type of bin if you want to make them inaccessible to the usual item flow. **Note:**  Unlike all other bin types, the **QC** bin type has none of the item handling check boxes selected by default. This indicates that any content you place in a QC bin is excluded from item flows.|  

For all bin types, except PICK, PUTPICK, and PUTAWAY, no other activity is allowed for the bin than what is defined by its bin type. For example, a bin of type **Receive** can only be used to receive items into or pick items from.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Only movement can be made to bins of type RECEIVE and QC. Similarly, only movements can be made from bins of type SHIP and QC.  

## Bin Ranking

In advanced warehousing, you can automate and optimize how items are collected in put-away and pick worksheets by ranking bins so that items are suggested taken or placed according to rank criteria to use warehouse space optimally.  

Put-away processes are optimized according to bin ranking by suggesting higher-ranking bins before lower-ranking bins. Similarly, pick processes are optimized by first suggesting items from bin content with high bin ranking. Furthermore, bin replenishments are suggested from lower-ranking bins to higher-ranking bins.  

Bin ranking together with bin content information are the basic properties that allow users to slot items in the warehouse.  

## Bin Setup  
In advanced warehousing, bins can be set up with capacity values, such as quantity, total cubage, and weight to control which and how items are stored in the bin.  

On each item card, you can assign a unit of measure (UOM) for the item, such as pieces, pallets, liters, grams, or boxes. You can also have a base UOM for an item and specify larger UOMs that are based on it. For example, you can define a pallet to equal 16 pieces, the latter being the base UOM.  

If you want to set a maximum quantity of a specific item to be stored in an individual bin and the item has more than one UOM, then you must set the maximum quantity for every UOM that exists on the item card. Accordingly, if an item has been set up to be handled in pieces and pallets, then the **Max. Qty.** field on the **Bin Content** page for that item must also be in pieces and pallets. Otherwise, the allowed quantity for that bin is not calculated correctly.  

Before you set capacity restrictions for bin contents on a bin, you must first make sure that the UOM and dimensions of the item have been set up on the item card.  

> [!NOTE]  
> It is only possible to operate with multiple UOMs in WMS installations. I all other configurations, bin contents can only be in the base UOM. In all transactions with a UOM higher than the item's base UOM, the quantity is converted to the base UOM.  

## Zone

In advanced warehousing, bins can be grouped in zones to manage how the workflow of warehouse activities is directed.  

A zone could be a receiving zone or a stocking zone, and each zone can consist of one or several bins.  

Most properties assigned to a zone will by default be assigned to the bin that is created from that zone.  

## Class  
In advanced warehousing, you can assign warehouse class codes to items, bins, and zones to control where different item classes are stored, such as frozen goods. You can divide a zone into several warehouse classes. For example, items in the receiving zone can be stored as frozen, hazardous, or other class.  

When you work with warehouse classes and a default receiving/shipping bin, you must manually fill in the appropriate bins in the warehouse receipt and shipment lines.  

In inbound flows, the class code is only highlighted on inbound lines where the item class code does not match the default receiving bin. If the correct default bins are not assigned, then the quantity cannot be received.  

## Location

A location is a physical structure or place where inventory is received, stored, and shipped, potentially organized in bins. A location can be a warehouse, service car, showroom, plant, or an area in a plant.  

## First Expired First Out

If you select the **Pick According to FEFO** check box on the **Bin Policies** FastTab on the location card, then item-tracked items are picked according to their expiration date. The items with the earliest expiration dates are picked first.  

Warehouse activities in all pick and movement documents are sorted according to FEFO, unless the items in question already have serial/lot numbers assigned. If only a part of the quantity on the line already has serial/lot numbers assigned, then the remaining quantity to be picked is sorted according to FEFO.  

When picking by FEFO, the available items that expire first are gathered in a temporary item tracking list based on the expiration date. If two items have the same expiration date, then the item with the lowest lot or serial number is picked first. If the lot or serial numbers are the same, then the item that was registered first is selected first. Standard criteria for selecting items in pick bins, such as Bin Ranking and Break Bulk, are applied to this temporary FEFO item tracking list.  

## Put-away Template

The put-away template can be assigned to an item and to a location. The put-away template specifies a set of prioritized rules that must be respected when creating put-aways. For example, a put-away template may require that the item is placed in a bin with bin content that matches the UOM, and if a similar bin with enough capacity cannot be found, then the item must be placed in an empty bin.

# Correct prepayments

You can make a correction to an order after you have posted a prepayment invoice for the order. You can add new lines to an order after issuing a prepayment, and then you can post another prepayment invoice, but you can't delete a line from an order after a prepayment has been invoiced for the line.  

> [!TIP]
> If you have posted a prepayment invoice for a sales invoice that you then correct or cancel, you must correct or cancel the prepayment as well.

## To correct a prepayment

The following procedure shows how to issue a prepayment credit memo to cancel all invoiced prepayments for a sales order.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the relevant sales order.
3. Choose the **Prepayment** action, and then choose the **Post Prepayment Credit Memo** action or the **Post and Print Prepmt. Cr. Memo** action.  
4. On the **Sales Credit Memo** page, proceed to correct the relevant entries, as for any sales credit memo. For more information, see [Process Sales Returns or Cancellations](sales-how-process-sales-returns-cancellations.md).  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > To reduce the amount in the **Line Amount** field, you must first increase the prepayment percentage on the line so that the value in the **Prepmt. Line Amount** field is not decreased below the value in the **Prepmt. Amt. Inv.** field.

5. To make a prepayment invoice for any new lines in the sales credit memo, choose the **Prepayment** action, and then choose the **Post Prepayment Invoice** action or the **Post and Print Prepmt. Invoice** action.  
6. To issue an additional prepayment invoice, increase the prepayment amount on one or more lines and post the prepayment invoice. A new invoice will be created for the difference between the prepayment amounts invoiced and the new prepayment amounts.

# Work with Service Contracts and Service Contract Quotes
You can create a service contract either manually or from a service contract quote. You can use a service contract quote as a forerunner of a service contract, in which your company makes an offer to the customer and obtains customer approval before you can convert it to a service contract. The procedures for creating either a service contract or service contract quote are similar.  

## To create a service contract or service contract quote  
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Contracts** or **Service Contract Quotes**,and then choose the related link.  
2. Create a new service contract or service contract quote.  
3. Fill in the **No.** field. A dialog box opens, asking whether you want to fill it with the common data from a contract template. If you want to create such a service contract or service contract quote, choose the **Yes** button. The **Service Contract Template List** page opens.  
4. Select the appropriate template, and then choose **OK** to use it to create the service contract or service contract quote.  
5. In the **Customer No.** field, choose the customer.  
6. If you do not want an annual amount difference to be distributed automatically, choose the **Allow Unbalanced Amounts** check box. The values in the **Annual Amount** and **Calcd. Annual Amount** fields are not automatically equalized. If you want application to do automatically distribute any annual amount difference that might occur from a change in the service contract, leave the **Allow Unbalanced Amounts** check box clear.  
7. Add contract lines to the service contract or service contract quote.  
8. Fill in the rest of the fields as necessary.  

## To convert a service contract quote to service contract  
When a customer has accepted a service contract quote, you convert it to a service contract. At the same time, you can create a service invoice for the starting period of the contract if the starting date of the contract is before the beginning of the next invoice period.

After you complete the following steps, a service contract is created with the status **Signed**. If a service invoice is created for the starting period of the contract, the invoiced amount is calculated in the following way, depending on whether the contract is detailed or not.  

For detailed contracts, the invoiced amount is calculated as follows:  

* Invoiced amount = sum of the invoiced amount for each contract line.  
* Invoiced amount for each contract line = ((quote value ÷ 12) × number of months in the starting period) + ((quote value ÷ number of days in the year) × number of days left in the starting period).  
* If the contract line expires before the starting period ends, the expiration date becomes the ending date of the starting period for the line.  

For contracts that are not detailed, the invoiced amount is calculated as follows:  

* Invoiced amount = (annual amount ÷ number of days in the year) × number of days in the starting period.  
* If the contract expires before the starting period ends, the expiration date becomes the ending date of the starting period.    

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Contract Quotes**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the service contract quote you want to convert to a service contract.  
3. Choose the **Make Contract** action.  
4. If the starting date of the contract is before the beginning of the next invoice period, you are asked if you want to create an invoice for the starting period of the contract. Choose **Yes**.  

 The service invoice is posted to the service account of the contract, even if the contract is prepaid.

## To create contract service credit memos
You can use a contract service credit memo when a customer cancels a prepaid service contract or removes a service item from a prepaid contract. You can also use it to correct an erroneous service invoice.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Credit Memos**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Create a new service credit memo.  
3. Fill in the **No.** field.  
4. In the **Customer No.** field, enter the number of the customer in the service contract.  

     The **Invoicing** FastTab shows information copied from the **Customer** card. If you want to post the credit memo to a different customer than the one specified on the **General** FastTab, enter the number of that customer in the **Bill-to Customer No.** field.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  You can compare the credit memo to the original posted document on the **Posted Service Invoices** page. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Posted Service Invoices**, and then choose the related link.  

5. Fill in the **Posting Date** and **Document Date** fields.  
6. On the credit memo lines, enter information about the items that have been returned or removed, or the allowance that will be sent. You can also use the **Get Prepaid Contract Entries** batch job.  

 To automatically create a credit memo when contract lines are removed from a service contract, on the **Service Contract** page, on the **Invoice Details** FastTab, select the **Automatic Credit Memos** check box.  

 To manually create a credit memo when contract lines are removed from a service contract, on the **Service Contract** page, choose the **Credit Memo** action.  

## Updating and evaluating contracts
Sometimes you have to change the terms of a contract after it has been created. In most cases, you open the relevant contract on the **Service Contract** page, and change it as necessary.  

You can change the status of the contract, initially set to **Locked**, add and remove contract lines, and cancel a contract. If you want to see how your business is doing as measured by gain and loss, you can do quick business analysis using the contract trendscape feature.

## To add a contract line to a service contract or contract quote  
When a customer purchases a new item and wants to include it in the existing service contract or contract quote, you can register the item as a service item and then add it as a new contract line to the contract or contract quote.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Contracts**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the relevant service contract or service contract quote that you want to add a new contract line for.  
3. Choose the **Open Contract** action to open the service contract or service contract quote for editing.  
4. On the **Invoice Details** FastTab, select the **Allow Unbalanced Amounts** field if you want to change the annual amount and distribute the annual amount difference manually on the contract lines. Otherwise, clear the check box in the **Allow Unbalanced Amounts** field. This will distribute the annual amount difference automatically on the contract lines after you change the annual amount.  
5. On the **Lines** FastTab, add a service item or item, or text description, on each contract line. Alternatively, you can add contract quote lines. Note that you can create multiple contracts per service item to have it included in different service contracts or contract quotes at the same time.  
6. Verify and correct the numbers in the **Line Discount %**, **Line Discount Amount**, **Response Time**, **Service Period**, and other fields as needed.

## To remove contract lines  
You may need to remove contract lines from the service contract as you remove corresponding service items from the service contract. Usually you remove a contract line that is expired or corresponds to the service item that has broken down.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Contracts**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the service contract from which you want to remove contract lines.  
3. Choose the **Open Contract** action to open the service contract for editing.  
4. Choose the contract line you want to remove. Fill in the **Contract Expiration Date** field with the date as of which you want to remove the line. For example, you could enter the date when the service item broke down.  
5. Choose the **Remove Contract Lines** action. The **Remove Lines from Contract** page opens.  
6. Fill in the default filters: **Contract No.**, **Service Item No.**, and **Contract Type**. If needed, you can apply more filters or change the existing ones.  
7. Fill in the fields on the **Options** FastTab, and then choose the **Delete Lines** action.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  If the contract is not detailed, you must update the value in the **Annual Amount** field on the **Invoice Details** FastTab on the **Service Contract** page, reflecting the loss of the service item from the contract.  
>   
>  If the contract is detailed and prepaid, and you have posted invoices for the contract, you can create a credit memo for the contract. Choose the **Create Credit Memo** action. This is unnecessary if the check box in the **Automatic Credit Memos** field on the **Invoice Details** FastTab is selected. In that case, a credit memo is created automatically when you remove a contract line.

## Service Line Cost and Value
On a service contract lines, the amounts in the **Line Cost** and **Line Value** are calculated as described in the following tables.

| Line Cost Options | Description|
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
|**Service item** | The cost is automatically retrieved from the **Default Contract Cost** field in the **Service Item** table and copied into the **Line Cost** field. The following formula is used to calculate the line cost:<br /><br /> Sales Unit Cost × Contract Value % ÷ 100|  
|**Item** | The cost is automatically retrieved from the **Unit Cost** field in the **Item** table and the **Contract Value %** field value in the **Service Mgt. Setup** table. The following formula is used to calculate the line cost:<br /><br /> Unit Cost × Contract Value % ÷ 100|  
|**Text description** | The value in the **Line Cost** field is set to zero.|  

| Line Value Options | Description|
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
|**Service item** | The price is automatically retrieved from the **Default Contract Value** field in the **Service Item** table and copied into the **Line Value** field.|  
|**Item** | Depending on the value in the **Contract Value Calc. Method** field in the **Service Mgt. Setup** table, the amount is retrieved from either the **Unit Price** or the **Unit Cost** field in the **Item** table. After that, this value is multiplied by the contents of the **Contract Value %** field in the **Service Mgt. Setup** table and divided by 100. This amount is copied into the **Line Value** field.<br /><br /> **NOTE:** If the **Contract Value Calc. Method** field is set to **None**, the contents of the **Line Value** field are not calculated.|  
|**Text description** | The contents of the **Line Value** field are set to zero.|  

## To add a contract discount to service contract quotes  
You can add contract discounts on services for contract quotes and service contracts. The discounts can be on spare parts in particular service item groups, on resource hours for resources in particular resource groups, and on particular service costs.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Contract Quotes**, and choose the related link.  
2. Choose the quote to add discounts for.  
3. Choose the **Service Discounts** action. The **Contract/Service Discounts** page opens.  
4. To create a new contract discount, choose the **New** action.  
5. Fill in the fields on the line as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)].  

> [!Tip]  
>  To add contract discounts directly to a service contract, perform similar steps from the **Service Contract** page.  

## To change the owner of a service contract  
You may need to change the owner of a service contract. If a service item in a service contract is registered in noncanceled multiple contracts owned by the same customer, then the owner of all service contracts that include this service item and of all other service items included in these contracts is updated automatically.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  In this case, only noncanceled contracts are considered. The status of the contract quotes is not taken into account.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  Service items and contracts can be related. Changing the owner of a service contract can affect these relationships.  
>   
>  For example, suppose service item No. 8 is included in contracts SC00003 and SC00015. Contract SC00015 also contains service item No. 15, which is also included in the contract SC00080. In this case, the owner for all three contracts and service items will be changed.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Contracts**, and then choose the related link. Open the relevant service contract whose owner you want to change.  
2. Choose the **Open Contract** action to open the contract for editing.  
3. Choose the **Change Customer** action. The **Change Customer in Contract** page opens.  
4. In the **Contract No.** and **Service Item No**. fields you can see the numbers of the contract and service item owned by the selected customer. If the customer owns more than one contract with more than one service item included, then the value of these fields will be **Multiple**. To see the list of related contracts or service items, select these field values.  
5. In the **New Customer No.** field, choose the new customer.  
6. In the **New Ship-to Code** field, choose the address.  
7. Choose the **OK** button to change the customer and ship-to code of the service contracts.  
8. Choose the **Lock Contract** action to lock the contract and to make sure that the changes will be part of the contracts.  

## To update a service contract price  
You can update the prices on service contracts by specifying a price update percentage.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Update Service Contract Prices**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the service contract.  
3. In the **Update to Date** field, enter a date. The batch job will update prices for contracts with next price update dates on or before this date.  
4. In the **Price Update %** field, enter the percentage that you want to update the prices by.  
5. In the **Action** field, select **Update Contract Prices**.  

## To post prepaid contract entries  
If you work with prepaid service contracts, you must regularly post prepaid contract entries, thereby transferring the prepaid payments from the prepaid contract accounts to the regular contract accounts.  

Before you can post prepaid contract entries, you must specify a number series in the **Prepaid Posting Document Nos.** field on the **Service Mgt. Setup** page.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Post Prepaid Contract Entries**, and then choose the related link.  
2. In the **Post until Date** field, enter a date. The batch job posts prepaid service ledger entries with posting dates up to this date.  
4. In the **Posting Date** field, enter the date you want to use as the posting date on the general journal line.  
5. In the **Action** field, choose **Post Prepaid Transactions**.  
6. Choose **OK** to post the entries.

## Changing the Service Contract Status
After the service contract is signed, the **Change Status** field value is automatically set to **Locked**. If you want to modify information in the service contract or service contract quote, first you have to change the status of the contract or contract quote from **Locked** to **Open**. Note that you cannot create service invoices for the service contract with the **Open** change status. After the contract or contract quote is modified, you have to change the status back to **Locked** to make it possible to create service invoices and ledger entries for the service contract, which includes the changes that you made to it.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  The **Change Status** field is not related to the **Release Status** field on the service order header, which governs the warehouse handling of service items.  

## To cancel a service contract  
You may need to cancel a service contract when the contract has expired or has been canceled by you or the customer.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  You cannot reopen a contract after it is canceled.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Contracts**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the relevant service contract to cancel.  
3. Choose the **Open Contract** action to open the service contract for editing.  
4. In the **Cancel Reason Code** field, choose the relevant reason code. To add more reason codes, choose the **Advanced** action.  

     If the check box in the **Use Contract Cancel Reason** field on the **Service Mgt. Setup** page is selected, you must specify a cancel reason code when canceling contracts.  

5. In the **Status** field, choose **Canceled**.  
6. If there are unposted invoices, credit memos, or opened prepaid entries for the contract, a confirmation message will appear. In the message box, choose **No** to return to the contract and post the documents, or **Yes** to continue the cancellation process.  

## Filing a service contract or contract quote  
You can file service contracts and contract quotes at any time to record and archive a copy of the contract or contract quote. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] files service contracts automatically when you convert contract quotes to service contracts or cancel service contracts. You can file a contract or quote yourself by choosing the **File Contract** action in the **Service Contracts** or **Service Contract Quotes** pages. If you want to view your archived contracts of quotes by searching for **Filed Contracts**.

# Create special orders

You can create a special order for a specific catalog item to be shipped to a specific customer. Your vendor ships the item to your warehouse and you can then ship the item on to your customer either independently or together with other items on another order.  

Special orders imply that the purchase and sales order are linked to ensure that the specific catalog item is picked and delivered to the customer.  

Before you can use this feature, you must first set up the customer, vendor, and item cards necessary for the order.  

## To create a special order

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Order**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action. Create and fill in a  sales order for the item. For more information, see [Sell Products](sales-how-sell-products.md).
3.  On the **Lines** FastTab, fill in the sales line. In the **Purchasing Code** field, select a purchasing code that has the **Special Order** field selected.

    You must now create a purchase order from a requisition worksheet.  
4. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Requisition Worksheets**, and then choose the related link.  
5. Choose the **Special Order** action, and then choose the **Get Sales Orders** action.  
6.  On the **Get Sales Orders** page, show results where the **Document No.** is the sales order number. Choose the **OK** button. A requisition worksheet line is created for the item.  
7.  On the requisition worksheet line, in the **Action Message** field, select **New**.  
8.  On the **Requisition Worksheets** page, choose the **Carry Out Action Message** action. The **Carry Out Action Msg. - Req.** page opens. Choose the **OK** button.  

    A message appears telling you that the purchase orders have been created. Choose the **OK** button.  

A purchase order created as a special order for a sales order is respected by the planning system as it balances demand and supply. That is, the purchase order (supply) remains linked to the sales order (demand), even if that purchase order could supply another earlier demand. For more information, see [Design Details: Reordering Policies](design-details-reservation-order-tracking-and-action-messaging.md).  

> [!NOTE]  
>  You cannot use the special order functionality if the item is already reserved. Therefore, for items that are sold on special orders, make sure the **Reserve** field on the item card is not set to **Always**.

# Invoice projects

During a project, costs from resource usage, materials, and project-related purchases can accumulate. As the project progresses, these transactions get posted to the project journal. It's important to record all costs in the project journal before you invoice the customer. You can invoice customers after the project is finished, or at certain intervals based on an invoicing schedule.

You can invoice:

* Multiple projects using a **Project Create Sales Invoice** task.
* Whole projects, projects within a project, or individual project planning lines using the relevant action in the project pages.
* Combine multiple project planning lines from different projects into a single sales invoice using **Get Project Planning Lines** action on the **Sales Invoice** page.

## To create multiple project sales invoices

You can create an invoice for a project or for one or more project tasks:

* When the work to invoice is complete.
* When you reach the date for invoicing set on an invoicing schedule.

The following procedure shows how to use a batch job to invoice multiple projects.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Project Create Sales Invoice**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
3. Set filters to specify the projects to invoice.
4. Choose the **OK** button to create the invoices.  

You can review and post created invoices on the **Sales Invoices** page.

> [!NOTE]
> Alternatively, invoice a customer by selecting the project, and then choosing the **Create Project Sales Invoice** action, or use the **Create Sales Invoice** action in the project tasks.

## To create and post project sales invoice from project planning lines

You can create an invoice from a project planning lines, and specify the quantity of the item, resource, or general ledger account.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Projects**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open a relevant project.
3. Select a project task for which the **Project Task Type** field contains **Posting**, and then choose the **Project Planning Lines** action.  
4. On a project planning line, in the **Qty. To Transfer to Invoice** field, enter the quantity of the item, resource, general ledger account type that you want to invoice.  
5. Choose the **Create Sales Invoice** action.
6. On the **Project Transfer to Sales Invoice** page, enter the posting date and whether you want to create a new invoice or append this invoice to an existing one.
7. Choose the **OK** button.  
8. On the **Project Planning Lines** page, choose the **Sales Invoices/Credit Memos** action.

    The **Sales Invoice** page opens, showing the quantity that you transferred to the invoice.
9. Make any other changes, and then choose the **Post** action.

> [!NOTE]  
> The procedure is similar for creating, reviewing, and posting a project-related sales credit memo.

## Invoice one customer for multiple project tasks

You can simplify your invoicing process by sending one invoice to a customer for multiple projects. Add project planning lines from multiple projects to a sales invoice in one go. This process is similar to creating a sales invoice from a project planning line and entering a value in the **Append to Sales Invoice No.** field.

Here's an overview of the process.

1. Create a new sales invoice, and fill in the **Sell-to Customer No.** field. If needed, also fill in the **Bill-to Customer No.** and **Currency Code** fields.
2. On the **Lines** FastTab, choose the **Get Project Planning Lines** action. The **Get Project Planning Lines** page shows billable project planning lines from projects for the sell-to customer, bill-to customer, and invoicing currency where the quantity to invoice is more than zero. 
3. Choose the lines you want to add to the invoice, and then choose **OK**.

Repeat these steps if you want to add another set of project planning lines. You can also delete the invoice or its lines and start over.

> [!NOTE]
> There are a couple of limitations:
>
> * The **Get Project Planning Lines** action isn't available on sales orders or sales quotes.
> * You can't filter on the **Ship-to Code** or **Contact No.** fields.

## Issue a credit memo for a project

When a credit is due to a customer for something you invoiced for a project, you can create a credit memo to reimburse them. You can issue a credit memo for job planning lines of the types **Billable** or **Both Budget and Billable**. This credit memo ensures that job planning always reflects the correct planned invoice/credit memo lines for the project before you post sales invoices and credit memos. To learn more about sales credit memos, go to [Process sales returns or cancellations](sales-how-process-sales-returns-cancellations.md).

To issue a credit memo for a planning line, follow these steps:

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Projects**, and then choose the related link.
1. Open the project you want to issue a credit memo for.
1. If the **Blocked** field is filled in, clear the field so that you can work with the project.
1. In the **Status** field, change the status from **Completed** to **Open**.
1. Choose the **Project Planning Lines** action.
1. Create a new planning line, and enter the same information as the line you want to credit. However, in the **Quantity** field, enter the same quantity but as a negative value. For example, if the quantity you want to credit is 10, enter a quantity of -10.
1. Choose the **Create Sales Credit Memo** action.
1. On the **Project Transfer to Credit Memo** page, fill in the fields as necessary, and then choose **OK**.
1. To review and post the credit memo, on the **Project Planning Lines** page, choose the **Sales invoices/credit memos** action.
1. On the **Sales Credit Memo** page, review the details. If it looks good, post the memo.

# Design Details: Cost Components
Cost components are different types of costs that make up the value of an inventory increase or decrease.  

 The following table shows the different cost components and any subordinate cost components that they consist of.  

|Cost Component|Subordinate Cost Component|Description|  
|--------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
|Direct cost|Unit cost (direct purchase price)|Cost that can be traced to a cost object.|  
|Direct cost|Freight cost (item charge)|Cost that can be traced to a cost object.|  
|Direct cost|Insurance cost (item charge)|Cost that can be traced to a cost object.|  
|Indirect cost||Cost that cannot be traced to a cost object.|  
|Variance|Purchase variance|The difference between actual and standard costs, which is only posted for items using the **Standard** costing method.|  
|Variance|Material variance|The difference between actual and standard costs, which is only posted for items using the **Standard** costing method.|  
|Variance|Capacity variance|The difference between actual and standard costs, which is only posted for items using the **Standard** costing method.|  
|Variance|Subcontracted variance|The difference between actual and standard costs, which is only posted for items using the **Standard** costing method.|  
|Variance|Capacity overhead variance|The difference between actual and standard costs, which is only posted for items using the **Standard** costing method.|  
|Variance|Manufacturing overhead variance|The difference between actual and standard costs, which is only posted for items using the **Standard** costing method.|  
|Revaluation||A depreciation or appreciation of the current inventory value.|  
|Rounding||Residuals caused by the way in which valuation of inventory decreases are calculated.|  

> [!NOTE]  
>  Freight and insurance costs are item charges that can be added to an item’s cost at any time. When you run the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job, the value of any related inventory decreases are updated accordingly.

# Block customers
You can block a customer, for example because of insolvency, so that the customer can't be added to sales documents or so that no transactions can be posted for the customer.

In addition to blocking a customer, you can set receivable transactions for the customer to be on hold in connection with reminders. For more information, see [Collect Outstanding Balances](receivables-collect-outstanding-balances.md).   

The following table describes the options for blocking customers.  

|Option|Description|  
|--------------------|------------|  
|**Blank**|Transactions are allowed for this customer.|
|**Ship**|New orders and new shipments can't be created for this customer. Existing shipments not yet invoiced can be invoiced.|  
|**Invoice**|New orders, new shipments, and new invoices can't be created for this customer. Existing shipments not yet invoiced can't be invoiced. You can still send reminders and finance charge memos to the customer.|  
|**All**|No transaction is allowed for this customer, including payments.|  

## To block a customer  
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customers**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select a customer, and then choose the **Edit** action.
3. In the **Blocked** field, choose what to block, as described in the table above.

# View and edit in Excel from Business Central

With pages that display a list of records in rows and columns, such as a list of customers, sale orders, or invoices, you can export the list to Microsoft Excel and view it there. Depending on the page, you have two options for viewing in Excel. Both are available from the **Share** icon ![Share a page in another app.](media/share-icon.png) at the top of a page. You can either select the **Open in Excel** action or the **Edit in Excel** action on the page. This article explains the two actions.

## Open in Excel

With the **Open in Excel** action, you can make changes to the records in Excel, but you can't publish the changes back to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. You can only save the changes to the Excel file, without affecting data in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

- Excel respects filters on the page that limit the records shown. The Excel workbook has the same rows and columns that appear on the page in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].
- This action works on both Windows and macOS.
- [!INCLUDE[open-edit-excel](includes/open-and-edit-excel.md)]

<!-- 
> [!IMPORTANT]
> For [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, the **Open in Excel** action is available by default. However, if you set up [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises for editing data in Excel, then the **Open in Excel** action is replaced by the **Edit in Excel** action.-->

[!INCLUDE [send-report-excel](includes/send-report-excel.md)] 

> [!NOTE]
> In Excel, whole numbers in columns will have a decimal symbol at the end (like a period `.` or comma `,`) even though the decimal symbol isn't shown in Business Central. The decimal symbol depends on your device's region settings. For example, `10` in Business Central could appear as `10.` or `10,` in Excel. You can change the format in Excel by selecting the values, then selecting <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>1</kbd>. To learn more about changing the number format in Excel, go to [Format numbers](https://support.microsoft.com/office/format-numbers-f27f865b-2dc5-4970-b289-5286be8b994a).

## Edit in Excel

The **Edit in Excel** action is available on most lists, but not all. With the **Edit in Excel** action, you make changes to records in Excel and then publish the changes back to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. When Excel opens, the **Excel Add-in** pane displays.

- With this action, Excel respects most filters on the page that limit the records shown, so the Excel workbook has almost the same records and columns.
- To get the latest data from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], choose **Refresh** in the Excel Add-in pane.
- [!INCLUDE[open-edit-excel](includes/open-and-edit-excel.md)]

### First-time sign-in

The **Edit in Excel** action requires that the Business Central add-in is installed in Excel. In some cases, your administrator might set up the add-in to install automatically for you. In this case, you just have to sign in to Business Central in the **Excel Add-in** pane with your user name and password. Otherwise, the **New Office Add-in** pane opens. To install the add-in, choose **Trust this add-in**, which installs the add-in directly from the Office Store.

If the add-in doesn't install, either contact your admin or try to install it manually. For more information, see [Install the add-in manually for your own use](admin-deploy-excel-addin.md#install).

### Work across environments and companies

You can switch the company that you're working with. To switch a company, select the **Options** icon ![Excel add-in options.](media/cogwheel.png "Excel add-in options") in the Excel Add-in pane, then select the company from the **Company** field.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When changing the company, make sure that the **Environment** field is not empty. If it is, then set it to one of the available options; otherwise, the add-in will not work correctly.  

If you make changes to the add-in, you must reload it to update the connection. To reload, use the ![Excel add-in menu](media/excel-addin-menu.png "Excel add-in menu") menu in the upper-right corner of the add-in. If you can't load the add-in, talk to your administrator. If you're the administrator, see [Get the Business Central add-in for Excel](admin-deploy-excel-addin.md).

> [!NOTE]
> The add-in works with Excel for the web (online) from any device as long as you use a supported browser. It also works with the Excel app for Windows (PC), but not for macOS.
>
> For [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, the **Edit in Excel** action is only available if the Excel add-in has been configured by your administrator, and only available for the web client. For administrators, if you want to learn how to install the Excel add-in, see [Setting up the Business Central add-in for Excel in Business Central on-premises](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/configuring-excel-addin).

### Limits when using Excel for the web

When **Edit in Excel** is used on list pages for tables with many columns, the resulting workbook might have too many columns for the file to be viewed in Excel for the web. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically limits the exported workbook to 100 columns when OneDrive is configured for system features.

# Connect E-Documents to external access points

[!INCLUDE [e-documents connectors](includes/edocuments-connectors-include.md)]

You can use E-Documents in Business Central to send and receive electronic documents with your business partners. To receive documents, you need to connect E-Documents to an external access point that handles the communication and validation of the documents. 

 > [!NOTE]
 > These connections require communication with external service providers who might be subject to additional payment and require contracts with them. To obtain all the necessary credentials, contact the service providers.

The steps to connect E-Documents to an external access point depend on the type of connector you choose.    

> [!NOTE]
> Ask your service provider for all the necessary details to establish a connection with their access point that follows.  

## Pagero service

1. On the **E-Document External Connection Setup** page, select the **Open OAuth 2.0 setup** action to open the **OAuth 2.0 Setup** page.  
2. On the **OAuth 2.0 setup** page, select the **Request Authorization Code** action. You're redirected to the external service authorization webpage and prompted for your sign-in details.
3. Copy the authorization code into the **Enter Authorization Code** field.  
4. Select **Refresh Access Token** to make sure that you can refresh the token. 
5. On the **E-Document External Connection Setup** page, fill in the following fields:

    | Field name | Description |
    |---|---|
    | FileAPI URL | Specify the file API URL. |
    | Fileparts URL | Specify the fileparts URL. |
    | DocumentAPI URL | Specify the document API URL. |
    | Company ID | Specify the company ID. |
    | Send Mode | Specify the send mode. You can select **Production**, **Test**, or **Certification**. |

6. Continue with the [nonservice provider setup steps](finance-how-setup-edocuments-external.md).  

## Avalara service

> [!NOTE]
> The Avalara connector in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is available from version 25.1

1. On the **Avalara Connection Setup** page, enter the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** fields. In the **Send Mode** field, choose the **Production**, **Test**, or **Certification** option, based on your plans. 
2. Select the **Select Avalara Company Id** action, and choose the right company. Make sure you enter values into the **Company Name** and **Company ID** fields.  
3. Select the **Select Avalara Mandate** action, and select the right **E-Document Service**, and then pick appropriate **Country Mandate** code on the **Avalara Mandate List** page. 
4. Navigate back to the **E-Document Service** page, and validate that the **Avalara Mandate** field in the **Avalara** FastTab is set with the value you chose. 
5. Continue with the [non-service provider setup steps](finance-how-setup-edocuments-external.md).

## Available service providers

At this moment, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports Pagero and Avalara access points for e-documents, but more access points are in the process of development. This page is updated with the parameters for new connectors when they're ready. You can also find more connectors on AppSource.

> [!NOTE]
> This page doesn't show how to connect with the local service providers. If [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] support some of them, it will be explained in the country-specific documentation.  

Microsoft doesn't have a contractual obligation with Pagero and Avalara. That means, if you want to use their connectors, you must have a contract with them.

# Current Utilization (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Current Utilization** report provides insights into the manufacturing capacity use and helps with capacity planning. It shows the capacity available and used by hours and the percentage of use.

:::image type="content" source="media/manufacturing/current-utilization.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Current Utilization Power BI Report" lightbox="media/manufacturing/current-utilization.png":::

## Use the report

The report is meant for business leaders and manufacturing teams.

COOs use the report to monitor the percentage of use of resources on production lines and ensure efficient allocation. You can analyze the capacity utilization gauges to track the current week's utilization percentage. The analysis can help you make necessary adjustments to meet production deadlines. The report also helps you track the expected capacity need percentage to keep the utilization rate above the required threshold.

Manufacturing managers use the report to understand the capacity of machine and work centers. The report provides insights into the capacity used by hour, allowing you to optimize the use of your machine and work centers. You can use the gauges to track today's utilization percentage and the current week's utilization percentage, and adjust the production schedules accordingly. The report helps you ensure that you complete production orders on time by keeping the utilization rate above the required threshold.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The *Current Utilization* report includes the following KPIs and measures: 

- [Capacity Used (Hours)](manufacturing-powerbi-kpis.md#capacity-used-hours)
- [Utilization %](manufacturing-powerbi-kpis.md#utilization)

[!INCLUDE[click-on-a-kpi-link](includes/click-on-a-kpi-link.md)] 

[!INCLUDE[powerbi-tip-track-kpis](includes/powerbi-tip-track-kpis.md)]

## Data used in the report

The report uses data from the following tables in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]:

# Incoming documents

External business documents can come into your company as an email attachment or a paper copy that you scan to file. This scenario is typical of purchases, where such incoming document files represent payment receipts for expenses or small purchases.

On the **Incoming Documents** page, you can use different functions to review expense receipts, manage OCR tasks, and convert incoming document files, manually or automatically, to the relevant documents or journal lines. The external files can be attached at any process stage, including to posted documents and to the resulting vendor, customer, and general ledger entries.

## Usage scenario

You can register files or paper copies received from your trading partners in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and create a document record. For example, a purchase or sales invoice, credit memo or a journal line.

Upload the received files, or use your device's camera to take a photo, and create entries to represent the external documents. Optionally, with PDF or image files, you can have an external optical character recognition (OCR) service generate electronic documents that can then be converted to records inside [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

> [!NOTE]
> The OCR feature is provided by external providers. Choose a service package that is appropriate for your organization and/or country/region. Find services compatible with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and details on available features at [AppSource.microsoft.com](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2081646).

For example, when you receive an invoice in PDF format from your vendor, you can send it to the OCR service from the **Incoming Documents** page. Alternatively, some OCR providers offer the option of processing files forwarded to a dedicated email address, which then automatically creates a related incoming document record. After some seconds, you receive the file back from the OCR service as an electronic invoice that can be converted to a purchase invoice for the vendor.

> [!TIP]
> Create incoming document records in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] directly from emails sent by vendors using the Outlook add-in. To learn more, go to [Use Business Central as your Business Inbox in Outlook](work-outlook-addin.md).

## Incoming document features

The incoming document process can consist of the following main activities:

* Record the external documents in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] by creating lines on the **Incoming Documents** page in the following ways:
  * Manually, either from a PC or from a mobile device, in one of the following ways:
    * Use the **Create from File** button, upload a file, and then fill the relevant fields on the **Incoming Document** page.
    * Use the **New** button, fill the relevant fields on the **Incoming Document** page and manually attach the related file.
    * From a tablet or phone, use the **Create from Camera** button to create a new incoming document record using the device's built-in camera.

      > [!NOTE]
      > To use a mobile phone, you must install the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] mobile app. The app is available on the App Store and on Google Play. To learn more, go to [Getting Business Central on your mobile device](install-mobile-app.md).

  * Automatically, by receiving the document from the OCR service as an electronic document after you've uploaded or emailed the related PDF or image file to an OCR service. The **Financial Information** FastTab is automatically filled on the **Incoming Document** page.
* Use an external OCR service to have PDF or image files turned into electronic documents that can be converted to document records in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].
* Create new documents or general journal lines for incoming document records by entering the information as you read it from incoming document files.
* Attach incoming document files to purchase and sales documents of any status, including to the vendor, customer, and general ledger entries that result from posting.
* View incoming document records and their attachments from any purchase and sales document or entry, or find all general ledger entries without incoming document records from the **Chart of Accounts** page.

> [!NOTE]
> Files attached to cards and documents on the **Attachments** tab aren't included on the **Incoming Documents** page. To learn more, go to [Manage Attachments, Links, and Notes on Cards and Documents](ui-how-add-link-to-record.md).

[!INCLUDE [about-ui-learn](includes/about-ui-learn.md)]

## <a name="Navigation"></a> Navigation
  
You can use different combinations of the Tab, Shift, and arrow keys of your keyboard to move between elements on a page. Elements include actions, fields and columns, parts, and other controls. In general, select <kbd>Tab</kbd> or <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd> to move to the next or previous element.

When you focus on an area that contains actions, like the navigation bar on the top of role center or action bar on other pages, use the arrows keys to move through the different actions and groups. Select <kbd>Enter</kbd> on a group to open its underlying actions, and then continue using the arrows keys. Select <kbd>Tab</kbd> or <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd> to move out of the action area.

By using the tab order, you can also switch between the main browser page and dialog boxes that request confirmation, for example, or the sign-in page.  

## <a name="Headings"></a> Headings in Content

The HTML source for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] content uses tags to help users of assistive technology to understand the structure and content of the page. For example, on list pages, the columns are defined in TH tags and the column headings are set with TITLE attribute inside the tag. Captions for elements, such as FastTabs, FactBoxes, and fields are included in heading tags (H1, H2, H3, and H4).  

## <a name="Images"></a> Image and Links

A descriptive text for images is set with the ALT attribute inside the IMG tag. A descriptive text for hyperlinks is set with the title attribute inside the A tag.  

## <a name="AssistiveTech"></a> Assistive Technologies

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports various assistive technologies, such as high contrast, screen readers, and voice recognition software. Some assistive technologies may not work well with certain elements in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] pages.  

## <a name="zoom"></a> Zoom

Most browsers use standard keyboard shortcuts to zoom in and out on the current page. These keyboard shortcuts aren't specific to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], but they work when you use [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in a browser. For a list of supported keyboard shortcuts, see [Keyboard Shortcuts for Zooming In and Out](keyboard-shortcuts.md#zoomshortcuts).

## Tooltips

Tooltips are available on most elements in the user interface, like page fields and columns, actions, cues tiles, and charts. A tooltip provides extra text that explains an element to help you better understand its purpose. 

Tooltips are accessed in different ways, depending on the client (web or mobile) and the device that you're working with. Use the following table as a guide. Some tooltips can be read by screen-readers. In this case, you access the tooltips as described in the table, then use the screen reader to navigate to the tooltip as you would with any other element.

#### Accessing tooltips

|Element|Mouse action for web client|Keyboard shortcut for web client|Touch gesture on tablet/phone for mobile app|Screen reader support|

title: Design Details - Item Tracking Posting Structure
description: Learn how to use item ledger entries as the primary carrier of item tracking numbers in the Item Tracking Posting Structure.

# Design Details: Item Tracking Posting Structure
To align with inventory costing functionality and to obtain a simpler and more robust solution, item ledger entries are used as the primary carrier of item tracking numbers.  
  
Item tracking numbers on order network entities and non-order network entities are specified in the **Reservation Entry** table (T337). Item tracking numbers that are related to historical information are retrieved directly from the item ledger entries that are related to the transaction in question. This means that item ledger entries reflect the item tracking specification of the posted order line.  
  
The **Item Tracking Lines** page retrieves the information from T337 and the item ledger entries and shows it through the temporary table, **Tracking Specification** (T336). T336 also hold the temporary data in the **Item Tracking Lines page** for item tracking quantities that remain to be invoiced.  
  
## One-to-Many Relation  
The **Item Entry Relation** table, which is used to link a posted document line with its related item ledger entries, consists of two main parts:  
  
* A pointer to the posted document line, the **Order Line No.** field.  
* An entry number pointing to an item ledger entry, the **Item Entry No.** field.  
  
The functionality of the existing **Entry No.** field, which relates an item ledger entry to a posted document line, handles the typical one-to-one relation when no item tracking numbers exist on the posted document line. If item tracking numbers exist, then the **Entry No.** field is left blank, and the one-to-many relation is handled by the **Item Entry Relation** table. If the posted document line carries item tracking numbers but only relates to a single item ledger entry, then the **Entry No.** field handles the relation, and the no record is created in the **Item Entry Relation** table.  
  
## Codeunits 80 (Sales-Post)  and 90 (Purch-Post)
To split the item ledger entries during posting, the code in codeunit 80 and codeunit 90, is encircled by loops that run through global temporary record variables. This code calls codeunit 22 with an item journal line. These variables are initialized when item tracking numbers exist for the document line. To keep the code simple, this looping structure is always used. If no item tracking numbers exist for the document line, then a single record is inserted, and the loop runs only once.  
  
## Posting the Item Journal  
Item tracking numbers are transferred via the reservation entries that relate to the item ledger entry, and the looping through item tracking numbers occurs in codeunit 22  (Item Jnl.-Post Line). This concept works in the same way when an item journal line is used indirectly to post a sale or purchase order as when an item journal line is used directly. When the item journal is used directly, the **Source Row ID** field points to the item journal line itself.  
  
## Code Unit 22  (Item Jnl.-Post Line)
Codeunits 80 (Sales-Post)  and 90 (Purch-Post) loop the call of codeunit 22 (Item Jnl.-Post Line) during the invoice posting of item tracking numbers and during the invoicing of existing shipments or receipts.  
  
During quantity posting of item tracking numbers, codeunit 22 (Item Jnl.-Post Line) retrieves item tracking numbers from the entries in T337 (Reservation Entry) that relate to the posting. These entries are placed directly on the item journal line.  
  
Codeunit 22 (Item Jnl.-Post Line) loops through the item tracking numbers and splits the posting into the respective item ledger entries that carry the item tracking numbers. Information about which item ledger entries are created is returned to T337(Reservation Entry)by using a temporary T336 record, which is called by a procedure in codeunit 22. This procedure is triggered when codeunit 22 has finished its run because at that point, the codeunit 22 object contains the information. When the temporary T336 record is retrieved, Codeunits 80 (Sales-Post)  and 90 (Purch-Post) create records in the **Item Entry Relation** table to link the created item ledger entries to the created shipment or receipt line. Codeunits 80 (Sales-Post)  and 90 (Purch-Post) then converts the temporary T336 (Tracking Specification) records to real T336 (Tracking Specification) records that are related to the line in question. However, this conversion occurs only if the posted document line is not deleted, because it is only partially posted.

# Create routings

Manufacturing companies use routings to visualize and direct the manufacturing process.

The routing is the basis of process scheduling, capacity scheduling, scheduled assignment of material needs, and manufacturing documents.  

As for production bills of material (BOMs), the routings are assigned to the manufacturing end item. A routing holds master data that captures the process requirements of a given produced item. After a production order is created for an item, its routing governs the scheduling of operations as represented on the **Prod. Order Routing** page under the production order.  

Before you can set up a routing, the following setups must be in place:  

- Item cards are created for parent items that take part in manufacturing. To learn more, go to [Register New Items](inventory-how-register-new-items.md).
- Production resources are set up. To learn more, go to [Set Up Work Centers and Machine Centers](production-how-to-set-up-work-and-machine-centers.md).

## To create a routing

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Routings**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
4. In the **Type** field, select one of the following options:
   - **Serial** to calculate the production routing according to the value in the **Operation No.** field.  
   - Select **Parallel** to calculate the operations according to the value in the **Next Operation No.** field.  
5. To edit the routing, set the **Status** field to **New** or **Under Development**.  

    Proceed to fill in the routing lines.
6. In the **Operation No.** field, enter the number of the first operation, for example,  **10**.  
7. In the **Type** field, specify which kind of resource is used, for example, **Work Center**.  
8. In the **No.** field, select the resource to be used, or type it in the field.  
9. In the **Routing Link Code** field, enter a code to connect the component to a specific operation. For more information, see [To create routing links](production-how-to-create-routings.md#to-create-routing-links).
10. In the **Run Time** and **Setup Time** fields, enter the process times needed to perform the operation.

     > [!NOTE]
     > Setup time is calculated per production order, whereas run time is calculated per produced item.  

11. In the **Concurrent Capacities** field, specify how many units of the selected resource are used to perform the operation. For example, allocating two people to one packing operation halves the run time.  
12. Continue to fill in lines for all operations involved in producing the item in question.  
13. To copy lines from an existing routing, choose the **Copy Routing** action to select existing lines.  
14. To activate the routing, in the **Status** field, choose **Certified**.  
15. You can now attach the new routing to the card of the production item in question, by filling in the **Routing No.** field. To learn more, go to [Register New Items](inventory-how-register-new-items.md).  

> [!NOTE]  
> Remember to recalculate the item's standard cost from the **Item** card. Choose the **Production** action, the **Calc. Production Std. Cost** action, and then choose the **All Levels** action.  You can also calculate and update the standard cost for one or many items on the **Standard Cost Worksheet** page. Learn more at [Update Standard Costs](finance-about-calculating-standard-cost.md#updating-standard-costs-with-standard-cost-worksheet).  


## To create routing links

You can create routing links to connect components to specific operations to retain their relationship even though the production BOM or routing is modified. Routing links also facilitate just-in-time flushing of components, namely when the specific linked operation starts, not when the complete production order is released. To learn more, go to [Flush Components According to Operation Output](production-how-to-flush-components-according-to-operation-output.md).  

Another important benefit is that linked components and operations display in a logical process structure when you use the **Production Journal** page to post output and consumption.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Routings**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the routing that contains the operations that you want to link.  

    Make sure the routing status is **Under Development**.  

3. On the relevant routing line, in the **Routing Link Code** field, select a code.  
4. Add different routing link codes to other operations in the routing, if relevant.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > You shouldn't use the same routing link code in different operations on a routing because you might incorrectly link a component to two different operations, so that it is consumed two times.  
    >
    > It's a good idea to name the routing link code after the operation to ensure operation-specific routing links.

5. Set the routing status to **Certified**.  

    Routing link codes are now assigned to operations. Next, you must create the actual link by assigning the same codes to specific components in the relevant production BOM.  

6. Open the **Production BOM** that contains the components that you want to link to the above operations. To learn more, go to [Create Production BOMs](production-how-to-create-production-boms.md).
7. Make sure the BOM status is **Under Development**.  
8. On the relevant production BOM line, in the **Routing Link Code** field, select the code that you assigned to the operation.  
9. Proceed to add routing link codes to other components according to the unique operations where they're used.  
10. Set the production BOM status to **Certified**.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > To enable the routing links on an existing production order, you must refresh the production order. To learn more, go to [Create Production Orders](production-how-to-create-production-orders.md).  

The selected components are now linked to the selected operations when you create or refresh a production order using the production BOM and routing. This link is visible on the **Prod. Order Components** page under the production order. You can remove and add the routing link codes at any time.

## To assign personnel, tools, and quality measures to routing operations

If you require personnel with qualifications, special knowledge, or special authorization for an operation, you can assign these personnel to the operation. In addition, you can assign tools and quality requirements to the operation. This procedure describes how to assign personnel. The steps are similar for other types of operation information.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Routings**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the relevant routing.  
3. On the **Lines** FastTab, select the line that you want to process, choose the **Operations** action, and then choose the **Personnel** action.  
4. Fill in the fields on the **Routing Personnel** page.  
5. Choose the **OK** button to exit the page. The entered values are copied and assigned to the operation.  

## To create a new version of a routing

The version principle enables you to manage several versions of a routing. The structure of the routing version corresponds to the structure of the routing consisting of the routing version header and the routing version lines. The starting date defines the basic difference.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Routings**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the routing to copy, and then choose the **Versions** action.  
3. On the **Routing Versions** page, choose the **New** action.
4. In the **Version Code** field, enter the unique identification of the version. You can use any combination of numbers and letters.  

    The newly created version is automatically assigned the status **New**.  
5. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](../archive/SetupAndAdministration/includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
6. To create operation lines, select the first blank line, and then fill in the **Operation No.** field according to the sequence of operations.

    The operation lines are in ascending order by operation numbers. To be able to make changes later, we recommend that you select adequate step widths. The **Next Operation No.** field refers to the next operation in the routing.

7. When you're done setting up the routing version, in the **Status** field, choose **Certified**.

# Setting up finance

Before you can begin to run your business, you must specify how you want to manage company finance processes. First, you set up the core of the company's accounting records: the chart of accounts (COA). Then you set up posting groups, which make the process of assigning default general ledger posting accounts to customers, vendors, and items more efficient.

Some finance setup can be done automatically with assisted setup guides, and some must be done manually. Learn more at [Getting Ready for Doing Business](ui-get-ready-business.md). The **General Ledger Setup** page specifies how to handle of your company's different accounting processes. For example, use this page to specify invoice rounding details, the currency code for your local currency, address formats, and whether you want to use an additional reporting currency. Learn more at [Understanding the General Ledger and the Chart of Accounts](finance-general-ledger.md).  

You can use dimensions to add different types of information to every transaction. You can set up your company's basic dimensions, such as *Projects* and *Departments*. Later, add more dimensions when you need them. For example, you can set up temporary dimensions to use for a limited time period, such during a sales campaign. Learn more at [Working with Dimensions](finance-dimensions.md).

Many of the setup tasks must be completed before you can begin recording financial transactions, but most settings can be adjusted as needed. That said, there are optional setup tasks as well. For example, you need only set up intercompany postings and consolidations if you are working with multiple companies.

# Upgrading an Integration with Dynamics 365 Sales
[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] integrates with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)], which makes it easy to connect and synchronize data with other Dynamics 365 applications, such as [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)], or even apps that you build yourself. If you are integrating for the first time, we recommend that you do so through [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)]. For more information, see [Integration with Dataverse](admin-common-data-service.md).

If you have already integrated [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can continue to synchronize data using your setup. However, if you upgrade [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], or turn off your [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] integration, to turn it on again you must connect through [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)]. 

> [!NOTE]
> Reconnecting through [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] will apply default synchronization settings, and will overwrite any configurations you have. For example, the default table mappings will be applied.

## To upgrade your connection to use Dataverse
1. Open the **Microsoft Dynamics 365 Connection Setup** page, and then turn off the **Enabled** toggle. Then close the page to disconnect from [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)].
2. Open the **Dataverse Connection Setup** page, and in the **Ownership Model** field, choose **Person**. Then choose the **Enabled** toggle to turn on the connection to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)].
  
   > [!NOTE]
   > After you enable the connection, the Business Central Integration Solution is deployed to Dataverse.
4. On the **Microsoft Dynamics 365 Connection Setup** page, choose **Redeploy Integration Solution** to reinstall the Business Central Integration Solution.
5. Turn on the **Enabled** toggle to reconnect to [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)].
  
   > [!NOTE]
   > After you enable the connection, the Business Central Integration Solution is deployed to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. This enables integration with tables that are specific to [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)], such as sales orders, quotes, and invoices.
6. On the **Sales Connection Setup** page, choose **Use Default Synchronization Setup** to initialize the integration table mappings for [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)].

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > Using the **Use Default Synchronization Setup** action will apply the default integration table mappings. All custom mappings will be overwritten. If you have custom mappings that you want to keep, we recommend that you export them to Excel or talk to your Microsoft partner about other ways to keep your custom mappings.

# Liquidity (Power BI report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The Liquidity Report is designed to help you evaluate your company's short-term financial health by focusing on three key performance indicators: Current Ratio, Quick Ratio, and Cash Ratio. These ratios, along with their supporting details, allow you to assess your ability to meet current liabilities.

:::image type="content" source="media/finance/liquidity-report.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Liquidity report" lightbox="media/finance/liquidity-report.png":::

## Use the report

The audiences for the report are:

- Executives
- Directors
- Other high-level decision makers

Executives use the report to analyze the company's financial stability and help ensure there's sufficient cash flow for ongoing operations. For a broad perspective of liquidity, you could assess the current ratio. The current ratio compares current assets to current liabilities. This helps assess day-to day operational stability.

For a more conservative assessment, you can analyze the quick ratio, which removes inventory and purchase prepayments from the equation. This ratio focuses on cash and assets that you can quickly convert to cash, such as accounts receivable.  

Finally, you could review the cash ratio, which focuses on liquid assets to meet financial obligations. This perspective is the most conservative, and focuses on cash and cash equivalents to meet current liabilities.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The *Liquidity* report includes the following KPIs and measures: 

- [**Current Ratio**](finance-powerbi-kpis.md#current-ratio)
- [**Quick Ratio**](finance-powerbi-kpis.md#quick-ratio)
- [**Cash Ratio**](finance-powerbi-kpis.md#cash-ratio)
- [**Current Assets**](finance-powerbi-kpis.md#current-assets)
- [**Current Liabilities**](finance-powerbi-kpis.md#current-liabilities)
- [**Inventory**](finance-powerbi-kpis.md#inventory)
- [**Purchase Prepayments**](finance-powerbi-kpis.md#purchase-prepayments)
- [**Liquid Assets**](finance-powerbi-kpis.md#liquid-assets)

[!INCLUDE[click-on-a-kpi-link](includes/click-on-a-kpi-link.md)] 

[!INCLUDE[powerbi-tip-track-kpis](includes/powerbi-tip-track-kpis.md)]

# Manage project supplies

You should manage project supplies of items, services, and expenses as an integral part of all projects. You can use inventory quantities or make project-specific purchases through purchase orders or purchase invoices. For example, when service on a computer requires a new disk, you create a purchase invoice to buy a new disk and record the project that uses it.

If the purchase process doesn't require you to record the physical transaction separately, you can process a purchase on the **Project G/L Journal** page. For more information, see [To post a project-related expense](projects-how-manage-project-supplies.md#to-post-a-project-related-expense).

## Manual or semi-automated replenishment

If you already know which supplies you need to replenish for a project, you can create a purchase order. To learn more, go to [Manual or semi-automated replenishment](#manual-or-semi-automated-replenishment).

However, if you aren't sure what you're missing, you can use a semi-automated process where you create a purchase order directly from a project. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] helps by listing all items and shows whether they're available or unavailable. You can adjust the quantities to replenish on the lines.  

The semi-automated process creates a purchase order for each vendor from which you purchase the items, including any quantity changes that you made on the **Create Purchase Orders** page. You can continue to process the purchase order or orders, for example, by editing or adding purchase order lines.

Later, you can review the purchase lines linked to the project either from the **Project Card** page or **Project Planning Lines** by choosing the **Purchase Lines** action. To learn more, go to [Use a semi-automated replenishment process for a project](#use-a-semi-automated-replenishment-process-for-a-project).

> [!NOTE]
> As in other cases that involve advanced inventory processes, such as reservation, warehousing, and assemble-to-order, the project's status must be **Open** and the **Apply Usage Link** toggle must be turned on.

### Use a semi-automated replenishment process for a project

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Projects**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open a project that you want to purchase items for.
3. Choose the **Create Purchase Orders** action.
4. The **Create Purchase Orders** page shows a line for each item on the project. Lines for both fully available quantities and unavailable quantities show by default. To show only unavailable quantities, choose the **Show Unavailable** action.
5. The **Quantity to Purchase** field contains the unavailable quantity. To purchase a different quantity, edit the value in the field.

   > [!NOTE]
   > You can also change the **Quantity to Purchase** field on unavailable lines, even though they represent fully available quantities.

6. You can also turn on the **Reserve** toggle if you want to reserve the quantity on the purchase line against a demand instead of filling out the **Project No.** and **Project Task NO.** fields on the purchase line. By default, the **Reserve** toggle is hidden on the page. You can personalize the page to add the toggle. To learn more, go to [Personalize your workspace](ui-personalization-user.md).
7. Select **OK**.

You can review the purchase lines linked to the project either from the **Project Card** page or **Project Planning Lines** by choosing the **Purchase Lines** action.

### Replenish a project manually

The following procedure shows how to use a purchase invoice to purchase products for a project. The same steps apply when using a purchase order.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Order**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action and fill in the fields as necessary. For more information, see [Record Purchases](purchasing-how-record-purchases.md).
3. In the **Project No.** and **Project Task No.** fields, select the information of the project that you want to purchase items or services for. Use the personalization tools if a field isn't visible. To learn more, go to [Personalize Your Workspace](ui-personalization-user.md).

    The value that you select in the **Project Line Type** field defines whether a planning line is created when you post the usage of the item. If the field contains **Billable**, then project planning lines that are ready to be invoiced to the customer are created. To learn more, go to [Invoice Projects](projects-how-invoice-jobs.md).

### How posting purchases affects inventory and WIP

When you post a receipt, the inventory is received and immediately written-off by an item ledger entry of the type **Negative Adjustment**. To avoid affecting WIP calculation, the project ledger entries don't include purchase order lines that aren't of the type **G/L Account**.

Project ledger entries are created as follows:

* From a purchase order, when you choose the **Post** action and choose **Invoice**.
* From a purchase invoice, when you choose the **Get Receipt Lines** action on the **Lines** FastTab, and then the **Post** action.

### To view the value of purchases for a project

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Projects**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open a relevant project card.

    On the **Tasks** FastTab, the **Outstanding Orders** field shows the total outstanding amount, in local currency, of inventory items and services on purchase documents for the project task line.  

    The **Amt. Rec. Not Invoiced** field shows the value of items delivered on purchase documents but not invoiced.  
3. Choose either of the fields to open the **Purchase Lines** page where you can review information about the related purchase document lines, including which items or services are received.

## To post a project-related expense

If you incur extraordinary or one-time project expenses, you can use the **Project G/L Journal** page to post them directly to the relevant project account.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Project G/L Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Create a new line and enter information about the expense, including information in the **Project No.** and **Project Task No** fields.  
3. When the journal is complete, choose the **Post** action.

## Receive items for projects with warehouse receipts or put-aways

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers advanced warehouse handling for purchase orders that are linked to projects. Save some time by using warehouse receipts or inventory put-aways to directly receive and register usage of items for projects.

Use the following methods to receive items:

- Post receipt and consumption from the order line.
- Post receipt and consumption from an inventory put-away document.
- Post receipt and consumption from a warehouse receipt document.

### To post receipt and consumption from an inventory put-away document

When your location is set up to require processing put-aways but not receipts, use an **Inventory Put-away** document to record and post put-away and receipt information for your purchase orders.

You can create an inventory put-away in three ways:

- Create the inventory put-away directly from the purchase order by choosing the **Create Inventory Put-away/Pick** action.
- Create inventory put-aways for several source documents at the same time by using the **Create Inventory Put-away/Pick/Movement** batch job.
- Create the put-away in two steps by first by releasing the purchase orders to make the items available to be put away. You can create the inventory put-away based on the source document on the **Inventory Put-away** page.

> [!NOTE]
> If bins are mandatory for the location, make sure that the **Bin Code** is filled in the purchase order lines.

### To post the inventory put-away

1. On the **Inventory Put-aways** page, open a previously created put-away document.
1. Enter the quantity that was put away in the **Qty. to Handle** field.
1. After you put away the items, choose the **Post** action.

The results of these steps are that you post the receipt of the source document lines that were put away. There are two item ledger entries for each line. One entry for receipt, and one to immediately write off the received quantity for the project. There are no project ledger entries until you post the invoice. If the location uses bins, posting also creates warehouse entries to post the bin quantity changes.

### To post receipt and consumption from a warehouse receipt document

You must get the lines from the released purchase order that the receipt is for. You can create warehouse receipts in one of two ways:

- In a push fashion, when work is done on an order-by-order basis. Choose the **Create Warehouse Receipt** action on the **Purchase Order** page to create warehouse receipt for a source document.
- In a pull fashion, where you use the **Release** action on the **Purchase Order** page to release the document to the warehouse. A warehouse employee creates a warehouse receipt for one or more released source documents.

> [!NOTE]
> If you use bins, the default bin is suggested. You can either accept the default bin or specify the bin to put the items in.

### To post the warehouse receipt

1. On the **Warehouse Receipts** page, open the warehouse receipt.
1. The **Qty. to Receive** field contains the quantity outstanding for each line, but you can change the quantity as needed.
1. After you received the items, choose the **Post** action.

The results of these steps are that you post the receipt of the source document lines. There are two item ledger entries for each receipt line. One entry for the receipt, and one to immediately write off the received quantity for the project.

There are no project ledger entries until you post the invoice.

If the location uses bins, posting also creates warehouse entries to post the bin quantity changes.

> [!NOTE]
> Warehouse put-away documents aren't created, even if your warehouse processes require both receipt and warehouse put-away.

### Good to know

- Return orders aren't supported for locations with directed put-away and pick. You need to undo consumption via a project journal, and then create return order for items in inventory.
- If purchase documents were created before the update, you can post them directly. If you want to use warehouse handling, reopen and release the purchase orders again.
- You can't edit the **No.**, **Variant Code**, **Project No.**, and **Project Task No.** fields on purchase lines if warehouse receipts or inventory put-aways exist.

title: Design Details - Item Tracking and Reservations

# Design Details: Item Tracking and Reservations

Simultaneous use of reservation and specific item tracking is uncommon, because they both create a coupling between supply and demand. Except for situations where a customer or production planner requests a specific lot, it rarely makes sense to reserve inventory items that already carry item tracking numbers for specific application. Although it is possible to reserve items that require specific item tracking, special functionality is needed to avoid availability conflicts between order processors that request the same item-tracked items.  
  
The concept of Late Binding ensures that a nonspecific reservation of a serial number or a lot number remains loosely coupled until posting. At posting time, the reservation system can reshuffle nonspecific reservations to ensure that fixed application is possible against the serial or lot number that is actually picked. Meanwhile, the serial or lot number is made available for specific reservation in other documents that request that particular serial or lot number.  
  
A nonspecific reservation is one in which the user does not care which specific item is picked, and a specific reservation is one in which the user does care.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
> The Late Binding functionality relates only to items that are set up with specific item tracking, and it applies only to reservations against inventory, not against inbound supply orders.  
  
Reservation of item tracking numbers falls into two categories, as shown in the following table.  
  
|Reservation|Description|  
|-----------------|---------------------------------------|  
|Specific|You select a specific serial or lot number when you reserve the inventory item from a demand, such as a sales order.<br /><br /> This is a regular reservation. It is a rigid link between supply and demand that both carry serial or lot numbers. **Note:**  The demand carries serial or lot numbers. <br /><br /> For example, you want to reserve a can of blue paint from Lot A, because the customer requests it. A can of blue paint from Lot A is shipped to the customer.|  
|Nonspecific|You do not select a specific serial or lot number when you reserve the inventory item from a demand, such as a sales order.<br /><br /> This is a state that is imposed on a reservation entry for serial or lot numbers that are not selected specifically. **Note:**  The demand does not carry serial or lot numbers. <br /><br /> For example, you want to reserve a can of blue paint from any lot for your sales order. A can of blue paint from a random serial or lot number is shipped to the customer.|  
  
The main difference between specific and nonspecific reservation is defined by the existence of serial or lot numbers on the demand side, as shown in the following table.  

| Type            | Supply                | Demand                   |
|-----------------|-----------------------|--------------------------|
| **Specific**    | Serial or lot number. | Serial or lot number.    |
| **Nonspecific** | Serial or lot number. | No serial or lot number. |
  
When you reserve inventory quantities from an outbound document line for an item that has item tracking numbers assigned and is set up for specific item tracking, the **Reservation** page leads you through different workflows depending on your need for the serial or lot numbers.  
  
## Specific Reservation  
When you choose **Reserve** from the outbound document line, a dialog box appears that asks you if you want to reserve specific serial or lot numbers. If you choose **Yes**, then a list is displayed with all the serial or lot numbers that are assigned to the document line. The **Reservation** page opens after you select one of the serial or lot numbers, and you can then reserve among the selected serial or lot numbers in a typical fashion.  
  
If some of the specific item tracking numbers that you are trying to reserve are held in nonspecific reservations, then a message at the bottom of the **Reservation** page informs you how many of the total reserved quantity are held in nonspecific reservations and whether they are still available.  
  
## Nonspecific Reservation  
If you choose **No** in the dialog box that appears, the **Reservation** page opens and allows you to reserve among all serial or lot numbers in inventory.  
  
Because of the structure of the reservation system, when you place a nonspecific reservation on an item-tracked item, the system must select specific item ledger entries to reserve against. Because the item ledger entries carry the item tracking numbers, the reservation indirectly reserves specific serial or lot numbers, even though you did not intend to. To handle this situation, the reservation system tries to reshuffle nonspecific reservation entries before posting.  
  
The system actually still reserves against specific entries, but then it uses a reshuffling mechanism whenever there is specific demand for the lot or serial number in the nonspecific reservation. This can be the case when you post a demand transaction, such as a sales order, consumption journal, or transfer order, for the serial or lot number, or when you try to specifically reserve the serial or lot number. The system reshuffles the reservations to make the lot or serial number available to the demand or to the specific reservation, thereby placing a different lot or serial number in the nonspecific reservation. If there is insufficient quantity in inventory, the system reshuffles as much as possible, and you receive an availability error if there is still insufficient quantity at the time of posting.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  On a nonspecific reservation the lot number or serial number field is blank in the reservation entry that points at the demand, such as the sale.  
  
## Reshuffle  
When a user posts an outbound document after picking the wrong serial or lot number, other nonspecific reservations are reshuffled to reflect the actual serial or lot number that is picked. This satisfies the posting engine with a fixed application between supply and demand.  
  
For all supported business scenarios, reshuffling  is possible only against positive item ledger entries that carry reservation and serial or lot numbers but without defined serial or lot numbers on the demand side.  
  
## Supported Business Scenarios  
The Late Binding functionality supports the following business scenarios:  
  
* Entering a specific serial or lot number on an outbound document with nonspecific reservation of a wrong serial or lot number.  
* Reserving a specific serial or lot number.  
* Posting an outbound document with nonspecific reservation of a serial or lot number.  
  
### Entering Serial or Lot Numbers on an Outbound Document with Wrong Nonspecific Reservation  
This is the most common of the three supported scenarios. In this case, the Late Binding functionality ensures that a user can enter a serial or lot number, which is actually picked, on an outbound document that already has a nonspecific reservation of another serial or lot number.  
  
For example, the need arises when an order processor has first made a nonspecific reservation of any serial or lot number. Later when the item is actually picked from inventory, the picked serial or lot number must be entered on the order before it is posted. The nonspecific reservation is reshuffled at posting time to ensure that the picked serial or lot number can be entered without losing the reservation and to ensure that the picked serial or lot number can be fully applied and posted.  
  
### Reserve Specific Serial or Lot Numbers  
In this business scenario, Late Binding functionality ensures that a user who is trying to reserve a particular serial or lot number that is currently nonspecifically reserved can do so. A nonspecific reservation is reshuffled at the time of reservation to free the serial or lot number for the specific request.  
  
The reshuffle happens automatically, but embedded Help is displayed at the bottom of the **Reservation** page and shows the following text:  
  
**XX of the Total Reserved Quantity are nonspecific and may be available.**  
  
In addition, the **Nonspecific Reserved Qty.** field shows how many reservation entries are nonspecific. By default, this field is not visible to users.  
  
### Posting an Outbound Document with Nonspecific Reservation of Serial or Lot Numbers  
This business scenario is supported with Late Binding functionality that enables fixed application and outbound posting of what is actually picked by reshuffling another nonspecific reservation of a serial or lot number. If reshuffling is not possible, then the following standard error message appears when the user tries to post the shipment:  
  
**Item XX cannot be fully applied.**

# Track Email Message Exchanges Between Salespeople and Contacts

[!INCLUDE[azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id](~/../shared-content/shared/azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id.md)]

Get more out of the communications between your salespeople and customers by turning email exchanges into actionable opportunities. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can work with Exchange Online to keep a log of the inbound and outbound messages. You can view and analyze the contents of each message on the **Interaction Log Entries** page.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and Exchange Online must be on the same tenant.

## To set up email logging

### Set up public folders and rules for email logging in Exchange Online

[!INCLUDE[admin-setup-email-public-folder](includes/admin-setup-email-public-folder.md)]

Next, you connect [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with Exchange Online.

### Set Up a shared mailbox and rules for email logging in Exchange Online

> [!NOTE]
> These steps require administrator access for Exchange Online.

Prepare a shared mailbox in the Exchange admin center. Alternatively, you can also use Exchange Online PowerShell. For more information, see [Create a shared mailbox](/microsoft-365/admin/email/create-a-shared-mailbox) or [Exchange Online PowerShell](/powershell/exchange/exchange-online-powershell?view=exchange-ps&preserve-view=true).

> [!NOTE]
> If you use Exchange Management PowerShell, your changes are available in the Exchange admin center after a delay. The delay might be several hours.

### Add a user account for members of the shared mailbox

The account that you use for email logging is an Exchange Online account. The scheduled job uses the account to connect to the shared mailbox and process emails. This account shouldn't be associated with a specific person. Add the email account to the members for the shared mailbox. For more information, see [Use the EAC to edit shared mailbox delegation](/exchange/collaboration-exo/shared-mailboxes#use-the-eac-to-edit-shared-mailbox-delegation).

### Allow other users to see logged emails

You can allow another user to open an email message in Exchange that is related to an interaction log entry from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. To do that, give the user ``Read`` permission to the **Archive** folder in the shared mailbox. For more information, see [Exchange Online PowerShell](/powershell/exchange/exchange-online-powershell?view=exchange-ps&preserve-view=true).

### Create mail flow rules

Mail flow rules look for specific conditions on messages and take action on them. Create two mail flow rules based on the information in the following table. For more information, see [Manage mail flow rules in Exchange Online](/exchange/security-and-compliance/mail-flow-rules/manage-mail-flow-rules?preserve-view=true) and [Mail flow rule actions in Exchange Online](/exchange/security-and-compliance/mail-flow-rules/mail-flow-rule-actions?preserve-view=true).

|Purpose  |Name  |Apply this rule if...  |Do the following...  |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|A rule for incoming email     |Log Email Sent to This Organization|The sender is located outside the organization, and the recipient is located inside the organization|BCC the email account that is specified for the shared mailbox.|
|A rule for outgoing email     |Log Email Sent from This Organization|The sender is located inside the organization, and the recipient is located outside the organization.|BCC the email account that is specified for the shared mailbox.|

> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] only processes messages in the Inbox folder in the shared mailbox. If a rule moves messages from the Inbox to another folder, those messages will not be processed. Additionally, messages in the Junk Mails folder are also ignored.

## Set Up [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to log email messages

Get started with email logging in two easy steps:

1. Connect [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with Exchange Online for your Microsoft 365 subscription. Exchange Online handles your email messages. We made this step easy by providing an assisted setup guide. You just need your administrator credentials for your administrator account in Microsoft 365. To start the guide, go to the **Assisted Setup** page, and then select the **Set up email logging** guide.  

2. Make sure that the email addresses for your sales people and contacts in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] are valid. To do that, for each customer or salesperson, open the **Contact** or **Salesperson/Purchaser** card and have a look in the **Email** field.

    > [!Tip]
    > After you complete the steps in the guide you can check whether the connection was successful. Search for **Email Logging**, choose **Actions**, and then choose **Validate Setup**.

## View email message exchanges in the Interaction Log

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates an entry on the **Interaction Log** page each time a salesperson and a contact exchange an email message. To view the interaction log, open the **Contact** card for the person, choose **Related**, then **History**, and then **Interaction Log Entries**. There are a few things you can do with each entry in the log, for example:

* View the content of the email message that was exchanged by selecting **Process** and then **Show Attachments**.
* Turn an email exchange into a sales opportunity. If an entry looks promising, you can turn it into an opportunity and then manage its progress toward a sale. To turn an email exchange into an opportunity, choose the entry, then **Process**, and then **Create Opportunity**. For more information, see [Managing Sales Opportunities](marketing-manage-sales-opportunities.md).

## Mailbox and folder limits in Exchange Online

There are mailbox and folder limits in Exchange Online, such as limits for folder sizes and the number of messages. For more information, see [Exchange Online limits](/office365/servicedescriptions/exchange-online-service-description/exchange-online-limits#storage-limits) and [Limits for public folders in Exchange Server](/Exchange/collaboration/public-folders/limits?view=exchserver-2019&preserve-view=true).

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] stores logged email messages in a folder in Exchange Online. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] also stores a link to each logged message. The links open the logged messages in Exchange Online from the Interaction Log Entries, Contact Card, and Salespersons Card pages in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. If a logged message is moved to another folder, the link is broken. For example, a message might be moved manually, or Exchange Online might automatically start AutoSplit when a storage limit is reached.

The following steps can help you avoid breaking links to messages in Exchange Online.

1. Don't move existing messages to another folder after you change settings for your email logging setup. Keeping existing messages put preserves the links. Links to messages in the new folder are valid.
2. Avoid reaching the mailbox and folder limits. If you're about to reach a limit, take the following steps:
    1. Set up a new shared mailbox in Exchange Online.
    2. Update your email flow rules in Exchange Online.
    3. Update your email logging setup in Business Central accordingly

## Connect on-premises versions to Microsoft Exchange

You can connect [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises to Exchange on-premises or Exchange Online for email logging. For both versions of Exchange, settings for the connection are available on the **Marketing Setup** page. For Exchange Online, you can also use an assisted setup guide.

<!-- [!IMPORTANT]
> The new experience doesn't support a connection to Exchange on-premises. If you must use Exchange on-premises, do not enable the feature update for the new experience.

## Connect to Exchange on-premises
<!--
## [Current Experience](#tab/current-experience)
To connect [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises to Exchange on-premises, on the **Marketing Setup** page, you can use **Basic** as the **Authentication Type**, and then enter credentials for the user account for Exchange on-premises. Then turn on the **Enabled** toggle to start logging email.

## [New Experience](#tab/new-experience)
The new experience does not support connections to Exchange on-premises.
-->
## Connect to Exchange Online

To connect to Exchange Online, you must register an application in Microsoft Entra ID. Provide the application ID, key vault secret, and the redirect URL to use for the registration. The redirect URL is preset and should work for most installations. For more information, see [To register an application in Microsoft Entra ID for connecting from Business Central to Exchange Online](#to-register-an-application-in-microsoft-entra-id-for-connecting-from-business-central-to-exchange-online). 

You must also use **OAuth2** as the **Authentication Type**. You must also register an application in Microsoft Entra ID. Provide the application ID, key vault secret, and the redirect URL to use for the registration. The redirect URL is prepopulated and should work for most installations. For more information, see [To register an application in Microsoft Entra ID for connecting from Business Central to Exchange Online](#to-register-an-application-in-microsoft-entra-id-for-connecting-from-business-central-to-exchange-online).

You must set up your installation to use HTTPS. For more information, see [Configuring SSL to Secure the Business Central Web Client Connection](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/deployment/configure-ssl-web-client-connection). If you're setting up your server to have a different home page, you can change the URL. The client secret is saved as an encrypted string in your database.

### To register an application in Microsoft Entra ID for connecting from Business Central to Exchange Online

The following steps assume that you use Microsoft Entra ID to manage identities and access. For more information, see [Quickstart: Register an application with the Microsoft identity platform](/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app). 

1. In the Azure portal, under **Manage**, choose **Authentication**.
2. Under **Redirect URL**, add the redirect URL that is suggested on the **Email Logging** page in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. If the redirect URL field on the Email Logging page is empty, find the suggested redirect URL on the **Assisted Setup** page. To open the page, on the **Email Logging** page, choose **Actions**, and then **Assisted Setup**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you do not specify the redirect URL, you can do so later by choosing **Add a platform**, and then choosing **Web** to add the web application and the redirect URL.

3. Under **Manage**, choose **API permissions**, and choose **Microsoft Graph**, and then choose **Delegated permissions**.
4. Use the search box to find and select **Mail**, and then add the **Mail.ReadWrite.Shared** permission.
5. Under **Manage**, choose **Certificates & Secrets**, and then create a new secret for your app. You use the secret either in the **Client Secret** field on the **Email Logging** page in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].
6. Choose **Overview**, and then find the **Application (client) ID** value. This value is the client ID of your application. You must enter it either in the **Client ID** field on the **Email Logging** page.
7. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], set up email logging on the **Email Logging** page, or use the **Assisted Setup** guide for assistance.

### Use Another Identity and Access Management Service

If you aren't using Microsoft Entra ID to manage identities and access, you need some help from a developer. If you prefer to store the app ID and secret in a different location, you can leave the Client ID and Client Secret fields blank and write an extension to fetch the ID and secret from the location. You can provide the secret at runtime by subscribing to the OnGetEmailLoggingClientId and OnGetEmailLoggingClientSecret events in codeunit 1641 "Setup Email Logging."

## To start logging email

1. To start logging email, on the **Email Logging** page, turn on the **Enabled** toggle.
2. Sign in with the Exchange Online account that the scheduled job uses to connect to the shared mailbox and process emails.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you are not prompted to sign in the the Exchange Online account, it might be because your browser is blocking pop-ups. To sign in, allow pop-ups from https://login.microsoftonline.com.

## To stop logging email

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Email Logging**, and then choose the related link.
2. Turn off the **Enabled** toggle.

## To change the user account used for email logging

### [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Online

1. Sign in to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with the account that the scheduled job uses to connect to the shared mailbox and process emails. This account must have access to both [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and Exchange Online.
2. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Email Logging**, and then choose the related link. 
3. Choose **Related**, and then **Job Queue Entry**.
4. Restart the **Email Logging** job.

### [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Email Logging**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose **Actions**, and then **Renew Token**.

# Batch post output and run times

The output quantity represents the work progress in the form of the finished quantity and used capacity of the work or machine center.

You can use an output journal to:

* Adjust inventory with the output of finished items from production.
* Register quantities and scrap for each operation in a production routing.
* Register setup and run time for work and machine centers.

> [!NOTE]
> If you use a production routing, inventory is updated only when you post output quantity for the last operation.

The **Production Journal** page lets you do the same tasks as the **Output Journal** page, and also do consumption posting tasks. To learn more, go to [Register Consumption and Output for a Released Production Order Line](production-how-to-register-consumption-and-output.md).

## To post output quantities and/or register run times for one or more production order lines

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Output Journal**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields with the production order data and the output data and/or run time. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
  
    You can use the **Explode Routing** function to generate journal lines from production orders.
  
3. If the operation is complete, select the **Finished** field.  
4. Choose the **Post** action to post the operations.

    Capacity ledger entries are updated for the used work or machine centers with information about time and quantity of output and scrap. If you posted the last operation, the item is added to inventory.

# Change the Annual Amount on Service Contracts or Contract Quotes
You can change the annual amount of the service contract or contract quote to correct the amount that will be invoiced annually.  

## To change the annual amount of the service contract or contract quote  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Contracts** or **Service Contract Quotes**,and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the contract or contract quote.  
3. Choose the **Open Contract** action to open the contract or contract quote for editing.  
4. Choose the **Allow Unbalanced Amounts** check box if you want to change the annual amount and distribute the annual amount difference manually on the contract lines. Otherwise, clear the check box to automatically distribute the annual amount difference on the contract lines after you change the annual amount.  
5. Change the contents of the **Annual Amount** field. You cannot sign, that is, convert into a service contract if you are working on a contract quote, or lock a service contract that has a negative annual amount. If you set the annual amount to zero, the contents of the **Invoice Period** field must be **None** when either signing or locking the service contract.  
6. Depending on whether the **Allow Unbalanced Amounts** check box is selected, run either the manual or automatic distribution of the annual amount difference. The contract lines will be updated so that the **Calcd. Annual Amount** field value is equal to the new annual amount.  

## Distributing Differences Between New and Calculated Annual Amounts
If you change the annual amount of a service contract or contract quote, you may want to distribute the difference between its new and calculated annual amounts on the contract lines. There are three ways to distribute amounts:

* Even distribution  
* Distribution based on line amounts  
* Distribution based on Profit

### Even Distribution
If you change the annual amount of the service contract or contract quote, you may want to distribute the difference between its new and calculated annual amounts on the contract lines. Even distribution is one of the automatic distribution methods that can help you spread equally the new and calculated annual amounts difference between line amounts on the contract lines. The following list of distribution procedure steps describe the main idea of this method:  

1. The difference between the new **Annual Amount** and **Calcd. Annual Amount** field values is divided by the number of the contract lines in the service contract or contract quote.  
2. The **Line Amount** field value is updated by adding the result of the previous operation.  
3. The contents in the **Line Discount Amount**, **Line Discount %**, and **Profit** fields are updated with regard to the new value in the **Line Amount** field in the following way:   
    * Line Discount Amount = Line Value - Line Amount.  
    * Line Discount % = Line Discount Amount / Line Value * 100.  
    * Profit = Line Amount - Line Cost.  

 The steps are repeated for each contract line.  

#### Example  
The **Allow Unbalanced Amounts** check box is not selected in the service contract that contains three contract lines with such information.  

|Item|Line Cost|Line Value|Line Discount %|Line Discount Amount|Line Amount|Profit|  
|----------|---------------|----------------|---------------------|--------------------------|-----------------|------------|  
|Item 1|30.00|40.00|0.00|0.00|40.00|10.00|  
|Item 2|40.00|50.00|10.00|5.00|45.00|5.00|  
|Item 3|50.00|70.00|10.00|7.00|63.00|13.00|  

The **Annual Amount** field value is equal to the contents of the **Calcd. Annual Amount** field, which is always set to the sum of the line amounts. In this case, it is equal to the following:  40 + 45 + 63 = 148.  

If you change the **Annual Amount** to 139, the amount is calculated that should be added to each **Line Amount** field value. This amount is calculated by subtracting the **Calcd. Annual Amount** from the new **Annual Amount** field value and dividing the result by the number of the contract lines in the service contract. In this case, it will be equal to the following: (139 - 148) / 3 = -3. Then, the last calculated figure is added to each **Line Amount** field value and the **Line Discount %**, **Line Discount Amount**, and **Profit** field values are updated using the formulas in the procedure described above.  

Finally, the contract lines will contain this data.  

|Item|Line Cost|Line Value|Line Discount %|Line Discount Amount|Line Amount|Profit|  
|----------|---------------|----------------|---------------------|--------------------------|-----------------|------------|  
|Item 1|30.00|40.00|7.50|3.00|37.00|7.00|  
|Item 2|40.00|50.00|16.00|8.00|42.00|2.00|  
|Item 3|50.00|70.00|14.29|10.00|60.00|10.00|  

### Distribution Based on Line Amount
If you change the annual amount of the service contract or contract quote, you may want to distribute the difference between its new and calculated annual amounts on the contract lines. Distribution Based on Line Amount is an automatic method that can help you spread the new and calculated annual amounts difference between the line amounts on the contract lines. This distribution will be performed proportionally to their line amount shares in the calculated annual amount. The following list of distribution procedure steps for each contract line describe the main idea of this method:  

1. The line amount percentage contribution is calculated as follows: the contents of the **Line Amount** field is divided by the **Calcd. Annual Amount** field values on all contract lines.  
2. The **Line Amount** field value is updated by adding to it the difference between the new and calculated annual amounts, which is multiplied by the line amount percentage contribution.  
3. The contents in the **Line Discount Amount**, **Line Discount %**, and **Profit** fields are updated with regard to the new value in the **Line Discount Amount** field in the following way:  

    * Line Discount Amount = Line Value - Line Amount  
    * Line Discount % = Line Discount Amount / Line Value * 100  
    * Profit = Line Amount - Line Cost  

The steps are repeated for each contract line.  

#### Example  
The **Allow Unbalanced Amounts** check box is not selected in the service contract that contains three contract lines with such information.  

|Item|Line Cost|Line Value|Line Discount %|Line Discount Amount|Line Amount|Profit|  
|----------|---------------|----------------|---------------------|--------------------------|-----------------|------------|  
|Item 1|15.00|17.00|3.00|0.51|25.00|1.49|  
|Item 2|20.00|23.00|None|0.00|55.10|3.00|  
|Item 3|24.00|27.00|3.00|0.81|112.70|2.19|  

The **Annual Amount** field value is equal to the contents of the **Calcd. Annual Amount** field which is always set to the sum of the line amounts. In this case, it is equal to the following: 16.49 + 23.00 + 26.19 = 65.68.  

If you change the **Annual Amount** to 60, the profit percentage contributions for each contract line is calculated:  

* Item 1 – 5 / (5 + 5.1 +12.7) = 0.2193 %  
* Item 2 – 5.1 / (5 + 5.1 + 12.7) = 0.2237  
* Item 3 – 12.7 / (5 + 5.1 + 12.7) = 0.557  

The **Line Amount** field value is updated on each contract line using the following formula: Line Amount = Line Amount + difference between the new and calculated annual amounts * Percentage Contribution. After that, the **Line Discount Amount**, **Line Discount %**, and **Profit** field values are updated using the formulas described in the procedure above.  

Finally, the contract lines will contain this data.  

|Item|Line Cost|Line Value|Line Discount %|Line Discount Amount|Line Amount|Profit|  
|----------|---------------|----------------|---------------------|--------------------------|-----------------|------------|  
|Item 1|15.00|17.00|11.41|1.94|15.06|0.06|  
|Item 2|20.00|23.00|8.65|1.99|21.01|1.01|  
|Item 3|24.00|27.00|11.37|3.07|23.93|-0.07|  

### Distribution Based on Profit
If you change the annual amount of the service contract or contract quote, you may want to distribute the difference between its new and calculated annual amounts on the contract lines. Distribution Based on Profit is one of the automatic methods that can help you spread the new and calculated annual amounts difference between the line amounts on the contract lines. This distribution will be performed proportionally to their profit shares in the total contract or contract quote profit. The following list of distribution procedure steps for each contract line describe the main idea of this method:  

1. The profit percentage contribution is calculated as follows: the contents of the **Profit** field is divided by the sum of **Profit** field values on all contract lines.  
2. The **Line Amount** field value is updated by adding to it the difference between the new and calculated annual amounts, which is multiplied by the profit percentage contribution.  
3. The contents in the Line Discount Amount, Line Discount %, and Profit fields are updated with regard to the new value in the **Line Amount** field in the following way:  

    * Line Discount Amount = Line Value - Line Amount  
    * Line Discount % = Line Discount Amount / Line Value * 100  
    * Profit = Line Amount - Line Cost  

#### Example  
The **Allow Unbalanced Amounts** check box is not selected in the service contract that contains three contract lines with such information.  

|Item|Line Cost|Line Value|Line Discount %|Line Discount Amount|Line Amount|Profit|  
|----------|---------------|----------------|---------------------|--------------------------|-----------------|------------|  
|Item 1|20.00|25.00|0.00|0.00|25.00|5.00|  
|Item 2|50.00|58.00|5.00|2.90|55.10|5.10|  
|Item 3|100.00|115.00|2.00|2.30|112.70|12.70|  

The **Annual Amount** field value is equal to the contents of the **Calcd. Annual Amount** field, which is always set to the sum of the line amounts. In this case, it is equal to the following:  25.00 + 55.10 + 112.70 = 192.80.  

 If you change the **Annual Amount** to 180, the profit percentage contributions for each contract line are calculated:  

* Item 1 – 5 / (5 + 5.1 +1 2.7) = 0.2193 %  
* Item 2 – 5.1 / (5 + 5.1 + 12.7) = 0.2237  
* Item 3 – 12.7 / (5 + 5.1 + 12.7) = 0.557  

The **Line Amount** field value is updated on each contract line using the following formula: Line Amount = Line Amount + difference between the new and calculated annual amounts * Percentage Contribution. After that, the **Line Discount Amount**, **Line Discount %**, and **Profit** field values are updated using the formulas in the step 3 of the procedure described above.  

Finally, the contract lines will contain this data.  

|Item|Line Cost|Line Value|Line Discount %|Line Discount Amount|Line Amount|Profit|  
|----------|---------------|----------------|---------------------|--------------------------|-----------------|------------|  
|Item 1|20.00|25.00|11.24|2.81|22.19|2.19|  
|Item 2|50.00|58.00|9.93|5.76|52.24|2.24|  
|Item 3|100.00|115.00|8.20|9.43|105.57|5.57|

# Finance Power BI app

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

This article explains how to use embedded Power BI reports in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to analyze finance data. You don't have to run a report or switch to another application, such as Excel. The feature provides an interactive and versatile way to calculate, summarize, and examine data in curated reports with predefined KPIs.

The Power BI reports on finance data support many analytics scenarios for finance processes.

Executives and the leadership team consume the data through high-level dashboards that present key performance indicators (KPIs) for finance. The KPIs aggregate data to provide a clear and concise overview of overall financial health, and highlight important performance metrics. This approach helps business leaders quickly assess performance toward strategic goals and make informed decisions without getting lost in granular details.

Managers and team leaders engage with the data through detailed managerial reports that showcase trends and summaries. Data is aggregated over time to reveal patterns and highlight areas that need attention. These reports provide context through charts, visualizations, and comparisons that help you understand underlying trends, identify risks, and make data-driven tactical adjustments.

Finance staff accesses operational reports that offer detailed, granular-level data. These reports offer task-specific information for daily functions. Staff can mine the data for specific transactions, process monitoring, and operational insights, ensuring effective day-to-day management of financial activities.

You can use the various reports in the Power BI Finance app for different things, depending on your role. This article describes some examples of use cases for different roles in an organization.

## Finance analytics for the leadership team

To fit this category, you might have a role such as:

- Executive
- Director
- Other high-level decision maker

### Sample scenario for a CFO

As the CFO, you're preparing for an upcoming board meeting and need an analysis of your company's financial position for the current fiscal quarter.

Using the [Financial Overview (Power BI report)](finance-powerbi-financial-overview.md), you begin with a comparative analysis of revenues. This quarter's revenue of $281,000 represents a significant increase compared to the same period last year of $242,000, marking a growth of $39,000, or approximately 16.1%. This positive trend indicates strong performance and suggests that current strategies are effectively increasing revenue.

:::image type="content" source="media/finance/financial-overview-app-page.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Finance Overview report" lightbox="media/finance/financial-overview-app-page.png":::

You want to compare the net profit margin for the current quarter to the same period in the previous year. You quickly identify that net profit margins are slightly lower, but you need more information to determine why.

:::image type="content" source="media/finance/net-profit-margin-by-fiscal-year-and-month.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Net Profit Margin visual" lightbox="media/finance/net-profit-margin-by-fiscal-year-and-month.png":::

By analyzing the [Profitability](finance-powerbi-profitability.md) report, you can easily see that expenses are up from 3.60 K to 11.85 K for the same period. Although revenue is up by approximately 16.1%, the increase in expenses suppressed growth and produced a marginal increase in profits.

:::image type="content" source="media/finance/profitability-snapshot.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Profitability report" lightbox="media/finance/profitability-snapshot.png":::

To ensure the company is able to cover its short-term obligations, fund new initiatives, and maintain operational stability you review the liquidity report and cash reserves.

The cash ratio of 1.0 indicates that the company has enough cash and cash equivalents (1.02M) to pay off all current liabilities (1.02M) immediately, if needed. The quick ratio of 1.15 indicates that without including inventory in current assets, the company can still cover its short-term debts without relying on sales of inventory. Overall, the current ratio of 1.21 indicates the company is in a balanced but cautious liquidity position with current assets of $1.24M to current liabilities of 1.02M.

:::image type="content" source="media/finance/liquidity-kpi-snapshot.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Liquidity report" lightbox="media/finance/liquidity-kpi-snapshot.png":::

## Finance analytics for the management team

As the Operations Manager, you oversee service delivery across various customer segments. These customer groups are tracked as dimensions values (Large, Medium, and Small) by the **Customer Group** global dimension.

By filtering the [Budget Comparison (Power BI report)](finance-powerbi-budget-comparison.md) by **Global Dimension 2** and **G/L Account Category** to **Income** and **Expense**, you can easily track budget performance. This data lets you allocate resources effectively, control the budget, and make data-driven decisions when you forecast.

:::image type="content" source="media/finance/budget-comparison-snapshot.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Budget Comparison report" lightbox="media/finance/budget-comparison-snapshot.png":::

## Finance analytics for daily finance work

As a member of the accounts receivable team, you manage the inflow of cash by ensuring timely and efficient collection of payments from customers. To monitor and prioritize your efforts, you use the [Aged Receivables (Back Dating) (Power BI report)](finance-powerbi-aged-receivables-back-dating.md).

Analyzing by payment terms code allows you to quickly identify customers who have outstanding balances in aging buckets beyond 30 days. You can now prioritize not only customers, but the invoices those customers should pay first.

# Let [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Suggest Values
[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can help you complete tasks quicker and more correctly by prefilling fields or complete lines with data that you would otherwise have to calculate and enter yourself. Although such automatic data entry is always correct, you can change it afterwards if you want to.

Functionality that enters field values for you is typically offered for tasks where you enter large volumes of transactional data and want to avoid errors and save time. This article contains a selection of such functionality. More sections will be added in future updates of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## The **Suggest Balancing Amount** check box on the **General Journal Batches** page
When, for example, you're entering general journal lines for multiple expenses that must all be posted to the same bank account, then each time you enter a new journal line for an expense, you can have the **Amount** field on the bank account line automatically updated to the amount that balances the expenses. For more information about working with general journals, see [Work with General Journals](ui-work-general-journals.md).

### To have the **Amount** field on balancing general journal lines filled automatically
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the line for your preferred general journal batch, choose the **Suggest Balancing Amount** check box.
3. Open the general journal and proceed to register and post transactions using the described functionality for automatic entry of a field value.       

For information about how to set up a personal general journal batch, for example, for expense handling, see [Work with General Journals](ui-work-general-journals.md).

## The **Automatically Fill Date Received** field on the **Payment Registration** page
The **Register Customer Payments** page shows outstanding incoming payments as lines that represent sales documents where an amount is due for payment. For more information about applying customer payments, see [Reconcile Customer Payments from a List of Unpaid Sales Documents](receivables-how-reconcile-customer-payments-list-unpaid-sales-documents.md).

Your main actions on the page are to fill in the **Payment Made** check box and the **Date Received** field. You can set [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] up to automatically enter work date in the **Date Received** field when you select the **Payment Made** check box.

### To have the **Date Received** field on the **Payment Registration** page filled automatically
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Payment Registration Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the **Automatically Fill Date Received** check box.
3. Open the **Register Customer Payments** page and proceed to process incoming customer payments using the described functionality for automatic entry of a field value.

# Delivery date calculation for sales

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically calculates the earliest possible date that an item on a sales order line can be shipped.

* If the customer has requested a specific delivery date, then the date on which the items must be available to pick to meet that delivery date is calculated.
* If the customer doesn't request a specific delivery date, then the date on which the items can be delivered is calculated. The calculation starts from the date on which the items are available for picking.

## Calculating a requested delivery date

If you specify a requested delivery date on the sales order line, that date becomes the starting point for the following calculations.

- *requested delivery date - shipping time = planned shipment date*
- *planned shipment date - outbound whse. handling time = shipment date*

If the items are available to pick on the shipment date, then the sales process can continue. Otherwise, a stock-out warning is displayed.

> [!NOTE]
> If your process is based on backward calculation, for example, if you use the requested delivery date to get the planned shipment date, we recommend you use date formulas with fixed durations, such as "5D" for five days or "1W" for one week. Date formulas without fixed durations, such as "CW" for current week or CM for current month, can result in incorrect date calculations. Learn more about date formulas at [Work with Calendar Dates and Times](ui-enter-date-ranges.md).

## Calculating the earliest possible delivery date

If you don't specify a requested delivery date on the sales order line, or if the requested delivery date can't be met, then the earliest date on which the items are available is calculated. That date is then entered in the **Shipment Date** field on the line, and the date on which you plan to ship the items and the date on which they'll be delivered to the customer are calculated using the following formulas.

- *shipment date + outbound whse. handling time = planned shipment date*
- *planned shipment date + shipping time = planned delivery date*

# Managing VAT Rate Changes

VAT rates can change depending on local legislation. Any change in VAT impacts your data in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] whether or not the VAT rate is lowered, raised, or removed. VAT is connected to many entities in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], such as customers, vendors, items, resources, item charges, and general ledger accounts. Changes in VAT rates usually happen at a specific date, from which point you will need to have changed the VAT setup, posting groups etc. to make sure new sales orders and purchase orders are created with the new VAT rate.

## Changing VAT rates

The optimal approach to manage a VAT rate change is to fully post and close open orders and other documents before the VAT rate switch date, to make sure these are not impacted by the change. This is the cleanest approach that allows you to start up new orders and documents with the new VAT rate.

The following approach is suggested to manage a VAT rate change

1. Fully post and close open orders, journals and other documents before the switch date. You can wait to after the switch date as long as you do not add new lines and make sure the effective date will be prior the switch date.  
2. Create the new VAT setup.  
3. Make the VAT switch on entities (relevant customers, vendors, items, and so on).  
4. At the VAT rate switch date you create new documents that will use the new rate.  


> [!NOTE]  
> We are currently updating the VAT Rate Change tool. The functionality mentioned below may not match the functionality in your environment. The update will take place before July 1st 2020 and will not be a regular monthly update. Instead, all environments will be updated automatically (hotfix). When this update is complete, this message will no longer appear.  

## The VAT Rate Change tool

The VAT Rate Change tool can assist with conversion of VAT Rates on master data, journals and orders, to some extent. This is useful if you want to convert VAT on master data more easily or if you have orders that you cannot close before the switch date and will be processed over a longer period of time, crossing the VAT rate switch date. There are certain restrictions and limitations in the VAT Rate Change tool that applies.

## Understanding the VAT rate conversion process and limitations

The VAT Rate Change tool performs VAT rate conversions for master data, journals, and orders in different ways. The selected master data and journals will be updated by the new general product posting group or VAT product post group. If an order has been fully or partially shipped, the shipped items will keep the current general product posting group or VAT product posting group. A new order line will be created for the unshipped items and updated to align current and new VAT or general product posting groups. In addition, item charge assignments, configuration templates for items, reservations, and item tracking information will be updated accordingly. 

On order lines, the unit price will be updated for all lines of type Item and Resource, if using prices incl. VAT for the item. For other line types it is possible to decide whether or not the unit price should be updated.

There are a few things that the tool does not convert:

* Sales or purchase orders and invoices where shipments have been posted. These documents are posted using the current VAT rate.  
* Documents that have posted prepayment invoices. For example, you have made or received prepayments on invoices that have not been completed before you use the VAT rate change tool. In this case, there will be a difference between the VAT that is due and the VAT that has been paid in the prepayments when the invoice is completed. The VAT rate change tool will skip these documents and you will have to manually update them.  
* Sales or purchase orders with warehouse integration if they are partially shipped or received.  
* Drop shipments.
* Special orders. 
* Assembly orders.
* Service contracts.  
* Credit memos.
* Return orders.
* Prices on Items (master data)
* Prices on Sales Prices (master data)
* Business Posting Groups on Customers and Vendors.

### To prepare VAT rate change conversions

Before you set up the VAT rate change tool, you must make the following preparations.

* If you have transactions that use different rates, then they must be separated into different groups either by creating new general ledger accounts for each rate or by using data filters to group transactions according to rate.  
* If you create new general ledger accounts, then you must create new general posting groups.  
* To reduce the number of documents that get converted, post as many documents as possible and reduce unposted documents to a minimum.  
* Back up data.

### To set up the VAT rate change tool

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Rate Change Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Master Data**, **Journals**, and **Documents** FastTabs, choose a posting group value from the option list for needed fields. For each group you can choose whether to convert VAT product posting groups or general product posting groups, or convert both values if they are available in the master data item. For some areas you can also set a filter to convert only a subset of values, for example, G/L accounts. 
3. On the **Prices Incl. VAT** FastTab, choose which line types on orders for which you want to update unit prices. Unit prices on lines of type Item and Resource will always be updated.

### To set up product posting group conversion

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Rate Change Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **VAT Rate Change Setup** page, choose either the **VAT Prod. Posting Group Conv.** or **Gen Prod. Posting Group Conv.** action.  
3. In the **From Code** field, enter the current posting group.  
4. In the **To Code** field, enter the new posting group.  

### To perform VAT rate change conversion

You use the VAT rate change tool to manage changes in the standard rate of VAT. You perform VAT and general posting group conversions to change VAT rates and maintain accurate VAT reporting. Depending on your setup, the following changes are made:  

* VAT and general posting groups are converted.  
* Changes are implemented in general ledger accounts, customers, vendors, open documents, journal lines, and so on.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Before you perform VAT rate change conversion, you can test the conversion. To do so, follow the steps below, but make sure to clear the **Perform Conversion** and **VAT Rate Change Tool Completed** check boxes. During test conversion, the **Converted** field in the **VAT Rate Change Log Entry** table is cleared and the **Converted Date** field in the **VAT Rate Change Log Entry** table is blank. After the conversion is complete, choose **VAT Rate Change Log Entries** to view the results of the test conversion. Verify each entry before you perform the conversion. In particular, verify transactions that use an old VAT rate.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Rate Change**, and then choose the **VAT Rate Change Setup** link.  
2. Verify that you have already set up the VAT product posting group conversion or general product posting group conversion.  
3. Choose the **Perform Conversion** check box.  

    > [!IMPORTANT]  
    >  Clear the **VAT Rate Change Tool Completed** check box. The check box is automatically selected when the VAT rate change conversion is completed.  

4. Choose the **Convert** action.  
5. After the conversion is complete, choose the **VAT Rate Change Log Entries** action to view the results of the conversion.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> After the conversion, the **Converted** field in the **VAT Rate Change Log Entry** table is chosen and the **Converted Date** field in the **VAT Rate Change Log Entry** table displays the conversion date.

- Vendor Ledger Entry
- Detailed Vendor Ledger Entry
- Date

### Amount Payable (LCY)
**Formula**   
The Amount Payable (LCY) measure calculates the total amount of payables in the local currency for a given period. The measure sums up the values in the amount (in local currency) column of the Vendor Ledger Entry table to determine the total amount of payables.

**Data Sources**
- Vendor Ledger Entry
- Detailed Vendor Ledger Entry
- Date

### Balance (Accounts Payable)
**Formula**   
The Balance (Accounts Payable) measure  calculates the total balance of accounts payable up to a specific date. The measure uses the [Amount Payable (LCY)](#amount-payable-lcy) measure and applies a filter to only include transactions on or before the selected date.

**Data Sources**
- Vendor Ledger Entry
- Detailed Vendor Ledger Entry

### Original Amount
**Formula**   
The Original Amount measure calculates the total amount of original entries for vendors. The measure uses the [Amount Payable (LCY)](#amount-payable-lcy) measure and applies a filter to the Vendor Ledger Entries table to only include entries with the Entry Type equal to "Initial Entry".

**Data Sources**
- Vendor Ledger Entry
- Detailed Vendor Ledger Entry

## G/L Entry Measures
- [Amount](#amount)
- [Balance](#balance)
- [Balance at Date](#balance-at-date)
- [Balance at Date (Neg)](#balance-at-date-neg)
- [Net Change](#net-change)
- [Net Change (Neg)](#net-change-neg)
- [Variance to Budget](#variance-to-budget)
- [Variance to Budget %](#variance-to-budget-)

### Amount
**Formula**   
The Amount measure sums all values in the amount column of the G/L Entry table.

**Data Sources**
- G/L Entry

### Balance
**Formula**   
The Balance measure calculates the total [Amount](#amount) across all dates, ignoring any filters on the `Date` table. By removing date-based filtering, this measure provides the full balance from the start to the end of the dataset, regardless of any date selections applied in the report.

**Data Sources**
- G/L Entry

### Balance at Date
**Formula**   
The Balance at Date measure calculates the cumulative [Amount](#amount) up to the latest date in the current filter context. It removes all date filters, then re-applies a filter to include only dates up to and including the maximum date within the selection. This provides a running balance up to the specified date.

**Data Sources**
- G/L Entry

### Balance at Date (Neg)
**Formula**   
The Balance at Date (Neg) measure, abbreviated for Balance at Date (Negative), shows the [Balance at Date](#balance-at-date) measure as a negative value.

*Balance at Date (Neg) = [Balance at Date](#balance-at-date) x -1*

**Data Sources**
- G/L Entry

### Net Change
**Formula**   
The Net Change measure is a filtered version of [Amount](#amount), focusing on non-closing entries to show only the net activity. Net Change filters out entries where **Closing Entry** is TRUE, excluding closing entries from its calculation.

**Data Sources**
- G/L Entry

### Net Change (Neg)
**Formula**   
The Net Change (Neg) measure, abbreviated for Net Change (Negative), shows the [Net Change](#net-change) measure as a negative value.

*Net Change (Neg) = [Net Change](#net-change) x -1*

**Data Sources**
- G/L Entry

### Variance to Budget
**Formula**   
The Variance to Budget measure calculates the difference between the actual net change and the budget amount.

*Variance to Budget = [Net Change](#net-change) - [Budget Amount](#budget-amount)*

**Formula**   
*Variance to Budget % = [Variance to Budget](#variance-to-budget) / [Net Change](#net-change)*

**Data Sources**
- G/L Entry
- G/L Budget Entry

## G/L Budget Entry Measures
- [Budget Amount](#budget-amount)
- [Budget Amount at Date](#budget-amount-at-date)

### Budget Amount
**Formula**   
The Budget Amount measure sums up all the budgeted amounts from the G/L Budget Entry table.

**Data Sources**
- G/L Budget Entry

### Budget Amount at Date
**Formula**   
The Budget Balance at Date measure calculates the budgeted balance at a specific date.

**Data Sources**

# Pick for production, assembly, or projects in basic warehouse configurations

How you pick components for production, projects, or assembly orders depends on how your warehouse is set up as a location. Learn more at [Setting Up Warehouse Management](warehouse-setup-warehouse.md).

In a basic warehouse configuration for the outbound flow (pick), on the **Location Card** page for the location, activate following settings:

* Production, select **Inventory Pick/Movement** in the **Prod. Consumption Whse. Handling** field.
* Assembly, select **Inventory Movement** in the **Asm. Consumption Whse. Handling** field.
* Project management, select **Inventory Pick** in the **Project Consumption Whse. Handling** field.

Use the following documents for internal operations:

* Inventory pick
* Inventory movement

## Inventory picks

* When you register an inventory pick for an internal operation, such as production or a project, the consumption of the picked components is posted at the same time.

* The **Bin Mandatory** toggle on the **Location Card** page is optional.
* When you use inventory picks, the **Bin Code** field on a production order component line or project planning lines defines the *take* bin. Components are decreased in the take bin when you post consumption.

## Inventory movements

* Inventory movements require that you turn on the **Bin Mandatory** toggle on the **Location Card** page for the location.
* Inventory movements only work with production order component lines and assembly order lines.
* When you register an inventory movement for an internal operation, you only record the physical movement of the components to a bin in the operation area. You don't post consumption.
* When you use inventory movements, the **Bin Code** field on production order component lines defines the *place* bin in the operation area. The place bin is where warehouse employees must place the components.
* Register the consumption of the picked components separately by posting a consumption journal or assembly order.

### Production

Use **Inventory Pick** documents for picking production components in the flow to production.

For a location that uses bins, you can extend the flow to production by using **Inventory Movement** documents. Inventory movements are especially useful for component flushing. To learn more about how component consumption is flushed from the To-Production or Open Shop Floor Bins, go to [Flushing Production Components in a Basic Warehouse Configuration](#flushing-production-components-in-a-basic-warehouse-configuration).

#### Over-picking in production

[!INCLUDE [manufacturing-overpicks](includes/manufacturing-overpicks.md)]

### Assembly  

Use **Inventory Movement** documents to move assembly components to the assembly area.

> [!NOTE]
> **Inventory Movement** documents require bins.

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports assemble-to-stock and assemble-to-order types of assembly flows. To learn more about assemble-to-order in the outbound warehouse flow, go to [Handling Assemble-to-Order Items with Inventory Picks](warehouse-how-to-pick-items-with-inventory-picks.md#handling-assemble-to-order-items-with-inventory-picks).

### Project management  

Use **Inventory Pick** documents to pick project components in the flow to project management.

For locations that use bins, you can extend the flow to project with **Inventory Movement** documents.

> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses the value in the **Remaining Quantity** field on the project planning line when it creates inventory picks. To use inventory picks for projects, you must turn on the **Apply Usage Link** toggle on the **Project Card** page for the projects. This setting lets you track usage against your plan. If you don't turn on the toggle, the remaining quantity stays at **0** and the inventory pick isn't created. To learn more, go to [To set up project usage tracking](projects-how-setup-jobs.md?tabs=current-experience#to-set-up-project-usage-tracking).

## Pick or move for production, assembly, and projects in a basic warehouse configuration

You can create an inventory pick or inventory movement in three ways:  

* From the source document itself.  
* For several source documents at the same time by using a batch job.  
* In two steps. Release the source document to make the source document ready for picking. Create the inventory pick or movement from the **Inventory Pick** or **Inventory Movement** documents. The inventory pick or movement are based on the source document.  

### To create an inventory pick from the source document

1. On the source document, which can be a production order or project, choose the **Create Inventory Put-away/Pick** action.  
2. Select the **Create Invt. Pick** checkbox.
3. Choose the **OK** button.

### To create an inventory movement from the source document

1. On the source document, which can be a production order, assembly order, or project, choose the **Create Inventory Put-away/Pick** action.  
2. Select the **Create Invt. Movement** checkbox.
3. Choose the **OK** button.

### To create multiple inventory picks or movements with a batch job

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Create Inventory Put-away/Pick/Movement**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Warehouse Request** FastTab, use the **Source Document** and **Source No.** fields to filter on types of documents or ranges of document numbers. For example, you might create picks only for productions orders.
3. On the **Options** FastTab, turn on the **Create Invt. Pick** or **Create Invt. Movement** toggles.
4. Choose the **OK** button.

### To create inventory picks or movements in two steps

To pick or move components for source documents in two steps, you must release the source document to make it ready for picking. Release source documents for internal operations in the following ways.  

|Source Document|Release Method|  
|---------------------|--------------------|  
|Production Order|On the **Planned Production Order** page, change the status of an order to **Released**, or use the **Released Production Order** page to create a released production order.|  
|Assembly Order|Change status of an assembly order to **Released**.|
|Projects | Change a project's status to **Open**, or create project with status Open right away.|  

A warehouse employee assigned to picking items can create an inventory put-away document for the source document.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Inventory Picks** or **Inventory Movement**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. In the **Source Document** field, select the type of source document that the put-away is for.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You can't use **Inventory Pick** documents for picking assembly components.
4. In the **Source No.** field, select the source document.  
5. Alternatively, choose the **Get Source Document** action to select the document from a list of inbound source documents that are ready for picking at the location.  
6. Choose the **OK** button to fill the pick or movement lines according to the selected source document.  

## To record the inventory pick

1. On the **Inventory Pick** page, open the document to record a pick for.  
2. In the **Bin Code** field on the pick lines, the bin where the items must be picked from the bin where the item is available. You can change the bin if needed.
3. Perform the pick, and then enter the pick quantity in the **Qty. to Handle** field.

    If you must pick the items for a line from more than one bin, for example because a bin doesn't contain the full quantity, use the **Split Line** action on the **Lines** FastTab. The action creates a line for the remaining quantity to handle.  
4. Choose the **Post** action.  

The following things happen during the posting process:

* Post the consumption of the source document lines that were picked.
* If the location uses bins, posting creates warehouse entries to post the changes to the bin quantity.

[!INCLUDE [preview-posting-warehouse](includes/preview-posting-warehouse.md)]

## To record the inventory movement

1. On the **Inventory Movement** page, open the document to record a movement for.  
2. In the **Bin Code** field on the movement lines, the bin to pick from is suggested based on the item's default bin and availability. You can change the bin if needed.  
3. Perform the move, and then enter the moved quantity in the **Qty. to Handle** field. The value on the Take and the Place lines must be the same. Otherwise, you can't register the movement.

    If you must take the items for a line from more than one bin, for example because a bin doesn't contain the full quantity, use the **Split Line** action on the **Lines** FastTab. The action creates a line for the remaining quantity to handle.  
4. Choose the **Register Invt. Movement** action.  

The following things happen during the posting process:

* Warehouse entries now indicate that the components are in the bins specified on the source document order lines. For example, the assembly order, production component, or project planning line.

>[!NOTE]
> Unlike when you move components with inventory picks, consumption isn't posted when you register an inventory movement. You register consumption as a separate step by posting the source document.

## Flushing production components in a basic warehouse configuration

Flushing methods affect the flow of components in production. Learn more at [Flush Components According to Operation Output](production-how-to-flush-components-according-to-operation-output.md). Depending on the flushing method you select, you can pick components for production in the following ways:

* Use an **Inventory Pick** document to record the pick for items that use the **Pick + Manual** flushing method. When you register an inventory pick, the consumption of the picked components is posted.
* Use an **Inventory Movement** document without a reference to a source document or other ways to record the movement of components that use the **Manual** flushing method. You must register consumption separately. Learn more at [Batch Post Production Consumption](production-how-to-post-consumption.md).

### Example

You have a production order for 15 PCS of item SP-SCM1004. Some of the items on the component list must be flushed manually in a consumption journal, and other items can be picked and flushed automatically using the **Pick + Backward** flushing method.  

The following steps provide an example of the actions that different people take and the related responses:  

1. The shop floor supervisor releases the production order. Items with **Forward** flushing method and no routing link are deducted from the open shop floor bin.  
2. The shop floor supervisor chooses the **Create Inventory Put-away/Pick** action on the production order and turns on the **Create Invt. Pick** and **Create Invt. Movement** toggles. An inventory pick document is created for items with **Manual** flushing method, and an inventory movement is created for items with **Pick + Backward** and **Pick + Forward** flushing methods.
3. The warehouse manager assigns the picks and movements to a warehouse employee.
4. The warehouse employee picks the items from the appropriate bins and places them in the To-Production bin or in the bin specified on the inventory movement. The bin can be a work center or machine center bin.  
5. The warehouse employee posts the pick. The quantity is deducted from the bins.
6. The warehouse employee posts the movement. The quantity is deducted from the pick bins and added to the consumption bin. The **Qty. Picked** field on the component list for all picked items is updated.  
7. The machine operator informs the production manager that the end items are finished.  
8. The shop floor supervisor uses the output journal or production journal to post the output. The quantity of component items that use **Pick + Forward** or **Pick + Backward** flushing methods with routing links is deducted from the To-Production bin.
9. The production manager changes the status of the production order to **Finished**. The quantity of component items that use **Backward** flushing method is deducted from the open shop floor bin, and the quantity of component items that use **Pick + Backward** flushing method and no routing link is deducted from the To-Production bin.  

 The following illustration shows when the **Bin Code** field on the component list is filled according to your location or machine/work center setup.

# Restructure Warehouses
You may want to restructure your warehouse with new bin codes and new bin characteristics. You will not undertake this kind of activity very often, but situations can occur where a reclassification is necessary to achieve or maintain a more efficient operation. For example:  

- You might want to switch to bin codes that support the use of automatic data capture, for example, with hand-held devices.  
- The warehouse may have purchased a new rack system that gives new possibilities in item storage.  
- The company may have altered its item assortment and moved the warehouse to a new physical location to accommodate this change.  

If your warehouse is set up to use bins but not directed put-away and pick, restructure your warehouse by creating the new bins that you want to use in the future.  

## To restructure a basic warehouse that uses bins only  
1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Locations**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  On the **Warehouse** FastTab, set the **Default Bin Selection** field to **Last-Used Bin**.  
3.  Move all the contents of your current bins to the new bins that you have just created.  

    1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Item Reclassification Journal**, and then choose the related link.  
    2.  Select a journal line, and then choose the **Get Bin Content** action.  
    3.  On the **Bin Content** FastTab, set filters in the **Location Code**, **Bin Code**, and **Item No.** fields to specify the content that you want to move.  
    4.  Choose the **OK** button to fill a journal line.  
    5.  In the **New Bin Code** field, select the bin to which the items should be moved.  
    6.  Repeat steps b through e for all bin content that you want to move.  
    7.  Choose the **Post** action.  

You have now emptied the bins where the items used to be. The default bins for your items have now been changed to the new bins.  

## To restructure an advanced warehouse that uses directed put-away and pick  

1.  Create the new bins that you want to use in the future. For more information, see [Create Bins](warehouse-how-to-create-individual-bins.md).  
2.  Move all the contents of your current bins to the new bins that you just created.  

    1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Warehouse Reclassification Journal**, and then choose the related link.  
    2.  For the bins where no real movement of items is involved, create a line for each of your current bins in the **Warehouse Reclassification Journal** with the old bin code, **From Bin Code**, and the new bin code, **To Bin Code**.  
    3.  If some of the movements involve actual physical movements that you want employees to perform, use **Movement Worksheets** to prepare movement instructions instead of using the warehouse reclassification journal. For more information, see [Move Items in Advanced Warehouse Configurations](warehouse-how-to-move-items-in-advanced-warehousing.md).  

3.  When the old bins are emptied, reclassify them as **QC** type bins to ensure that they are not included in item flows.  

    1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Locations**, and then choose the related link.  
    2.  Select the line with the location, and then choose the **Bins** action.  
    3.  On the **Bins** page, in the **Bin Type Code** field, enter **QC** for each of the old bins that you emptied in step 3 in the previous procedure.  

You have now removed the bins from the warehouse flow, and reclassified them as QC bins. QC bins have none of the activity fields on the **Bin Types** page selected and are therefore not considered by the item flow. For more information, see [Set Up Bin Types](warehouse-how-to-set-up-bin-types.md).  

## To delete a bin  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Locations**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Select the location where you want to delete bins. Choose the **Bins** action.  
3.  Select the lines for the bins that you want to delete.  
4.  Choose the **Delete** action.  

If you choose the **Yes** button, the bin is deleted for use in the future, but the bin code in all warehouse entries remains the same.  

If you want to rename a bin so that all records associated with the bin are also renamed, including bin contents, warehouse activity lines, registered warehouse activity lines, warehouse worksheet lines, warehouse receipt lines, posted warehouse receipt lines, warehouse shipment lines, posted warehouse shipment lines, and warehouse entries, you can do so on the **Bins** page.  

## To rename a bin and change the bin code in all records  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Locations**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Select the location where you want to rename a bin or change the bin code, and then choose the **Bins** action.  
3.  Select the bin that you want to change and enter a new bin code in the **Code** field.  
4.  Choose the **Yes** button.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  If you choose **Yes** and there are many entries concerning this bin, for example, because you have not deleted warehouse documents for some time, it may take some time to rename all the records. Therefore, if you use this method, consider running the batch job **Delete Registered Whse. Documents** before you start the renaming process. Also note that the only documents that are deleted in this batch job are put-aways, picks, and movements.  
>   
>  If you are renaming a receiving bin or a shipping bin, all the posted receipts or shipments that refer to the bin in question are renamed.

# Set up approval users

Before you can create workflows that involve approval steps, you must set up the users who are involved in approval processes on the **Approval User Setup** page. You can also set amount limits for different types of requests, define substitute approvers, and set up notifications.  

After you set up approval users, you can create workflow responses for approval workflows. Learn more at [Create Approval Workflows](across-how-to-create-workflows.md).  

> [!TIP]
> You can require that multiple approvers react to an approval request by creating a group of approvers on the **Workflow User Group** page. Learn more at [Set Up Workflow User Groups](across-how-to-set-up-workflow-users.md).  

## To set up an approval user

[!INCLUDE [workflow-requestor-approver](includes/workflow-requestor-approver.md)]

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Approval User Setup**, then choose the related link.  
2. Create a new line on the **Approval User Setup** page, and then fill the fields as described in the following table.  

   |Field|Description|
   |-----|-----------|
   |**User ID**|Select the user ID of the person involved in the approval process.|
   |**Salespers./Purch. Code**|Specify the salesperson or purchaser code that applies to the user.<br /><br /> You typically fill in the **Salespers./Purch. Code** field if the salesperson or purchaser responsible for the customer or vendor is also the person who must approve a sales or purchase request.|
   |**Approver ID**|Select the user ID of the person who must approve requests made by the person you specified in the **User ID** field.|
   |**Sales Amount Approval Limit**|Specify the maximum sales amount in local currency (LCY) that the person selected in the **User ID** field can approve.|
   |**Unlimited Sales Approval**|Specify that the person identified in the **User ID** field can approve all sales requests regardless of the amount.<br /><br /> If you select this checkbox, you can't fill in the **Sales Amount Approval Limit** field.|
   |**Purchase Amount Approval Limit**|Specify the maximum purchase amount in LCY that the person identified in the **User ID** field can approve.|
   |**Unlimited Purchase Approval**|Specify that the person identified in the **User ID** field can approve all purchase requests regardless of the amount.<br /><br /> If you select this checkbox, you can't fill in the **Purchase Amount Approval Limit** field.|
   |**Request Amount Approval Limit**|Specify the maximum amount in LCY that the person identified in the **User ID** field can approve for purchase quotes.<br /><br /> To use this field, you must select the **Approver Chain** option in the **Approver Limit Type** field on the **Workflow Response** page.|
   |**Unlimited Request Approval**|Specify that the person identified in the **User ID** field can approve all purchase quotes regardless of the amount.<br /><br /> If you select this checkbox, you can't fill in the **Request Amount Approval Limit** field.|
   |**Substitute**|Select the user ID of the person who will approve requests made by the person identified in the **User ID** field if the user in the **Approver ID** isn't available. <br /><br />**Note:**  The substitute can either be the user in the **Substitute** field, the direct approver, or the approval administrator, in that order of priority. Learn more at [Use Approval Workflows](across-how-use-approval-workflows.md).|
   |**Email**|Specify the email address of the person in the **User ID** field.|
   |**Approval Administrator**|Specify the user who has permission to unblock approval workflow, such as by delegating approval requests to new substitute approvers or deleting overdue approval requests.<br /><br />**Note** Only one person can be the approval administrator.|

3. To test the approval user setup, choose the **Approval User Setup Test** action.  
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for every person you want to set up as an approval user.  

The next step is to specify how you want [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to notify people that a request is pending their attention. Learn more at [Setting Up Workflow Notifications](across-setting-up-workflow-notifications.md).

# Change which features are displayed

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is designed to help you run your business regardless of the size and complexity. At the core of the product, you find essential features, such as financial reporting, sales, purchasing, and inventory management. As business complexity increases, you can turn on functionality for manufacturing and service management, for example.

You can define the product complexity level, and thereby which features the company's users get access to, by changing the **Experience** setting on the **Company Information** page. Note that the experience setting can also be changed by adding certain extensions from AppSource. For more information, see [Customizing [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Using Extensions](ui-extensions.md).

The following table lists the experiences that are currently available.

| Experience | Impact on User Interface |
| --- | --- |
| **Essential** |Shows all actions and fields for all common business functionality.|
| **Premium** |Shows all actions and fields for all business functionality, including Manufacturing and Service Management.|

The experiences that can be selected in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] reflect the solution licenses, called plans, that are defined for the product. For information about the Essential and Premium plans, see [Business Central](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2264940) on the Microsoft Dynamics 365 marketing site. See also the [[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Licensing Guide](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2264939).

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Users of type Team Member, Internal Admin, External Accountant, and Delegated Admin can be assigned a different plan than other users in the solution. Only users of type Evaluation or Premium can change the value in the **Experience** field from Essential to Premium.

> [!NOTE]
> In 2024 release wave 1, a user with the Premium plan can sign in to a company that's using the Essentials plan. However, the Premium user can't use any of the features that the Premium license provides. The same isn't true in the opposite direction. Users who have the Essentials plan can't sign in to a company that's using the Premium plan.

Prior to defining a company's experience setting, you define users' access to specific functions and pages by assigning permission sets. For more information, see [Assign Permissions to Users and Groups](ui-define-granular-permissions.md).

The **Experience** setting applies to all users in a company, but each user can personalize their own experience further by changing page layouts and content. For more information, see [Personalize Your Workspace](ui-personalization-user.md).

## Enabling premium features after upgrading a plan

Users are assigned to plans in Microsoft 365 Admin Center in connection with the general work to create the Business Central users. For more information, see [Add users and assign licenses at the same time](/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/add-users?view=o365-worldwide&preserve-view=true).

### To update plan changes in users groups

[!INCLUDE [2023rw1-sec-group-short](includes/2023rw1-sec-group-short.md)]

When you have made a change to users plans in Microsoft 365 Admin Center, such as assigned more users to the Premium plan, you must update [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to reflect the change.

1. Sign is as an administrator.
2. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Users**, and then choose the related link.
3. On the **Users** page, choose the **Update users from Microsoft 365** action.

### To select the Premium experience

You can now proceed to select the new experience.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Company Information**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Company Information** page, on the **User Experience** FastTab, select Premium  in the **Experience** field.

## Help assumes the Premium experience

All feature descriptions in user documentation for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] assume the **Premium** experience, meaning the descriptions cover the full scope of UI elements.

# Sales Quick Start

To be able to sell products and services, you must first set up items and customers. Once that is done, you can start registering sales orders and sending out invoices.

## Set up items to sell

This video shows how to set up an item to sell in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

<br>

> [!Video https://learn-video.azurefd.net/vod/player?id=a5e825b2-e309-4753-bdff-a6947dc314e6]

### Set up a new item

[!INCLUDE[create_new_item](includes/create_new_item.md)]

For more information and additional things you can do when setting up items, see [Register New Items](inventory-how-register-new-items.md).  

## Set up customers

This video shows how to set up a new customer in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

<br>

> [!VIDEO https://learn-video.azurefd.net/vod/player?id=37d3ec2a-71c2-4f0d-9a94-62c83805fbfa]

### Set up a new customer

[!INCLUDE[create_new_customer](includes/create_new_customer.md)]

For more information and additional things you can do when setting up customers, see [Register New Customers](sales-how-register-new-customers.md)

## Create a sales order  

When you sell something to a customer, you have two options. The first, and simplest, is to just create a sales invoice. However, if your sales process is more complex, for example if you have situations where you only ship parts of an order quantity, you use a sales order.

### To create a sales order  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 10.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Orders**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select **New** to create a new entry.
3. In the **Customer** field, enter the name of an existing customer.

    Other fields on the **Sales Order** page are now filled with the standard information of the selected customer.  

4. Fill in the remaining fields on the **Sales Order** page as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

5. On the **Lines** FastTab, in the **Type** field, select what type of product, charge, or transaction that you will post for the customer with the sales line.

6. In the **No.** field, enter the number of an inventory item or service.

7. In the **Quantity** field, enter the number of items to be sold.

8. In the **Line Discount %** field, enter a percentage if you want to grant the customer a discount on the product.

9. To add a comment about the order line that the customer can see on the printed sales order, write a comment in the **Description** field on an empty line.

10. Repeat steps 5 through 9 for every item that you want to sell to the customer.

11. To only ship a part of the order quantity, enter that quantity in the **Qty. to Ship** field. The value is copied to the **Qty. to Invoice** field.

12. To only invoice a part of the shipped quantity, enter that quantity in the **Qty. to Invoice** field. The quantity must be lower than the value in the **Qty. to Ship** field.

13. When the sales order lines are completed, choose the **Post and Send** action.

For more information and additional things you can do when creating customer sales orders, see [Sell Products with a Customer Sales Order](sales-how-sell-products.md).  

## Create a sales invoice

When you create and post a sales invoice, you not only create the invoice document you send to the customer, you also create the related quantity and value entries in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

### To create and post a sales invoice  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 20.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Invoices**, and then choose the related link.  

2. Select **New** to create a new entry.

3. In the **Customer** field, enter the name of an existing customer.

4. Fill in the remaining fields on the **Sales Invoice** page as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

5. On the **Lines** FastTab, in the **Type** field, select what type of product, charge, or transaction that you will post for the customer with the sales line.

6. In the **No.** field, select a record to post according to the value in the **Type** field.

7. In the **Quantity** field, enter how many units of the product, charge, or transaction that the line will record for the customer.  

8. If you want to give a discount, enter a percentage in the **Line Discount %** field. The value in the **Line Amount** field updates accordingly.  

9. Repeat steps 5 through 8 for every product or charge that you want to invoice the customer for.  

10. In the **Invoice Discount Amount** field, enter an amount that should be deducted from the value shown in the **Total Incl. Tax** field.

11. When the sales invoice lines are completed, choose the **Post and Send** action.  

For more information and additional things you can do when creating customer sales invoices, see [Invoice Sales](sales-how-invoice-sales.md)

# Set Up Multiple Interest Rates for Delayed Payment

You can use different interest rates for different periods for delayed payments in trade transactions. [!INCLUDE [multiple-interest-rates-def](includes/multiple-interest-rates-def.md)]

For example, a government specifies the maximum interest to be levied for a consumer. This interest rate can be changed twice a year on 01 January and 01 July. The interest rate between businesses (B2B) is agreed by the parties and there is no limit to that customer group. The announced rate is usually four percent more than the normal bank interest.

When you create finance charge terms and reminder terms, for delayed payment penalty, you can specify multiple interest rates so that the penalty fee is calculated from different interest rates in different periods.  

## To set up multiple interest rates

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Finance Charge Terms**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Finance Charge Terms** page, select the required finance term, and then choose the **Interest Rates** action.  
3. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
4. Choose the **OK** button.  
5. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Reminder Terms**, and then choose the related link.  
6. On the **Reminder Terms** page, select the required reminder term, and then choose the **Levels** action.  
7. On the **Reminder Levels** page, for the relevant reminder levels, select the **Calculate Interest** field.  

When you issue a finance charge memo, the memo shows the finance charges with multiple interest rates for a specific time period. The memo also contains the contact details of the customer, the company issuing the memo, the additional amount, and the total amount. The opening entry on the memo is displayed in bold. The finance charges are calculated with multiple interest rates for a specific time period and are printed after the opening entry of the memo.

# Update currency exchange rates

If you trade in different currencies, you need to keep track of the changes in currency exchange rates. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] helps you manage and update the exchange rates manually or automatically and set up a currency exchange rate service.

## Currencies

> [!TIP]  
> In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can find real-time information about foreign exchange (FX) rates or historical rates under the term currency. For more information, see [Set Up an Additional Reporting Currency](finance-how-setup-additional-currencies.md).

[!INCLUDE [finance-currencies-def](includes/finance-currencies-def.md)]

You can specify the currency codes in the **Currencies** list, including extra information and settings that are necessary for each currency code. For more information, see [Currencies](finance-set-up-currencies.md#curr)

### Example of a receivable currency transaction

[!INCLUDE [finance-currencies-example](includes/finance-currencies-example.md)]

## Exchange rates

The exchange rates are the tool to calculate the local currency value (LCY) of each currency transaction. The **Currency Exchange Rates** page includes the following fields:

|Field|Description|  
|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
|**Starting Date**|The date when the currency rate was effective.|  
|**Currency Code**|The currency code related to this exchange rate.|  
|**Relational Currency Code**|If this currency is part of a triangular currency calculation, then you can set up the related currency code here.|  
|**Exchange Rate Amount**|The exchange rate amount is the rate for the currency code selected on the line. Normally 1 or 100.|  
|**Relational Exch. Rate Amount**|The relational exchange rate amount relates to the rate to use for the relational currency code.|  
|**Adjustment Exch. Rate Amount**|The rate for the currency code selected on the line for the use of the **Adjust Exchange Rates** batch job.|  
|**Relational Adjmt Exch. Rate Amt**|The rate for the currency code selected on the line for the use of the **Adjust Exchange Rates** batch job.|  
|**Fix Exchange Rate Amount**|Specifies if the currency's exchange rate can be changed on invoices and journal lines.|  

In general, the values of the **Exchange Rate Amount** and **Relational Exchange Rate Amount** fields are used as the default currency rate on all new receivables and payables documents that are created going forward. The document is assigned the currency rate according to the current working date.  

> [!Note]
> The actual currency rate is calculated using this formula:
>
> `Currency Amount = Amount / Exchange Rate Amount * Relational Exch. Rate Amount`

The adjustment exchange rate amount, or the relational adjustment exchange rate amount, updates all open bank, receivables, or payables transactions.  

> [!Note]
> The actual currency rate is calculated using this formula:
>
> `Currency Amount = Amount / Adjustment Exch. Rate Amount * Relational Adjmt Exch. Rate Amt`

## Adjust exchange rates

Because exchange rates fluctuate constantly, you need to adjust other currency equivalents periodically. If you don't, amounts you converted from foreign (or other) currencies and posted to the general ledger in local currency can be incorrect. Also, you need to update daily entries posted before you enter a daily exchange rate.

You can use the **Adjust Exchange Rates** batch job to manually adjust the exchange rates for posted customer, vendor, and bank account entries. The batch job can also update other reporting currency amounts on G/L entries.  

> [!TIP]
> You can use a service to update exchange rates automatically. For more information, see [To set up a currency exchange rate service](finance-how-update-currencies.md#set-up-a-currency-exchange-rate-service). However, this doesn't adjust exchange rates on already posted transactions. To update exchange rates on posted entries, use the **Adjust Exchange Rates** batch job.

You can also specify how the adjustment handles dimensions for unrealized gains and losses postings by choosing one of the following options in the **Dimension Posting** field:  

* **Source Entry Dimensions**: Transfer dimension values for G/L entries for unrealized gains and losses from the entry you're adjusting.  
* **No Dimensions**: Don't transfer dimension values for unrealized gains and losses to G/L entries. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] still uses default dimension settings, for example, **Code Mandatory**, **Same Code**, or **No Code**. If the source transaction entries have dimension values, the adjustment creates entries without dimension values.  
* **G/L Account Dimensions**: Transfer dimension values from the unrealized gains and losses G/L account's dimension settings source entry to G/L entries.

> [!NOTE]
> To use the preview capability, you need to turn on the **Feature Update: Enable use of new extensible exchange rate adjustment, including posting review** feature on the **[Feature Management](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=2610)** page.

> [!NOTE]
> This capability isn't available in the Swiss version right now, but it's coming soon. We're working on it.

## Preview the effect of an adjustment

You can preview the effect that an exchange rate adjustment has on posting before you actually post by choosing the **Preview Posting** action on the **Exch. Rates Adjustment** report (Report 596) request page. On the request page, you can specify what to include in the preview:

* Get a detailed posting to the general ledger by entry.
* Get a summarized posting by currency. Just pick the **Adjust per entry** field on the **Exch. Rates Adjustment** report.

### Effect on customers and vendors

For customer and vendor accounts, the batch job uses the exchange rate that was valid on the posting date specified for the batch job to adjust the currency. The batch job calculates the differences for the individual currency balances and posts the amounts to the general ledger account that is specified in the **Unrealized Gains Acc.** field or the **Unrealized Losses Acc.** field on the **Currencies** page. Balancing entries are automatically posted to the receivables/payables account in the general ledger.

The batch job processes all open customer ledger entries and vendor ledger entries. If there's an exchange rate difference for an entry, the batch job creates a new detailed customer or vendor ledger entry. The new entry reflects the adjusted amount on the customer or vendor ledger entry.

#### Dimensions on customer and vendor ledger entries

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] assigns the dimensions from the customer or vendor ledger entries to the adjustment entries, and posts adjustments for each combination of dimension values.

### Effect on bank accounts

For bank accounts, the batch job adjusts the currency by using the exchange rate that is valid on the posting date specified in the batch job. The batch job calculates the differences for each bank account that has a currency code and posts the amounts to the general ledger account that is specified in the **Realized Gains Acc.** field or the **Realized Losses Acc.** field on the **Currencies** page. Balancing entries are automatically posted to the general ledger bank accounts that are specified in the bank account posting groups. The batch job calculates one entry per currency per posting group.

#### Dimensions on bank account entries

The adjustment entries for the bank account's general ledger account and the gain/loss account are assigned the bank account's default dimensions.

### Effect on G/L accounts

If you post in another reporting currency, the batch job can create new general ledger entries for currency adjustments between the local currency and the other reporting currency. The batch job calculates the differences for each general ledger entry. It adjusts the general ledger entry depending on the contents of the **Exchange Rate Adjustment** field for each general ledger account.

#### Dimensions on G/L account entries

The adjustment entries are assigned the default dimensions from the accounts they're posted to.

> [!Important]
> Before you can use the batch job, you need to enter the adjustment exchange rates that are used to adjust the foreign currency balances. You do so on the **Currency Exchange Rates** page.<br><br>  

> [!Video https://learn-video.azurefd.net/vod/player?id=e871f958-fe42-4cf3-bb8a-e97f4c7658de]

## Set up a currency exchange rate service

You can use an external service to keep your currency exchange rates up to date.

> [!NOTE]
> Most exchange rate services provide data that is compatible with the import process in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. However, sometimes the data is formatted differently and you need to customize your import process. You can use the data exchange framework to do that by adding your own codeunit. You'll probably need some help from a developer to do that. For more information, see [Set Up Data Exchange Definitions](across-how-to-set-up-data-exchange-definitions.md).

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Currency Exchange Rate Services**, and then select the related link.
2. Select the **New** action.
3. On the **Currency Exchange Rate Service** page, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
4. Map the fields from the XML file to the currency exchange rates table in the source field.
5. Apply any necessary transformation rules.
6. Turn on the **Enabled** toggle to enable the service.

> [!NOTE]
> The following video shows how you can connect to a currency exchange rate service, using the European Central Bank as an example. In the segment that describes how to set up field mappings, the setting in the **Source** column for the **Parent Node for Currency Code**  only returns the first currency found. The setting should be `/gesmes:Envelope/Code/Code/Code`.

<br><br>  
  
> [!Video https://learn-video.azurefd.net/vod/player?id=76914b80-c36a-4d74-95fa-0cdf5c5c0bfa]

## Update currency exchange rates through a service

Follow the steps given to update the currency exchange rates through a service:

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Currencies**, and then select the related link.
2. Select the **Update Exchange Rates** action.

## Correct mistakes

Every now and then you might need to correct a mistake in a payment transaction that's associated with adjustments to foreign currency gains and losses. You can use the **Reverse transaction** action on the **Bank Account Ledger Entries**, **Customer Ledger Entries**, and **Vendor Ledger Entries** pages to unapply and reverse the payment transaction.

> [!NOTE]
> When you unapply and reverse a payment for an entry that had currency exchange rate adjustments associated with it, the reversal posts reversal entries for the adjustments. You might have to run the currency exchange rate adjustment again to get the correct current balance.

# Service Order Status and Repair Status

The **Status** field on the **Service Order** page and the service item repair status, which is represented by the **Repair Status Code** field on the **Service Order** page have a certain relationship in Service Management. The service order status reflects the repair status of all the service items in the service order.  

> [!NOTE]  
> These two status field are not related to the **Release Status** field on the service order header, which determines how the warehouse handles service items.  

Each time the repair status of a service item is changed in a service order, the status of the order is updated. To display the status that reflects the overall repair status of the individual service items, you must specify the following:  

* The service order status that each repair status is linked to.  
* The level of priority of each service order status option.  

When you convert a service quote to a service order, the repair status of each service item is changed in the order to **Initial** and the service order status is changed to **Pending**.  

> [!NOTE]
> Before you can create service orders, you must set up repair statuses and service status priorities. For more information, see [Set Up Statuses for Service Orders and Repairs](service-order-repair-status.md).

## Specifying Service Order Status for Repair Status

Each repair status is linked to a particular service order status. The options for the service order status are as follows:

* **Pending**
* **In Process**
* **On Hold**
* **Finished**

The repair status options are as follows:

* **Initial**
* **In Process**
* **Referred**
* **Partly Serviced**
* **Quote Finished**
* **Waiting for Customer**
* **Spare Part Ordered**
* **Spare Part Received**
* **Finished**  

### Pending

The service order status **Pending** indicates that the service can start or continue at any time. Therefore, the repair status options of **Initial**, **Referred**, **Partly Serviced**, and **Spare Part Received** can be linked to this service order status.  

### In Process

The service order status **In Process** indicates that the service is in process. Therefore, the repair status options **In Process** and **Spare Part Ordered** can both be linked to this service order status. If you link the **Spare Part Ordered** status to an **In Process** service order status, you must also link the **Spare Part Received** status to this service order status.  

### On Hold

The service order status **On Hold** indicates that the service is temporarily on hold because you are waiting for a customer response or spare parts before the service can start. Therefore, the repair status options of **Quote Finished**, **Spare Part Ordered**, and **Waiting for Customer** can be linked to this service order status.  

### Finished

The service order status **Finished** indicates that the service has been completed. Therefore, the **Finished** repair status is linked to this status.  

## Assigning Priority to Service Order Status

When a repair status of a service item is changed, the service order status options linked to the different repair status options of all the service items in the order are identified. If the service items are linked to two or more service order status options, the service order status option with the highest priority is selected.  

You must decide which service order status contains the most important information about the status of the service order and assign that status the highest priority, and so on.  

Then, when you create a new service order and you add service items to it, the **Priority** field on the service order header is updated based on the priorities on the service items.  

### Example

A typical priority level assignment could be as follows:  

* In Process - High  
* Pending - Medium high  
* On Hold - Medium low  
* Finished - Low  

For example, if one service item has the repair status **Initial**, linked to the service order status **Pending**, another has the repair status **In Process**, linked to the service order status **In Process**, and a third has the repair status **Spare Part Ordered**, linked to the service order status **On Hold**, the resulting service order status will be **In Process** because this has the highest priority.

# Allocated Hours (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Allocated Hours** report gives an overview of the allocated time, in hours, for each work center. The view of allocated hours can help you identify over and underused work centers. Additionally, the report includes indicators such as the load percentage, allocated time (hours), and capacity available (hours) for a quick summary of resource use.

:::image type="content" source="media/manufacturing/allocated-hours.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Allocated Hours Power BI Report" lightbox="media/manufacturing/allocated-hours.png":::

## Use the report

Manufacturing managers use the report to plan and allocate resources effectively. The data shows which work centers are over or underutilized, so you can make informed decisions about how to allocate resources.

For example, if you notice that a work center is underused, you can assign more work orders to that center to optimize the use of its resources. Conversely, if a work center is over utilized, you can reallocate work orders or consider adding more resources to that work center.

Manufacturing workers use this report to optimize the use of resources. You can analyze the allocated time in hours of each work center, and then plan your work accordingly.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The *Allocated Hours* report includes the following KPIs and measures: 

- [Load %](manufacturing-powerbi-kpis.md#load)
- [Allocated Time (Hours)](manufacturing-powerbi-kpis.md#allocated-time-hours)
- [Capacity Available (Hours)](manufacturing-powerbi-kpis.md#capacity-available-hours)

[!INCLUDE[click-on-a-kpi-link](includes/click-on-a-kpi-link.md)] 

[!INCLUDE[powerbi-tip-track-kpis](includes/powerbi-tip-track-kpis.md)]

## Data used in the report

The report uses data from the following tables in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]:

- Production Order Capacity Need
- Work Center
- Work Center Group

# Keyboard shortcuts

This article provides an overview of key combinations (keyboard shortcuts) that you can use when you work with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

You can find an overview of the most popular keyboard shortcuts in [Keyboard shortcuts (PC only)](keyboard-shortcuts-cheatsheet.md).

> [!TIP]
> For a graphical view of the most-used keyboard shortcuts, select the following image, and download the PDF file.
>
> [![Icon for the PDF file.](media/keyboard_shortcut_inline.png)](media/keyboard-shortcuts-2024.pdf "Icon that opens a PDF")

## Overview of keyboard shortcuts

Keyboard shortcuts aid accessibility and can make it easier and more efficient to navigate to different areas and elements on a page. Most web browsers support these shortcuts. However, the behavior might vary slightly.

> [!NOTE]
> The keyboard shortcuts that this article describes refer to the English (United States) keyboard layout. The layout of keys on other keyboards doesn't correspond exactly to the layout on a United States English keyboard.

Most of the keyboard shortcuts are the same, regardless of whether the operating system is Windows or macOS. However, some shortcuts differ for macOS. These shortcuts are enclosed in parentheses in the following sections.

> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports only a single character set for data. Therefore, some characters might not be supported in your environment, and you might experience issues if you try to retrieve data that was entered by using a different character set. For example, if your environment supports only English and Russian characters, data might not be stored correctly if you enter it in a language that uses different characters. This issue can also apply to keyboard shortcuts. You should contact your system administrator to ensure that you know which languages your instance of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports.
>
> In addition to the global keyboard shortcuts that this article describes, some business-specific shortcuts are available. For example, in the generic version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the <kbd>F9</kbd> key posts a document, and <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>F7</kbd> shows the ledger entries for a record when you open the record in a card. This article includes some of the more common business-specific shortcuts. Be aware that the shortcuts might differ in your solution. In the user interface, the tooltip for an action shows the keyboard shortcut to use.

## <a name="Keyboard"></a>General keyboard shortcuts

The following table describes the keyboard shortcuts for navigating and accessing different elements of a page. Elements include things like actions, dropdown lists, and lookups. Learn about the shortcuts for navigating records when you're inside a list in the [Keyboard shortcuts in lists](#lists) section.

| Select these keys<br>(these keys in macOS) | To do this |
|---|---|
| <kbd>Alt</kbd> | Show access keys for selecting actions in the action bar and on the navigation menu of the page. Learn more in the [Access keys for action bar and navigation menu](#access-keys-for-action-bar-and-navigation-menu) section. |

| <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> | Copy the value of a field. If the field is in focus, and specific text in the field isn't selected, the entire value is copied. If any text in the field is selected, only that text is copied. |
| <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>F1</kbd> | Open either the [help pane](product-help-and-support.md#help-pane) or a Business Central help article on [Microsoft Learn](/dynamics365/business-central/), depending on your Business Central version. |
| <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>F12</kbd> | Switch between wide and narrow layout views. |
| <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>F5</kbd> | Reload the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] application. (The effect is similar to the effect of selecting the **Refresh** or **Reload** button in the browser.)|
| <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+select | Navigate during personalization or customization when the action is highlighted with an arrowhead. Learn more in [Personalize your workspace](ui-personalization-user.md). |
| <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>F1</kbd> | Open the **Help & Support** page. Learn more in [Help & Support page](product-help-and-support.md#help--support-page). |
| <kbd>F5</kbd> | Update the data on the current page. Use this keyboard shortcut to ensure that the data on the page is updated with any changes that other users make while you're working. |
| <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>O</kbd> | Open the **Available Companies** pane, where can use to switch to another company or environment. Learn more in [Switching to Another Company or Environment](ui-organization-switch.md). |
| <kbd>Enter</kbd> | Enable or access the element or control that is in focus. |
| <kbd>Esc</kbd> | Close the current page or dropdown list. |
| <kbd>Tab</kbd> | Move focus to the next control or element on a page, such as an action, button, field, or list heading. |
| <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd> | Move focus to the previous control or element on a page, such as an action, button, field, or list heading. |
| <kbd>Y</kbd> and <kbd>N</kbd> | <p>Activate the **Yes** and **No** buttons in dialog boxes.</p><p>**Note:** The actual keys vary, depending on your current language. You specify your language on the **My Settings** page. For example, if your current language is German, you select <kbd>J</kbd> to activate the **Ja** ("Yes") button and <kbd>N</kbd> to activate the **Nein** ("No") button. |

## <a name="lists"></a>Keyboard shortcuts in lists

The following table describes the keyboard shortcuts that you can use on a list page. The shortcut actions vary slightly, depending on whether the page is shown in the list view or the tile view.

# Modify planning suggestions in a graphical view

A typical planning activity is to change or add planning worksheet lines to modify the suggested supply orders before you commit them by running the **Carry out Action Message** function. An alternative to doing this in the planning worksheet is to use a graphical view. However, this is currently not supported in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

<!--On the **Item Availability by Timeline** page, you can modify certain supply orders and suggestions by dragging elements on the x-axis to change quantity or dragging elements on the y-axis to change due date.  

When you open the **Item Availability by Timeline** page from the **Planning Worksheet** page, you can make the following changes:  

- Modify a suggested supply order that only exists as a planning line.  
- Modify an existing supply order that the planning system suggests to change.  
- Create a new suggested supply order and modify it.  

For more information about the planning line types that are shown, see the Description field on the **Event Changes** FastTab.  

When you choose **Save Changes** on the **Item Availability by Timeline** page, the modifications that you have made are copied to the planning or requisition worksheet. You can now implement them using the **Carry Out Action Msg.-Plan.** function.  

The following procedure shows how to modify supply suggestions by drag and drop. As an alternative, you can change the **Due Date** and **Quantity** fields on the **Event Changes** FastTab and immediately see the changes graphically on the **Timeline** FastTab on the **Planning Worksheet** page.  

## To modify suggested supply orders in the graphical view

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Planning Worksheet**, and then choose the related link.  

2. Choose the line that you want to see item availability for, choose **Item Availability by**, and then choose **Timeline**.

    The **Item Availability by Timeline** page opens with the item number, location, and variant of the item on the selected planning line prefilled in the **Options** FastTab. The **Timeline** FastTab shows a graphical representation of the item’s projected inventory, including planning suggestions.  

<!--3. Make sure that the **Include Planning Suggestions** field is selected.  
3. Find the suggested supply order that you want to modify. You can identify modifiable elements by the green circle and the disk icon. For more information about the different symbols, see [Symbols and Icons on the Timeline FastTab](#symbols-and-icons-on-the-timeline-fasttab).  
4. Place the pointer over the green circle until it enlarges and the pointer changes to Move shape (four arrows).  
5. Press and hold the mouse button while you drag the pointer up or down to modify the quantity. Press and hold the mouse button while you drag the pointer left or right to modify the due date.  
6. In addition to moving elements by drag and drop, you can modify planning suggestions by using a number of drop-down menu functions. Access the drop-down menu for the green circle of a suggested supply element and select one the following functions  

    |Function|Description|  
    |--------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Create New Supply**|Creates a new element point where you access the drop-down menu, which represents a new suggested supply order. It becomes a new line in the planning worksheet when you choose **Save Changes**.<br /><br /> **NOTE:** If the **Location Filter** or **Variant Filter** fields on the **Options** FastTab are empty or have more than one filter value, then the new supply is created and later saved to the planning or requisition worksheet with the following codes:<br /><br /> * If the filter field is empty, then the new supply is created without a location or variant code.<br /><br /> * If more than one filter value is defined, then the new supply is created for the first filter value according to the sorting method.<br /><br /> If you want another variant or location code, then you must manually change it on the new planning line.|  
    |**Auto-Adjust Supply**|Optimizes a new supply that you have created in the graph by making sure that it results in zero inventory before the next supply.|  
    |**Delete Supply**|Deletes the element in the **Timeline** FastTab and deletes the planning line when you choose **Save Changes**. The icon changes to a disk that has a red cross when the supply has been deleted.<br /><br /> **NOTE:** You can only delete a supply of action message type **New**. After you choose **Save Changes**, you must manually delete the planning line in question in the planning or requisition worksheet.|  

7. Choose the **Reload** action if you want to reset all the changes that you have made after you last opened the **Item Availability by Timeline** page or selected **Reload**.  
8. When the elements are placed where you want them in the diagram, choose **Save Changes** to copy modified quantity and date changes to the planning or requisition lines that represent the graphical elements.  

To implement the supply plan changes, you must follow the resulting action messages from the planning or requisition worksheet. For more information, see Carry Out Action Msg.-Plan..

## Symbols and Icons on the Timeline FastTab
 |Symbol/Icon|Description|  
 |------------------|---------------------------------------|  
 |Black cross|Orders (both supply and demand).<br /><br /> -   Cannot be modified.<br />-   Visible when the **Show Projected Inventory** field is selected (orange graph).|  
 |Red circle|Existing supply orders that are not in planning suggestions.<br /><br /> -   Cannot be modified.<br />-   Visible when the **Show Projected Inventory** field is selected (orange graph).|  
 |Yellow star|Forecast demand.<br /><br /> -   Cannot be modified.<br />-   Visible when the **Forecast Name** field has a value.<br /><br /> When both the **Show Projected Inventory** and the **Include Planning Suggestions** fields are selected, then each yellow star has a linked counterpart in the opposite graph. This illustrates how a suggested supply fulfills the forecasted demand.|  
 |Green circle with an icon shaped as a disk that has a red cross|Suggested supply order with action message *Cancel*.<br /><br /> -   Cannot be modified.<br />-   Visible when the **Include Planning Suggestions** field is selected (green graph).|  
 |Green circle with an icon shaped as a disk that has a star|Suggested supply orders with action message *New*.<br /><br /> -   Can be modified.<br />-   Visible when the **Include Planning Suggestions** field is selected (green graph).|  
 |Green circle with an icon shaped as a disk that has one or two arrows|Suggested supply orders with action message *Reschedule*, *Change Qty.*, or *Resched. and Chg. Qty.*<br /><br /> -   Can be modified.<br />-   Visible when the **Include Planning Suggestions** field is selected (green graph).<br /><br /> The arrows reflect the direction of the planning suggestion.

# Copilot in Business Central overview

This article answers common questions about Microsoft Copilot in Dynamics 365 Business Central.

## What is Copilot in Business Central?

Copilot is the AI-powered assistant that helps spark creativity, boost productivity, and eliminate tedious tasks. Copilot in Business Central is the world's first AI-powered assistant across all lines of business. With Copilot in Business Central, small and medium-sized organizations empower their workers through intuitive AI tools that boost creativity and save time.

## Where can I find the list of Copilot features in Business Central?

Copilot includes a constantly expanding set of capabilities that help users in different roles and tasks. Learn more in [Work smarter with Microsoft Copilot in Dynamics 365 Business Central](https://aka.ms/BCAI).

## How does Copilot approach security, privacy, and compliance?

Copilot is built on the Microsoft cloud and designed for enterprise use, with the security, privacy, and compliance controls that our customers expect. Here's some key points to common questions:

- When a user interacts with Copilot, it inherits their data permissions and can't read any more data than the user already has access to.
- Microsoft doesn't read your prompts or use your data to train AI models without your explicit permission.
- For customers within the EU Data Boundary, data doesn't move outside that boundary. 

Learn more about Copilot data security and privacy in Dynamics 365 at [FAQ for Copilot data security and privacy for Dynamics 365 and Power Platform](/dynamics365/faqs-copilot-data-security-privacy) and data movement across geographies in [Copilot data movement across geographies](ai-copilot-data-movement.md).

## How does Copilot approach AI safety?

Generative AI within Copilot in Business Central aligns with Microsoft's responsible AI principles, including fairness, reliability, safety, privacy and security, inclusiveness, transparency, and accountability. Learn more in [Responsible AI FAQs for Business Central](responsible-ai-overview.md) or explore our [Responsible AI transparency report](https://aka.ms/RAITransparencyReport2024).

## Is Copilot free?

Currently, Copilot in Business Central is included with your Business Central license at no extra cost. However, fair-use policies, quotas, or pricing might be introduced later.

## Does Copilot in Business Central require a minimum number of users?

Currently, no minimum number of users is required to start to use Copilot in Business Central.

## How does Copilot use the Azure AI time quota that is included with licenses?

Business Central offers numerous AI-powered features. Some features, such as sales and inventory forecasting, use specific machine learning models. These features rely on Azure AI and aren't related to Copilot. As the Dynamics 365 licensing guide indicates, 30 minutes of Azure AI time are included with Business Central licenses. This quota refers to non-Copilot features, where consumption of Azure AI time has no effect on Copilot in Business Central.

## Is Copilot in Business Central available worldwide?

Copilot includes a constantly expanding set of capabilities that help users in different roles and tasks. Each Copilot capability defines its own list of supported regions and supported languages. Although most features might be available only in English at first, we aim to unlock more languages and regions over time. Learn more at [Copilot international availability](https://aka.ms/bapcopilot-intl-report-external).

## Is Copilot aware of my environment customizations?

Some but not all Copilot features can work with your custom pages, tables, and other content from the apps that you have installed. For example, you can use [analysis assist](analysis-assist.md) on your custom lists, or you can use [chat with Copilot](chat-with-copilot.md) to find records in custom tables. Learn more about how each Copilot feature works with your customizations in [Analyze data in lists with help from Copilot](analysis-assist.md) and [Chat with Copilot](chat-with-copilot.md).

The accuracy and user experience of Business Central’s AI-powered features might vary based on the apps that you have installed.

## Does Copilot have to be trained on my data?

Copilot in Business Central relies on powerful AI foundation models that are coupled with data management features of the Business Central platform. No expensive or time-consuming training is needed before your organization can start to use Copilot with your own company data.

## Can I develop my own copilots for Business Central?

You can extend and enhance Copilot in Business Central by using tools that are part of Business Central's standard development platform. Learn more in [Integrating AI using Developer Tools for Copilot](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/ai-integration-landing-page).

You can also connect copilots by using Copilot Studio. In addition, you can implement your own standalone AI-powered apps and services that connect to Business Central. Learn more in [Adopt, extend, and build Copilot experiences across the Microsoft Cloud](/microsoft-cloud/dev/copilot/overview).

## How do I stay up with the latest news about Copilot in Business Central?

For news about Copilot and other AI innovation in Business Central, you can follow [the release plans](https://aka.ms/BCReleasePlan).

## As a Business Central partner, how easily can I demonstrate Copilot in Business Central to my customers?

Copilot in Business Central is automatically available when you provision a Microsoft Entra tenant with a Business Central environment on the [Customer Digital Experiences (CDX)](https://aka.ms/CDX) site. Learn more about how to prepare demonstrations in [Prepare demonstration environments of Dynamics 365 Business Central](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/demo-environment).

Depending on the environment that you provision, extra setup might be required. Learn more in [Configure Copilot and agent capabilities](/dynamics365/business-central/enable-ai).

## Is there a difference between Copilot in Business Central and Copilot for Microsoft 365?

Microsoft empowers people to achieve more through copilots that are adapted to different situations. For example, Copilot for Microsoft 365 is the AI assistant that is intended for working with Microsoft Teams, Excel, and other productivity apps. Copilot in Business Central is the AI assistant that is intended specifically for the Business Central app.

## Does Copilot in Business Central work with Copilot for Microsoft 365?

Currently, there's no direct connection between Copilot in Business Central and Microsoft 365 Copilot. Meaning, Copilot features inside Business Central are unaware of your Microsoft 365 data.

Conversely, when working in the Microsoft 365 suite of applications there are options for Copilot to utilize Business Central data. One such option is Microsoft 365 Copilot for Finance, a standalone product that utilizes general GPT training data, Microsoft 365 Graph data, and ERP information. Microsoft 365 Copilot for Finance can connect to Business Central and work with ERP data useful to specific contexts and scenarios, like collections management.

Learn more about Microsoft 365 Copilot for Finance with Business Central in [Collect outstanding balances](receivables-collect-outstanding-balances.md). Learn more general information at [Microsoft 365 Copilot for Finance](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/copilot/copilot-for-finance).

## Is Copilot available for Business Central online only?

Yes, Copilot is exclusive to Business Central online. Therefore, it isn't available for other deployment types, such as on-premises or private cloud.

## Is Copilot available to Embed applications?

Currently, because of technical limitations, we can't offer Copilot to customers who run independent software vendor (ISV) Embed apps. ISVs can extend Copilot with their own functionality or provide alternative uses of generative AI.

# Make payments

You pay vendors or customers, or reimburse your employees, by posting payment lines on the **Payment Journal** page. The payment journal is a general journal that's optimized for making payments, and offers lots of powerful actions. For example, the **Suggest Vendor Payments** action that finds vendor payments that are due, and the **Vendor - Summary Aging** report that shows an overview of due vendor payments.  

You can start the payment process from the lists, cards, and ledger entries for vendors, customers, and employees. Each of these pages has a button that starts the payment flow and helps you fill in the payment journal.  

From the payment journal, you can print computer checks or record when checks are written. If you select **Computer Check** in the **Bank Payment Type** field, you must print lines that represent checks before you can post the payment journal.

After you post payments, you can export them to a bank file you can upload to your bank for processing.

After the payments are made at your bank, you must apply them to their related open vendor or employee ledger entries. You can apply them manually or by importing a bank statement file and applying the payments automatically. For more information, see [Applying Payments Automatically and Reconciling Bank Accounts](receivables-apply-payments-auto-reconcile-bank-accounts.md).

The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the articles that describe them.

# Set Up Electronic Document Sending and Receiving

> [!NOTE]
> The content in this article is only applicable for versions of Dynamics 365 Business Central that were released before 2023 release wave 2. In 2023 release wave 2, new functionality for E-Documents is included. To learn more, see [Set up e-documents](finance-how-setup-edocuments.md). 


As an alternative to emailing as file attachments, you can send and receive business documents electronically. By electronic document is meant a standard\-compliant file representing a business document, such as an invoice from a vendor that can be received and converted to a purchase invoice in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The exchange of electronic documents between two trading partners is performed by an external provider of document exchange services. The generic version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports sending and receiving electronic invoices and credit memos in the PEPPOL format, which is supported by the largest providers of document exchange services. A major provider of document exchange services is preconfigured and ready to be set up for your company.  

From PDF or image files representing incoming documents, you can have an external OCR service (Optical Character Recognition) create electronic documents that you can then convert to document records in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], like for electronic PEPPOL documents. For example, when you receive an invoice in PDF format from your vendor, you can send it to the OCR service from the **Incoming Documents** page. After a few seconds, you receive the file back as an electronic invoice that can be converted to a purchase invoice for the vendor. If you send the file to the OCR service by email, then a new incoming document record is automatically created when you receive the electronic document back.  

The **PEPPOL** electronic document format is preconfigured to enable you to send electronic invoices and credit memos in the PEPPOL format. First, you must set up various master data, such as company information, customers, items, and units of measure. These are used to identify the business partners and items when converting data in fields in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to elements in the outgoing document file. Last, you must select the format on the **Electronic Document Format** page for each customer who you will send electronic PEPPOL documents to. For more information, see [Send Electronic Documents](sales-how-to-send-electronic-documents.md).  

The **PEPPOL – Invoice** and **PEPPOL – Credit Memo** data exchange definitions are preconfigured to enable you to receive electronic invoices and credit memos in the PEPPOL format. First, you must set up various master data, such as company information, vendors, items, and units of measure. These are used to identify the business partners and items when converting data in elements in the incoming document file to fields in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Last, you must select the data exchange definition on the **Incoming Documents** page for each incoming electronic document that you want to convert to a purchase document in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

The **OCR – Invoice** data exchange definition is preconfigured to enable you to receive electronic documents that are generated by the OCR service. To receive, for example, an invoice as an electronic OCR document, you set up master date and then process the document just as when receiving an electronic PEPPOL document. For more information, see [Use OCR to Turn PDF and Image Files into Electronic Documents](across-how-use-ocr-pdf-images-files.md).  

The preconfigured services for document exchange and OCR must be enabled before you send or receive. For more information, see [Set Up a Document Exchange Service](across-how-to-set-up-a-document-exchange-service.md).

1. In the **Search** box, enter **Purchases & Payables Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Default Accounts** FastTab, fill the field as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**G/L Account for Non-Item Lines**|Specifies the G/L account that is automatically inserted on purchase lines that are created from electronic documents when the incoming document line does not contain an identifiable item. Any incoming document line that does not have a GTIN or the vendor's item number will be converted to a purchase line of type **G/L Account**, and the **No.** field on the purchase line will contain the account that you select in the **G/L Account for Non-Item Lines** field.<br /><br /> If you leave the **G/L Account for Non-Item Lines** field blank, and the incoming document has lines without identifiable items, then the purchase document will not be created. An error message will instruct you to fill the **G/L Account for Non-Item Lines** field before you can complete the task.|

# Convert Existing Locations to Warehouse Locations
You can enable an existing inventory location to use zones and bins and to operate as a warehouse location.  

The batch job to enable a location for warehouse operation creates initial warehouse entries for the warehouse adjustment bin for all items that have inventory in the location. These initial entries will be balanced when warehouse physical inventory entries are entered after the batch job is run.  

You can create zones and bins either before or after the conversion. The only bin that you must create before the conversion is the one that is to be used as the future adjustment bin.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  To clear all negative inventory and any open warehouse documents before you convert the location for warehouse handling, run a report to identify the items with negative inventory and open warehouse documents for the location. For more information, see Check on Negative Inventory.  

## To enable an existing location to operate as a warehouse location  
1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Create Warehouse Location**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  In the **Location Code** field, specify the location that you want to enable for warehouse processing.  
3.  In the **Adjustment Bin Code** field, specify the bin at the location where unsynchronized warehouse entries are stored. For more information, see the [To synchronize the adjusted warehouse entries with the related item ledger entries](inventory-how-count-adjust-reclassify.md#to-synchronize-the-adjusted-warehouse-entries-with-the-related-item-ledger-entries).  

    Using the open item ledger entries for the specified location, warehouse journal lines are created that sum up every combination of Item No., Variant Code, Unit of Measure Code, and, if necessary, Lot No. and Serial No. in the item ledger entries. The warehouse journal lines are then posted. This posting creates warehouse entries that place the inventory in the warehouse adjustment bin. The **Adjustment Bin Code** on the location card is also set.  

4.  To see which items were added to the adjustment bin during the batch job, run the **Warehouse Adjustment Bin** report.  
5.  When the **Create Warehouse Location** batch job has completed, perform and post a warehouse physical inventory. For more information, see [Count, Adjust, and Reclassify Inventory Using Journals](inventory-how-count-adjust-reclassify.md).  

> [!NOTE]  
>  It is recommended that you run the **Create Warehouse Location** batch job at a time when it will not impact the daily work in the system. This job processes each entry in the **Item Ledger Entry** table, and if there are a large number of item ledger entries, the job can last several hours.  

 For those locations that did not use warehouse management documents before the conversion, you must re-open and release any source documents that were partially received or partially shipped before the conversion.

# Set up e-documents

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The E-Documents core module is a framework. By default, there's no **Service Integration** field. If you find the **Document Format** options by default, remember that they're offered as examples. Localization apps must provide format detail because they're specific to local requirements.

> [!NOTE]
> A standard PEPPOL document format is a global format in the **Document Format** field. Keep in mind that you probably can't use this format as is. It's a W1 format that Microsoft provides to show how to use this feature. We recommend that you test the existing PEPPOL format before you start to use this format.

The first step to configure electronic documents (e-documents) is to set up the E-Documents Service for e-document communication.

## Set up an e-document service

To set up an e-document service, follow these steps.

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **E-Document Services**, and then select the related link.
2. Select **New**, and then, on the **E-Document Service** page, on the **General** FastTab, configure the fields as described in the following table.

    | Field | Description |
    |-------|-------------|
    | Code | Select the electronic export setup code. |
    | Description | Enter a brief description of the electronic export setup. |
    | Document Format | The export format of the electronic export setup. By default, there are two options in this field. You can select **PEPPOL BIS 3** as a generic code-based format or **Data Exchange** when you must set up predocuments of specific formats on the **Data Exchange Definition** FastTab.</p> |
    | Service Integration | Select the integration code for the electronic export setup. Currently, the only option is **No integration**. |

3. On the **Importing** FastTab, configure the fields as described in the following table.

    | Field | Description |
    |-------|-------------|
    | Automatic Import | Specify whether documents should be automatically imported from the service. |
    | Automatic processing| Specify whether [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses your e-document setup to automatically create a purchase document based on the received e-document. If you choose **No**, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates the e-document, but you must review its details before you create the purchase document. |
    | Validate Receiving Company | Specify whether the receiving company information must be validated during import. |
    | Resolve Unit Of Measure | Specify whether to resolve the unit of measure during import. |
    | Lookup Item Reference | Specify whether to search for items by item reference during import. |
    | Lookup Item GTIN | Specify whether to search for items by Global Trade Item Number (GTIN) during import. |
    | Lookup Account Mapping | Specify whether to search for accounts in **Account Mapping** by the incoming text during import. |
    | Validate Line Discount | Specify whether to validate a line discount during import. |
    | Apply Invoice Discount | Specify whether to apply an invoice discount during import. |
    | Verify Totals | Specify whether to verify invoice totals during import. |
    | Create Journal Lines | Specify whether a journal line must be created instead of a purchase document. Select this option when you want to use journals as a destination for your invoices. |
    | General Journal Template Name | Specify the name of the general journal template that's used for journal line creation. This field is applicable when you want to use journals as a destination for your invoices. |
    | General Journal Batch Name | Specify the name of the general journal batch that's used for journal line creation. This field is applicable when you want to use journals as a destination for your invoices. |
    | Batch Start Time | Specify the start time for import jobs. |
    | Minutes between runs | Specify the number of minutes between import job runs. |

4. If you selected **Data Exchange** in the **Document Format** field on the **General** FastTab, on the **Data Exchange Definition** FastTab, fill in the fields as described in the following table.

    | Field | Description |
    |-------|-------------|
    | Document Type | Specify the document type that uses data exchange to import and export the data. Examples include **Sales Invoice**, **Sales Credit memo**, and **Purchase Invoice**. |
    | Import Data Exchange Def. Code | Specify the data exchange code that's used to import the data. Use this field only to receive a document in the purchase process. |
    | Export Data Exchange Def. Code | Specify the data exchange code that's used to export the data. Use this field only to deliver documents in the sales process. |

> [!NOTE]
> There are data exchange definitions for the PEPPOL format that are related to sales and purchase documents. However, you likely can't use these definitions as is. They're all W1 formats that are provided to show how to use this feature. We recommend that you test the existing PEPPOL format before you start to use them.
>
> If you configured the **Data Exchange Definition** format in your localization, you can add a line for the document types that you need. Add lines that match the default data exchange example for the W1 PEPPOL format. However, first select the **Document Type** option for each line that you need. For each data type, select the **Import Data Exchange Def. Code** or **Export Data Exchange Def. Code** value that you want to use.
>
> If you don't use the **Data Exchange Definition** format, you can create and configure formats by using the [interface](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-extend-edocuments). Adjust the information on the **Export Mapping** and **Import Mapping** lines, where you can find the tables and fields to configure transformation rules. In this case, you must add a new option for your format in the **Document Format** field.  

5. On the **Exporting** FastTab, fill in the fields as described in the following table:

   |Field  |Description  |
   |---------|---------|
   | Batch Exporting | Specify whether the service uses batch processing to export e-documents. |
   | Embed document PDF to export| Specify whether to embed a PDF version of the e-document in the e-document file when you export.|

   > [!NOTE]
   > The **Embed document PDF to export** option can make life a little easier. When you post a document, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates a PDF file and embeds it as a PDF attachment in the e-document. The PDF is a human-readable version that's easier to understand than the full XML of the PEPPOL format.

### Supported document types

Support for document types is based on the **Document Format**. To check which document types are supported, on the **E-Document Services** page, choose the **Supported Document Types** action. The **E-Document Service Supported Source Document Types** opens. In the **Source Document Type** column, you can choose different document types for the format you're planning to use. Only use the document type if that document is selected.

## Set up a document sending profile

You can set up a preferred method of sending sales documents for each customer. If you do, you don't have to select a sending option every time you choose the **Post and Send** action. On the **Document Sending Profiles** page, you can set up sending profiles and then select the one to use in the **Document Sending Profile** field on a customer card. You can select the **Default** checkbox to specify that a document sending profile is the profile for all customers for which a profile isn't specified in the **Document Sending Profile** field.

This feature is used to set up electronic invoicing automation. When you choose **Post and Send** on a sales document, the **Post and Send Confirmation** dialog shows the sending profile in use. It's either the profile set up for the customer or the default profile for all customers.

To set up a document sending profile, follow these steps.

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Document Sending Profile**, and then select the related link.
2. On the **Document Sending Profiles** page, select **New**.
3. On the **General** FastTab, fill in the required fields.
4. On the **Sending Options** FastTab, fill in the fields as described in the following table.

    | Field | Description |
    |-------|-------------|
    | Electronic Document | Specify whether the document is sent as an e-document that the customer can import into their system when you select **Post and Send**. To use this option, you must also set the **Format** or **Electronic Document Service Flow Code** field. Alternatively, you can save the file to your computer. |
    | Format | Specify the format to use to send an e-document. This field is required if you select **Through Document Exchange** in the **Electronic Document** field. |
    | Electronic Document Service Flow Code | Specify the electronic service flow that's used to send documents. This field is required if you select **Extended E-Document Service Flow** in the **Electronic Document** field. |

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you select **Extended E-Document Service Flow** in the **Electronic Document** field, you must already have the workflow configured for your e-documents.

## Set up the workflow

To set up a workflow for e-documents, follow these steps.

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Workflow Templates**, and then select the related link.
2. If you can't find **E-Document Workflow Templates** on the **Workflow Templates** page, select **Reset Microsoft Templates**. **E-Document Workflow Templates** should then appear. Close the page.
3. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Workflows**, and then select the related link.
4. Choose the **New Workflow from Template** action to select a template for the e-documents process. The available templates are **Send to one service** and **Send to multiple services**.
5. Select **OK** to finish the workflow setup.
6. In the **Then Response** field, select **Send E-Document using setup** to configure the workflow responses.
7. Select the E-Document Service that you created as an option, choose **OK**, and then enable the workflow.

> [!NOTE]
> You can create your own workflow for e-documents without using predefined workflow templates. If you have more services, you can use different workflows.

To use more workflows, configure them through the document sending profiles for different customers. When you set up the workflow, specify the document sending profile in the **On Condition** column on the **Workflow Steps** FastTab, because you can't have two services that use the same document sending profile in workflows.

When you configure your workflow on the **Workflows** page, point to the **On Condition** field on the **Workflow Steps** FastTab. On the **Event Conditions** page, in the **Filter** field, select the document sending profile that you want to use.

## Set up a retention policy for e-documents

E-documents can be subject to local legislation that specifies the period for which you must keep e-documents. To manage that, administrators can define retention policies that control how often [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] deletes records. To learn more about retention policies, go to [Define Retention Policies](admin-data-retention-policies.md).

To set up retention policies for e-documents, follow these steps.

1. On the **E-Document Services** page, choose the **Retention Policy** action.
2. When the action is completed, select one of the following retention policies to set up:

    - E-Document Log
    - E-Document Integration Log
    - E-Document Mapping Log
    - E-Document Data Storage

## E-Documents demo data  

> [!NOTE]
> From [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] version 24.0, you can set up demo data for E-Documents.

To provide easier ways to test and demonstrate e-documents, Microsoft offers a demo module. To enable the module, follow these steps:  

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Contoso Demo Tool**, and then select the related link.  
2. Before you enable the **E-Document Contoso Module**, you must first enable the  **Common Module** and **Warehouse Module**.
3. After you enable the modules, select the **E-Documents Contoso Module**, and then choose the **Generate** action.
4. Follow the steps.  
5. Close the page.

After you enable the module, you have demo items, six electronic documents (based on Peppol BIS 3), and configured **E-Document Services** with created workflows.

# Export and Import Approval Workflows

To transfer workflows to other [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] databases, for example to save time when creating new workflows, you can export and import workflows.  

Another way to quickly create workflows is to use workflow templates. Learn more at [Create Workflows from Workflow Templates](across-how-to-create-workflows-from-workflow-templates.md).  

On the **Workflow** page, you create a workflow by listing the involved steps on the lines. Each step consists of a workflow event, moderated by event conditions, and a workflow response, moderated by response options. You define workflow steps by filling fields on workflow lines using fixed lists of event and response values representing scenarios supported by the application code. Learn more at [Create Workflows](across-how-to-create-workflows.md).  

## Export a workflow

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Workflows**, then choose the related link.  
2. Select a workflow, then choose the **Export to File** action.  

## Import a workflow

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Workflows**, then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **Import from File** action.  
3. On the **Import** page, select **Choose**, choose the XML file containing the workflow, then select **Open**.  

> [!CAUTION]  
> If the workflow code already exists in the database, the workflow steps will be overwritten with the steps in the imported workflow.

# Allocate recurring costs and income

You can allocate an entry in a recurring general journal to several accounts when you post the journal. To learn more about recurring general journals, go to [Work with recurring journals](ui-work-general-journals.md#work-with-recurring-journals).

The following allocation methods are available:

* Quantity
* Percentage (%)
* Amount

The allocation features work with recurring general journals and in fixed asset journals.
<!--You can also distribute the cost or revenue of a line to an intercompany partner when you post a sales or purchase document. When you post the document, a line will be posted in your general journal, and a corresponding line will be created in the intercompany outbox.-->

The following procedures describe how to prepare to allocate costs in a recurring general journal by defining allocation keys. When allocation keys are defined, you complete and post the journal like any other recurring general journal. For more information, see [Work with General Journals](ui-work-general-journals.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> **Allocation Accounts** aren't supported in recurring journals. While the **Allocation Account** option is available in the **Account Type** field on the lines of the journal, this option isn't supported. Instead, use the allocations feature as described in this article.
>
> If you defined allocation accounts in a previous version of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], update the setup to use allocations.

## To set up allocation keys

You can allocate an entry in a recurring general journal to several different accounts when you post the journal. The allocation can be a quantity, percentage, or amount.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Recurring General Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **Batch Name** field to open the **General Journal Batches** page.
3. You can either modify allocations on an existing batch in the list or create a new batch with allocations.
   * To create a new batch, choose the **New** action, and go to the next step.
   * To change the allocations of an existing journal, select the journal and go to step 7.    
4. In the **Name** field, enter a name for the batch, such as CLEANING. In the **Description** field, enter a description, such as Cleaning Expenses Journal.
5. When you're done, close the page. A new, empty recurring journal opens.
6. Fill in the fields on the line.
7. Choose the **Allocations** action.
8. Add a line for each allocation. You must fill in either the **Allocation %**, **Allocation Quantity**, or **Amount** field. You must also fill in the **Account No.** field and, if you're allocating the transaction among global dimensions, the global dimension fields.
9. If you enter a percentage on a line, the amount in the **Amount** field is calculated automatically. These amounts have the opposite sign from the total amount in the **Amount** field in the recurring journal.
10. After entering the allocations lines, choose **OK** to return to the **Recurring General Journal** page. The **Allocated Amt. (USD)** field is filled in and matches the **Amount** field.
11. Post the journal.

## To change an allocation key that is already set up

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Recurring General Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Recurring General Journals** page, select the journal with the allocation.
3. Choose the line with the allocation, and then choose the **Allocations** action.
4. Change the relevant fields, and then choose **OK**.

# Where-Used (Top Level) (report)

The **Where-Used (Top Level)** report shows where, and in what quantities, you use items in the product structure to produce an item.

The report shows only the item as where-used when the base item is used as the top-level item. For example, you use item A to produce item B. You use item B to produce item C. If you run the report for item A, the report shows item B as where-used. If you run this report for item B, the report shows item C shows as where-used.

You can also open the **Where-Used Line** page directly from the item.

## Use cases

Your trial balance shows in both your local currency (LCY) and additional reporting currency (ACY). However, the report only shows data for the latter if you have setup the additional reporting currency feature.

Data is aggregated for the period specified by the Datefilter parameter on the report's request page and summarized by the two global dimensions per G/L account category.

The Excel workbook contains three worksheets that you can use to analyze your trial balance:

- Trial Balance (LCY)
- Trial Balance (ACY)
- TrialBalanceData

# Aged Accounts Payable (report)

The **Aged Accounts Payable** report shows the amounts on outstanding invoices, credit memos, and payments for vendors.

You can configure report aging to generate three periods of equal length as of a specified date (for example, the three preceding months from the end of the current month). The vendor's outstanding balance is calculated for each period, as are balances due before or after the three periods. You can name each period based on either the actual start and end dates, or the total number of days included (for example, 1–31 days).

To help you easily identify the company's current financial health, total percentages of outstanding amounts are calculated for each date range.

The report can show either a summed balance for each vendor or a detailed breakdown of each outstanding document.

## Use cases

## Report description
Shows overdue balances for vendors in time intervals. The overdue amounts can show by due date, posting date, or by document date. You can choose to show the amounts in local currency (LCY) and print details of the overdue documents. The time intervals can have headings with dates or with number of dates overdue, relative to the specified aging by type.
This report is the main report for reconciling vendor ledger to G/L. Assuming that you don't post directly to the payables account for the vendor posting group, this report is a specification of the amounts in the general ledger.

### What the report does
Shows the amount of outstanding invoices, credit memos and payments for vendors.

You can configure report aging to generate three equal length periods as of the specified date (i.e. three preceding months from the end of the current month). The vendor's outstanding balance is then calculated for each period, as well as any balances due before or after the three periods. 

Each period can be named from the actual start/end dates, or the total number of days included (i.e. 1 - 31 days).

A total percentage of outstanding amounts are calculated for each date range, to help you easily identify the company's current financial health.

The report can either show a summed balance for each vendor, or a detailed breakdown of each outstanding document for analysis.

### Use cases
Analyse vendor balances at the end of each period. Used to monitor unpaid invoices, and prioritise payments for overdue accounts. 

Allows easy reconciliation of the vendor subledger against the payables account(s) in the general ledger, assuming that direct posting is disabled.

# Inventory Valuation (report)

The **Inventory Valuation** report shows:

* The beginning balance (quantity and value) based on a starting date you specify.
* The closing balance based on an ending date you specify entered.

You can also find decreases and increases in quantity and value in the period.

If you use expected cost posting, you can choose to include expected costs that reconcile to your inventory (interim) accounts.

The value in the **Cost Posted to G/L** column should equal the value in the **Ending Date Value** column. If it isn't, it's because you didn't run **Post Inventory Cost to G/L**.

Depending on settings on the **Inventory Posting Setup** page, you can run the report with different location filters and compare inventory posting group totals to the related G/L Accounts to ensure that your inventory subledger balances with the general ledger inventory balance sheet accounts.

> [!TIP]
> To ensure that the report is up-to-date, we recommend that you run the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job before you generate this report.

> [!NOTE]
> This report isn't available in the US, Canada, and Mexico. Instead, use the localized version of the **Inventory Valuation** (10139) report.

## Use cases

<!-- 
Prompt

Below is a report in an ERP system. Provide 3-4 use cases for different personas working with inventory.
Format like this:    
  
As a <persona>, use the report to    
* use case 1

## Report description
Displays inventory valuation for selected items in your inventory. The report also shows information about the value of increases and decreases in inventory over time.

The report will also print the expected cost of entries that have been posted as received or shipped, depending on whether you enable the Include Expected Cost toggle.

If you enable Include Expected Cost, the report groups entries and shows a group total of invoiced and expected costs for each Inventory Posting Group.

You can also narrow your report output with the Location and Variant Filters. However, as the report is built on top of a value entry, you can't use Bin Filter.

To ensure that the Inventory Valuation report is up-to-date, it's recommended to run the Adjust Cost - Item Entries batch job prior to running this report.

In the US, Canada, and Mexico, this report isn't available. Instead, use the localized version of Inventory Valuation (10139) report.

### What the report does
Displays beginning Inventory Balance (Quantity and Value) based on the Starting Date entered and Closing Inventory Balance based on the Ending Date entered. You can also see the decreases and increases in Quantity and Value within the period.

You can choose to include Expected Costs, which will reconcile to your Inventory (Interim) Accounts should you be using Expected Cost Posting.

The final column Cost Posted to G/L should be equal to the Ending Date Value column. If it is not, it is because Post Inventory Cost to G/L has not been run. 

Depending on your Inventory Posting Setup you can run the report with different Location Filters and compare Inventory Posting Group Totals to the related G/L Accounts to ensure that  your Inventory Subledger Balance to the General Ledger Inventory Balance Sheet Accounts.

To ensure that the report is up-to-date, it's recommended to run the Adjust Cost - Item Entries batch job prior to running this report.

In the US, Canada, and Mexico, this report isn't available. Instead, use the localized version of Inventory Valuation (10139) report.

### Use cases
Reconcile your inventory subledger to the inventory account(s) in the general ledger at the end of each period.

Analyse the changes to expected costs posted during the period, and determine the value of inventory on hand for financial reporting.

Please include your data sources and URLs

Inventory managers use the report to:

* Analyze inventory valuation for selected items to ensure that it's accurate.
* Determine the value of on-hand inventory for planning purposes.
* Monitor changes to expected costs posted during a period to identify discrepancies.

Supply chain managers use the report to:

* Analyze the inventory valuation for selected items to ensure adequate inventory levels.

# Item Age Composition - Quantity (report)

The **Item Age Composition - Quantity** report shows on-hand inventory aged by receipt date.

You can configure the report's aging to generate three equal length periods on an ending date. The inventory's age is calculated for each period, as well as before and after the period. The report also shows the total inventory.

The values represent the remaining quantity for open inbound item ledger entries, which are usually a result of purchases, output, or positive adjustments. The posting date for entries determines the bucket their value is in.

To determine the age of inventory by warehouse, you can filter the report by location. You can also filter by item.

# Customer Statement (report)

The **Customer Statement** report shows a customer statement for a specified period of time.

You can choose to show the overdue amounts in a separate section.

Similar to the **Aged Receivables** report, you can include an aging band. For the aging band, businesses often set **30D**. 30D means 30 day intervals such as 30, 60, and 90 days overdue. The intervals start from the ending date, or **1M+CM**. 1M+CM is the current month in a separate interval and then monthly intervals for the preceding months.

> [!NOTE]
> In the customer list, this report also has a **Scheduled Statements** action. This action doesn't filter to the selected customer. It's the same report, but you use it when you want to send statements to one or more customers. You can filter the report to only show open entries for the customer. To apply the filter when you're setting up the report, in the **Statement Style** field, choose **Open Items**

# Aged Accounts Receivables (report)

> [!NOTE]
> This is a legacy version of an accounts receivables aging report. We recommend you use the **Aged Accounts Receivables Excel** report instead. To learn more, go to [About *Aged Accounts Receivables Excel*](../reports/report-4402.md).

The **Aged Accounts Receivables** report shows the number of outstanding customer invoices, credit memos, and payments.

You can configure the report's aging to generate three equal length periods as of a date you specify. For example, the periods might be the three previous months from the end of the current month. The report calculates the customer's outstanding balance for each period, and balances due before or after the three periods.

> [!TIP]
> Businesses often use the start and end dates as the names for each period, or the total number of days the periods include. For example, 1 - 31 days.

To help you easily identify the current state of customer debts, the report calculates a total percentage of outstanding amounts for each period.

The report can either show a summed balance for each customer, or a detailed breakdown of each outstanding document.

## Report name
Aged Accounts Receivables

## Report description
Shows the amount outstanding with customers broken down into time intervals for the overdue time. The report also displays the part of the customers' balance that isn't due and can be shown with or without document details for each customer. This report is the main report for reconciling customer ledger to G/L. Assuming you don't allow direct posting to the accounts used in the customer posting groups' receivables account, this report is a specification of the amounts you find in the G/L.

### What the report does
Shows the amount of outstanding invoices, credit memos and payments for customers.

You can configure report aging to generate three equal length periods as of the specified date (i.e. three preceding months from the end of the current month). The customer's outstanding balance is then calculated for each period, as well as any balances due before or after the three periods. 

Each period can be named from the actual start/end dates, or the total number of days included (i.e. 1 - 31 days).

A total percentage of outstanding amounts are calculated for each date range, to help you easily identify the current state of collectable customer debts.

The report can either show a summed balance for each customer, or a detailed breakdown of each outstanding document for analysis.

### Use cases
Analyse customer balances at the end of each period. Used as a gauge to measure the reliability of collectable debts for your customers.
Allows easy reconciliation of the customer subledger against the receivables account(s) in the general ledger, assuming that direct posting is disabled. 
This report helps businesses manage and analyze their accounts receivable by providing a clear view of which invoices are overdue and by how long. It's particularly useful for credit and collections teams to prioritize follow-ups and improve cash flow management.

Please include your data sources and URLs

-->

Accounts receivable professionals use the report to:

* Reconcile customer subledgers against the receivables accounts in the general ledger and ensure that all outstanding balances are accurate and complete.
* Identify discrepancies or errors in customer transactions and investigate them.
* Get data to prepare financial statements such as income statements or balance sheets.

Collections specialists use the report to:

* Identify overdue customer accounts and prioritize follow-up activities based on how overdue the payments are.
* Analyze customer payment history to identify patterns or trends in late payments and proactively address issues.
* Prepare collection reports or dashboards for internal or external stakeholders.

Credit analysts use the report to:

* Analyze customer payment history to make recommendations for credit limits or payment terms.

# Fixed Asset Book Value 02 (report)

The **Fixed Asset Book Value 02** report shows the breakdown of fixed asset book value by changes in acquisition, depreciation, and appreciation within the period, with a further breakdown by additions and disposals within the period.

To include information about Write-downs, Appreciation, Custom 1, and Custom 2 posting types in the report, select either the **Acquisition Type** or the **Depreciation Type* fields on the **FA Posting Type Setup** page.

You can include reclassified entries in the report. The report then shows the reclassification entries in a separate column.

If you select the **Budget Report** field, the report calculates the expected depreciation for the period.

Enter a group type if you want to group the fixed assets and show group totals. For example, if you have six FA classes, select the **FA Class** option to print group totals for each FA class.

Use this report to describe the changes in fixed assets for a given period when there are many changes across groups of fixed assets.
