# Set up a sequence of workflow users

Before you can create approval workflows, you must set up the users who can submit requests and their approvers. For example, you can specify who receives a notification to act on a workflow step. You set up approval workflow participants on the **Approval User Setup** page. Learn more at [Set Up Approval Users](across-how-to-set-up-approval-users.md).

On the **Workflow User Groups** page, you can specify where a participant engages in an approval workflow by entering a number in the **Sequence No.** field. For example, you can specify that users engage in a sequential order, such as a chain of approvers. You can also specify a flat list of approvers by entering the same number. In the latter case, only one of the approvers must approve a request.

[!INCLUDE [workflow-requestor-approver](includes/workflow-requestor-approver.md)]

## To set up a workflow user group

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Workflow User Groups**, then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action. The **Workflow User Group** page opens.  
3. In the **Code** field, enter a maximum of 20 characters to identify the workflow.  
4. In the **Description** field, describe the workflow.  
5. On the **Workflow User Group Members** FastTab, fill in the fields on the first line, as described in the following table.  

   |Field|Description|
   |-----|-----------|
   |**User Name**|Specify the user who takes part in a workflow.<br /><br /> The user must exist on the **User Setup** page. Learn more at [Assign Permissions to Users and Groups](ui-define-granular-permissions.md).|
   |**Sequence No.**|Specify the order in which the workflow user engages in a workflow relative to other users. This field can specify, for example, when the user approves relative to other approvers by setting up the **Workflow User Group** option in the **Approver Type** field on the related workflow response.|

   > [!NOTE]
   > Typically, sequence numbers are sequential for users in a workflow user group. However, multiple users can have the same sequence number. When that's the case, only one of the users must approve a request before the workflow goes to the next step. For example, if user A and user B are both number two in the sequence, the workflow goes to the step three when when either user A or user B approves the request.
6. Repeat step 5 to add more workflow users to the workflow user group.

# Send Electronic Documents

> [!NOTE]
> The content in this article is only applicable for versions of Dynamics 365 Business Central that were released before 2023 release wave 2. In 2023 release wave 2, new functionality for E-Documents is included. To learn more, see [Set up e-documents](finance-how-setup-edocuments.md).  

The generic version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports sending electronic invoices and credit memos in the PEPPOL format, a format that the largest document exchange service providers support. A document exchange service provider dispatches electronic documents between trading partners. To provide support for other electronic document formats, you use the data exchange framework.  

 In the generic version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], a document exchange service is preconfigured and ready to be set up for your company. For more information, see [Set Up a Document Exchange Service](across-how-to-set-up-a-document-exchange-service.md). However, in some cases, you must install an app. For more information, see [Electronic Invoicing FAQ](faq-electronic-invoicing.yml).  

 To send a sales invoice as an electronic PEPPOL document, you select the **Electronic Document** option in the **Post and Send** dialog box. You can also set up the customer's default document sending profile from that dialog box. First, you must set up various master data, such as company information, customers, items, and units of measure. These are used to identify the business partners and items when converting data in fields in [Set Up Electronic Document Sending and Receiving](across-how-to-set-up-electronic-document-sending-and-receiving.md).  

### To send an electronic sales invoice

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Invoices**, and then choose the related link.  

2. Create a new sales invoice.  

3. When the sales invoice is ready to be invoiced, choose the **Post and Send** action.  

     If the customer's default sending profile is **Electronic Document**, then it will be shown in the **Post and Send Confirmation** dialog box. This way, you just have to choose the **Yes** button to post and send the invoice electronically in the selected format.  

4. In the **Post and Send Confirmation** dialog box, choose the AssistEdit button to the right of the **Send Document to** field.  

5. In the **Send Document to** dialog box, in the **Electronic Document** field, choose **Through Document Exchange Service**.  

6. In the **Format** field, choose **PEPPOL**.  

7. Choose the **OK** button. The **Post and Send Confirmation** dialog box appears. **Electronic Document (PEPPOL)** is added to the **Send Document to** field.  

8. Choose the **Yes** button.  

     The sales invoice is posted and sent to the customer in the PEPPOL format.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  You can also send a posted sales invoice as an electronic document. The procedure is the same as described in this topic for non-posted sales documents. On the **Posted Sales Invoice** page, choose the **Activity Log** action to view the status of the electronic document.

# Run Full Planning, MPS, or MRP

The terms "running the planning worksheet" or "running MRP" refer to calculating the master production schedule and material requirements. The calculation is based on actual and forecasted demand. The planning system can calculate either Master Production Schedule (MPS) or Material Requirements Planning (MRP) on request, or both at the same time.  

- MPS is the calculation of a master production schedule based on actual demand and the demand forecast. The MPS calculation is used for end items that have a forecast or a sales order line. These items are called MPS items and are identified dynamically when the calculation starts.  
- MRP is the calculation of material requirements based on actual demand for components and the demand forecast on the component level. MRP is calculated only for items that are not MPS items. The purpose of MRP is to provide time-phased formal plans, by item, to supply the appropriate item, at the appropriate time, in the appropriate location, and in the appropriate quantity.  

The planning algorithms for MPS and MRP are the same. The algorithms pertain to netting, reusing existing replenishment orders, and action messages. The planning system process examines what is, or will be, needed (demand) and what's on-hand or expected (supply). When you net these quantities against each other, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides action messages. Action messages are suggestions to create a new order, change an order (quantity or date), or cancel an order. The term "order" includes purchase orders, assembly orders, production orders, and transfer orders.

You can track the links that the planning creates between demand and supply on the **Order Tracking** page. For more information, see [Track Relations Between Demand and Supply](production-how-track-demand-supply.md).

Proper planning results depend on the set up done on item cards, assembly BOMs, production BOMs, and routings.  

## Methods for generating a plan  

- **Calculate Regenerative Plan:** Process or regenerate the material plan. This process starts by deleting all planned supply orders that are currently loaded. All items in the database are replanned.  
- **Calculate Net Change Plan**: Process a net change plan. Items are considered in net change planning from two types of changes:  
   - **Demand/supply changes:** These changes include modifications to quantities on sales orders, demand forecasts, assembly orders, production orders, or purchase orders. An unplanned inventory level change is also considered a quantity change.  
   - **Planning parameter changes:** These changes include changes in safety stock, reorder point, routing, bill of material, and changes to the time bucket or lead time calculation.  
- **Get Action Messages:** Serves as a short-term planning tool by issuing action messages to alert the user of modifications made since the last time you calculated a regenerative or net change plan.  

With each planned method, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] generates worksheet entries assuming infinite capacity. Work center and machine center capacity isn't considered when you develop schedules.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The Calculate Regenerative Plan is the most common process. The Calculate Plan and Carry out Action Messages, however, can be used to run the Calculate Net Change Plan process.  
>
> You can run the Get Action Messages Plan between regenerative and net change planning runs to obtain an immediate view of the effect of schedule changes. However, it isn't meant to replace the full regenerative or net change planning processes.  

## To calculate the planning worksheet
  
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Planning Worksheets**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **Calculate Regenerative Plan** action to open the **Calculate Plan** page.  
3. On the **Options** FastTab, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**MPS**|Calculate a master production schedule. Items with open sales orders or demand forecasts are considered in this run. <br/>If other demands, for example safety stock, reorder point, or open production component lines, also exist for such items these demands are included in the MPS calculation to ensure that the planning system deals with the complete inventory profile.  |  
    |**MRP**|Calculate material requirements planning. Items with dependent requirements are considered in this run. Typically, MPS and MRP are run at the same time. To run MPS and MRP at the same time, on the **Manufacturing Setup** page, on the **Planning** FastTab, select the **Combined MPS/MRP Calculation** field.|  
    |**Starting Date**|Evaluate inventory availability. If an item's on-hand quantity is below the reorder point, the system forward-schedules a replenishment order from this date. If an item is below its safety stock (as of the starting date), the system back-schedules a replenishment order due on the planning starting date.|  
    |**Ending Date**|The ending date of the planning horizon. Neither demand nor supply are considered after this date. If the reorder cycle for an item extends beyond the ending date, the effective planning horizon for that item is equal to the order date plus the reorder cycle.<br/><br/> The planning horizon is the time that the plan is extended to. If the horizon is too short, items with a longer lead time aren't ordered on time. If the horizon is too long, too much time is spent reviewing and processing information that likely changes before it's needed. You can set one planning horizon for production and a longer one for purchases, although it isn't required. A planning horizon for purchases and production should be set to cover the total lead time for components.|  
    |**Stop and Show First Error**|Select this option if you want the planning run to stop as soon as it encounters an error. A message displays with information about the error. If an error exists, only the successful planning lines made before the error was encountered are presented in the planning worksheet. If you don't select this field, the **Calculate Plan** batch job continues until it completes. Errors won't interrupt the batch job. If one or more errors exist, a message displays after completion with information about how many items are affected. The **Planning Error Log** page will then open to provide more details about the error and links to the affected item cards.|  
    |**Use Forecast**|Select a forecast to include as demand when you run the planning batch job. The default forecast is set up on the **Planning** FastTab on the **Manufacturing Setup** page.|  
    |**Exclude Forecast Before**|Define how much of the selected forecast to include in the planning run by entering a date before which forecast demand is not included.|  
    |**Respect Planning Parameters for Exception Warnings**|By default, this field is selected.<br/><br/> Supply on planning lines with warnings is normally not modified according to planning parameters. Instead, the planning system only suggests a supply to cover the exact demand quantity. However, you can define certain planning parameters for planning lines to be respected with certain warnings.<br/><br/>|  

4. On the **Item** FastTab, set filters to run the planning based on the item, item description, or location.  
5. Choose the **OK** button. The batch job runs and planning lines are added to the planning worksheet.  

## To perform action messages
  
1. On the **Planning Worksheet** page, choose the **Carry Out Action Message** action.  
2. On the **Options** FastTab, specify how to create the supplies. Fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Production Order**|Specify how to create production orders. You can do this directly from the planning line proposals. You can create either planned or firm planned production orders.|  
    |**Assembly Order**|Specify how to create assembly orders. You can do this directly from the planning line proposals.|  
    |**Purchase Order**|Specify how to create purchase orders. You can do this directly from the planning line proposals.<br/><br/> If you chose to copy the planning line proposals for purchase orders to the requisition worksheet, select the template and worksheet name.|  
    |**Transfer Order**|Specify how to create transfer orders. You can do this directly from the planning line proposals.<br/><br/> If you chose to copy the planning line proposals for transfer orders to the requisition worksheet, select the template and worksheet name.|  
    |**Combine Transfer Orders**|Select whether to combine transfer orders.|  
    |**Stop and Show First Error**|Select this option if you want the **Carry Out Action Msg. - Plan.** batch job to stop as soon as it finds an error. Aa message displays information about the error. If an error exists, only the planning lines processed before the error was found will create supply orders.|  

3. On the **Planning Line** FastTab, you can set filters to limit the perform action messages.  
4. Choose the **OK** button.  

The batch job deletes the lines in the planning worksheet after it has performed the action message. The other lines remain in the planning worksheet until they are either accepted at a later date or else deleted. You can also delete the lines manually.  

## Action messages
  
Action messages are issued by the order tracking system when balance is unattainable in the existing order network. The messages can be viewed as a suggestion for you to process changes that reestablish balance between supply and demand.  

The generation of action messages occurs one level at a time, for each item's low-level code. This makes sure that all items that experience or will experience changes in supply or demand are considered.  

To avoid small, unneeded, or unimportant action messages, you can set dampeners, which serve to restrict the generation of action messages to only those changes that exceed the defined quantity or number of days.  

After you review the action messages and determine whether to accept some or all of the suggested changes, select the **Accept Action Message** field. Next, update the schedules accordingly.  

> [!NOTE]  
> An action message is a suggestion to create a new order, cancel an order, or change the quantity or date of an order. An order is a purchase order, transfer order, or production order.  

In response to any supply/demand imbalances, the following action messages are generated.  

|Action Message|Description|  
|--------------------|---------------------------------------|  
|**New**|If a demand can't be fulfilled by suggesting action messages to **Change Qty.**, **Reschedule**, or **Reschedule & Change Qty.** on existing orders, the action message **New** is generated to suggest a new order. The message **New** is also generated if there aren't supply orders in the reorder cycle of the item. This option determines the number of periods forward and backward in the availability profile when it searches for an order to reschedule.|  
|**Change Quantity**|When the quantity changes for a demand that's tracked to a supply order, the action message **Change Qty.** is generated. The message indicates that the related supply should be changed relative to the change in demand. If a new demand emerges, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] searches for the nearest existing unreserved supply order in the reorder cycle, and issues a change of action message for that order.|  
|**Reschedule**|When a date change for a supply or demand order causes an imbalance in the order network, the action message **Reschedule** is generated. If there is a one-to-one relationship between demand and supply, an action message is generated to suggest that you move the supply order. If the supply-order covers demand from more than one sales order, the supply order is re-scheduled equal to the date of the first demand.|  
|**Resch. & Chg. Qty.**|If both the dates and quantities of an order change, you must change plans with regard to both. Action messaging gathers both actions in one message, **Resched. and Chg. Qty.**, to ensure that the order network returns to balance.|  
|**Cancel**|If a demand that has been covered on an order-to-order basis is deleted, an action message is generated to cancel the related supply order. If the relationship isn't order-to-order, an action message is generated to change in order to reduce the supply. If through other factors, such as inventory adjustments, a supply order isn't required at the time you generate the action messages, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] suggests an action message of **Cancel** in the worksheet.|

# Error message: "Posting Date is not within your range of allowed posting dates…"

When you use the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job, you might run into the following error message:

**Posting date is not within your range of allowed posting dates**

This message indicates that you aren't allowed to post entries for the date you entered. You can get around this issue by changing your user setup.

## Change the user setup  

|User ID  |Allow Posting From  | Allow Posting To  |
|---------|---------|--------|
|EUROPE  |  2020-09-11      |2020-09-30      |

In this case, you're allowed to post in the date range from September 11 to September 30. However, you aren't allowed to post the adjustment value entry with a September 10 posting date.  

### Overview of the posting date setup

# Keyboard shortcuts

This article provides an overview of key combinations (keyboard shortcuts) that you can use when you work with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

You can find an overview of the most popular keyboard shortcuts in [Keyboard shortcuts (PC only)](keyboard-shortcuts-cheatsheet.md).

> [!TIP]
> For a graphical view of the most-used keyboard shortcuts, select the following image, and download the PDF file.
>
> [![Icon for the PDF file.](media/keyboard_shortcut_inline.png)](media/keyboard-shortcuts-2024.pdf "Icon that opens a PDF")

## Overview of keyboard shortcuts

Keyboard shortcuts aid accessibility and can make it easier and more efficient to navigate to different areas and elements on a page. Most web browsers support these shortcuts. However, the behavior might vary slightly.

> [!NOTE]
> The keyboard shortcuts that this article describes refer to the English (United States) keyboard layout. The layout of keys on other keyboards doesn't correspond exactly to the layout on a United States English keyboard.

Most of the keyboard shortcuts are the same, regardless of whether the operating system is Windows or macOS. However, some shortcuts differ for macOS. These shortcuts are enclosed in parentheses in the following sections.

> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports only a single character set for data. Therefore, some characters might not be supported in your environment, and you might experience issues if you try to retrieve data that was entered by using a different character set. For example, if your environment supports only English and Russian characters, data might not be stored correctly if you enter it in a language that uses different characters. This issue can also apply to keyboard shortcuts. You should contact your system administrator to ensure that you know which languages your instance of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports.
>
> In addition to the global keyboard shortcuts that this article describes, some business-specific shortcuts are available. For example, in the generic version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the <kbd>F9</kbd> key posts a document, and <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>F7</kbd> shows the ledger entries for a record when you open the record in a card. This article includes some of the more common business-specific shortcuts. Be aware that the shortcuts might differ in your solution. In the user interface, the tooltip for an action shows the keyboard shortcut to use.

## <a name="Keyboard"></a>General keyboard shortcuts

The following table describes the keyboard shortcuts for navigating and accessing different elements of a page. Elements include things like actions, dropdown lists, and lookups. Learn about the shortcuts for navigating records when you're inside a list in the [Keyboard shortcuts in lists](#lists) section.

| Select these keys<br>(these keys in macOS) | To do this |
|---|---|
| <kbd>Alt</kbd> | Show access keys for selecting actions in the action bar and on the navigation menu of the page. Learn more in the [Access keys for action bar and navigation menu](#access-keys-for-action-bar-and-navigation-menu) section. |
| <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Down arrow</kbd> | Open a dropdown list or look up a value for a field. |
|<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd><kbd>Down Arrow</kbd>|Open a related record's card or list page filtered to the value in the lookup or assist edit field|
| <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Option</kbd>+<kbd>Down arrow</kbd> | Open a related record's card or list page, which is filtered to the value in the lookup or assist-edit field. |
| <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Up arrow</kbd> | Show the tooltip for a field or a column header of a table. If the field has validation errors, select <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Up arrow</kbd> to show the validation error. Select the <kbd>Esc</kbd> key or <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Up arrow</kbd> to close the tooltip. |
| <kbd>F2</kbd> | Switch between selecting the entire field value and placing the cursor at the end of the field value. |
| <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>F2</kbd> | Show and hide the FactBox pane. |
| <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>F2</kbd> | Switch between **Details** and **Attachments** in the FactBox pane. |

| <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Q</kbd><br>(<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Option</kbd>+<kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Q</kbd>) | Open the **Find Entries** page, so that you can look for documents and entries that are related to each other, based on common information like the document number or posting date. Learn more in [Finding Related Entries for Documents](ui-find-entries.md). |
| <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>N</kbd> | Open a page where you can create a new record. (The effect is similar to the effect of selecting the **New** or **+** action.) |
| <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>N</kbd> | Close a newly created page, and then open a new one where you can create a new record. The effect of <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>F9</kbd> is similar. It posts a document and creates a new one. |
| <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>T</kbd> | Open the **My Settings** page. |
| <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Right arrow</kbd> | Look up additional information or underlying values for a field that contains the ![AssistEdit.](media/assist-edit-icon.png "AssistEdit button") button. This keyboard shortcut is used when the usual dropdown button (<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Down arrow</kbd>) in the same field is used for another purpose. |
| <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> | Show information in the company badge. As of the Business Central 2022 release wave 2 (version 21), this keyboard shortcut is no longer supported. Its replacement is <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>O</kbd>. |
| <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>F1</kbd> | Open and close the page inspection pane. The page inspection pane shows information about the page, such as its source table, fields, filters, and extensions. Learn more in [Inspecting pages in Business Central](across-inspect-page.md). |
| <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> | Copy the value of a field. If the field is in focus, and specific text in the field isn't selected, the entire value is copied. If any text in the field is selected, only that text is copied. |
| <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>F1</kbd> | Open either the [help pane](product-help-and-support.md#help-pane) or a Business Central help article on [Microsoft Learn](/dynamics365/business-central/), depending on your Business Central version. |
| <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>F12</kbd> | Switch between wide and narrow layout views. |
| <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>F5</kbd> | Reload the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] application. (The effect is similar to the effect of selecting the **Refresh** or **Reload** button in the browser.)|
| <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+select | Navigate during personalization or customization when the action is highlighted with an arrowhead. Learn more in [Personalize your workspace](ui-personalization-user.md). |
| <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>F1</kbd> | Open the **Help & Support** page. Learn more in [Help & Support page](product-help-and-support.md#help--support-page). |
| <kbd>F5</kbd> | Update the data on the current page. Use this keyboard shortcut to ensure that the data on the page is updated with any changes that other users make while you're working. |
| <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>O</kbd> | Open the **Available Companies** pane, where can use to switch to another company or environment. Learn more in [Switching to Another Company or Environment](ui-organization-switch.md). |
| <kbd>Enter</kbd> | Enable or access the element or control that is in focus. |
| <kbd>Esc</kbd> | Close the current page or dropdown list. |
| <kbd>Tab</kbd> | Move focus to the next control or element on a page, such as an action, button, field, or list heading. |
| <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd> | Move focus to the previous control or element on a page, such as an action, button, field, or list heading. |
| <kbd>Y</kbd> and <kbd>N</kbd> | <p>Activate the **Yes** and **No** buttons in dialog boxes.</p><p>**Note:** The actual keys vary, depending on your current language. You specify your language on the **My Settings** page. For example, if your current language is German, you select <kbd>J</kbd> to activate the **Ja** ("Yes") button and <kbd>N</kbd> to activate the **Nein** ("No") button. |

# Analytics in purchasing

Businesses capture lots of data during daily activities that supports business intelligence (BI) for purchasing managers:

- Purchase quotes
- Purchase orders
- Purchase invoices

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides features to help you gather, analyze, and share your organization's purchasing data:

- Power BI reports for purchasing
- Ad-hoc analysis on lists
- Ad-hoc analysis of data in Excel (using open in Excel)
- Built-in sales reports

Each of these features has advantages and disadvantages, depending on the type of data analysis and the role of the user. To learn more, go to [Analytics, business intelligence, and reporting overview](reports-bi-reporting.md).

This article introduces how you can use these analytical features to gain purchasing insights.

## Analytics needs in purchasing

When you think about the analytics needs in purchasing, it might help to use a persona-based model that describes different analytics needs at a high-level.

:::image type="content" source="/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/media/analytics-personas.svg" alt-text="Illustration of different personas for analytics" lightbox="/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/media/analytics-personas.svg":::

People in different roles have different needs when it comes to data, and they use the data in different ways. For example, people in asset management and finance interact with data differently than people in sales.

:::image type="content" source="/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/media/analytics-personas-scenarios.svg" alt-text="Illustration of how different personas have different analytics needs." lightbox="/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/media/analytics-personas-scenarios.svg":::

| Role              | Data aggregation  | Typical ways to consume data                          | 
|-------------------|-------------------| ----------------------------------------------------- |
|COO / CSO / CFO / CEO    | Performance data  | KPIs <br> Dashboards <br> Financial reports           |
|Purchasing Manager      | Trends, summaries | Built-in managerial reports <br> Ad-hoc analysis      | 
|Purchasing Officer / Purchasing Agent | Detailed data     | Built-in operational reports <br> On-screen task data |


## Using Power BI to monitor purchasing KPIs

A key performance indicator (KPI) is a measurable value that shows how effectively you’re meeting your goals. In procurement, people often use the following KPIs to monitor their procurement organization's performance:

- Outstanding Amount (excluding VAT)
- Amount Received but Not Invoiced (excluding VAT)
- Period-over-Period Purchases Growth (Amount or in percentage)
- Purchases by Item/Vendor/Location/Purchaser
- Actual purchases vs Budget

:::image type="content" source="media/purchases/purchases-overview.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Purchases Overview Power BI report" lightbox="media/purchases/purchases-overview.png":::

These purchasing KPIs, and more, are available in the Power BI Purchasing app for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. To learn more, go to [Power BI Purchasing app](purchases-powerbi-app.md).

[!INCLUDE [power-bi-purchasing-app](includes/power-bi-purchasing-app.md)]

## Use financial reporting to produce financial statements and KPIs (related to purchasing)

The **Financial Reporting** feature gives you insights into the financial data shown on your chart of accounts (COA). You can set up financial reports to analyze figures in general ledger (G/L) accounts, and compare general ledger entries with budget entries. Specifically for purchasing, you can set up financial reports on the general ledger (G/L) accounts that you use to track purchase postings.

Dimensions play an important role in business intelligence. A dimension is data that you can add to an entry as a parameter. Dimensions let you group entries that have similar characteristics, such as customers, regions, and products, and easily retrieve these groups for analysis. Among other purposes, use dimensions when you define analysis views and create financial reports. To learn more, go to [Work with Dimensions](finance-dimensions.md).

To learn more about financial reports, go to [Prepare Financial Reports with Financial Data and Account Categories](bi-how-work-account-schedule.md).

## Finance reporting across business units or legal entities (related to purchasing)

Some organizations use [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in multiple business units or legal entities. Others use [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in subsidiaries that report to parent organizations. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] gives accountants tools that help them transfer general ledger entries from two or more companies (subsidiaries) into a consolidated company. Specifically for purchasing management, you might want to consolidate general ledger entries for your purchasing accounts to track sales KPIs across business units or legal entities.

To learn more, go to [Company consolidation](finance-consolidated-company-reporting.md).

## Ad-hoc analysis of purchasing data

Sometimes, you just need to check whether the numbers add up correctly, or quickly confirm a figure. The following features are great for ad-hoc analyses:

- Data analysis on ledger list pages
- Open in Excel

The **Data Analysis** feature lets you open almost any list page, such as **Purchase Orders**, **Posted Purchase Invoices**, **Vendor Ledger Entries**, or **General Ledger Entries**, enter analysis mode, and then group, filter, and pivot data as you see fit.

:::image type="content" source="media/data-analysis-vendor-ledger-entries.png" alt-text="Example of how to do data analysis on the Customer Ledger Entries page." lightbox="media/data-analysis-vendor-ledger-entries.png":::

Similarly, you can use the **Open in Excel** action to open a list page, filter the list to a subset of the data, and then use Excel to work with the data. For example, by using features such as Analyze Data, What-If Analysis, or Forecast Sheet.

:::image type="content" source="media/open-in-excel-vendor-ledger-entries.png" alt-text="Example of how to do data analysis on the Customer Ledger Entries data using Excel." lightbox="media/open-in-excel-vendor-ledger-entries.png":::

> [!TIP]
> If you configure OneDrive for system features, the Excel workbook opens in your browser.

To learn more about how to do ad-hoc analysis on purchasing data, go to [Ad hoc analysis of purchasing data](ad-hoc-analysis-purchasing.md).

## Built-in reports for purchasing

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes several built-in reports, tracing functions, and tools to help purchasing organizations report on their data.

[!INCLUDE [purchasing_reports_report_explorer](includes/purchasing-reports-report-explorer-include.md)]

## On-screen purchasing analytics

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] has several pages that give you purchasing overviews and tasks to do. Here's an example to get you started:

- [View the Availability of Items](inventory-how-availability-overview.md)  
- [Calculate Dates for purchases](purchasing-date-calculation-for-purchases.md)
- [View purchase ledger entries](purchasing-how-record-purchases.md#viewing-ledger-entries)

### Show purchasing-related general ledger entries and balances from the Chart of Accounts page

The Chart of Accounts page shows all general ledger accounts with aggregated numbers posted to the general ledger. From this page, you can do things like:  

- View reports that show general ledger entries and balances.  
- Review a list of posting groups for that account.
- View separate debit and credit balances for a single account.

Specifically for purchasing, you can create a view on the Chart of Accounts page that only shows the accounts you use to post purchasing entries.

:::image type="content" source="media/chart-of-accounts-page.png" alt-text="Example of how the Chart of Accounts page shows finance insights" lightbox="media/chart-of-accounts-page.png":::

To learn more, go to [Understand the Chart of Accounts](finance-general-ledger.md#the-chart-of-accounts).

### Analyze data by dimensions (related to purchasing)

Dimensions are values that categorize entries so you can track and analyze them on documents, such as purchase orders. Dimensions can, for example, indicate the project or department an entry came from.  

So, instead of setting up separate general ledger accounts for each department or location, you can use dimensions as a basis for analysis and avoid having to create a complicated chart of accounts structure.

To learn more, go to [Analyze Data by Dimensions](bi-how-analyze-data-dimension.md).

# Use resources for projects

You record the usage of resources in the project journal to keep track of costs, prices, and the work types that are linked to projects. For more information, see [Record Usage for Projects](projects-how-record-job-usage.md).

> [!NOTE]
> You can also purchase external resources, for example, to invoice a vendor for work delivered. For more information, see [Record Purchases](purchasing-how-record-purchases.md).

You can also post the usage of a resource in a resource journal. Entries posted in a resource journal have no effect on the general ledger.

## To assign resources to projects

You assign resources to projects by creating project planning lines for the project. For more information, see [Create Projects](projects-how-create-jobs.md).

## To record resource usage for a project

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Project Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open a relevant project journal batch, and then fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
3. When the journal is complete, choose the **Post** action.

You may want to restructure your warehouse with new bin codes and new bin characteristics. You will not undertake this kind of activity very often, but situations can occur where a reclassification is necessary to achieve or maintain a more efficient operation. For example:  

- You might want to switch to bin codes that support the use of automatic data capture, for example, with hand-held devices.  
- The warehouse may have purchased a new rack system that gives new possibilities in item storage.  
- The company may have altered its item assortment and moved the warehouse to a new physical location to accommodate this change.  

If your warehouse is set up to use bins but not directed put-away and pick, restructure your warehouse by creating the new bins that you want to use in the future.  

## To restructure a basic warehouse that uses bins only  
1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Locations**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  On the **Warehouse** FastTab, set the **Default Bin Selection** field to **Last-Used Bin**.  
3.  Move all the contents of your current bins to the new bins that you have just created.  

    1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Item Reclassification Journal**, and then choose the related link.  
    2.  Select a journal line, and then choose the **Get Bin Content** action.  
    3.  On the **Bin Content** FastTab, set filters in the **Location Code**, **Bin Code**, and **Item No.** fields to specify the content that you want to move.  
    4.  Choose the **OK** button to fill a journal line.  
    5.  In the **New Bin Code** field, select the bin to which the items should be moved.  
    6.  Repeat steps b through e for all bin content that you want to move.  
    7.  Choose the **Post** action.  

You have now emptied the bins where the items used to be. The default bins for your items have now been changed to the new bins.  

## To restructure an advanced warehouse that uses directed put-away and pick  

1.  Create the new bins that you want to use in the future. For more information, see [Create Bins](warehouse-how-to-create-individual-bins.md).  
2.  Move all the contents of your current bins to the new bins that you just created.  

    1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Warehouse Reclassification Journal**, and then choose the related link.  
    2.  For the bins where no real movement of items is involved, create a line for each of your current bins in the **Warehouse Reclassification Journal** with the old bin code, **From Bin Code**, and the new bin code, **To Bin Code**.  
    3.  If some of the movements involve actual physical movements that you want employees to perform, use **Movement Worksheets** to prepare movement instructions instead of using the warehouse reclassification journal. For more information, see [Move Items in Advanced Warehouse Configurations](warehouse-how-to-move-items-in-advanced-warehousing.md).  

3.  When the old bins are emptied, reclassify them as **QC** type bins to ensure that they are not included in item flows.  

    1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Locations**, and then choose the related link.  
    2.  Select the line with the location, and then choose the **Bins** action.  
    3.  On the **Bins** page, in the **Bin Type Code** field, enter **QC** for each of the old bins that you emptied in step 3 in the previous procedure.  

You have now removed the bins from the warehouse flow, and reclassified them as QC bins. QC bins have none of the activity fields on the **Bin Types** page selected and are therefore not considered by the item flow. For more information, see [Set Up Bin Types](warehouse-how-to-set-up-bin-types.md).  

## To delete a bin  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Locations**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Select the location where you want to delete bins. Choose the **Bins** action.  
3.  Select the lines for the bins that you want to delete.  
4.  Choose the **Delete** action.  

If you choose the **Yes** button, the bin is deleted for use in the future, but the bin code in all warehouse entries remains the same.  

If you want to rename a bin so that all records associated with the bin are also renamed, including bin contents, warehouse activity lines, registered warehouse activity lines, warehouse worksheet lines, warehouse receipt lines, posted warehouse receipt lines, warehouse shipment lines, posted warehouse shipment lines, and warehouse entries, you can do so on the **Bins** page.  

## To rename a bin and change the bin code in all records  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Locations**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Select the location where you want to rename a bin or change the bin code, and then choose the **Bins** action.  
3.  Select the bin that you want to change and enter a new bin code in the **Code** field.  
4.  Choose the **Yes** button.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  If you choose **Yes** and there are many entries concerning this bin, for example, because you have not deleted warehouse documents for some time, it may take some time to rename all the records. Therefore, if you use this method, consider running the batch job **Delete Registered Whse. Documents** before you start the renaming process. Also note that the only documents that are deleted in this batch job are put-aways, picks, and movements.  
>   
>  If you are renaming a receiving bin or a shipping bin, all the posted receipts or shipments that refer to the bin in question are renamed.

# Set up locations

Locations are places such as warehouses where you buy, store, or sell items. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses locations to help keep track of inventory in both simple and complex warehouse processes.

You can then create document lines for a specific location, view availability by location, and transfer inventory between locations. To learn more, go to [Manage Inventory](inventory-manage-inventory.md).
<br><br>  
  
> [!Video https://learn-video.azurefd.net/vod/player?id=fe5ed50e-2e5d-47d4-8616-92ae4639f400]

## Location cards

You specify information about a location, such as a warehouse or distribution center, on the **Location Card** page. You give each location a name and a code that represents the location. You can then enter the location code in other parts of the program when you want to record transactions for a given location.  

You can enter information about bins and warehouse policies for each location. Based on your warehouse policies, you can use the options on the **Bins** FastTab to specify the bins to use by default for transactions. If you're using directed put-away and pick, the options on the **Bin Policies** FastTab let you define how to use advanced warehousing features.  

Some option fields depend on settings in the **Location Card** page to restrict unsupported setup combinations.  

Choose the **Zones** or **Bins** actions to view information about zones and bins that are defined for the location.

### To set up a location

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Locations**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action.
3. On the **Location Card** page, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for every location where you want to keep inventory.

> [!NOTE]  
> Many fields on the Location Card page are related to the handling of items in inbound and outbound warehouse processes. These fields are not relevant for companies that do not require complex warehouse functionality. To learn more, go to [Setting Up Warehouse Management](warehouse-setup-warehouse.md).

You can change the configuration of a location as long as it doesn't have item ledger entries.  

If you have multiple locations, you can define transfer routes between locations. To learn more about transfer routes, go to [To create a transfer route](inventory-how-setup-locations.md#to-create-a-transfer-route).

### To create a transfer route

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Transfer Routes**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action.
4. On the **Location Card** page, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

You can now transfer inventory items between two locations. To learn more about transfers, go to [Transfer Inventory Between Locations](inventory-how-transfer-between-locations.md).

## Bins

Bins represent the basic warehouse structure and can suggest where to put items. Your bins can have contents, or be floating bins without specific contents.

To use the bin functionality at a location, on the **Location Card** page, on the **Warehouse** FastTab, turn on the **Bin Mandatory** toggle. You can design the item flow at the location by specifying bin codes in the fields for the warehouse processes on the **Bins** and **Bin Policies** FastTabs.

> [!NOTE]
> Before you can specify bin codes on a location, you must create bin codes. To learn more about bins, go to [Create Bins](warehouse-how-to-create-individual-bins.md) and [Set Up Bin Types](warehouse-how-to-set-up-bin-types.md).  

## Zones

If you want to structure your bins under zones, you can do that in the **Zones** page. When you assign a zone to bins, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] copies information from the zone to the bins. You can also choose to set up one zone and use bins alone to organize your warehouse. To learn more about zones, go to [Setting Up Warehouse Management](warehouse-setup-warehouse.md).  

## Default Dimensions for Locations

Dimensions are values that categorize entries so you can track and analyze them using various reporting tools. For example, dimensions can indicate the department or project an entry came from. Having default dimensions helps people avoid making mistakes and having to enter dimensions manually on the transaction level if all goods come from a single location and department.

You set default dimensions for a location on the **Location Card** page by choosing **Dimensions**. Afterward, the location's default dimensions are assigned to the following documents when you choose the location on a line.

* Transfer orders
* Physical inventory orders
* Inventory shipments
* Inventory receipts
* Item journals

If needed, you can delete or change the dimension on the line. In the **Value Posting** field, you can require people to specify dimensions for locations before they can post an entry. If you want to allow people to choose only certain dimension values, you can specify the values in the **Allowed Values Filter** field. You can also include location dimension values on the **Default Dimension Priorities** page, and for combinations of priority and dimension rules on the **Dimension Combinations** page.

Because transfer order documents and reclassification journals deal with more than one location, the order in which you enter data is important. Default dimensions are copied from the last location field (the in-transit location is ignored).

### Example of default dimensions on locations

The following examples illustrate how the default dimension is used.

You have the following dimension settings:

* Location EAST. Department dimension is ADM
* Location WEST. Department dimension is PROD

You specify the location on a transfer order as follows:

1. From Location = EAST
2. To Location = WEST

The PROD dimension will be copied from location WEST.

You fill in the fields in the opposite order, as follows:

1. To Location = WEST
2. From Location = EAST

The ADM dimension will be copied from location EAST.

# Design Details: Item Application

When you post an inventory transaction, the quantity posting is recorded in the item ledger entries, the value posting in the value entries. For more information, see [Design Details: Inventory Posting](design-details-inventory-posting.md).  

In addition, an item application is made to link the cost recipient to its cost source to provide cost forwarding according to the costing method. For more information, see [Design Details: Costing Methods](design-details-costing-methods.md).  

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] makes two types of item application.  

|Application type|Description|  
|----------------------|---------------------------------------|  
|Quantity application|Created for all inventory transactions|  
|Cost application|Created for inbound entries together with a quantity application as a result of user interaction in special processes.|  

Item applications can be made in the following ways.  

|Method|Description|Application type|  
|------------|---------------------------------------|----------------------|  
|Automatic|Occurs as general cost forwarding according to the costing method|Quantity application|  
|Fixed|Made by the user when:<br /><br /> -   Processing returns<br />-   Posting corrections<br />-   Undoing quantity postings<br />-   Creating drop shipments **Note:**  The fixed application can be  made either manually by entering an entry number in the **Appl.-from Item Entry** field or by using a function, such as the **Get Posted Document Lines to Reverse**.|Quantity application<br /><br /> Cost application **Note:**  Cost application only occurs in inbound transactions where the **Appl.-from Item Entry** field is filled to create a fixed application. See the next table.|  

Whether quantity applications or cost applications are made depends on the direction of the inventory transaction and whether the item application is made automatically or fixed, in connection with special processes.  

The following table shows, based on the central application fields on inventory transaction lines, how costs flow depending on the transaction direction. It also indicates when and why the item application is of type quantity or cost.  

|-|Appl.-to Item Entry field|Appl.-from Item Entry field|  
|-|--------------------------------|----------------------------------|  
|Application for outbound entry|The outbound entry pulls the cost from the open inbound entry.<br /><br /> **Quantity application**|Not supported|  
|Application for inbound entry|The inbound entry pushes the cost onto the open outbound entry.<br /><br /> The inbound entry is the cost source.<br /><br /> **Quantity application**|The inbound entry pulls the cost from the outbound entry. **Note:**  When making this fixed application, the inbound transaction is treated as a sales return. Therefore, the applied outbound entry remains open. <br /><br /> The inbound entry is NOT the cost source.<br /><br /> **Cost application**|  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> A sales return is NOT considered a cost source when fixed applied.  
>
> The sales entry remains open until the real source is posted.  

An item application entry records the following information.  

|Field|Description|  
|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
|**Item Ledger Entry No.**|The number of the item ledger entry for the transaction that this application entry is created for.|  
|**Inbound Item Entry No.**|The item ledger entry number of the inventory increase to which the transaction should be linked, if applicable.|  
|**Outbound Item Entry No.**|The item ledger entry number of the inventory decrease to which the transaction should be linked, if applicable.|  
|**Quantity**|The quantity being applied.|  
|**Posting Date**|The posting date of the transaction.|  

## Inventory Increase  
When you post an inventory increase, then a simple item application entry is recorded without an application to an outbound entry.  

### Example  
The following table shows the item application entry that is created when you post a purchase receipt of 10 units.  

|Posting Date|Inbound Item Entry No.|Outbound Item Entry No.|Quantity|Item Ledger Entry No.|  
|------------------|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------|---------------------------------------------|  
|01-01-20|1|0|10|1|  

## Inventory Decrease  
When you post an inventory decrease, an item application entry is created that links the inventory decrease to an inventory increase. This link is created by using the item's costing method as a guideline. For items using FIFO, Standard, and Average costing methods, the linking is based on the first-in-first-out principle. The inventory decrease is applied to the inventory increase with the earliest posting date. For items using the LIFO costing method, the linking is based on the last-in-first-out principle. The inventory decrease is applied to the inventory increase with the most recent posting date.  

In the  **Item Ledger Entry** table, the **Remaining Quantity** field shows the quantity that has not yet been applied. If the remaining quantity is more than 0, then the **Open** check box is selected.  

### Example  
The following example shows the item application entry that is created when you post a sales shipment of 5 units of the items that were received in the previous example. The first item application entry is the purchase receipt. The second application entry is the sales shipment.  

The following table shows the two item application entries that result from the inventory increase and the inventory decrease, respectively.  

|Posting Date|Inbound Item Entry No.|Outbound Item Entry No.|Quantity|Item Ledger Entry No.|  
|------------------|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------|---------------------------------------------|  
|01-01-20|1|0|10|1|  
|01-03-20|1|2|-5|2|  

## Fixed Application  
You make a fixed application when you specify that the cost of an inventory increase should apply to a specific inventory decrease, or vice versa. The fixed application affects the remaining quantities of the entries, but the fixed application also reverses the exact cost of the original entry that you are applying to, or from.  

To make a fixed application, you use the **Appl.-to Item Entry** field or the **Appl.-from Item Entry** field in the document lines to specify the item ledger entry that you want the transaction line to apply to, or from. For example, you might make a fixed application when you want to create a cost application that specifies that a sales return should apply to a specific sales shipment to reverse the cost of the sales shipment. In this case, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] ignores the costing method and applies the inventory decrease, or increase, for a sales return, to the item ledger entry that you specify. The advantage of making a fixed application is that the cost of the original transaction is passed to the new transaction.  

### Example – Fixed Application in Purchase Return  
The following example, which illustrates the effect of fixed application of a purchase return of an item using the FIFO costing method, is based on the following scenario:  

1. In entry 1, the user posts a purchase at a cost of LCY 10.00.  
2. In entry 2, the user posts a purchase at a cost of LCY 20.00.  
3. In entry 3, the user posts a purchase return. The user makes a fixed application to the second purchase by entering the item ledger entry number in the **Appl.-to Item Entry** field on the purchase return order line.  

The following table shows item ledger entries resulting from the scenario.  

|**Posting Date**|**Item Ledger Entry Type**|**Quantity**|**Cost Amount (Actual)**|**Item Ledger Entry No.**|  
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------|------------------|----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|  
|01-04-20|Purchase|10|10.00|1|  
|01-05-20|Purchase|10|20.00|2|  
|01-06-20|Purchase (Return)|-10|-20.00|3|  

Because a fixed application is made from the purchase return to the second purchase entry, the items are returned at the correct cost. If the user had not performed the fixed application, then the returned item would be incorrectly valued at LCY 10.00 because the return would have been applied to the first purchase entry according to the FIFO principle.  

The following table shows the item application entry that results from the fixed application.  

|Posting Date|Inbound Item Entry No.|Outbound Item Entry No.|Quantity|Item Ledger Entry No.|  
|------------------|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------|---------------------------------------------|  
|01-06-20|2|3|10|3|  

The cost of the second purchase, LCY 20.00, is passed correctly to the purchase return.  

### Example – Fixed Application with Average Cost  
The following example, which illustrates the effect of fixed application, is based on the following scenario for an item that uses the Average costing method:  

1. In entry numbers 1 and 2, the user posts two purchase invoices. The second invoice has the incorrect direct unit cost of LCY 1000.00.  
2. In entry number 3, the user posts a purchase credit memo with a fixed application applied to the purchase entry with the wrong direct unit cost. The sum of the **Cost Amount (Actual)** field for the two fixed applied value entries becomes 0.00  
3. In entry number 4, the user posts another purchase invoice with the correct direct unit cost of LCY 100.00  
4. In entry number 5, the user posts a sales invoice.  
5. The inventory quantity is 0, and the inventory value is also 0.00  

The following table shows the result of the scenario on the item's value entries.  

The following table shows the result of the scenario on the item's value entries after posting is complete and cost adjustment has been run.

|Posting Date|Item Ledger Entry Type|Valued Quantity|Cost Amount (Actual)|Appl.-to Item Entry|Valued by Average Cost|Item Ledger Entry No.|Entry No.|  
|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|  
|01-01-20|Purchase|1|200.00||No|1|1|  
|01-01-20|Purchase|1|1000.00||No|2|2|  
|01-01-20|Purchase|-1|-1000|2|No|3|3|  
|01-01-20|Purchase|1|100.00||No|4|4|  
|01-01-20|Sale|-2|-300.00||Yes|5|5|  

If the user had not made the fixed application between the purchase credit memo and the purchase with the incorrect direct unit cost (step 2 in the previous scenario), then the cost would have been adjusted differently.  

The following table shows the result on the item's value entries if step 2 in the previous scenario is performed without a fixed application.  

|Posting Date|Item Ledger Entry Type|Valued Quantity|Cost Amount (Actual)|Valued by Average Cost|Item Ledger Entry No.|Entry No.|  
|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|  
|01-01-20|Purchase|1|200.00|No|1|1|  
|01-01-20|Purchase|1|1000.00|No|2|2|  
|01-01-20|Purchase|-1|433,33|Yes|3|3|  
|01-01-20|Purchase|1|100.00|No|4|4|  
|01-01-20|Sale|-2|866,67|Yes|5|5|  

In entry number 3, the value in the **Cost Amount (Actual)** field is valued by average and therefore includes the erroneous posting of 1000.00. Accordingly, it becomes -433,33, which is an inflated cost amount. The calculation is 1300 / 3 = .-433,33.  

In entry number 5, the value of the **Cost Amount (Actual)** field for this entry is also inaccurate for the same reason.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  If you create a fixed application for an inventory decrease for an item that uses the Average costing method, then the decrease will not receive the average cost for the item as usual, but will instead receive the cost of the inventory increase that you specified. That inventory decrease is then no longer part of the average cost calculation.  

### Example – Fixed Application in Sales Return  
Fixed applications are also a very good means of reversing cost exactly, such as with sales returns.  

The following example, which illustrates how a fixed application ensures exact cost reversal, is based on the following scenario:  

1.  The user posts a purchase invoice.  
2.  The user posts a sales invoice.  
3.  The user posts a sales credit memo for the returned item, which applies to the sales entry, to reverse the cost correctly.  
4.  A freight cost, related to the purchase order that was posted earlier, arrives. The user posts it as an item charge.  

The following table shows the result of scenario steps 1 through 3 on the item's value entries.  

|Posting Date|Item Ledger Entry Type|Valued Quantity|Cost Amount (Actual)|Appl.-from Item Entry|Item Ledger Entry No.|Entry No.|  
|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|  
|01-01-20|Purchase|1|1000.00||1|1|  
|02-01-20|Sale|-1|1000.00||2|2|  
|03-01-20|Sale (Credit Memo)|1|1000|2|3|3|  

The following table shows the value entry resulting from scenario step 4, posting the item charge.  

|Posting Date|Item Ledger Entry Type|Valued Quantity|Cost Amount (Actual)|Appl.-from Item Entry|Item Ledger Entry No.|Entry No.|  
|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|  
|04-01-20|(Item Charge)|1|100.00||1|4|  

The following table shows the effect of the exact cost reversal on the item's value entries.  

|Posting Date|Item Ledger Entry Type|Valued Quantity|Cost Amount (Actual)|Appl.-from Item Entry|Item Ledger Entry No.|Entry No.|  
|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|  
|01-01-20|Purchase|1|1000.00||1|1|  
|02-01-20|Sale|-1|1100.00||2|2|  
|03-01-20|Sale (Credit Memo)|1|1100.00|2|3|3|  
|04-01-20|(Item Charge)|1|100.00||1|4|  

When you run the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job, the increased cost of the purchase entry, due to the item charge, is forwarded to the sales entry (entry number 2). The sales entry then forwards this increased cost to the sales credit entry (entry number 3). The final result is that the cost is correctly reversed.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  If you are working with returns or credit memos and you have set up the **Exact Cost Reversing Mandatory** field in either the **Purchases & Payables Setup** page or the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page, as appropriate for your situation, then [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically fills the various application entry fields when you use the **Copy from Document** function. If you use the **Get Posted Document Lines to Reverse** function, then the fields are always filled automatically.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  If you post a transaction with a fixed application, and the item ledger entry that you are applying to is closed, meaning that the remaining quantity is zero, then the old application is automatically undone and reapplies the item ledger entry using the fixed application that you specified.  

## Transfer Application  
When an item is transferred from one location to another, inside the company inventory, then an application is created between the two transfer entries. Valuing a transfer entry depends on the costing method. For items using the Average costing method, valuation is made using the average cost in the average cost period in which the valuation date of the transfer occurs. For items using other costing methods, valuation is made by tracing back to the cost of the original inventory increase.  

### Example – Average Costing Method  
The following example, which illustrates how transfer entries are applied, is based on the following scenario for an item using Average costing method and an average cost period of Day.  

1. The user purchases the item at a cost of LCY 10.00.  
2. The user purchases the item again at a cost of LCY 20.00.  
3. The user transfers the item from EAST to WEST location.  

The following table shows the effect of the transfer on the item's value entries.  

|Posting Date|Item Ledger Entry Type|Location Code|Valued Quantity|Cost Amount (Actual)|Entry No.|  
|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|  
|01-01-20|Purchase|EAST|1|10.00|1|  
|01-01-20|Purchase|EAST|1|20.00|2|  
|02-01-20|Transfer|EAST|-1|15.00|3|  
|02-01-20|Transfer|WEST|1|15.00|4|  

### Example – Standard Costing Method  
The following example, which illustrates how transfer entries are applied, is based on the following scenario for an item using Standard costing method and an average cost period of Day.  

1. The user purchases the item at a standard cost of LCY 10.00.  
2. The user transfers the item from EAST to WEST location at a standard cost of LCY 12.00.  

The following table shows the effect of the transfer on the item's value entries.  

|Posting Date|Item Ledger Entry Type|Location Code|Valued Quantity|Cost Amount (Actual)|Entry No.|  
|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|  
|01-01-20|Purchase|EAST|1|10.00|1|  
|02-01-20|Transfer|EAST|-1|10.00|2|  
|02-01-20|Transfer|WEST|1|10.00|3|  

Since the value of the original inventory increase is LCY 10.00, the transfer is valued at that cost, not at LCY 12.00.  

## Reapplication  
Because of the way an item's unit cost is calculated, an incorrect item application could lead to a skewed average cost and unit cost. The following scenarios may cause incorrect item applications, which require that you undo item applications and reapply item ledger entries:  

* You have forgotten to make a fixed application.  
* You have made an incorrect fixed application.  
* You want to overrule the application created automatically when posting, according to the item's costing method.  
* You have to return an item to which a sale has already been manually applied, without using the **Get Posted Document Lines to Reverse** function, and you must therefore undo the application.  

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers a feature for analyzing and correcting item applications. This work is performed on the **Application Worksheet** page.

# Moving Annual Total (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Moving Annual Total (MAT)** report calculates a total of sales over the last 12 months. This is a rolling calculation where the date is continually moving.

The report showcases the sales amount moving annual total (MAT), and compares it to the MAT for the previous period.

:::image type="content" source="media/powerbi/sales/sales-moving-annual-total.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Moving Annual Total Power BI report" lightbox="media/powerbi/sales/sales-moving-annual-total.png":::

## How to use the report

Business leaders and managers use the report to identify how the MAT is performing across the period.

Business leaders can use the report to monitor the overall sales performance of your organization over the last 12 months. By analyzing the [Moving Annual Total (MAT)](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#sales-amount-mat-fiscal) and [Previous Year Moving Annual Total (PYMAT)](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#sales-amount-pymat-fiscal) figures, you can identify trends in sales growth and compare your organization's performance to the previous year. You can also use the [Moving Annual Total Growth Amount](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#sales-amount-matg-fiscal) and [Growth %](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#sales-amount-matg--fiscal) figures to identify periods that performed well or didn't meet the growth expectation.

For example, if you notice that your organization's sales growth is stagnant or declining, you can use this information to develop a plan that focuses on improving sales and increasing marketing efforts during these periods.

Sales managers can use the report to analyze sales data over the last 12 months and gain insights into sales trends. By drilling down into the sales figures for specific categories, you can identify areas of strength and weakness in your sales performance. For example, you might notice that sales of some items have declined over the last few months while the sales of other items are increasing.

The monthly analysis helps you identify when sales started to decline and take necessary actions to introduce products that align with the new trend to increase sales and meet customer demand. With this information, you can make data-driven decisions to optimize your sales strategy and drive revenue growth for your company.

## Key performance indicators

The report includes the following key performance indicators (KPIs) and measures:

- [**Moving Annual Total (MAT)**](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#sales-amount-mat-fiscal)
- [**Previous Year Moving Annual Total (PYMAT)**](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#sales-amount-pymat-fiscal)
- [**Moving Annual Total Growth Amount**](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#sales-amount-matg-fiscal)
- [**Moving Annual Total Growth %**](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#sales-amount-matg--fiscal)
- [**Sales Amount**](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#sales-amount)

# Define an invoice posting policy for users

Companies often have unique processes for posting sales and purchase invoices and shipments. For example, processes can vary from one person posting everything on a purchase order, to multiple employees. You can restrict users from posting invoices, or require that invoices are posted together with shipments or receipts.

## To specify a posting policy

On the **User Setup** page, in the **Sales Invoice Posting Policy** and **Purch. Invoice Posting Policy** fields, choose one of the following options:

* **Allowed** (Default) - Keep the current behavior, where a user can choose the posting option to use, such as **Ship**, **Invoice**, and **Ship and Invoice**. 
* **Prohibited** - Prevent the user from posting invoices. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] shows a confirmation dialog that provides only the **Ship** or **Receive** options.
* **Mandatory** - Allow the user to post invoices together with receipts or shipments. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] shows a confirmation dialog with the **Ship and Invoice** or **Receive and Invoice** options.

## Effect on documents

The following table describes how invoice posting policies affect documents.

> [!NOTE]
> When you post sales and purchase invoices and credit memos, you don't have any posting options. The documents always post the physical and financial transactions together. You can't partially post invoices and credit memos.

|Document | Option 1: Allow <br>Displays a series of options| Option 2: Prohibited <br>Confirmation dialog | Option 3: Mandatory <br>Confirmation dialog|
|--|--|--|--|
|Sales order |- Ship <br>- Invoice <br>- Ship and Invoice |Do you want to post the shipment? |Do you want to post the shipment and invoice?|
|Sales invoice|No options| Posting is prohibited per User Setup|Do you want to post the invoice?|
|Sales credit memo|No options|Posting is prohibited per User Setup|Do you want to post the credit memo?|
|Sales return order |- Receive <br>- Invoice <br>- Receive and Invoice |Do you want to post the receipt? |Do you want to post the receipt and invoice?|
|Inventory pick |- Ship <br>- Ship and Invoice |Do you want to post the shipment? |Do you want to post the shipment and invoice?|
|Purchase order |- Receive <br>- Invoice <br>- Receive and Invoice |Do you want to post the receipt? |Do you want to post the receipt and invoice?|
|Purchase invoice|No options|Posting is prohibited per User Setup|Do you want to post the invoice?|
|Purchase credit memo|No options|Posting is prohibited per User Setup|Do you want to post the credit memo?|
|Purchase Return Order |- Ship <br>- Invoice <br>- Ship and Invoice |Do you want to post the shipment? |Do you want to post the shipment and invoice?|
|Inventory Put-away |- Receive <br>- Receive and Invoice |Do you want to post the receipt? |Do you want to post the receipt and invoice?|
|Warehouse Shipment |- Ship <br>- Ship and Invoice | Do you want to post the shipment? |Do you want to post the shipment and invoice?|

   > [!Note]
   > The setting doesn't affect posting of general journal lines where you can select **Invoice** in the **Document Type** field.

# Track your business KPIs with Power BI metrics

If you use Power BI on [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] data, it's easy to track KPIs or metrics that are important to you.

With metrics in Power BI, you can curate your own metrics and track them against key business objectives, in a single pane. This feature enhances data culture by promoting accountability, alignment, and visibility for teams and initiatives within organizations.

Follow this four-step process to set up Power BI metrics:

1. Create a scorecard in Power BI. Learn more at [Create scorecards in Power BI](/power-bi/create-reports/service-goals-create).  
2. Add the metrics you want to track by connecting to your Power BI report on telemetry. Learn more at [Create connected metrics](/power-bi/create-reports/service-goals-create-connected).  
3. Add alerting, if needed, to define status rules for your metrics. Learn more at [Create automated status rules for metrics](/power-bi/create-reports/service-metrics-status-rules).  

    This step automates status updates based on rules that govern the metric. Rules trigger changes based on value, percentage of target met, date conditions, or a combination of the three, making the rules versatile. For connected metrics, these status rules refresh every time the data in your scorecard refreshes.
4. Follow metrics to get alerts in Teams or by email. Learn more at [Follow your metrics](/power-bi/create-reports/service-metrics-follow).  

Learn more about Power BI metrics at [Get started with metrics in Power BI](/power-bi/create-reports/service-goals-introduction).

> [!NOTE]
> Starting with Business Central 2023 release wave 2, it's possible to embed scorecards from Power BI metrics in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

# Let Business Central suggest values

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] helps you complete tasks faster and more accurately by prefilling fields or completing lines with data that you would otherwise calculate and enter manually. Although such automatic data entry is always correct, you can change it afterwards if you want to.

This article contains a selection of such functionality. More sections will be added in future updates of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## Autofill fields with Copilot (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner-section.md)]

When you draft a new record or edit an existing record, Copilot suggests values for editable fields on the page. Learn more in [Autofill fields with Copilot](autofill-fields-with-copilot.md).

## The **Suggest Balancing Amount** check box on the **General Journal Batches** page

When, for example, you're entering general journal lines for multiple expenses that must all be posted to the same bank account, then each time you enter a new journal line for an expense, you can have the **Amount** field on the bank account line automatically updated to the amount that balances the expenses. For more information about working with general journals, see [Work with General Journals](ui-work-general-journals.md).

### To have the **Amount** field on balancing general journal lines filled automatically

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Journals**, and then choose the related link.
1. On the line for your preferred general journal batch, choose the **Suggest Balancing Amount** check box.
1. Open the general journal and proceed to register and post transactions using the described functionality for automatic entry of a field value.       

For information about how to set up a personal general journal batch, for example, for expense handling, see [Work with General Journals](ui-work-general-journals.md).

## The **Automatically Fill Date Received** field on the **Payment Registration** page

The **Register Customer Payments** page shows outstanding incoming payments as lines that represent sales documents where an amount is due for payment. For more information about applying customer payments, see [Reconcile Customer Payments from a List of Unpaid Sales Documents](receivables-how-reconcile-customer-payments-list-unpaid-sales-documents.md).

Your main actions on the page are to fill in the **Payment Made** check box and the **Date Received** field. You can set [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] up to automatically enter work date in the **Date Received** field when you select the **Payment Made** check box.

### To have the **Date Received** field on the **Payment Registration** page filled automatically

# The Sales and Inventory Forecast extension

Inventory management is a trade-off between customer service and managing your cost. On one hand, a low inventory requires less working capital, but, on the other hand, stock-outs potentially lead to missed sales. The Sales and Inventory Forecast extension predicts potential sales using historical data and gives a clear overview of expected stock-outs. Based on the forecast, the extension helps create replenishment requests to your vendors and saves you time.  

## Setting up forecasting

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the connection to [Azure AI](https://azure.microsoft.com/overview/ai-platform/) is already set up for you. But you can configure the forecast to use a different type of period to report by, such as changing from forecasting by month to forecasting by quarter. You can also choose the number of periods to calculate the forecast by, depending on how granular you want the forecast to be. We suggest that you forecast by month and with a 12 month horizon for the forecast.

> [!TIP]  
> Consider the length of the periods that the service will use in its calculations. The more data you provide, the more accurate the predictions will be. Also, watch out for large variances in periods. They will also impact predictions. If Azure AI does not find enough data, or the data varies a lot, the service will not make a prediction.

## Use the forecasts

The extension uses Azure AI to predict future sales based on your sales history to help you avoid inventory shortage. For example, when you choose an item on the **Items** page, the chart in the **Item Forecast** pane shows the estimated sales of this item in the coming period. This way you can see if you're likely to run out of stock of the item soon.  

You can also use the extension to suggest when to stock up on inventory. For example, you might create a purchase order for Fabrikam to buy their new desk chair. The Sales and Inventory Forecast extension might suggest that you also restock on the LONDON swivel chair that you usually buy from this vendor. The extension can forecast that you'll soon run out of stock of the LONDON swivel chair, so you might order more chairs already now.  

## Design details

Subscriptions for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] come with access to several predictive web services in all regions where [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is available. For more information, see the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central Licensing Guide. The guide is available for download on the [Business Central](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/en-us/business-central/overview/) website.

These web services are stateless, meaning they use data only to calculate predictions on demand. They don't store data.

> [!NOTE]  
> You can also use your own predictive web service instead of ours. For more information, see [Create and use your own predictive web service for sales and inventory forecasts](#AnchorText). 

### Data required for forecast

To make predictions about future sales, the web service requires quantitative data about past sales. That data comes from the **Posting Date**, **Item No**, and **Quantity** fields on the **Item Ledger Entries** page, where:

- The entry type is "Sale."
- The posting date is between the date that is calculated based on the values in the **Historical Periods** and **Period Type** fields on the **Sales and Inventory Forecast Setup** page and the work date.

Before is uses the web service, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] compresses transactions by **Item No.** and **Posting Date** based on the value in the **Period Type** field in the **Sales and Inventory Forecast Setup** page.

## <a name="AnchorText"> </a>Create and use your own predictive web service for sales and inventory forecasts

For [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, the model is published by Microsoft and connected to the Microsoft subscription. For other deployment options, you must create Machine Learning resources in your own Azure subscription. You can find sample steps in the [sample repo](https://github.com/microsoft/BCTech/tree/master/samples/MachineLearning). The purpose of this task is to get the API URI and API key.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales and Inventory Forecast Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Expand the **General** FastTab, and then fill in the API URL and API key fields.

> [!NOTE]
> You can always switch back to resources managed by Microsoft by removing values from API URL and API Key fields.  

## Limitations of the Sales and Inventory Forecast extension

The Sales and Inventory Forecast extension produces aggregated forecast for all locations and variants. If you have multiple locations, for example, that represent different stores, you can't get a forecast for each location. You must distribute amounts afterwards.

Regarding throughput, we estimate that [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can process approximately 50000 items in 12 hours, which is defined as the *Max Execution Timeout*. The exact number depends on the data and settings for extensions. For more information about report limits in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and how they're configured in the online service, see [Report limits in Business Central](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/operational-limits-online#Reports).

The Sales and Inventory Forecast extension doesn't support filtering, means you can't split items into separate batches.

You can create sales and production forecasts with the **Demand Forecasts** list page. Then, for each forecast, you specify various settings for that forecast in the **Demand Forecast Overview** page.  

Forecasting functionality is used to create anticipated demand; actual demand is created from sales and production orders. During creation of the Master Production Schedule (MPS), the forecast is netted against the sales and production orders. The **Forecast Type** field on the forecast determines which type of requirements to take into consideration in the netting process. If the forecast is for a *sales item*, only sales orders net the forecast. If it is for *components*, only dependent demand from production order components net the forecast.  

Forecasting allows your company to create "what if" scenarios and efficiently and cost-effectively plan for and meet demand. Accurate forecasting can make a critical difference in customer satisfaction levels with regard to order promising dates and on-time delivery.  

You can also define the right level of details in the **Forecast by Location** and **Forecast by Variant** fields in the **Demand Forecast Overview** page. Filters and other settings are stored in the **Demand Forecast Name** table, so you can easily stop and continue your work later. 

## Sales forecasts and production forecasts

The forecasting functionality in application can be used to create sales or production forecasts, in combination or independently. For example, most make-to-order companies do not carry finished goods inventory, because each item is produced when it is ordered. Anticipating orders (sales forecasting) is critical for a reasonable turnaround time on the finished goods (production forecasting). As an example, component parts with lengthy delivery times, if not on order or on inventory, can delay production.  

- The sales forecast is the sales department's best guess at what will be sold in the future, and is specified by item and by period. However, the sales forecast is not always adequate for production.  
- The production forecast is the production planner's projection of how many end items and derived subassemblies to produce in specific periods to meet the forecasted sales.  

In most cases, then, the production planner modifies the sales forecast to fit the conditions of production, yet still satisfies the sales forecast.  

You create forecasts manually on the **Demand Forecast** page. Multiple forecasts can exist in the system, and are differentiated by name and type. Forecasts can be copied and edited as necessary. 

> [!NOTE]
> Only one forecast is valid for planning purposes at any time.

The forecast consists of a number of records each stating item number, forecast date, and forecasted quantity. The forecast of an item covers a period, which is defined by the forecast date and the forecast date of the next (later) forecast record. From a planning point of view, the forecasted quantity should be available at the start of the demand period.  

You must designate a forecast as *Sales Item*, *Component*, or *Both*. The forecast type *Sales Item* is used for sales forecasting. The production forecast is created using the *Component* type. The forecast type *Both* is only used to give the planner an overview of both the sales forecast and the production forecast. With this option, the forecast entries are not editable. By designating these forecast types here, you can use the same worksheet to enter a sales forecast as you do a production forecast, and use the same sheet to view both forecasts simultaneously. Note that the system treats the different inputs (sales and production) differently when calculating planning, based on item, manufacturing, and production setup.  

## Component forecast

The component forecast can be seen as an option forecast in relation to a parent item. This can, for example, be useful if the planner can estimate the demand for the component.  

Because the component forecast is designed to define options for a parent item, the component forecast should be less than or equal to the sales item forecast quantity. If the component forecast is higher than the sales item forecast, the system treats the difference between these two types of forecasts as independent demand.  

## Forecasting periods

The forecast period is valid from its starting date until the date the next forecast starts. The time interval page gives you multiple choices to insert the demand at a specific date in a period. It is therefore recommended not to change the forecast period scope unless you want to move all forecast entries to the starting date of this period.  

## Forecast by locations

On the **Manufacturing Setup** page you can specify whether you want to consider the locations that are defined on forecasts when you calculate plans. 

### Use forecast by locations

If you turn on the **Use Forecast by Location** toggle, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] respects any location codes that are specified for each demand forecast entry and calculate the remaining forecast for each location.  

Consider this example: Your company purchases and sells items on two locations: EAST and WEST. For both locations, you have configured a lot-to-lot reordering policy. You create a forecast for the two locations:

- 10 pieces for location EAST
- 4 pieces for location WEST

Then, you create a sales order with a quantity of 12 on location WEST. The planning system will suggest that you do the following:

- Replenish 10 pieces for location EAST, based on data from the forecast.  
- Replenish 12 pieces for location WEST, based on the sales order. The four pieces that were specified in the forecast are fully consumed by the actual demand of the sales order. For more information, see [Forecast Demand is Reduced by Sales Orders](design-details-balancing-demand-and-supply.md#forecast-demand-is-reduced-by-sales-orders).  

> [!NOTE]  
> If location-based forecasts are viewed in isolation, the overall forecast might not be representative.

### If you don't use forecast by locations

If you turn off the **Use Forecast by Location** toggle, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] ignores the location codes that are specified for each demand forecast entry and aggregate the forecasts into a forecast for empty locations.  

Consider this example: Your company purchases and sells items on two locations: EAST and WEST. For both locations, you configured a lot-to-lot reordering policy. You create a forecast for the two locations:

- 10 pieces for location EAST
- 4 pieces for location WEST

Then, you create a sales order with a quantity of 12 on location WEST. The planning system suggests that you do the following:

- Replenish 12 pieces for location WEST, based on the sales order.  
- Replenish 2 pieces for the empty location. The 10 and 4 pieces that were specified in the forecast are partially consumed by the actual demand of the sales order. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] ignored the location codes that were specified by the user and uses a blank location instead.  

> [!NOTE]  
> You can set a filter by locations, but location-based results might not match planning results without filters.

## To create a demand forecast

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Demand Forecast**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **General** FastTab, select a forecast in the **Demand Forecast Name** field. Multiple forecasts can exist and are differentiated by name and forecast type.  
3. In the **Location Filter** field, select the location to which this forecast will apply.
4. In the **View by** field to change the period that is displayed in each column. You can select from the following intervals: **Day**, **Week**, **Month**, **Quarter**, **Year**, or the **Accounting Period** as set up in your finance area.

> [!NOTE]  
> You should consider which time interval that you want to use for future forecasts so that the time interval is consistent throughout. When you enter a forecast quantity, it is valid on the first day of the time interval that you select. For example, if you select a month, enter the forecast quantity on the first day of the month. If you select a quarter, enter the forecast quantity on the first day of the first month in the quarter.

5. In the **View as** field, select how the forecast quantities are shown for the time interval. If you select **Net Change**, then the net change in balance is displayed for the time interval. If you select **Balance at Date**, then the page displays the balance as of the last day in the time interval.  
6. In the **Forecast Type** field, select **Sales Item**,  **Component**, or **Both**. If you select **Sales Item** or **Component**, then you can edit the quantity by period. If you select **Both**, then you cannot edit the quantity, but you can choose the drop-down arrow button and view the demand forecast entries.  
7. Specify a **Date Filter** if you want to limit the amount of data displayed.  
8. On the **Demand Forecast Matrix** FastTab, enter the forecasted quantities by typing a quantity in the cell representing an item on a particular date or period. Note that in empty cells, the lookup button opens an empty page indicating that you must enter a value manually.   

> [!NOTE]  
> You can also edit an existing forecast. On the **Demand Forecast Matrix** page, choose the **Copy Demand Forecast** action and populate the **Demand Forecast** page with an existing forecast. You can then edit quantities as appropriate.

# Set up payment terms

Payment terms determine how you manage due dates and payment discounts. You can use date formulas to define the payment terms. When you first sign up for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the demonstration company provides a few payment methods that businesses often use. You can, however, add as many as you need.  

If you assign payment terms to customers and vendors, the same terms are always used on the sales and purchase documents you create for them. The document dates on sales and purchase documents, not their posting dates, are used to calculate due dates for payments. If needed, you can change the terms on the sales or purchase document. For example, if you want a particular customer to pay you within seven days rather than the default 14 days. Changing the terms on the document doesn't change the default payment term assigned to the customer. The same payment terms are available for sales and purchase documents.

When you post an invoice, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates the payment discounts based on the payment terms. The payment discount date is the last date that the customer can receive a discount. The date is also calculated when you post an invoice.  

Similarly, when you post a credit memo, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates payment discounts based on the payment terms. It calculates the discount on credit memos in the same way as discounts on invoices. When you apply a credit memo to an invoice, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] reduces the discount amount for the invoice by the credit memo's discount amount.  

If you want to send your customers reminders of overdue payments, you must set up reminder levels and terms. To learn more about reminders, go to [Set Up Reminder Terms and Levels](finance-setup-reminders.md).  

## To set up payment terms

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Payment Terms**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  

After you set up the payment terms, you assign them to customers and vendors. Optionally, assign payment terms to your payment methods.  

> [!TIP]
> In the base version of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], payment terms don't support partial payments. Instead, you must use the prepayments functionality. To learn more about prepayments, go to [Set Up Prepayments](finance-set-up-prepayments.md).
>
> In some countries/regions, you *can* set up payment terms with partial payments. To learn whether your country/region supports this capability, go to the **Local Functionality** section in the table of contents on the left side of a [Microsoft Learn](about-localization.md) article.

## Audit changes to payment terms

You can use the Change Log feature to capture changes users make to your payment terms setup. [!INCLUDE [include-audit-what-who-when](includes/include-audit-what-who-when.md)]

The following table lists the table for payment terms and its ID.

| Table | Table ID |
|------ | -------- |
| Payment Terms    | 3 |

# Set Up Base Calendars

You can assign a base calendar to your company and its business partners, such as customers, vendors, or locations. Delivery and receipt dates on future sales order, purchase order, transfer order, and production order lines are calculated according to the calendar’s specified working days. The main task in setting up a new base calendar is to specify and define the non-working days that you want to apply.  

## To set up a base calendar

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Base Calendar**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Choose the **New** action.  
3.  Fill in the **Code** field.  
4. Choose the **Maintain Base Calendar Changes** action.
5. On the **Base Calendar Changes** page, use the **Recurring System** field to mark a particular date or day as a recurring nonworking day. You can select either the **Annual Recurring** or **Weekly Recurring** option.  

    If you select **Annual Recurring**, you must also enter the relevant date in the **Date** field.  

    If you select **Weekly Recurring**, you must also select the relevant day of the week in the **Day** field. If you leave the field empty, you must fill in the **Date** field. The **Day** field is filled in automatically.  

When you make an entry, the **Nonworking** field is selected. You can choose to clear the check mark to make it a working day.  
 When you return to the base calendar card, you will observe that the nonworking day entries that you made have been updated. These entries now appear in red and the **Nonworking** field is selected.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  When setting up a new base calendar, you can select and copy lines from an existing calendar. You do this in the relevant **Base Calendar Changes** page.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  Any base calendar defined for the vendor or the location affects how the dates are calculated and rounded to working days.
Specifies a date formula for the time that it takes to replenish the item. It is used to calculate the **Planned Receipt Date** field, if calculating forward, and **Order Date** field, if calculating backwards. See [Lead Time Calculation](across-how-to-assign-base-calendars.md#lead-time-calculation).

## Lead Time Calculation

Any base calendar defined for the vendor or the location affects how the dates are calculated and rounded to working days. Accordingly, the two date fields on purchase order lines are calculated as follows under different conditions.

|Calculation Direction|Vendor Calendar Defined|Vendor Calendar Not Defined|
|---------------------|-----------------------|---------------------------|
|Forward|planned receipt date = order date + vendor lead time (per the vendor calendar and rounded to the next working day in first the vendor calendar and then the location calendar)|planned receipt date = order date + vendor lead time (per the location calendar)|
|Backward|order date = planned receipt date - vendor lead time (per the vendor calendar and rounded to the previous working day in first the vendor calendar and then the location calendar)|order date = planned receipt date - vendor lead time (per the location calendar)|

> [!NOTE]
> In addition to the lead time calculation that affects the planned receipt date and order date, as shown in the above table, warehouse handling time and safety lead time may be added to the formulas to make up the value in the **Expected Receipt Date** field, as follows: Planned Receipt Date + Safety Lead Time + Inbound Warehouse Handling Time = Expected Receipt Date.

> [!Important]
> If your location uses a significantly different calendar than your vendors do, then it is important that you set up specific calendars for those vendors, to calculate optimal vendor lead times. For information about how to set up vendor calendars, see [To assign a base calendar](across-how-to-assign-base-calendars.md#to-assign-a-base-calendar).

The contents of the **Lead Time Calculation** field is copied from either the item card or the SKU card, if the lead time is defined for the item, or on the **Item Vendor Catalog** page, if the lead time is defined for the vendor.

## To customize a calendar
The main task in customizing a base calendar for your company, or one of its business partners, is to enter any changes to working and nonworking day status.

For example, while a base calendar would typically list all Saturdays as non-working days, the customized calendar for a particular location may list all Saturdays during the months of November and December, and leading up to the holiday season, as working days.

The following procedure uses the case of the location as an example. Note that at this point, you have already assigned a base calendar to the location.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Locations**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the location that you want to update, and then select the **Customized Calendar** field. Note that a calendar must be selected in the **Base Calendar Code** field.
3. On the **Customized Calendar Entries** page opens, choose the **Maintain Customized Calendar Changes** action.
4. In the **Customized Calendar Changes**, add lines for customized calendar entries.

    When you enter a line, the **Nonworking** check box is selected. You can clear the check box if you want to change the status to a working day.

    You can use the **Recurring System** field to set a particular date or day as a recurring nonworking day. You can select either the **Annual Recurring** or **Weekly Recurring** option.

    If you select **Annual Recurring**, you must also enter the relevant date in the **Date** field. If you select **Weekly Recurring**, you must also select the relevant day of the week in the **Day** field. If you leave the field empty, you must fill in the **Date** field. The **Day** field is then filled in automatically. This could be useful if you want to mark an individual date as a nonworking or working day.

5. Choose the **OK** button.

On the **Customized Calendar Entries** page, you will observe that the date entries are updated with the changes that you made.

On the Location card, you will observe that the **Customized Calendar** field contains **Yes**, indicating that a customized calendar has been set up.

> [!Important]
> If you do not fill in the **Location Code** field on an order line, your company’s calendar is used.


If you do not fill in the **Shipping Agent Code** field on the order line, your company’s calendar is used.

> [!NOTE]  
> If you make changes to a base calendar for which customized calendar changes exist, all existing customized calendars are updated automatically.

## To assign a base calendar  
The following procedure schedules delivery dates on sales order lines for a customer as an example.

Base calendars are assigned to your own company, customers, vendors, locations, and shipping agents as follows:  

-   On the **Company Information** and **Customer** cards, the base calendar is assigned on the **Shipping** FastTab.  
-   On the **Vendor** card, the base calendar is assigned on the **Receiving** FastTab.  
-   On the **Location** card, the base calendar is assigned on the **Warehouse** FastTab.  
-   On the **Shipping Agents** page, the base calendar is assigned on the **Shipping Agent Services** page.  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customers**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Open the **Customer** card for whom you will assign a base calendar.  
3.  On the **Shipping** FastTab, in the **Base Calendar Code** field, select the base calendar that you want to assign.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  -   If you do not assign a base calendar to a company, all dates are calculated as working days.  
> -   If you enter a blank location on an order line, all dates are calculated as working days.  
> -   Any base calendar defined for the vendor or the location affects how the dates are calculated and rounded to working days.

> [!NOTE]  
>  Before you can make customized calendar entries, you must first assign a base calendar to the company.

# Set Up Locations to Use Bins

Bins represent the basic warehouse structure, and you use them to suggest where to place items. After you create your bins you define their contents, or let them serve as floating bins without specific contents.

To use the bin functionality at a location, turn on the **Bin Mandatory** toggle on the **Location** card. After you turn on the toggle, the **Bin Code** and **Zone Code** fields are available on the following documents:

* Warehouse receipt header
* Warehouse receipt lines
* Warehouse put-away lines
* Warehouse shipment header
* Warehouse shipment lines
* Warehouse put-away lines

The next step is to design the item flow at the location by specifying bin codes in setup fields that represent the different flows.  

> [!NOTE]  
> You must create bin codes before you can specify them for the location. For more information, see [Create Bins](warehouse-how-to-create-individual-bins.md).  

## To set up a location to use bins

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Locations**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the location where you want to use bins.  
3. Choose the **Edit** action.  
4. On the **Warehouse** FastTab, select the **Bin Mandatory** checkbox.  
5. If you aren't using directed put-away and pick for the location, in the **Default Bin Selection** field, choose the method you want [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to use to assign a default bin to an item.  
6. Open the card for the location that you want to set up bins for.
7. On the **Bins** FastTab, select the bins to use as the default for receipts, shipments, inbound, outbound, and open shop floor bins.  

    The bin codes you specify appear automatically on the headers and lines of various warehouse documents. The default bins define all starting or ending placements of items in the warehouse.  
8. If you're using directed put-away and pick, select a bin for warehouse adjustments. The bin code in the **Adjustment Bin Code** field defines the virtual bin in which to record discrepancies in inventory:

    * When you observe differences registered in the warehouse item journal
    * Differences calculated when you register a warehouse physical inventory  
9. Optional: Fill in the fields on the **Bin Policies** FastTab. The most important fields are **Bin Capacity Policy**, **Allow Breakbulk**, and **Put-away Template Code** fields.  
10. On the **Warehouse** FastTab, fill in the **Outbound Whse. Handling Time**, **Inbound Whse. Handling Time**, and the **Base Calendar Code** fields. To learn more, go to [Set Up Base Calendars](across-how-to-assign-base-calendars.md).

## Fill in the consumption bin

The following flow chart shows how the **Bin Code** field on production order component lines is filled in according to your location setup.

# Design details: Inventory valuation
Inventory valuation is the determination of the cost that is assigned to an inventory item, as expressed by the following equation.  

Ending inventory = beginning inventory + net purchases – cost of goods sold  

The calculation of inventory valuation uses the **Cost Amount (Actual)** field of the value entries for the item. The entries are classified according to the entry type that corresponds to the cost components, direct cost, indirect cost, variance, revaluation, and rounding. For more information, see [Design Details: Cost Components](design-details-cost-components.md).  

Entries are applied against each other, either by the fixed application or according to the general cost-flow assumption defined by the costing method. One entry of inventory decrease can be applied to more than one increase entry with different posting dates and possibly different acquisition costs. For more information, see [Design Details: Item Application](design-details-item-application.md). Therefore, calculation of the inventory value for a given date is based on summing up positive and negative value entries.  

## Inventory valuation report  
To calculate the inventory value in the **Inventory Valuation** report, the report begins by calculating the value of the item’s inventory at a given starting date. It then adds the value of inventory increases and subtracts the value of inventory decreases up to a given ending date. The end result is the inventory value on the ending date. The report calculates these values by summing the values in the **Cost Amount (Actual)** field in the value entries, using the posting dates as filters.  

The printed report always shows actual amounts, that is, the cost of entries that have been posted as invoiced. Also, the report prints the expected cost of entries that are posted as received or shipped, if you select the Include Expected Cost field on the Options FastTab.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  Values in the **Inventory Valuation** report is reconciled with the Inventory account in the general ledger, meaning the value entries in question have been posted to the general ledger.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  Amounts in the **Value** columns of the report are based on the posting date of transactions for an item.  

## Inventory valuation - WIP report  
A manufacturing company needs to determine the value of three types of inventory:  

* Raw Materials inventory  
* WIP inventory  
* Finished Goods inventory  

The value of WIP inventory is determined by the following equation:  

* Ending WIP inventory = Beginning WIP inventory + manufacturing costs – cost of goods manufactured  

As for purchased inventory, the value entries provide the basis of the inventory valuation. The calculation is made using the values in the **Cost Amount (Actual)** field of the item and capacity value entries associated with a production order.  

The purpose of WIP inventory valuation is to determine the value of the items whose manufacturing hasn't yet been completed on a given date. Therefore the WIP inventory value is based on the value entries related to the consumption and capacity ledger entries. Consumption ledger entries must be invoiced at the date of the valuation. Therefore, the **Inventory Valuation – WIP** report shows the costs representing the WIP inventory value in two categories: consumption and capacity.

# Status Field on Documents

When you create a quote, order, or credit memo, the **Status** field on the document header contains the status **Open** by default.

After you've filled in the document, you can release it, and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] changes the value in the **Status** field to **Released**. This status indicates that the order is ready for the next stage of processing before it's posted.

| Status | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| Open   | You can make changes to the document. |
| Released | The document has been released to the next stage of processing, and you can't make changes to lines of type *Item* and *Fixed Asset*.<br /><br />You can reopen a released document if you want to make changes to its contents. To move the adjusted document to the next stage of processing, you must once again release the document. |
| Pending Approval   | The document is waiting to be approved. |
| Pending Prepayment | A prepayment invoice has been posted for the document. |

## Release process

You can use the release process in different ways to ease your normal workflow, for example, to follow company procedures about approvals or to start warehouse activities.

### Approval procedures

Your company can use the release procedure to indicate that another user has approved the document or that an external contact can meet the specifications of the document, as shown in these examples:

* You can only release a purchase order when your vendor has indicated that they're prepared to fulfill the order.
* You create an order and a second user must approve it, perhaps for security reasons, before you're allowed to release it.
* The manager responsible for approving all refunds must release a credit memo that you've created.

Learn more about approval workflows at [Use Workflows](across-use-workflows.md).

### Warehouse activities

If the order status is **Open**, the warehouse won't begin to prepare the shipment, and doesn't expect to receive the items on a purchase order. When you release the order, you indicate that the order is complete, and that the warehouse can include it in its activities.

## Reopen a released order

You can make changes to a released order by reopening it. However, you can only increase the quantity of the lines already processed by the warehouse.

When you make the changes and release the order again, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] recalculates the value-added tax (VAT) and the invoice discount.

If you make changes to a released order, you must notify the warehouse about the changes.

> [!NOTE]
> If you want to post a single open order or credit memo without releasing it first, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will automatically release the document when you post it. If you post your orders or credit memos by using the **Post Batch** function, you can choose to post only the orders or credit memos that you've released.

# Work with bills of material

You use bills of materials (BOMs) to structure parent items that must be assembled from other items or produced by resources or machine centers from components.

## Assembly BOMs or production BOMs

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports two different types of BOMs:

| BOM type | General category | Example |
| -------- | ---------------- | ------- |
| [Assembly BOMs](assembly-how-work-assembly-boms.md) | Warehouse / assembly | Items that consist of other items, assembled with basic or no resources. |
| [Production BOMs](production-how-to-create-production-boms.md) | Manufacturing / production | Items that consist of different components and subassemblies, produced at a work or machine center. |

You use assembly orders for making end items from components in a simple process that can be performed by one or more basic resources, which aren't machine or work centers, or without any resources. For example, an assembly process could be to pick two wine bottles and one coffee sack and then pack them as a gift item.  

An assembly BOM is the master data that defines which component items go into an assembled end item and which resources are used to assemble the assembly item. When you enter an assembly item and a quantity in the header of a new assembly order, the assembly order lines automatically fil in according to the assembly BOM with one assembly order line per component or resource. Learn more at [Assembly Management](assembly-assemble-items.md).

You use production orders for making end items from components in a complex process that requires a production routing and work or machine centers, which represent production capacities. For example, a production process could be to cut steel plates in one operation, weld them in the next operation, and paint the end item in the last operation. Learn more at [Manufacturing](production-manage-manufacturing.md).

A production BOM is the master data that defines a production item and the components that go into it. For assembly items, the production BOM must be certified and assigned to the production item before it can be used in a production order. When you enter the production item on a production order line, either manually or by refreshing the order, then the production BOM content becomes the production order components. Learn more at [Create Production BOMs](production-how-to-create-production-boms.md).

The concept of resources in production is much more advanced than in assembly management. Work centers and machine centers act as resources. The operations assigned to resources in production routings represent production steps. Learn more at the [Create Routings](production-how-to-create-routings.md) article.

Both assembly orders and production orders might be linked directly to sales orders. However, you can only use assembly orders to customize the end item directly for a customer request with the sales order.

# Use Power Automate flows in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]

With [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you're given a license to Microsoft Power Automate. This license lets you use your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] data as part of a workflow in Microsoft Power Automate. You create flows and connect to your data from internal and external sources through the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] connector.

Power Automate flows are triggered by events, such as a record being created, modified, or deleted. Flows can also be run on a user-defined schedule or on demand.

> [!NOTE]
> Administrators can restrict access to Power Automate. If you find that you don't have access to some or all of the features described in this article, talk to your admin. If you want to learn how you can control Power Automate access as an admin, see [Set Up Power Automate Integration](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/powerplatform/power-automate-setup).

<!-- You must have a valid account with both [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and Power Automate. --> 

> [!TIP]
> In addition to Power Automate, you can use approval workflow templates in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Although they're two separate workflow systems, any approval workflow template you create with Power Automate is added to the list of workflows within [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Learn more at [Workflows](across-workflow.md).

## About Power Automate flows

Power Automate is a service that helps you create automated workflows (or flows) between apps and services, like [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Power Automate flows require little or no coding knowledge. They can be associated with a wide range of events and responses, such as:

- Record changes
- External files updates
- Posted documents
- Different Microsoft and third-party services, like Microsoft Outlook, Excel, Dataverse, Teams, SharePoint, Power Apps, and more.

There are three different cloud flow types that you can work with:

|Flow type|Description|
|---------|-----------|
|Automated flow|This flow type is run automatically by an event. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], an event could be when a record or document is created, modified or deleted. So, for example, a new sales invoice can trigger a flow for an approval request, which can have different events set depending on the approver's reply. A negative response sends a notification and email to the approval requester. A positive reply simultaneously updates an Excel spreadsheet located in a SharePoint folder and sends an update to a Teams chat. Automated flows can be started by both internal and external events in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].|
|Approval flow|Approval flows are also automated flows in Power Automate, but they're designed specifically for requesting approval when changes are made to records and data. You can use approval flows in Power Automate as an alternative to the [approval workflows feature](across-use-workflows.md) that's part of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. |
|Scheduled flow|This type of flow is also automatically run but it runs periodically at a scheduled date and time. |
|Instant flow|This flow type is run on-demand, requiring the user to run it manually from a button or action in another app or device, in this case, the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] client. Instant flows work similarly to batch shortcuts, performing multiple lengthy steps with a few button presses and are launched from specific pages or tables. For example, a flow can add a button to the action menu on the **Vendors** page to block payments to a vendor and, at the same time, send customizable emails to the vendor's contact and your company's purchasers as well as update the contact in Outlook. |

## Power Automate features

You can explore all Power Automate flows currently available to you by signing in to [Power Automate](https://powerautomate.com) and selecting **My flows** from the navigation bar on the left. Here you find any flows you have already created yourself and flows shared with you by an admin or coworker.

- Instant flows are also made available for running directly from most list, card, and document pages in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. You find the instant flows in the **Automate** action group in the action bar of pages. To run a flow, select it, and follow the instructions presented to you. Learn more in the sections that follow.

- With automated flows in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], there's nothing for you to do, unless you want to change them, or turn them off. Otherwise, they just work when triggered. 
<!--

## Automated flows

With Power Automate, you can create business flows directly in-house and rely on citizen developers. Automated workflows can be started by both internal and external events in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], and also be set to run periodically. Learn more and get instructions on how to create flows in the [Set Up Automated Workflows](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/powerplatform/automate-workflows) article in the administration content.

-->

## Run instant flows

Instant flows open inside [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online so you can remain within the context of the business process you were in the middle of doing. You can run an instant flow from most lists, cards, or documents.

1. In the action bar, select **Automate**, then choose a flow from the list of available flows under the **Power Automate** action.

    :::image type="content" source="media/power-automate-instant-menu.svg" alt-text="Shows the Automate action with instant flow actions.":::

    On some pages, **Automate** is nested under **More options (...)**. 
2. In the **Run Flow** pane, fill in any required fields, then select **Continue** to run the flow.

> [!NOTE]
> The first time you use the **Automate** item, you may see only the **Get started with Power Automate** action. You see this action because you haven't agreed to the privacy notice for Microsoft Power Automate. To continue, select **Get started with Power Automate** and follow the instructions to agree or disagree.  
>
> :::image type="content" source="media/power-automate-action.png" alt-text="Shows the Automate item in the action bar.":::

<!--

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can run a Power Automate flow from most list, card, and document pages. Once the admin has connected [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with Power Automate, you'll see any flows your organization has added when you choose the **Automate** action on the relevant pages. Instant flows are run without leaving [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Learn more in the [Set Up Automated Workflows](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/powerplatform/automate-workflows) article in the administration content.

These instant flows open on a page inside [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online so you can remain within the context of the business process you were in the middle of. Choose the **Automate** action—on some pages nested under the **More Options** menu—choose the **Power Automate** menu item, then choose the relevant link to trigger the workflow. The connection to Power Automate is already set up for you.

Most flows require you to fill in a field or two before you choose the **Run flow** action.

> [!TIP]
> If you don't see an **Automate** action, then your [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] probably hasn't yet been set up to use Power Automate. Learn more from your admin.-->

## Create, edit, and manage flows

Creating new flows or modifying and managing existing ones (like turning them on or off) can be done directly in Power Automate. But you can initiate some of these tasks from the Automate action menu in  [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]:

:::image type="content" source="media/power-automate-menu.svg" alt-text="Shows the Automate action in the action bar with expanded actions.":::

- To create an automated flow from a list, card, or document page, select **Automate** > **Create automated flow**.
- To create an approval workflow from a card or document page, select **Automate** > **Create approval flow**.

  > [!TIP]
  > This action is only available on card and document type pages; not lists.
- To create an instant flow from a list, card, or document page, select **Automate** > **Create action based on a flow**.
- To open Power Automate from a list, card, or document page, select **Automate** > **Manage flows**.
<!--- To create new flows or manage existing flows from inside [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], got to the **Manage Power Automate Flows** page.-->

These tasks are typically done by an admin or super user. The tasks require a broader knowledge of the business processes in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. To learn more, go to the following articles in the Business Central Dev and IT Pro help:

- [Power Automate integration](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/powerplatform/power-automate-overview)
- [Create automated flows](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/powerplatform/automate-workflows) (also covers approval flows)
- [Create instant flows](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/powerplatform/instant-flows)
- [Manage Power Automate flows](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/powerplatform/manage-power-automate-flows)
<!-- 

## Add more automated flows and instant flows

You can create flows through the [powerautomate.microsoft.com](https://powerautomate.microsoft.com) website. However, if your admin has switched on the capability to run Power Automate flows from inside [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, you can start the process of building a flow from the **Automate** action on the relevant pages, which can be found under the **More Options** menu depending on the page. Then choose the **Power Automate** menu item, and then choose the **Create a flow** action. Power Automate then opens in a new browser tab, and you're signed in automatically.

You can find sample templates to adapt to your company and all available trigger events, using both [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and external tools, by choosing the **Connectors** menu on the Power Automate website. Learn more about available templates and triggers in the [Set Up Automated Workflows](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/powerplatform/automate-workflows) article in the administration content.

## Create and manage Power Automate flows

You can create new flows or manage existing Power Automate flows in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on the **Manage Power Automate Flows** page. Learn more in the [Manage Power Automate Flows](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/powerplatform/manage-power-automate-flows) article in the administration content.

<!--
You can also manage available Power Automate workflows on the **Workflows** page in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The page lists both the built-in approval and Power Automate workflows, with options for the latter to enable/disable, delete, and view the workflow on the Power Automate website.-->

# Modify planning suggestions in a graphical view

A typical planning activity is to change or add planning worksheet lines to modify the suggested supply orders before you commit them by running the **Carry out Action Message** function. An alternative to doing this in the planning worksheet is to use a graphical view. However, this is currently not supported in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

<!--On the **Item Availability by Timeline** page, you can modify certain supply orders and suggestions by dragging elements on the x-axis to change quantity or dragging elements on the y-axis to change due date.  

When you open the **Item Availability by Timeline** page from the **Planning Worksheet** page, you can make the following changes:  

- Modify a suggested supply order that only exists as a planning line.  
- Modify an existing supply order that the planning system suggests to change.  
- Create a new suggested supply order and modify it.  

For more information about the planning line types that are shown, see the Description field on the **Event Changes** FastTab.  

When you choose **Save Changes** on the **Item Availability by Timeline** page, the modifications that you have made are copied to the planning or requisition worksheet. You can now implement them using the **Carry Out Action Msg.-Plan.** function.  

The following procedure shows how to modify supply suggestions by drag and drop. As an alternative, you can change the **Due Date** and **Quantity** fields on the **Event Changes** FastTab and immediately see the changes graphically on the **Timeline** FastTab on the **Planning Worksheet** page.  

## To modify suggested supply orders in the graphical view

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Planning Worksheet**, and then choose the related link.  

2. Choose the line that you want to see item availability for, choose **Item Availability by**, and then choose **Timeline**.

    The **Item Availability by Timeline** page opens with the item number, location, and variant of the item on the selected planning line prefilled in the **Options** FastTab. The **Timeline** FastTab shows a graphical representation of the item’s projected inventory, including planning suggestions.  

<!--3. Make sure that the **Include Planning Suggestions** field is selected.  
3. Find the suggested supply order that you want to modify. You can identify modifiable elements by the green circle and the disk icon. For more information about the different symbols, see [Symbols and Icons on the Timeline FastTab](#symbols-and-icons-on-the-timeline-fasttab).  
4. Place the pointer over the green circle until it enlarges and the pointer changes to Move shape (four arrows).  
5. Press and hold the mouse button while you drag the pointer up or down to modify the quantity. Press and hold the mouse button while you drag the pointer left or right to modify the due date.  
6. In addition to moving elements by drag and drop, you can modify planning suggestions by using a number of drop-down menu functions. Access the drop-down menu for the green circle of a suggested supply element and select one the following functions  

    |Function|Description|  
    |--------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Create New Supply**|Creates a new element point where you access the drop-down menu, which represents a new suggested supply order. It becomes a new line in the planning worksheet when you choose **Save Changes**.<br /><br /> **NOTE:** If the **Location Filter** or **Variant Filter** fields on the **Options** FastTab are empty or have more than one filter value, then the new supply is created and later saved to the planning or requisition worksheet with the following codes:<br /><br /> * If the filter field is empty, then the new supply is created without a location or variant code.<br /><br /> * If more than one filter value is defined, then the new supply is created for the first filter value according to the sorting method.<br /><br /> If you want another variant or location code, then you must manually change it on the new planning line.|  
    |**Auto-Adjust Supply**|Optimizes a new supply that you have created in the graph by making sure that it results in zero inventory before the next supply.|  
    |**Delete Supply**|Deletes the element in the **Timeline** FastTab and deletes the planning line when you choose **Save Changes**. The icon changes to a disk that has a red cross when the supply has been deleted.<br /><br /> **NOTE:** You can only delete a supply of action message type **New**. After you choose **Save Changes**, you must manually delete the planning line in question in the planning or requisition worksheet.|  

7. Choose the **Reload** action if you want to reset all the changes that you have made after you last opened the **Item Availability by Timeline** page or selected **Reload**.  
8. When the elements are placed where you want them in the diagram, choose **Save Changes** to copy modified quantity and date changes to the planning or requisition lines that represent the graphical elements.  

To implement the supply plan changes, you must follow the resulting action messages from the planning or requisition worksheet. For more information, see Carry Out Action Msg.-Plan..

## Symbols and Icons on the Timeline FastTab
 |Symbol/Icon|Description|  
 |------------------|---------------------------------------|  
 |Black cross|Orders (both supply and demand).<br /><br /> -   Cannot be modified.<br />-   Visible when the **Show Projected Inventory** field is selected (orange graph).|  
 |Red circle|Existing supply orders that are not in planning suggestions.<br /><br /> -   Cannot be modified.<br />-   Visible when the **Show Projected Inventory** field is selected (orange graph).|  
 |Yellow star|Forecast demand.<br /><br /> -   Cannot be modified.<br />-   Visible when the **Forecast Name** field has a value.<br /><br /> When both the **Show Projected Inventory** and the **Include Planning Suggestions** fields are selected, then each yellow star has a linked counterpart in the opposite graph. This illustrates how a suggested supply fulfills the forecasted demand.|  
 |Green circle with an icon shaped as a disk that has a red cross|Suggested supply order with action message *Cancel*.<br /><br /> -   Cannot be modified.<br />-   Visible when the **Include Planning Suggestions** field is selected (green graph).|  
 |Green circle with an icon shaped as a disk that has a star|Suggested supply orders with action message *New*.<br /><br /> -   Can be modified.<br />-   Visible when the **Include Planning Suggestions** field is selected (green graph).|  
 |Green circle with an icon shaped as a disk that has one or two arrows|Suggested supply orders with action message *Reschedule*, *Change Qty.*, or *Resched. and Chg. Qty.*<br /><br /> -   Can be modified.<br />-   Visible when the **Include Planning Suggestions** field is selected (green graph).<br /><br /> The arrows reflect the direction of the planning suggestion. For example, a left arrow together with an up arrow reflects a *Resched. and Chg. Qty.* action message that consists of a backward rescheduling and a quantity increase.|  
-->
<!--When you access the drop-down menu for the **Timeline** FastTab, the following functions appear depending what you choose  

 |Function|Description|

# Financial analytics

During daily activities, businesses capture lots of data that can support business intelligence (BI) for decision makers:

- Sales figures
- Purchases
- Operational expenses
- Employee salaries
- Budgets

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers features to help you gather, analyze, and share your organization's finance data:

- Financial reporting (for financial statements and KPIs)
- Power BI reports for finance
- Ad-hoc analysis on lists
- Ad-hoc analysis of data in Excel (using open in Excel)
- Built-in finance reports

Each of these features has its advantages and disadvantages, depending on the type of data analysis and the role of the user. To learn more, go to [Analytics, business intelligence, and reporting overview](reports-bi-reporting.md).

This article introduces how you can use these analytical features to provide financial insights.

## Analytics needs in finance

When thinking of analytics needs in finance, it might help to use a mental model based on personas described on a high-level and their different analytics needs.

:::image type="content" source="/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/media/analytics-personas.svg" alt-text="Illustration of different personas for analytics" lightbox="/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/media/analytics-personas.svg":::

People in different roles have different needs when it comes to data, and they use the data in different ways. For example, people in finance interact with data differently than people in sales.

:::image type="content" source="/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/media/analytics-personas-scenarios.svg" alt-text="Illustration of how different personas have different analytics needs." lightbox="/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/media/analytics-personas-scenarios.svg":::

| Role              | Data aggregation  | Typical ways to consume data                          | 
|-------------------|-------------------| ----------------------------------------------------- |
|CFO / CEO          | Performance data  | KPIs <br> Dashboards <br> Financial reports           |
|Finance Management | Trends, summaries | Built-in managerial reports <br> Ad-hoc analysis      | 
|Bookkeeper         | Detailed data     | Built-in operational reports <br> On-screen task data |

## Using Power BI to monitor financial statements and KPIs

A key performance indicator (KPI) is a measurable value that shows how effectively you’re meeting your goals. In finance, people often use the following KPIs to monitor their organization's financial health:

- Net Profit Margin
- Gross Profit Margin
- Current/Quick/Cash Ratio
- COGS (Cost of Goods Sold)
- Debt-to-Equity Ratio
- Current/Payroll/Longterm Liabilities
- Operating Profit - EBIT
- EBITDA
- Average Collection Period (Days)

:::image type="content" source="media/finance/financial-overview.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Finance Overview report" lightbox="media/finance/financial-overview.png":::

These financial KPIs, and more, are available in the Power BI Finance app for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. To learn more, go to [Power BI finance app](finance-powerbi-app.md).

[!INCLUDE [power-bi-finance-app](includes/power-bi-finance-app.md)]

## Using Financial Reporting to produce financial statements and KPIs

The **Financial Reporting** feature gives you insights into the financial data shown on your chart of accounts (COA). You can set up financial reports to analyze figures in general ledger (G/L) accounts, and compare general ledger entries with budget entries. The results display in charts and reports on your home page, such as the Cash Flow chart, and the Income Statement and Balance Sheet reports.

Dimensions play an important role in business intelligence. A dimension is data that you can add to an entry as a parameter. Dimensions let you group entries that have similar characteristics so they're easier to analyze. For example, customers, regions, products, and salespersons. Among other purposes, use dimensions when you define analysis views and create financial reports. Learn more at [Work with Dimensions](finance-dimensions.md).

> [!TIP]
> As a quick way to analyze transactional data, you can filter totals in the chart of accounts and all entries in **Entries** pages by dimensions. Look for the **Set Dimension Filter** action.  

The following table describes a sequence of tasks in financial reporting, with links to the articles that describe them.

## Finance reporting across business units or legal entities

Some organizations use [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in multiple business units or legal entities. Others use [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in subsidiaries that must report into parent organizations. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] gives accountants tools that help them transfer general ledger entries from two or more companies (subsidiaries) into a consolidated company.  

To learn more, go to [Company consolidation](finance-consolidated-company-reporting.md).

## Ad-hoc analysis of finance data

Sometimes, you just need to check whether the numbers add up correctly, or quickly confirm a figure. The following features are great for ad-hoc analyses:

- Data analysis on ledger list pages
- Open in Excel

The Data analysis feature lets you open almost any list page, such as General Ledger Entries, Fixed Asset Ledger Entries, Check Ledger Entries, or Bank Account Ledger Entries, enter analysis mode, and then group, filter, and pivot data as you see fit.

:::image type="content" source="media/data-analysis-gl-entries.png" alt-text="Example of how to do data analysis on the G/L entries page." lightbox="media/data-analysis-gl-entries.png":::

Similarly, you can use the **Open in Excel** action to open a list page for ledger entries, optionally filter the list to a subset of the data, and then use Excel to work with the data. For example, by using features such as [!INCLUDE [excel-copilot-name](includes/excel-copilot-name.md)], Analyze Data, What-If Analysis, or Forecast Sheet.

:::image type="content" source="media/open-in-excel-gl-entries.png" alt-text="Example of how to do data analysis on the G/L entries data using Excel." lightbox="media/open-in-excel-gl-entries.png":::

[!INCLUDE [onedrive-excel-online](includes/onedrive-excel-online.md)]

To learn more about ad-hoc analyses on ledgers, go to [Ad hoc analysis on finance data](ad-hoc-analysis-finance.md).

## Built-in reports for finance

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes several built-in reports, tracing functions, and tools to help auditors or controllers who are responsible for reporting to the finance department.

To get an overview of available reports, you can choose **All reports** on the top pane of your home page. This action opens the Role Explorer, which is filtered to the features in the **Report & Analysis** option. To learn more, go to [Finding Reports with the Role Explorer](ui-role-explorer.md).

:::image type="content" source="media/report-explorer-finance.png" alt-text="Example of reports on the finance role center." lightbox="media/report-explorer-finance.png":::

Built-in reports come in two flavors:

- Designed for print (pdf).
- Designed for analysis in Excel.

The following articles provide more information about built-in reports:

- [Built-in key finance reports](finance-reports.md)
- [Built-in fixed assets reports](fa-reports.md)
- [Built-in accounts receivable reports](receivables-reports.md)
- [Built-in accounts payable reports](payables-reports.md)

<!-- TODO: add when we have these articles
* [Built-in Cost Accounting reports](cost-accounting-reports.md) 
* [Built-in Cash Management reports](cost-accounting-reports.md) 
* [Built-in Tax and VAT reports](tax-and-vat-reports.md) 
-->

## On-screen finance task pages

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] has several pages that give you financial overviews and tasks to do:

- [Show general ledger entries and balances from the Chart of Accounts page](#show-general-ledger-entries-and-balances-from-the-chart-of-accounts-page)
- [View actual amounts compared to budgeted amounts for all accounts and for several periods](#view-actual-amounts-compared-to-budgeted-amounts-for-all-accounts-and-for-several-periods)
- [Analyze data by dimensions](#analyze-data-by-dimensions)
- [Analyzing cash flow](#analyzing-cash-flow)

### Show general ledger entries and balances from the Chart of Accounts page

The Chart of Accounts page shows all general ledger accounts with aggregated numbers posted to the general ledger. From this page, you can do things like:  

- View reports that show general ledger entries and balances.  
- Review a list of posting groups for that account.
- View separate debit and credit balances for a single account.

:::image type="content" source="media/chart-of-accounts-page.png" alt-text="Example of how the Chart of Accounts page shows finance insights" lightbox="media/chart-of-accounts-page.png":::

To learn more, go to [Understand the Chart of Accounts](finance-general-ledger.md#the-chart-of-accounts).

### View actual amounts compared to budgeted amounts for all accounts and for several periods

As a part of gathering, analyzing, and sharing your company data, you might want to view actual amounts compared to budgeted amounts for all accounts and for several periods. You can make this comparison from the **Chart of Accounts** page, by choosing the **G/L Balance/Budget** action.

To learn more, go to [Analyze Actual Amounts Versus Budgeted Amounts](bi-how-analyze-actual-versus-budget.md).

### Analyze data by dimensions

Dimensions are values that categorize entries so you can track and analyze them on documents, such as sales orders. Dimensions can, for example, indicate the project or department an entry came from.  

So, instead of setting up separate general ledger accounts for each department and project, you can use dimensions as a basis for analysis and avoid having to create a complicated chart of accounts structure.

In financial analysis, a dimension is data you add to a G/L entry as a kind of marker. This data is used to group G/L entries with similar characteristics, such as customers, regions, products, and salesperson, and easily retrieve these groups for analysis. You can use dimensions on entries in journals, documents, and budgets.

To learn more, go to [Analyze Data by Dimensions](bi-how-analyze-data-dimension.md).

### Analyzing cash flow

On the Accountant home page, under **Finance Performance**, the Cash Cycle, Cash Flow, and Income & Expense charts offer ways to analyze cash flow:

- Review figures for a period by using the timeline slider.
- Filter the chart by choosing the source in the legend.
- Change the length of the period, or go to the previous or next period, by choosing options on the Finance Performance drop down.

:::image type="content" source="media/cashflow-accountant-rolecentre.png" alt-text="Example of how the cash flow visuals look on the accountant role centre" lightbox="media/cashflow-accountant-rolecentre.png":::

To examine the forecast, in addition to forecast entries, you can also look at the cash flow worksheet. For example, you can see how the forecast:

- Handles confirmed sales and purchases.
- Subtracts payables and adds receivables.
- Skips duplicate sales orders and purchase orders.

To learn more, go to [Analyzing Cash Flow in Your Company](finance-analyze-cash-flow.md).

# Create projects

When you start a new project, you must create a project card with integrated project tasks and project planning lines, structured in two layers.  

The first layer consists of project tasks. You must create at least one project task per project because all posting refers to a project task. Having at least one project task in your project enables you to set up project planning lines and to post consumption to the project.

The second layer consists of project planning lines, which specify the detailed use of resources, items and various general ledger expenses.

The layer structure enables you to divide the project into smaller tasks, and therefore use more specific details in budgeting, quotes, and registration. In addition, it gives you insight into how a project is progressing. For example, you can track whether you're meeting designated milestones or if you're on target to meet budget expectations.

> [!TIP]
> Choose the **New Project** action on the **Project Manager** Role Center to launch an assisted setup guide that takes you through the steps of creating a project with integrated tasks and planning lines. The following procedure describes how to perform the steps manually. <!-- For an example of how to create a project manually, go to [Video: How to create a project in Dynamics 365 Business Central](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqaPWr7BWmw).-->

## To create a project card

You create a project card and then create project task lines and project planning lines for it.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Projects**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action, and then fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
3. To base the project on information from another project, choose the **Copy Project** action, fill in the fields as necessary, and then choose the **OK** button.

> [!NOTE]  
> If you're using time sheets with your project, you must also designate a person responsible. This person can approve time sheets for the employee tasks associated with the project. For more information, see [Set Up Time Sheets](projects-how-setup-time-sheets.md).

> [!NOTE]  
> The **Apply Usage Link** toggle indicates whether project ledger entries are linked to project planning lines. The **Apply Usage Link** toggle also activates warehouse handling, planning, assembly-to-order, item tracking, and reservation capabilities for a project.

Optionally, mark actions on project as blocked using the **Blocked** field. The following table describes the effect of the options for this field.

|Option  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|Blank |All actions are allowed.|
|Posting    |You can work with planning lines, but the project is blocked for posting. You can't post usage or sales for the project.|
|All  |All actions are blocked.|

## To create tasks for a project

A key part of creating a project is to specify the various tasks involved in the project. You specify tasks by creating one line per task on the **Tasks** FastTab on the **Project Card** page. Every project must have at least one task.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Projects**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the project card for a relevant project.
3. On the **Tasks** FastTab, fill in the fields as necessary on a new line.
4. To indent tasks and create a hierarchy, Choose the **Tasks** action, the then choose **Indent Project Tasks** action.
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 for all the tasks that you need for the project.
6. To specify the project tasks with information on other project tasks, choose the **Copy Project Tasks from** action, fill in the fields as necessary, and then choose the **OK** button.

## Invoice one or more customers for project tasks

Sometimes the party that is receiving a service is different from the party that pays the bill. Also, sometimes you might need to invoice multiple customers for tasks in the project. On the **Project Card** page, use the **Task Billing Method** field to specify whether you're billing one customer, or multiple customers.

If the customer who is receiving the service also pays the bill, in the **Bill-to** and **Ship-to** fields, choose **Default (Customer)** and **Default (Sell-to Address)**.

If you're billing multiple customers, you can specify the customer who receives the service and the customer to invoice for each task in the project. You can also provide the following information:

* Select the ship-to address for the customer where the work happens.
* Add information about external references to simplify communication about the project.
* Overwrite the standard financial terms of the project.

## Specify a default location for project items

You can save time on data entry by specifying a default location and bin for projects on the **Project Card** page. When you create tasks, project planning lines, and project journal lines for the project, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] assigns the default location. You can, however, change the location code and bin on tasks and lines if needed.

If you define a **To-Project Bin Code** on the location, the bin code is populated when you select the location code. If your warehouse flow requires warehouse picks, you can also define other bins from which to consume items.

These fields are the defaults when you create project tasks. Existing project tasks don't change.

There are a few things to know about using default locations:

* For project tasks, if you define a **To-Project Bin Code** on the location, the bin code is assigned when you select the location code. If your warehouse flow requires warehouse picks, you can also define other bins from which to consume items.
* For project planning lines, the **Location Code** is based on the value selected on the project planning line when you select an item. If a bin code isn't defined for the project task, the bin from the default bin content is selected. You can change both values manually.
* For project journal lines, the **Location Code** is based on the value selected on the job journal line when you select an item. If a bin code isn't defined for the project task, the bin from default bin content is selected. You can change both values manually.

> [!NOTE]
> The processes businesses use to pick items in their warehouses differ, depending on whether they use basic or advanced warehouse configurations. To learn more about the options for warehouse configuration, go to [Overview of different configuration options](design-details-warehouse-management.md#overview-of-different-configuration-options).

## To create planning lines for a project

You can refine your new project tasks on project planning lines. A planning line can capture the information that you want to track for a project. For example, you can track the resources the project requires, or the items that are needed. For example, you have a task to get a customer to approve a project. You associate the task with planning lines for items such as meeting the customer and assigning a resource.  

A project planning line can have one of the types described in the following table.  

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Budget** |Provides estimated usage and costs for the project, typically in a time and materials type project. You can't invoice planning lines of this type. |
| **Billable** |Provides estimated invoicing to the customer, typically in a fixed price project. |
| **Both Budget and Billable** |Provides budgeted usage equal to what you want to invoice. |

> [!NOTE]
> While you enter information on project planning lines, cost information is automatically filled in. For example, the cost, price, and discount for resources and items are based on information from the resource and item.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Projects**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open a relevant project card.
3. Select a project task for which the **Project Task Type** field contains **Posting**, and then choose the **Project Planning Lines** action.  
4. On the **Project Planning Lines** page, on a new line, fill in the fields as necessary.
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 for all planning lines that you need for the project task.

> [!TIP]
> If the line is for an item, you can use the **Item Availability by** action to explore the item's availability by location, event, or period.

## Avoid document number errors when you post project journals

If you use a number series for project journal batches, you can't post the journal if the document numbers aren't consecutive. If needed, you can correct the order of document numbers when you post project journals.

On the **Project Journals** page, the **Document No.** field is editable so that you can specify different document numbers for different journal lines, or the same document number for related journal lines.

If a number series is specified in the **No. Series** field on the project journal batch, document numbers for individual or grouped lines must be sequential when you post a project journal. If they aren't, you can't post the journal. To avoid getting stuck, use the **Renumber Document Numbers** action on the **Project Journals** page before you post the journal. If you group journal lines by document number before you use the action, they stay grouped but might be assigned a different document number.

> [!TIP]
> The **Renumber Document Numbers** action also works on filtered views.

# Delete cost budget entries

You use the **Delete Cost Budget Entries** batch job to cancel cost budget entries from the cost budget register.  

To prevent any gaps in the cost budget entries and cost register entries, you can't delete a single entry or a batch of entries in the middle of the list of register entries.  

## To delete a cost budget entry  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Delete Cost Budget Entries**, and then choose the related link.  

    The **To Register No.** field contains the last register entry number and can't be changed.  

    You can use the **From Register No.** field to select a register entry number from which the deletion should begin.  
2. Choose the **OK** button to delete the selected cost budget entries.  

> [!NOTE]  
> To avoid an accidental deletion of cost budget entries, you can close register entries by marking the lines as **Closed** in the **Closed** field on the **Cost Budget Registers** page.

A regular step in any financial rhythm is to reconcile bank accounts. To close sales invoices and purchase credit memos as paid, you apply incoming payments to customer or vendor ledger entries.

While most customers in B2B environments pay some time after delivery, leaving the posted sales invoices open for the Accounts Receivable department to close (apply) when payment is received, some sales invoices can be paid immediately, for example with PayPal. Such invoices are immediately applied as paid when they're posted and, therefore, don't appear as payments to be processes in AR. For more information, see, for example, [Invoice Sales](sales-how-invoice-sales.md).  

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], one of the fastest ways to register payments is with the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page by importing a bank statement file or feed. The payments are applied to open customer or vendor ledger entries based on data matches between payment text and entry information. You can review and change the matches before you post the journal, and close bank account ledger entries for ledger entries when you post the journal. The bank account is reconciled when all payments are applied.

Other pages exist where you can either apply payments or reconcile bank accounts:

* The **Bank Account Reconciliations** page, where you reconcile bank accounts by matching imported bank statement lines with your system bank account ledger entries. Here, you can also reconcile check payments. For more information, see [Reconcile Bank Accounts](bank-how-reconcile-bank-accounts-separately.md). Here, you can't apply payments.
* The **Payment Registration** page, where you can manually apply payments received as cash, check, or bank transaction against a generated list of unpaid sales documents. This functionality is available only for sales documents. Here, you can't apply outgoing payments, and you can't reconcile bank accounts.
* The **Cash Receipt Journal** page, where you manually post receipts to the relevant general ledger, customer, or other account by entering a payment line. You can either apply the receipt or refund to one or more open entries before you post the cash receipt journal, or from the customer ledger entries. Here, you can't reconcile bank accounts.

The **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page uses automatic matching logic that you can set up on the **Payment Application Rules** page. For more information, see [Set Up Rules for Automatic Application of Payments](receivables-how-set-up-payment-application-rules.md).  

Other aspects of managing receivables include to collect outstanding balances, including finance charges and reminders, and to set bank accounts up to allow customers' payments to be withdrawn from their account automatically.

# Create analysis reports

Sales managers need to analyze turnover, gross profit, and other key sales performance indicators regularly. Purchasers are more interested in the dynamics of purchase volumes, vendor performance, and purchase prices. Whereas logistics/inventory managers need information on inventory turnover, analysis of inventory movement, and statistics on inventory value. So there's no one-size-fits-all analysis report.

You can customize analysis reports based on records of your posted transactions, for example, sales, purchases, transfers, and inventory adjustments. In a customizable report, the source data, which is derived from the item ledger (with associated value entries), can be combined, compared, and presented in meaningful user-defined ways. In this sense, the analysis report is similar to a PivotTable report in Microsoft Excel.  

So, for example, you can create a personalized report that focuses on your key accounts in terms of total product turnover in amounts and quantities sold, gross profit, and gross profit percentage during the current month. Then you can have it compare those figures with the results from previous months or the same month last year, and calculate deviations. All this can be done in one and the same view, enabling you to navigate to the cause of identified problem areas and even choose the drop-down to zero in on details all the way down to the level of individual transactions.  

The analysis report consists of the objects you want to analyze (such as customers, customer groups, sales people, and so on, represented as lines) and the analysis parameters, which is the way you want to analyze the object (such as profit calculations, periodic comparisons of sales amounts and volumes or periodic comparisons of actual and budgeted figures, represented as columns). 

In addition to analysis reports, you can create and view similar information in analysis views (based on dimensions). Learn more at [Analyze Data by Dimensions](bi-how-analyze-data-dimension.md).

## Example

You can set up these lines (objects you want to analyze):  

- Computers  
- Displays  
- Spare Parts  

Then you can set up these columns (how you want the objects analyzed):  

- Sales Current Month  
- Sales Last Month  
- Sales in Pct. of last Month  

## Setting up line and column layouts

On the **Analysis Report** page, you can view different line and column layouts that you set up on the:

* **Analysis Line Templates** page where you define the name of the report and the objects you want to show in the lines of your report, and the
* **Analysis Column Templates** page where you define the name of the column template and the analysis parameters that show in the report as columns. Each line on this page represents a column in your report. 

Note that analysis lines and analysis columns are independent from each other.  

Based on the lines and columns you set up, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] aggregates the result of your report in the **Analysis Report** page, as shown in the following table.  

|- |Sales Current Month|Sales Last Month|Sales Last Month %|  
|-|-|-|-|  
|Computers| | | |  
|Displays| | | |  
|Spare parts| | | |  
|Total| | | |  

You can, for example, set up one group of lines and several groups of column layouts to show monthly and annual reports, respectively.

## Set up analysis column templates

The following procedure is based on sales analysis views. The steps are similar for purchase and inventory analysis views.

An analysis column template contains a set of lines, each representing an analysis column you want in the analysis report. To define a column, you must assign an analysis type code to a line. This analysis type code determines the type of source data in the item ledger entries that the analysis will be based on. Source data can include cost, sales amount, or quantity, and their associated value entries. You can set up as many column templates as you like, then use them to create new analysis reports.    

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Column Templates**, then choose the related link.  
2. Select the first empty line and fill in the fields as necessary.
3. Choose the **Columns** action.  
4. On the **Analysis Columns** page, fill the fields in to specify the columns you want in your analysis report.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > To define a column, you must fill in the **Analysis Type Codes** field for all column types except **Formula**. Set up the analysis type codes on the **Analysis Types** page.  
    >
    > Also, in the **Ledger Entry Type** field, if you select **Item Entries**, the actual figures from the item ledger entry are copied. If you select **Item Budget Entries**, the budgeted figures from the budget are copied.  
5. Choose **OK** to save your changes.  

## Set up analysis line templates

The following procedure is based on analysis reports for sales. The steps are similar for purchase and inventory analysis reports.

An analysis line template contains a set of lines, each representing an analysis line you want in the analysis report. A line can specify one or a range of items, customers, vendors, or groups. You can also create a formula in a line to sum up the other lines. You can set up as many line templates as you like, then use them to create new analysis reports.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Line Templates**, then choose the related link.  
2. Select the first empty line, and then fill in the fields as necessary.
3. Choose the **Lines** action.  
4. On the **Analysis Lines** page, create lines for the items, customers, vendors, or salespeople you want to view figures for in your analysis report. You must fill in the **Type**, **Range**, and the **Description** fields.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Alternatively, to create many individual lines for each item, customer, and so on, you can select the appropriate insert option to fill in all the relevant fields on the line. If you need to, you can then edit the lines manually. To insert lines, choose the **Insert Items** or **Insert Item Groups** action.  

## Create a new sales analysis report

The following procedure is based on analysis reports for sales. The steps are similar for purchase and inventory analysis reports.

With analysis reports you can analyze the dynamics of your sales according to key sales performance indicators, such as sales turnover in both amounts and quantities, contribution margin, or progress of actual sales against the budget. You can also use analysis reports to analyze your average sales prices and evaluate the sales performance of your sales force.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Analysis Reports**, then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Analysis Report Sale** page, choose the **New** action.
3. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
4. Choose the **Edit Analysis Report** action.
5. On the **Sales Analysis Report** page, choose the **Show Matrix** action  

> [!NOTE]  
> Building combinations of line and column templates to create reports and assigning them unique names is optional. If you do this, you won't need to select line and column templates on the **Sales Analysis Report** page. After you have chosen a report name, you can change line and column templates independently and then later select the report name again to restore the original combination.

# Set Up Shop Calendars

A work center or machine calendar specifies the working days and hours, shifts, holidays, and absences that determine the center’s gross available capacity, measured in time, according to its defined efficiency and capacity values.

As a foundation for calculating a specific work or machine center calendar, you must first set up one or more general shop calendars. A shop calendar defines a standard work week according to start and end times of each working day and the work shift relation. In addition, the shop calendar defines the fixed holidays during a year.  

The following describes how to set up work center calendars. The steps are similar when setting up machine center calendars.  

## To create work shifts  
1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Work Shifts**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  On a blank line, enter a number in the **Code** field to identify the work shift, for example, **1**.  
3.  Describe the work shift in the **Description** field, for example, **1st shift**.  
4.  Optionally, fill in lines for a second or third work shift.  

Even if your work centers do not work in different work shifts, enter at least one work shift code.  

## To set up a shop calendar  
1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Shop Calendars**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  On a blank line, enter a number in the **Code** field to identify the shop calendar.  
3.  Describe the shop calendar in the **Description** field.  
4.  Choose the **Working Days** action.
5.  On the **Shop Calendar Working Days** page, define a complete work week, with the start and end times for each day.  

    In the **Work Shift Code** field, select one of the shifts that you previously defined. Add a line for every working day and every shift. For example:  

    Monday  07:00 15:00 1   
    Tuesday 07:00 15:00 1  

    If you need a shop calendar with two work shifts, you must fill it in in this manner:  

    Monday 07:00 15:00 1   
    Monday 15:00 23:00 2  
    Tuesday 07:00 15:00 1  
    Tuesday 15:00 23:00 2  

    Any week days that you do not define in the shop calendar, such as Saturday and Sunday, are considered non-working days and will have zero available capacity in a work center calendar.  

    When all the working days of a week are defined, you can close the **Shop Calendar Working Days** page and proceed to enter holidays.  

6.  On the **Shop Calendars** page, select the shop calendar, and then choose the **Holidays** action.
7. On the **Shop Calendar Holidays** page, define the holidays of the year by entering the start date and time, the end time, and description of each holiday on individual lines. For example:  

    04/07/14 0:00:00 23:59:00 Summer Holiday  
    05/07/14 0:00:00 23:59:00 Summer Holiday  
    06/07/14 0:00:00 23:59:00 Summer Holiday  

The defined holidays will have zero available capacity in a work center calendar.  

The shop calendar can now be assigned to a work center to calculate the work shop calendar that will govern all operation scheduling at that work center.  

## To calculate a work center calendar  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Work Centers**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the work center that you want to update.  
3. In the **Shop Calendar Code** field, select which shop calendar to use as the foundation for a work center calendar.  
4. Choose the **Calendar** action.  
5. On the **Work Center Calendar** page, choose the **Show Matrix** action.  

    The left side of the matrix page lists the work centers that are set up. The right side shows a calendar displaying the available capacity values for each working day in the defined unit of measure, for example, **480** minutes. Each line represents the calendar of one work center.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  You can also select to view the capacity values for each week or month by changing the selection in the **View By** field on the **Work Center Calendar** page.  

    To reflect the new shop calendar as a line on the selected work center, it must first be calculated.  

6.  Choose the **Calculate** action.  
7.  On the **Work Center** FastTab, you can set a filter to only calculate for one work center. If you do not set a filter, all existing work center calendars will be calculated.  
8.  Define the starting and ending dates of the calendar period that should be calculated, for example, one year from 01/01/14 to 31/12/14.
9. Choose the **OK** button to calculate capacity.  

Calendar entries are now created or updated displaying the available capacity for each period according to the following three sets of master data:  

- The working days and shift defined in the assigned shop calendar.  
- The value in the **Capacity** field on the work center card.  
- The value in the **Efficiency** field on the work center card.  

The calculated work center calendar will now define when and how much capacity is available at this work center. This controls the detailed scheduling of operations performed at the work center.  

## To record work center absence  
1.  On the **Work Center Calendar** page, choose the **Show Matrix** action.
2. On the **Work Center Calendar Matrix** page, select the work center and calendar day when the absence time should be recorded, and then choose the **Absence** action.  
3.  On the **Absence** page, define the starting time, ending time, and description of that day’s absence. For example:  

    25/01/01 08:00 10:00 Maintenance  

4.  Choose the **Update** action, and then close the **Absence** page.  

The capacity of the selected day has now decreased by the recorded absence time.

# Manage storage by deleting documents or compressing data

A central role, such as the application administrator, must regularly deal with accumulating historic documents by deleting or compressing them.  

> [!TIP]
> Learn more about other ways to reduce the amount of data stored in a database by reading [Reducing Data Stored in Business Central Databases](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/database-reduce-data) in our Developer and IT pro documentation.

## Delete documents

In certain situations, you might need to delete invoiced purchase orders. However, you can't delete them unless you fully invoice and received the items in the purchase orders. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] helps you out by checking for that.

Businesses usually delete return orders after they're invoiced. When you post an invoice, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] transfers it to the **Posted Purchase Credit Memo** page. If you selected the **Return Shipment on Credit Memo** check box on the **Purchases & Payable Setup** page, the invoice is transferred to the **Posted Return Shipment** page. You can delete the documents using the **Delete Invd Purch. Ret. Orders** batch job. Before it deletes documents, the batch job checks whether the purchase return orders are fully shipped and invoiced.  

Blanket purchase orders aren't automatically deleted after you process and invoice all the related purchase orders. Instead, you can delete them with the **Delete Invoiced Blanket Purchase Orders** batch job.  

Businesses typically delete invoiced service orders automatically after they're fully invoiced. When an invoice is posted, a corresponding entry is created and can then be viewed on the **Posted Service Invoices** page.  

Service orders aren't deleted automatically, however, if the total quantity on the order was posted from the **Service Invoice** page rather than from service order itself. You might need to manually delete such invoiced orders by running the **Delete Invoiced Service Orders** batch job.  

## Compress data with date compression

You can compress data in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to save space in the database&mdash;which in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online can even save you money. The compression, based on dates and functions, combines several old entries into one new entry.

You can compress entries that meet all of the following conditions:

* They're from closed fiscal years.
* The **Open** field is set to **No**.
* They're at least five years old. If you want to compress data less than five years old, contact your Microsoft partner.

So, for example, vendor ledger entries from previous fiscal years can be compressed so there's only one credit and one debit entry per account per month. The amount in the new entry is the sum of all the compressed entries. The date assigned is the starting date for the compressed period, such as the first day of the month (if you compress entries by month). After compression, you can still see the net change for each account in the previous fiscal year.

The number of entries that result from a date compression depends on how many filters you set, which fields are combined, and which period length you choose. There's always at least one entry. When the batch job is finished, you can see the result on the **Date Compr. Registers** page.

You can compress the following data types using batch jobs.

* Finance entries - general ledger (G/L) entries, value added tax (VAT) entries, bank account ledger entries, G/L budget entries, customer ledger entries, and vendor ledger entries.
* Warehouse entries
* Resource entries
* Item budget entries
* Fixed asset (FA) ledger entries, FA maintenance ledger entries, and FA insurance ledger entries.

When you're defining criteria for the compression, you can keep the contents of certain fields using the options under **Retain Field Contents**. The available fields depend on the data you're compressing.

> [!NOTE]
> Before you can run date compression, your analysis views must be current. Learn more in the [Update an analysis view](bi-how-analyze-data-dimension.md#update-an-analysis-view) section.

After the compression, the contents of the following fields are always retained: **Posting Date**, **Vendor No.**, **Document Type**, **Currency Code**, **Posting Group**, **Amount**, **Remaining Amount**, **Original Amt. (LCY)**, **Remaining Amt. (LCY)**, **Amount (LCY)**, **Purchase (LCY)**, **Inv. Discount (LCY)**, **Pmt. Disc. Given (LCY)**, and **Pmt. Disc. Possible**.

## Posting compressed entries

Compressed entries are posted a little differently than standard posting. This difference is to reduce the number of new general ledger entries created by date compression, and is especially important when you keep information such as dimensions and document numbers. Date compression creates new entries as follows:

* On the **General Ledger Entries** page, new entries are created for the compressed entries. The **Description** field contains **Date Compressed** so the compressed entries are easy to identify. 
* On ledger pages, such as the **Customer Ledger Entries** page, one or more new entries are created. 

The posting process creates gaps in the number series for entries on the **General Ledger Entries** page. Those numbers are assigned to the entries on the ledger pages only. The number range assigned to the entries is available on the **G/L Register** page in the **From Entry No.** and **To Entry No.** fields. 

> [!NOTE]
> After you run date compression, you can't reverse vendor or bank ledger entries for any transactions that are affected by the compression.

The number of entries that result from a date compression depends on how many filters you set, which fields are combined, and the length of the time period you choose. There's always at least one entry.

> [!WARNING]
> Date compression deletes entries, so you should always make a backup copy of the database before you run the batch job.

### To run a date compression

1. Choose the ![Search for Page or Report](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Data Administration**, then choose the related link.
2. Do one of the following, depending on your needs:
    * To use an assisted guide to set up date compression for one or more types of data, choose **Data Administration Guide**.
    * To set up compression for an individual type of data, choose **Data Compression**, **Compress Entries**, then choose the data to compress.

   > [!NOTE]
   > You can only compress data more than five years old. If you want to compress data less than five years old, contact your Microsoft partner. They need to use the `OnSetMinimumNumberOfYearsToKeep` event in the "Date Compression" codeunit to set the threshold.

# Use the same Microsoft 365 Account in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_long.md)] and Microsoft Invoicing
When you sign up for a trial with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can move to a 30-day evaluation phase, you can start a subscription, or you can stop using [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. In all cases, you may at some point have seen something called **Microsoft Invoicing** and clicked it. This was an app that was part of what is now Microsoft 365 Business Standard and was formerly known as Microsoft 365 Business Premium subscription, so not everyone will have seen that tile in their Microsoft 365 experience.  

Microsoft Invoicing is no longer available, but if you need to sign into Invoicing to retrieve your data, you might see a message that you cannot access Microsoft Invoicing because your account is used in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

You see a similar message if you install the mobile app for Invoicing.  

## Workaround
Invoicing and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] have a shared platform. That means that you are recognized as an existing user of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] when you click Invoicing in the Microsoft 365 admin center. The reason is that Invoicing cannot use the same company as [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

So you will have to sign in to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and rename your existing company, and then create a new company that you can then use in Invoicing. No data is moved or overwritten during this workaround.

### To rename your company
1. Sign in to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].
2. In the top right corner, choose the **Settings** icon ![Settings.](media/ui-experience/settings_icon_small.png "Settings icon for role center"), and then choose **My Settings**.
3. In the **Company** field, choose a different company.
4. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Companies**, and then choose the related link.  
5. On the **Companies** page, choose **Edit List**.  
6. Change the name of the *My Company* entry to something else.  

    Wait a number of minutes. We’ll be making a number of changes in the underlying database, and that takes a while.
7.	When the system is ready again, choose the **Create New Company** button.  
8.  In the dialog that appears, specify the name as *My Company*, and choose the **Production – Setup Data Only** option.  

This again takes a number of minutes. When the process completes, you will be able to access Invoicing as part of your Microsoft 365 Business Standard experience. but only to export data since the Invoicing app is deprecated.  

### What about my data?
When you rename the original My Company, the database tables that store your existing [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] data are renamed, but the data itself is not touched.  

If you use both Invoicing and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the data is stored in two different containers (the two companies). Nothing is shared, so you'll have to manage customers and items in both companies.

# Set up resources for projects

To correctly manage resource activities, you must set up your resources and the related costs and prices. The project-related prices, discounts, and cost factor rules are set up on the project card. You can specify the costs and prices for individual resources, resource groups, or all available resources of the company.

You specify the default amount per hour when you set up a resource. The price and cost amounts apply when you use or sell resources in a project. For example, if you use a specific machine for five hours, the calculation is based on the amount per hour.

> [!NOTE]
> You can't purchase external resources for a specific project. We recommend that you use items of the type Service instead.

## To set up a resource

Create a card for each resource that you want to use in projects.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Resources**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action.
3. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  

## To set up a resource group

You can combine several resources in one resource group. All capacities and budgets of resource groups are accumulated from the individual resources. You can also enter capacities for resource groups either independently of the accumulated values or in addition to them.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Resource groups**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action.
3. Fill in the fields as necessary.

## To set capacity for a resource

To calculate how much time a resource can spend on projects, you must set their capacity. Capacity represents a resource's available time for a period on the work calendar. This setup is used when you fill in project planning lines that contain the resource. For more information, see [Create Projects](projects-how-create-jobs.md).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Resources**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the relevant resource card, and then choose the **Resource Capacity** action.
3. On the **Resource Capacity** page, in the **View By** field, specify the length of the period, such as **Day**, that is shown on columns on the **Resource Capacity Matrix** FastTab.
4. For each resource on a line, specify for each period on the columns the number of hours that the resource is available.
5. Alternatively, to detail the resource's capacity for a specific period, choose the **Set Capacity** action.

   > [!TIP]
   > If you're setting capacity for a group of people who typically work the same hours, you can save a little time and ensure consistency by choosing a work hour template. For example, you might have one work hour template for full time technicians, and another for technicians that work part time. To learn more about work hour templates, go to [To set up work hour templates](service-how-setup-work-service-hours.md#to-set-up-work-hour-templates).

6. On the **Resource Capacity Settings** page, fill in the fields as necessary.
7. Choose the **Update Capacity** action. The **Resource Capacity** page is updated with the entered capacity.
8. Close the page.

## To set up alternate resource costs

In addition to the cost specified on the resource card, you can set up alternate costs for each resource. For example, if you pay an employee a higher hourly rate for overtime, you can set up a resource cost for the overtime rate. The alternate cost that you set up for the resource overrides the cost on the resource card when you use the resource in the resource journal.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Resources**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the resource for that you want to set up one or more alternate costs for, and then choose the **Costs** action.  
3. On the **Resource Costs** page, fill in the fields on a line as necessary.  
4. Repeat step 3 for each alternate resource cost that you want to set up.

> [!NOTE]
> To set up resource costs that apply to all resources and resource groups, open the **Resource Costs** page and fill in the fields.

## To set up alternate resource prices

In addition to price specified on the resource card, you can set up alternate prices for each resource. These alternate prices can be conditional. They can depend on whether the resource is used with a specific project or work type.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Resources**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the resource for that you want to set up one or more alternate prices for, and then choose the **Prices** action.
3. On the **Resource Prices** page, fill in the fields on a line as necessary.
4. Repeat step 3 for each alternate resource price that you want to set up.

## To adjust resource prices

If you want to change costs or prices for a large number of resources, you can use a batch job.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Adjust Resource Costs/Prices**, and then choose the related link.
2. Fill in the fields on a line as necessary, and then choose the **OK** button.

> [!NOTE]  
> This batch job doesn't create or adjust alternate costs or prices for resources. It only changes the contents of the field on the resource card for the **Adjust Field** field that you selected in the batch job. The adjustment takes effect immediately for resources, so check your adjustment factors before you run the batch job.

## To get resource price change suggestions based on existing alternate prices

If you already set up alternate resource prices for some resources, you can use a batch job to set up multiple alternate resource prices.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Resource Price Changes**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **Suggest Res. Price Chg. (Price)** action, and then fill in the fields as necessary.
3. Choose the **OK** button.  
4. When the batch job is finished, the **Resource Price Changes** page shows the results of the batch job.

## To get resource price change suggestions based on standard prices

If you want to set up multiple alternate resource prices based on the standard prices on the resource cards, you can use a batch job.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Resource Price Changes**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **Suggest Res. Price Chg. (Res.)** action, and then fill in the fields as necessary.  
3. Choose the **OK** button.  
4. When the batch job is finished, open the **Resource Price Changes** page to see the results of the batch job.

### Allow multiple people to post resource transactions at the same time

To allow people to post transactions for resources at the same time, enable the **Enable multiple users to post resource ledger entries at the same time** feature update on the **Feature Management** page. By default, the feature isn’t enabled.

> [!NOTE]
> Similar features are available for project, inventory, and warehouse entries. To learn more, go to:
>
> * [Allow multiple people to post project transactions at the same time](projects-how-setup-jobs.md#allow-multiple-people-to-post-project-transactions-at-the-same-time)
> * [Allow workers to post inventory transactions at the same time](inventory-how-setup-general.md#allow-workers-to-post-transactions-at-the-same-time)
> * [Design details: Creating warehouse entries](design-details-warehouse-entries.md)

If you enable the feature, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] assigns entry numbers for each table from `SequenceNumbers` in the database, which allows people to post transactions at the same time. The result can be that sometimes entries from two or more transactions are interleaved.

There's a similar feature for inventory transactions. An item register might contain any or all of the entry tables, as shown in the following image.

:::image type="content" source="media/interleaved inventory tables.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the item register with several entry tables." lightbox="media/interleaved inventory tables.png":::

If you don’t enable the feature, when someone posts a transaction the tables are locked and other users can’t post. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] finds the last entry in each table and assigns a number that’s one higher. This numbering ensures that entries that belong to the same register are consecutive, but prevents other people from posting at the same time.

> [!NOTE]
> You might not want to enable the feature if you have a feature or extension that:
>
> * Relies on consecutive entry numbers.
> * Requires that tables are locked throughout the posting process.

# Use pre-closing reports

There are many standard reports that you can use to verify the accuracy of the accounts before closing the books at the end of a year or period. For example, you can use the **Customer - Trial Balance** report to verify that the balance for a customer posting group is equal to the balance on the corresponding general ledger account on a certain date.

The following table describes a number of reports that might be useful in this process.

| To | See this report |
| --- | --- |
| Print a detailed trial balance report for one or more bank accounts with additional information about individual entries. |Bank Acc. - Detail Trial Bal. |
| Print a detail trial balance for selected customers. |Customer - Trial Balance |
| Print a detail trial balance with detailed information about individual entries, for selected customers during a selected period. |Customer - Detail Trial Bal. |
| Print a detail trial balance for selected vendors. |Vendor - Trial Balance |
| Print a detail trial balance with detailed information about individual entries, for selected vendors during a selected period. |Vendor - Detail Trial Balance |
| Print a trial balance with the current year's and the previous year's figures. | Closing Trial Balance |
| Print a detailed trial balance report for general ledger account balances. |Detail Trial Balance |
| Print a trial balance report with balances and net changes for general ledger accounts. |Trial Balance |
| Print a trial balance for a consolidated company. |Consolidated Trial Balance |

To see a report, choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, type the name as it appears in the table, and then choose the related link.

# Integrate with Microsoft Dataverse via data sync

Business apps often use data from more than one source. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] combines data into a single set of logic that makes it easier to connect [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to other Dynamics 365 applications. For example, [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] or your own application built on [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)]. To learn more about [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)], go to [What is Dataverse?](/powerapps/maker/common-data-service/data-platform-intro).

The following steps provide an overview of the steps to integrate [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

> [!Note]  
> These tasks require the **System Administrator** security role in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

1. Assign licenses for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] to the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] users who will use the integrated apps.

2. Set up a connection to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)]. For more information, see [Connect to Dataverse](admin-how-to-set-up-a-dynamics-crm-connection.md).  

3. Synchronize data between the apps. For more information, see [Synchronizing Business Central and Dataverse](admin-synchronizing-business-central-and-sales.md). 

## Get started with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)]

To get started with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)], you'll need a Microsoft Power Apps account. If you don't already have a Power Apps account, you can get one for free by visiting [powerapps.com](https://make.powerapps.com/?utm_source=padocs&utm_medium=linkinadoc&utm_campaign=referralsfromdoc) and choosing the **Get started free** link. To learn more about how to get started with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)], go to the [Get started with Dataverse](/training/modules/get-started-with-powerapps-common-data-service/) module from Microsoft training.

## Bi-directional or uni-directional data synchronization

You can synchronize data either to or from one Dynamics 365 business app to another, or in both directions in near-real time, through [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)]. For example, if you integrate [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)], a salesperson can create a sales order in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] and the order synchronizes to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Conversely, from [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)], the salesperson can check the availability of the item on the order in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. 

## Standard and custom entities

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] securely stores data in a set of tables, which are sets of records similar to how a table stores data within a database. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] includes a base set of standard tables that cover typical scenarios, but you can also create custom tables specific to your organization. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can view standard and custom tables being synchronized on the Integration Table Mappings page.

## About the Business Central Base Integration Solution

The Base Integration Solution is a key component of the integration. The solution adds the required roles and access levels to the user accounts for the integration, and it creates tables needed to map [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] company to business unit in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)]. 

By default, the **Set up [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] connection** assisted setup guide imports the solution. To do that, the setup guide uses an administrator user account that you specify. This account must be a valid user in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] with the **System Administrator** security role.  

To learn more about user accounts, go to the following articles:

* [Setting Up User Accounts for Integrating with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)]](admin-setting-up-integration-with-dynamics-sales.md) 
* [Create users in Microsoft Dynamics 365 (online) and assign security roles](/dynamics365/customer-engagement/admin/create-users-assign-online-security-roles). 

The administrator account is used only one time during the setup for the configuration changes that the Base Integration Solution makes in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)]. After the solution imports, the account is no longer needed. Integration will continue to use the user account that is automatically created specifically for the integration.

In addition to customizing [!INCLUDE [cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)], the solution also creates a security role in [!INCLUDE [cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] for the integration:

* **Business Central Dataverse Integration** - Allows you to manage the connection between [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and [!INCLUDE [cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)]. Typically, this role is assigned only to the user account that's automatically created for synchronization. To learn more about this role, go to [Setting Up User Accounts for Integrating with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)]](admin-setting-up-integration-with-dynamics-sales.md).

When you set up the connection, you create the integration table mappings that you need to synchronize data. Entities in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] are mapped to tables and table fields in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] through integration tables. To learn more about mappings, go to [Standard Entity Mapping for Synchronization](admin-synchronizing-business-central-and-sales.md#standard-table-mapping-for-synchronization).

## Handle differences in local and base transaction currencies

You can connect to a [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] environment that has a different base currency than the local currency in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. You make the connection in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on the **Dataverse Connection Setup** page or by using the **Set up connection to Dataverse** assisted setup guide.

To be able to connect, ensure that the base transaction currency setting in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] has the currency that set on the **Currencies** page in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], and at least one exchange rate is specified for the currency on the **Currency Exchange Rates** page.

Here's an example. You're connecting [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] with Euro (EUR) set as the local currency on the **General Ledger Setup** page to a [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] environment that has a base transaction currency set to US dollar (USD). You'll need to have USD on the **Currencies** page in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and the appropriate exchange rate. 

When you enable the connection to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)], [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] adds its local currency to the **Currency** entity in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] with the exchange rate from the **Currency Factor** field on the **Currency Exchange Rates** page.

Currency synchronization is unidirectional, from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to [!INCLUDE [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)], monetary amounts convert and synchronize as follows:

* Amounts in the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] base currency convert to the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] local currency based on the latest exchange rate synchronized from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].
* Amounts in the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] local currency synchronize with the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] local currency in one of the other (non-base) currencies in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)].

## What happens when you copy a company

You can safely copy companies that integrate with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]. Copying companies helps reduce the risk of data inconsistencies and can save you valuable time. To learn more about copying companies, go to [Copy a company](about-new-company.md#copy-a-company).

# Work with item attributes

When customers inquire about an item, either in correspondence or in an integrated web shop, they might ask or search according to characteristics, such as height and model year. To provide this customer service, you can assign item attribute values of different types to your items, which can then be used when searching for items.

You can also assign item attributes to item categories, which then apply to the items that use the item categories. For more information, see [Categorize Item](inventory-how-categorize-items.md).

> [!TIP]  
> If you attach pictures to items, the Image Analyzer extension can detect attributes in the image, and suggest the attributes so you can decide whether to assign them. The extension is ready to go. You just need to enable it. For more information, see [The Image Analyzer Extension](ui-extensions-image-analyzer.md).

The balancing account number is inserted automatically on the invoice header every time you create a new invoice. For more information, see [Defining Payment Methods](finance-payment-methods.md).  

## To settle purchase invoices promptly

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Invoices**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. To pay either in cash or by bank transfer, enter the number of the general ledger cash account or the bank account in the **Bal. Account No.** field.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The **Bal. Account Type** and **Bal. Account No.** fields are not included in the standard layout of the invoice header. In order to post the payment of an invoice, you must contact a Microsoft partner who can add the fields through code.  
>
> This customization is only required if you do not specify balancing accounts on the payment methods as describe above.

# About unit cost calculation

Each item has a unit cost that is calculated based on the company's costing method and other factors. As a rule, with the *Standard* costing method, the **Unit Cost** field value is based on the standard cost for the item. For all other costing methods (*FIFO*, *LIFO*, *Specific*, and *Average*), the unit cost is calculated based on the average unit cost across a period of time.  

## When is the unit cost field updated for item

The chosen costing method influences when the **Unit Cost** field is updated.

When the costing method is set as *Standard*, the **Unit Cost** field is updated whenever the standard cost is changed, and users can't edit the **Unit Cost** field. For more information, see [About Calculating Standard Cost](finance-about-calculating-standard-cost.md).

If the costing method is *FIFO*, *LIFO*, *Specific*, or *Average*, then the **Unit Cost** is updated in the following cases:

* When the item is cost-adjusted, automatically or by an [Adjust Cost](inventory-how-adjust-item-costs.md#to-adjust-item-costs-manually) task.
* During the posting of purchase invoices, output, or positive adjustment if one of the following conditions is true:
  * The net invoiced quantity of the item changes from negative or zero to positive.
  * The current unit cost is zero.

If one of these conditions is true, then the **Unit Cost** field is updated with the value in the **Last Direct Cost** field on the item card.

> [!NOTE]
> The **Unit Cost** field is not updated if the current unit cost is higher than zero and the new unit cost is zero. A unit cost of zero is considered an exception from regular business. Therefore, the current unit cost is retained to provide the last known, relevant value. This exception applies even if the existing inventory has been revalued to zero.

In the **Unit Cost** field on the item card, you can drill down to view the history of transactions that the average cost of units on hand is calculated from in the **Average Cost Calc. Overview** window.

## Impact of unit cost field on purchases and sales
How the contents of the **Costing Method** field influence the unit cost calculation for purchases and sales is described in more detail in the following sections.

### Unit cost calculation for purchases

When you purchase items, the value in the **Last Direct Cost** field on the item card is copied to the **Direct Unit Cost** field on a purchase line or to the **Unit Amount** line on an item journal line.

What you select in the **Costing Method** field influences how [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates the contents of the **Unit Cost** field on the lines.

#### Costing method FIFO, LIFO, Specific, or Average

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates the contents of the **Unit Cost (LCY)** field on the purchase line or the contents of the **Unit Cost** field on the item journal line according to the following formula:

*Unit Cost (LCY) = (Direct Unit Cost – (Discount Amount / Quantity)) x (1 + Indirect Cost % / 100) + Overhead Rate*

#### Costing method Standard

The **Unit Cost (LCY)** field on the purchase line or the **Unit Cost** field is filled on the item journal line by copying the value in the **Unit Cost** field on the item card. By using costing method set as *Standard*, this value is always based on the standard cost.

When you post the purchase, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses the unit cost from the purchase line or item journal line to the purchase item invoice entry. You can see it on the entry list for the item.

#### All costing methods

The unit cost from the source document line is used to calculate the contents of the **Cost Amount (Actual)** field, or if applicable, the **Cost Amount (Expected)** field that relates to this item entry, regardless of the costing method of the item.

### Unit cost calculation for sales

When you sell items, the unit cost is copied from the **Unit Cost** field on the item card to the sales line or the item journal line.

When you post, the unit cost is copied to the sales invoice item entry, and it can be seen on the entry list for the item. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses the unit cost from the source document line to calculate the contents of the **Cost Amount (Actual)** field, or if applicable, the **Cost Amount (Expected)** field in the value entry related to this item entry.

<!--
## To make general changes in the last direct unit cost

If you need to change the direct unit cost for several items, you can use the **Adjust Item Costs/Prices** batch job.  

The batch job changes the contents in the **Unit Price** field on the item card. The batch job changes the content of the field in the same way for all items or selected items. The batch job multiplies the value in the field by an adjustment factor that you specify.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Adjust Item Costs/Prices**, and then choose the related link.  
2. In the **Adjust Field** field, specify which item or SKU card field you want to adjust.  
3. In the **Adjustment Factor** field, specify the factor by which to adjust the value. For example, enter **1.5** to increase the value by 50%.  
4. On the **Item** FastTab, set filters to specify, for example, which items to process with the batch job.  
5. Choose the **OK** button.

# Manufacturing Power BI app

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The Power BI Manufacturing app gives insights into your manufacturing activities. Its detailed analytics and visualizations of manufacturing data help:

- Streamline manufacturing processes
- Improve decision-making at all levels of the organization
- Optimize production efficiency

## Manufacturing analytics for the leadership team

To fit this category, you might have a role such as:

- Chief Operating Officer
- Chief Manufacturing Officer
  
### Example scenario: analyzing current utilization

COOs need to ensure that your manufacturing plant is operating at optimal levels. By analyzing the [Current Utilization](manufacturing-powerbi-current-utilization.md) and [Historical Utilization](manufacturing-powerbi-historical-utilization.md) reports, you can get a better understanding of how efficiently you're using your resources and identify areas for improvement.

You can also use the [Work Center Load](manufacturing-powerbi-work-center-load.md) report to identify bottlenecks in your production process, and make informed decisions to increase efficiency and productivity.

## Manufacturing analytics for the management team

To fit this category, you might have a role such as:

- Manufacturing Manager
- Operations Manager

### Example scenario: improving resource usage

Manufacturing managers ensure that all production orders are completed on time and within budget. Using the [Finished Production Order Breakdown](manufacturing-powerbi-finished-production-order-breakdown.md) and [Average Production Times](manufacturing-powerbi-average-production-times.md) reports, you can analyze the production time for each order and identify opportunities to optimize the production process.

The [Allocated Hours](manufacturing-powerbi-allocated-hours.md) report provides a detailed breakdown of allocated hours and aggregates them by work center. This report can help you catch unexpected spikes in resource usage.

By using the [Released Production Orders](manufacturing-powerbi-released-production-orders.md) report, you can also identify discrepancies in production patterns across different orders and make decisions.

## Manufacturing analytics for warehouse staff

To fit this category, you might have a role such as:

- Manufacturing Supervisor
- Production Operator

### Example scenario: tracking production lines

Manufacturing supervisors ensure that goods and materials flow smoothly through the manufacturing facility. Your role is critical in maintaining the production schedule and meeting customer demand. The [Current Utilization](manufacturing-powerbi-current-utilization.md) report shows the use of work centers in real-time, which helps you spot bottlenecks and optimize production processes.

You notice that one work center is consistently operating at full capacity, while others are underused. You use the [Historical Utilization](manufacturing-powerbi-historical-utilization.md) report to analyze the historical use of work centers and find trends and patterns. This report helps you plan for future capacity needs and balance production across work centers.

To improve production efficiency, you track the allocated hours for each work center using the [Allocated Hours](manufacturing-powerbi-allocated-hours.md) report. This report helps you understand workloads and adjust staffing levels accordingly.

# Sustainability value chain overview

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This set of features is available as a _public preview_ in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], starting from **2025 release wave 1**. Read carefully, and be sure to understand which features we currently support.  

The sustainability value chain features are a comprehensive tool designed to streamline the collection and use of data from your value chain partners. This feature empowers organizations to accurately calculate Scope 3 emissions, enabling better sustainability reporting and compliance with environmental standards.  

## Introduction to value chain for Scope 3 emissions calculation

The sustainability value chain enables you to use data you from your value chain partners to calculate your scope 3 emissions. A value chain in general is a vendor you do business with and from whom you collect inbound emission data. After you collect emissions or carbon data from your vendors, you can use the data to calculate your Scope 3 emissions in your business processes. You can also calculate other emissions for other types of item handling, such as transfers, production, and so on. These calculations help give you accurate information about embedded emissions for items you plan to sell.

The sustainability value chain helps businesses:

- Achieve a higher level of accuracy in sustainability reporting.
- Provide better communication with customers related to emissions in their products.
- Better align with regulatory demands.
- Actively contribute to reducing their environmental footprint.  

## How the system keeps sustainability value chain data

To track the sustainability value chain, record and use transactions from the **Sustainability Value Entries** page.  

> [!NOTE]
> The sustainability value chain process works only with the CO2e (carbon equivalent).

The **Sustainability Value Entry** page is an important component for managing and tracking the value of the embedded carbon footprint in items. It records all changes in the CO2e emissions of inventory items, including purchases, location transfers, production, sales, and so on. This page helps ensure accurate CO2e (carbon equivalent) valuation and provides detailed insights into the emissions effect of inventory transactions.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The sustainability value chain uses only the average method of CO2e emission calculation per item. An item's **CO2e per Unit** is calculated as the average **CO2e per Unit** at each point in time after a purchase.

# Design Details: Cost Adjustment

The main purpose of cost adjustment is to forward cost changes from cost sources to cost recipients, according to an item’s costing method, to provide correct inventory valuation.  

An item can be sales invoiced before it has been purchase invoiced, so that the recorded inventory value of the sale does not match the actual purchase cost. Cost adjustment updates the cost of goods sold (COGS) for historic sales entries to ensure that they match the costs of the inbound transactions to which they are applied. For more information, see [Design Details: Item Application](design-details-item-application.md).  

The following are secondary purposes, or functions, of cost adjustment:  

* Invoice finished production orders:  

  * Change the status of value entries from **Expected** to **Actual**.  
  * Clear WIP accounts. For more information, see [Design Details: Production Order Posting](design-details-production-order-posting.md).  
  * Post variance. For more information, see [Design Details: Variance](design-details-variance.md).  
  * Update the unit cost on the item card.  

Inventory costs must be adjusted before the related value entries can be reconciled with the general ledger. For more information, see [Design Details: Reconciliation with the General Ledger](design-details-reconciliation-with-the-general-ledger.md).  

## Detecting the Adjustment

The task of detecting if cost adjustment should occur is primarily performed by the Item Jnl.-Post Line routine, while the task of calculating and generating cost adjustment entries is performed by the **Adjust Cost – Item Entries** batch job.  

To be able to forward costs, the detection mechanism determines which sources have changed in costs and to which destination these costs should be forwarded. The following three detection functions exist in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]:  

* Item Application Entry  
* Average Cost Adjustment Entry Point  
* Order Level  

### Item Application Entry

This detection function is used for items that use FIFO, LIFO, Standard, and Specific costing methods and for fixed applications scenarios. The function works as follows:  

* Cost adjustment is detected by marking the source item ledger entries as *Applied Entry to Adjust* whenever an item ledger entry or value entry is posted.  
* Cost is forwarded according to the cost chains that are recorded in the **Item Application Entry** table.  

### Average Cost Adjustment Entry Point

This detection function is used for items that use the Average costing method. The function works as follows:  

* Cost adjustment is detected by marking a record in the **Avg. Cost Adjmt. Entry Point** table whenever a value entry is posted.  
* Cost is forwarded by applying the costs to value entries with a later valuation date.  

### Order Level

This detection function is used in conversion scenarios, production and assembly. The function works as follows:  

* Cost adjustment is detected by marking the order whenever a material/resource is posted as consumed/used.  
* Cost is forwarding by applying the costs from material/resource to the output entries associated with the same order.  

The Order Level function is used to detect adjustments in assembly posting. The following graphic shows the adjustment entry structure:  

![Flow of entries in cost adjustment.](media/design_details_assembly_posting_3.png "Flow of entries in cost adjustment")  

For more information, see [Design Details: Assembly Order Posting](design-details-assembly-order-posting.md).  

## Manual versus Automatic Cost Adjustment

Cost adjustment can be performed in two ways:  

* Manually, by running the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job. You can run this batch job either for all items or for only certain items or item categories. This batch job runs a cost adjustment for the items in inventory for which an inbound transaction has been made, such as a purchase. For items that use the average costing method, the batch job also makes an adjustment if any outbound transactions are created.  
* Automatically, by adjusting costs every time that you post an inventory transaction, and when you finish a production order. The cost adjustment is only run for the specific item or items affected by the posting. This is set up when you select the **Automatic Cost Adjustment** check box on the **Inventory Setup** page.  

It is good practice to run the cost adjustment automatically when you post because unit costs are more frequently updated and therefore more accurate. The disadvantage is that the performance of the database can be affected by running the cost adjustment so often.  

Because it is important to keep the unit cost of an item up to date, it is recommend that you run the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job as often as possible, during nonworking hours. Alternatively, use automatic cost adjustment. This ensures that the unit cost is updated for items daily.  

Regardless if you run the cost adjustment manually or automatically, the adjustment process and its consequences are the same. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates the value of the inbound transaction and forwards that cost to any outbound transactions, such as sales or consumptions, which have been applied to the inbound transaction. The cost adjustment creates value entries that contain adjustment amounts and amounts that compensate for rounding.  

The new adjustment and rounding value entries have the posting date of the related invoice. Exceptions are if the value entries fall in a closed accounting period or inventory period or if the posting date is earlier than the date in the **Allow Posting From** field on the **General Ledger Setup** page. If this occurs, the batch job assigns the posting date as the first date of the next open period.  

## Adjust Cost - Item Entries Batch Job

When you run the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job, you have the option to run the batch job for all items or for only certain items or categories.  

> [!NOTE]  
> We recommend that you always run the batch job for all items and only use the filtering option to reduce the runtime of the batch job, or to fix the cost of a certain item.  

### Example

The following example shows if you post a purchased item as received and invoiced on 01-01-20. You later post the sold item as shipped and invoiced on 01-15-20. Then, you run the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** and **Post Inventory Cost to G/L** batch jobs. The following entries are created.  

#### Value Entries (1) 

|Posting Date|Item Ledger Entry Type|Cost Amount (Actual)|Cost Posted to G/L|Invoiced Quantity|Entry No.|  
|------------|----------------------|--------------------|------------------|-----------------|---------|  
|01-01-20|Purchase|10.00|10.00|1|1|  
|01-15-20|Sale|-10.00|-10.00|-1|2|  

#### Relation Entries in the G/L – Item Ledger Relation Table (1)

|G/L Entry No.|Value Entry No.|G/L Register No.|  
|-------------|---------------|----------------|  
|1|1|1|  
|2|1|1|  
|3|2|1|  
|4|2|1|  

#### General Ledger Entries (1)

|Posting Date|G/L Account|Account No. (En-US Demo)|Amount|Entry No.|  
|------------------|------------------|---------------------------------|------------|---------------|  
|01-01-20|[Inventory Account]|2130|10.00|1|  
|01-01-20|[Direct Cost Applied Account]|7291|-10.00|2|  
|01-15-20|[Inventory Account]|2130|-10.00|3|  
|01-15-20|[COGS Account]|7290|10.00|4|  

Later, you post a related purchase item charge for 2.00 LCY invoiced on 02-10-20. You run the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job and then run the **Post Inventory Cost to G/L** batch job. The cost adjustment batch job adjusts the cost of the sale by -2.00 LCY accordingly, and the **Post Inventory Cost to G/L** batch job posts the new value entries to the general ledger. The result is as follows.  

#### Value Entries (2)  

|Posting Date|Item Ledger Entry Type|Cost Amount (Actual)|Cost Posted to G/L|Invoiced Quantity|Adjustment|Entry No.|  
|------------|----------------------|--------------------|------------------|-----------------|----------|---------|  
|02-10-20|Purchase|2.00|2.00|0|No|3|  
|01-15-20|Sale|-2.00|-2.00|0|Yes|4|  

#### Relation Entries in the G/L – Item Ledger Relation Table (2)

|G/L Entry No.|Value Entry No.|G/L Register No.|  
|-------------|---------------|----------------|  
|5|3|2|  
|6|3|2|  
|7|4|2|  
|8|4|2|  

#### General Ledger Entries (2)

|Posting Date|G/L Account|Account No. (En-US Demo)|Amount|Entry No.|  
|------------|-----------|------------------------|------|---------|  
|02-10-20|[Inventory Account]|2130|2.00|5|  
|02-10-20|[Direct Cost Applied Account]|7291|-2.00|6|  
|01-15-20|[Inventory Account]|2130|-2.00|7|  
|01-15-20|[COGS Account]|7290|2.00|8|  

## Automatic Cost Adjustment

To set up cost adjustment to run automatically when you post an inventory transaction, use the **Automatic Cost Adjustment** field on the **Inventory Setup** page. This field enables you to select how far back in time from the current work date that you want automatic cost adjustment to be performed. The following options exist.  

|Option|Description|
|------|-----------|
|Never|Costs are not adjusted when you post.|  
|Day|Costs are adjusted if posting occurs within one day from the work date.|  
|Week|Costs are adjusted if posting occurs within one week from the work date.|  
|Month|Costs are adjusted if posting occurs within one month from the work date.|  
|Quarter|Costs are adjusted if posting occurs within one quarter from the work date.|  
|Year|Costs are adjusted if posting occurs within one year from the work date.|  
|Always|Costs are always adjusted when you post, regardless of the posting date.|  

The selection that you make in the **Automatic Cost Adjustment** field is important for performance and the accuracy of your costs. Shorter time periods, such as **Day** or **Week**, affect system performance less, because they provide the stricter requirement that only costs posted in the last day or week can be automatically adjusted. This means that the automatic cost adjustment does not run as frequently and therefore affects system performance less. However, it also means that unit costs may be less accurate.  

### Example

The following example shows an automatic cost adjustment scenario:  

* On January 10, you post a purchased item as received and invoiced.  
* On January 15, you post a sales order for the item as shipped and invoiced.
* On February 5, you receive an invoice for a freight charge on the original purchase. You post this freight charge, applying it to the original purchase invoice, which increases the cost of the original purchase.  

If you have set up the automatic cost adjustment to apply to postings that occur within a month or a quarter from the current work date, then the automatic cost adjustment runs and forwards the cost of the purchase to the sale.  

If you have set up the automatic cost adjustment to apply to postings that occur within a day or a week from the current work date, then the automatic cost adjustment does not run, and the cost of the purchase is not forwarded to the sale until you run the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job.

# Managing Marketing Campaigns
Having a strong marketing plan in place enables you to identify, attract, and retain customers. A marketing plan consists of various campaigns and other interactions in connection with your sales and marketing activities. While planning a campaign, you need to decide which contacts to target, what type of campaign (such as trade show or direct mail), and what salespeople will perform each task.

Each campaign consists of various activities or tasks. You can combine multiple task, for example tasks that each represent a step, in activities. Activity tasks are related to each other by a date formula. Individual tasks can only be assigned to salespeople. Activities can be assigned to opportunities, salespeople, groups of sales people, and contacts. For more information, see [Set Up Opportunity Sales Cycles and Cycle Stages](marketing-how-setup-opportunity-sales-cycles-stages.md).

## Defining individual campaigns
Before you can create a campaign, you must set up *campaign status codes*. Using these codes will help you manage your campaigns by assigning a status to the campaign. As you work through the stages of a campaign, you are able to see what step a campaign is at and what step comes next. You set up campaign status codes on the **Campaign Status** page.

You can create a campaign card for each campaign that you want to keep track of. You can also view these campaign cards to view general information about your campaigns.
You can delete campaign entries, such as if the entry records an action that has been canceled. Only canceled campaign entries can be deleted.

### Selecting the target audience
After you have created a campaign, you can start creating segments that specify the target audience of the campaign. For more information, see [Managing Segments](marketing-segments.md).

### Registering discount percentages
When you have set up your campaign, decided what segments you want the campaign to cover, and set the starting and ending dates, you register the discount percentage that the customer will receive on the individual items on the lines on the **Sales Line Discounts** page. You can also register the sales prices for the individual items on the lines on the **Sales Prices** page. You can access both pages from the campaign card.

 When you have set up the sales prices/line discounts and the segments on the campaign card, you must activate them so that the campaign prices/discounts will be reflected on the lines.

> [!NOTE]  
>   In order to activate the sales prices/line discounts, you must specify if the whole segment or only some contacts are targets of the campaign. If the sales prices/line discounts covers all the contacts in the segment, select the **Campaign Target** field on the **Campaign** FastTab of the **Segment** card.

If the sales prices/line discounts are not to be offered to all the contacts in the segment, you can clear the **Campaign Target** field for the relevant contacts. If you cannot see this field, you can add it to your view. For more information, see [Personalize Your Workspace](ui-personalization-user.md).

## Conducting campaigns
As a campaign runs, all interactions with your contacts, or segment, are recorded so that you can get statistics and other information about the costs and success rates of the campaign.

Campaigns are conducted by salespeople, and you must create activities to represent each task and assign them to the relevant salespeople. For more information, see [Set Up Opportunity Sales Cycles and Cycle Stages](marketing-how-setup-opportunity-sales-cycles-stages.md).

# Process sales returns or cancellations

If a customer wants to return items or be reimbursed for items or services that you have sold and received payment for, you must create and post a sales credit memo that specifies the requested change. To include the correct sales invoice information, you can do the following tasks:  

- Create the sales credit memo directly from the posted sales invoice.
- Create a new sales credit memo with copied invoice information.

If you need more control of the sales return process, such as warehouse documents for the item handling, or a better overview when receiving items from multiple sales documents with one sales return, then you can create sales return orders. A sales return order automatically issues the related sales credit memo and other return-related documents, such as a replacement sales order, if needed. For more information, see [Process sales return orders](sales-how-process-sales-returns-orders.md).

> [!NOTE]  
> If a posted sales invoice has not yet been paid, then you can use the **Correct** or **Cancel** functions on the posted sales invoice to reverse transactions. These functions only work for unpaid invoices, and they do not support partial returns or cancellations. For more information, see [Correct or Cancel Unpaid Sales Invoices](sales-how-correct-cancel-sales-invoice.md).

A return or reimbursement might relate to only some of the items or services on the original sales invoice. In that case, you must edit information on the lines on the sales credit memo or sales return order. When you post the sales credit memo or sales return order, the sales documents that are affected by the change are reversed and a refund payment can be created for the customer. For more information, see [Making Payments](payables-make-payments.md).  

The credit memo posting will also revert any item charges that were assigned to the posted document, so that the item's value entries are the same as before the item charge was assigned.

> [!NOTE]
> The bookkeeping aspects of sales returns, such as the payments to customers as reimbursement, is considered bookkeeping work and not described here. For more information, see [Managing Payables](payables-manage-payables.md).

## To create a sales credit memo from a posted sales invoice  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Posted Sales Invoices**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Posted Sales Invoices** page, select the posted sales invoice that you want to reverse, choose the **Cancel** action, and then choose the **Create Corrective Credit Memo** action.

    The sales credit memo header contains some information from the posted sales invoice. You can edit this, for example, with new information that reflects the return agreement.  
3. Edit information on the lines according to the agreement, such as the number of returned items or the amount to reimburse.
4. Choose the **Prepare** action, and then choose the **Apply Entries** action.
5. On the **Apply Customer Entries** page, select the line with the posted sales document that you want to apply the sales credit memo to, and then choose the **Applies-to ID** action.

    The identifier of the sales credit memo displays in the **Applies-to ID** field.
6. In the **Amount to Apply** field, enter the amount that you want to apply if it's smaller than the original amount.  

    At the bottom of the **Apply Customer Entries** page, you can see the total amount to apply to reverse all involved entries, namely when the value in the **Balance** field is zero.
7. Choose the **OK** button. When you post the sales credit memo, it is applied to the posted sales documents.

    After you create or edit sales credit memo lines, and the single or multiple applications are specified, you can post the sales credit memo.  
8. Choose the **Posting** action, then choose the **Post and Send** action.  

The **Post and Send Confirmation** dialog box opens showing the preferred sending method for the customer. You can change the sending method by choosing the lookup button for the **Send Document** to field. For more information, see [Set Up Document Sending Profiles](sales-how-setup-document-send-profiles.md).  

The posted sales documents that you applied the credit memo to are now reversed, and a refund payment can be created for the customer. The sales credit memo is removed and replaced with a new document in the list of posted sales credit memos.

## To create a sales credit memo by copying a posted sales invoice

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Credit Memos**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action to open a new empty sales credit memo.
3. In the **Customer Name** field, enter the name of an existing customer.
4. Choose the **Prepare** action, then choose the **Copy Document** action.
5. On the **Copy Sales Document** page, in the **Document Type** field, select **Posted Invoice**.
6. Choose the **Document No.** field to open the **Posted Sales Invoices** page, and then select the posted sales invoice record that contains lines that you want to reverse.
7. Select the **Recalculate Lines** check box if you want the copied posted sales invoice lines to be updated with any changes in item price and unit cost since the invoice was posted.
8. Choose the **OK** button. The copied invoice lines are inserted in the sales credit memo.
9. Complete the sales credit memo as explained in [To create a sales credit memo from a posted sales invoice](sales-how-process-sales-returns-cancellations.md#to-create-a-sales-credit-memo-from-a-posted-sales-invoice).

## To create a sales allowance
You can send a customer a credit memo with a price reduction if the customer has received slightly damaged items or received the items late.  
You can post this reduced price as an item charge in a credit memo or a return order and assign it to the posted shipment. The following describes it for a sales credit memo, but the same steps apply to a sales return order.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Credit Memos**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action to open a new empty sales credit memo.
3. Fill in the credit memo header with relevant information about the customer that you want to give the sales allowance to.  
4. On the **Lines** FastTab, in the **Type** field, select **Charge (Item)**.  
5. In the **No.** field, select the appropriate item charge value.  
     You might want to create a special item charge number to cover sales allowances.  
6. In the **Quantity** field, enter **1**.  
7. In the **Unit Price Excl. Tax** field, enter the amount of the sales allowance.  
8. Assign the sales allowance as an item charge to the items in the posted shipment. For more information, see [Use Item Charges to Account for Additional Trade Costs](payables-how-assign-item-charges.md). When you have assigned the allowance, return to the **Sales Credit Memo** page.  

When you post the sales return order, the sales allowance is added to the relevant sales entry amount. In this way, you can maintain accurate inventory valuation.

## To combine return receipts
You can combine return receipts if your customer returns several items that are covered by different sales return orders.  

When you receive the items into your warehouse, post the relevant sales return orders as received. This creates posted return receipts.  

When you're ready to invoice this customer, instead of invoicing each sales return order separately, you can create a sales credit memo and automatically copy the posted return receipt lines to this document. Then you can post the sales credit memo and conveniently invoice all the open sales return orders at once.  

To combine return receipts, the **Combine Shipments** check box must be selected on the **Customer Card** page.  

### To manually combine return receipts  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Credit Memos**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.
3. On the **General** FastTab, fill in the fields as necessary.  
4. Choose the **Get Return Receipt Lines** action.  
5. Select the return receipt lines that you want to include in the credit memo:  

    - To insert all lines, select all lines, and then choose the **OK** button.  

    - To insert specific lines, select the lines, and then choose the **OK** button.  
6.  If an incorrect shipment line was selected or you want to start over, you can simply delete the lines on the credit memo and rerun the **Get Return Receipt Lines** function.  
7.  Post the invoice.  

### To automatically combine return receipts

You can automatically combine return receipts and have the option of automatically posting the credit memos using the  **Combine Return Receipts** function.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Combine Return Receipts**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Combine Return Receipts** page, fill in the fields to select the relevant return receipts.
3. Select the **Post Credit Memos** check box. If not, you must manually post the resulting purchase credit memos.
4. Choose the **OK** button.  

### To remove a received and invoiced return order

When you invoice return receipts in this way, the return orders from which the return receipts were posted still exist, even if they have been fully received and invoiced.  

When return receipts are combined on a credit memo and posted, a posted sales credit memo is created for the credited lines. The **Quantity Invoiced** field on the originating sales return order is updated based on the invoiced quantity.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Delete Invoiced Sales Return Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Specify in the **No.** filter field which return orders to delete.  
3. Choose the **OK** button.  

Alternatively, delete individual sales return orders manually.  

## Inventory costing

To preserve correct inventory valuation, you typically want to put returned items back in inventory at the unit cost that they were sold at, not at their current unit cost. This is referred to as exact cost reversing.

Two functions exist to assign exact cost reversing automatically:  

|Function|Description|  
|------------------|---------------------------------------|  
|**Get Posted Document Lines to Reverse** function on the **Sales Return Order** page|Copies lines of one or more posted documents to be reversed into the sales return order. For more information, see [Create a sales return order based on one or more posted sales documents](sales-how-process-sales-returns-orders.md#create-a-sales-return-order-based-on-one-or-more-posted-sales-documents).|  
|**Copy Document** function in the **Sales Credit Memo** and **Sales Return Order** pages|Copies both the header and lines of one posted document to be reversed.<br /><br /> Requires that the **Exact Cost Reversing Mandatory** check box is selected on the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page.|

To assign exact cost reversing manually, you must choose the **Appl.-from Item Entry** field on any type of return document line, and then select the number of the original sales entry. This links the sales credit memo or sales return order to the original sales entry and ensures that the item is valued at the original unit cost.

For more information, see [Design Details: Inventory Costing](design-details-inventory-costing.md).

# Visit our video library

You found our documentation. But some people prefer to watch content rather than read it. To that end, we're producing short, easily digestible videos. Most videos supplement our user assistance, and some of them can be viewed on their own.  

If you're new to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can launch the introduction videos from the welcome page that displays. If you're already working in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can get to the library from the **Business Manager** and **Accountant** Role Centers by choosing the **Product Videos** tile.  

> [!Tip]  
> Videos in the library display in a frame that might seem a little small. To make the frame larger, choose the double-ended arrow icon in the upper-right corner. Afterward, videos will display in the larger frame until you make it small again.

# Receive items with warehouse receipts

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you receive items and put them away using one of four methods, as described in the following table.

|Method|Inbound Process|Require Receipts|Require Put-aways|Complexity Level (Learn more at [Warehouse Management Overview](design-details-warehouse-management.md))|  
|------------|---------------------|--------------|----------------|------------|  
|A|Post receipt and put-away from the order line|||No dedicated warehouse activity.|  
|B|Post receipt and put-away from an inventory put-away document||Turned on|Basic: Order-by-order.|  
|C|Post receipt and put-away from a warehouse receipt document|Turned on||Basic: Consolidated receive/ship posting for multiple orders.|  
|D|Post receipt from a warehouse receipt document and post put-away from a warehouse put-away document|Turned on|Turned on|Advanced|  

To learn more about how to handle inbound items, go to [Inbound Warehouse Flow](design-details-inbound-warehouse-flow.md).

The following article refers to methods C and D in the previous table.

## Receive items with a warehouse receipt

When items arrive at a warehouse that processes warehouse receipts, get the lines of the document that triggered the receipt. If you use bins, you can either accept the default bin or specify the bin to put the items in. The latter might be required when you receive an item for the first time. Then, enter the quantities of the items you received and post the receipt.  

You can create warehouse receipt in one of two ways:

* In a push fashion, when work is done on an order-by-order basis. Choose the **Create Warehouse Receipt** action in the source document, such as a purchase order, sales return order, or transfer order to create a warehouse receipt for a source document.
* In a pull fashion, where you use the **Release** action in the source document, such as a purchase order, sales return order, or transfer order to release the document to the warehouse. A warehouse employee can create a **Warehouse Receipt** for one or more released source documents.

The following procedure describes how to create a warehouse receipt in a pull fashion.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Warehouse Receipts**, then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  

    Fill in the **Location Code** field on the **General** FastTab. When you retrieve source document lines, some of the information is copied to each line.

    For a location that requires bins, fill in the **Bin Code** field. Depending on your setup, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can add the bin code for you. Learn more at [Zone and bin codes](warehouse-how-receive-items.md#zone-and-bin-codes).  

3. You can get source document in two ways:

    1. Choose the **Get Source Documents** action. The **Source Documents - Inbound** page opens. Here you can select one or more source documents released to warehouse that requires receipt.
    2. Choose the **Use Filters to Get Src. Docs.** action. The **Filters to Get Source Docs. - Inbound** page opens. Here you can select Source Document Filter and run it. All released source document lines that meet the filter criteria are added on the **Warehouse Receipt** page. Learn more at [How to Use Filters to Get Source Documents](warehouse-how-receive-items.md#how-to-use-filters-to-get-source-documents).

4. Set the quantity to receive.

    The **Qty. to Receive** field contains the quantity outstanding for each line, but you can change the quantity as needed. 

    To set the value in the **Qty. to Receive** field on all lines to zero, choose the **Delete Qty. to Receive** action. For example, setting the quantities to zero is useful if you're using a barcode scanner to update the received quantities. To add the outstanding quantities from the source document again, choose the **Autofill Qty. to Receive** action.  

    On a warehouse receipt document where the received quantity is higher than ordered, enter the quantity received in the **Qty. to Receive** field. If the increase is within the tolerance specified by an assigned over-receipt code, the **Over-Receipt Quantity** field updates to show the quantity by which the value in the **Quantity** field is exceeded. If the increase is over the tolerance, the over-receipt isn't allowed.

5. Post the warehouse receipt. The quantity fields are updated on the source documents, and the items are added to inventory.  

    [!INCLUDE [preview-posting-shipment](includes/preview-posting-shipment.md)]

    > [!TIP]
    > If you use warehouse put-aways (method D in the table in the beginning of this article), the items are received. However, you can't pick them until they're put away. To learn more about putting away items, go to [Put Items Away with Warehouse Put-aways](warehouse-how-to-put-items-away-with-warehouse-put-aways.md).
    >
    > Otherwise, consider using the **Post and Print** action. The action posts the receipt and prints it as a put-away instruction that shows where to put the item.

    > [!NOTE]  
    > If your warehouse uses cross-docking, you can check whether you can cross-dock items without putting them away. To learn more about cross-docking, go to [Cross-Dock Items](warehouse-how-to-cross-dock-items.md).

## How to use filters to get source documents

From a warehouse receipt, you can use the **Filters to Get Source Docs.** page to retrieve the released source document lines that specify the items to receive.

1. In the warehouse receipt, choose the **Use Filters to Get Src. Docs.** action.
2. To set up a new filter, enter a descriptive code in the **Code** field, then choose the **Modify** action.

    The **Source Document Filter Card - Inbound** page appears.

3. Use the filters to define the type of source document lines to retrieve. For example, you can select types of source documents, such as purchase or transfer orders.
4. Choose **Run**.  

All released source document lines that meet the filter criteria are added on the **Warehouse Receipt** page on which you activated the filters.

You can make an unlimited number of filter combinations. Filters are saved on the **Filters to Get Source Docs.** page, and they're available the next time you need them. You can change the criteria at any time by choosing the **Modify** action.

## Zone and bin codes

To receive items with warehouse class codes other than the class code of the bin in the **Bin Code** field on the document header, clear the **Bin Code** field on the header before you retrieve source document lines for the items.  
<!-- TBD, table with comparison of various options-->

If bins are mandatory for a location, zone and bin codes are added to warehouse receipt documents as follows:

* For advanced configurations that use directed put-away and pick, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses the receipt bin code from the **Location Card** page for the location. If a receipt bin code isn't specified, no bin is specified. If the item and receipt bins don't match, the receipt bin code is blank.
* In other configurations, if a receipt bin code isn't specified, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses the bin code from the source document.

# Record Special Purchase Prices and Discounts

> [!NOTE]
> In 2020 release wave 2 we released streamlined processes for setting up and managing prices and discounts. If you're a new customer using that version, you're using the new experience. If you're an existing customer, whether you are using the new experience depends on whether your administrator has enabled the **New sales pricing experience** feature update in **Feature Management**. For more information, see [Enabling Upcoming Features Ahead of Time](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/feature-management).

The different price and discount agreements that apply when you buy from different vendors must be defined so that the agreed rules and values are applied to purchase documents that you create for the vendors.

When you have recorded special prices and line discounts for sales and purchases, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] ensures that your profit on item trade is always optimal by automatically calculating the best price on sales and purchase documents and on project and item journal lines. For more information, see [Best Price Calculation](purchasing-how-record-purchase-price-discount-payment-agreements.md#best-price-calculation).

Concerning prices, you can have a special purchase price inserted on purchase lines if a certain combination of vendor, item, minimum quantity, unit of measure, or starting/ending date exists.

Concerning discounts, you can set up and use two types of purchase discounts:

| Discount Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Purchase Line Discount** |An amount discount that is inserted on purchase lines if a certain combination of vendor, item, minimum quantity, unit of measure, or starting/ending date exists. This type works in the same way as for purchase prices. |
| **Invoice Discount** |A percentage discount that is subtracted from the document total if the value amount of all lines on a purchase document exceeds a certain minimum. |

Because purchase line discounts and purchase prices are based on a combination of item and vendor, you can also enter this configuration from the item card, where the rules and values are defined. For more information, see [Register New Items](inventory-how-register-new-items.md).

## To set up a special purchase price for a vendor

#### [Current Experience](#tab/current-experience)

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Vendors**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the relevant vendor card, and then choose the **Prices** action.
3. Fill in the fields on the line as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
4. Fill a line for each combination for which the vendor grants you a purchase line discount.

#### [New Experience](#tab/new-experience)

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Vendors**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the vendor, and then choose the **Sales Price Lists** action.
3. Choose **New** to create a new purchase price list.
4. On the **General** and **Tax** FastTabs, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
5. To add items to the list, do one of the following:
   * To add many items, choose **Suggest Lines**, and then enter filter criteria to specify the types of items to add. Optionally, you can also enter some additional settings for the items that are specific to the price list. You can change these later, if needed.
   * To copy items from another price list, choose **Copy Lines**, and then choose the price list to copy.
   * To add items manually, in the grid, in the **Product Type** field, choose the type of product that the price list is for. Depending on your selection, fill in the remaining fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
6. To start using the price list, in the **Status** field, choose **Active**.

## To set up a line discount for a vendor

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Vendors**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the relevant vendor card, and then choose the **Line Discounts** action.

   The **Vendor No.** field is prefilled with the vendor number.
3. Fill in the fields on the line as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
4. Fill a line for each combination for which the vendor grants you a purchase line discount.

## To set up an invoice discount for a vendor

When your vendors have informed you which invoice discounts they grant, enter the invoice discount code on the vendor cards and set up the terms for each code.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Vendors**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the vendor card for a vendor that will be eligible for invoice discounts.
3. In the **Invoice Disc. Code** field, select a code for the relevant invoice discount terms to use to calculate invoice discounts for the vendor.

    > [!NOTE]  
    > Invoice discount codes are represented by existing vendor cards. This enables you to quickly assign invoice discount terms to vendors by picking the name of another vendors who will have the same terms.

    Proceed to set up new the purchase invoice discount terms.
4. On the **Vendor Card** page, choose the **Invoice Discounts** action. The **Vend. Invoice Discounts** page opens.
5. In the **Currency Code** field, enter the code for a currency that the invoice discount terms on the line applies to. Leave the field blank to set up invoice discount terms in USD.
6. In the **Minimum Amount** field, enter the minimum amount that an invoice must have to be eligible for the discount.
7. In the **Discount %** field, enter the invoice discount as a percentage of the invoice amount.
8. Repeat steps 5 through 7 for each currency that the vendor will receive a different invoice discount for.

The invoice discount is now set up and assigned to the vendor in question. When you select the vendor code in the **Invoice Disc. Code** field on other vendor cards, the same invoice discount is assigned to those vendors.

## To choose a principle for posting purchase discounts

When you post a purchase invoice that includes one or more discounts, you can choose between two principles for posting discount amounts. You can post discounts separately or you can subtract discounts from invoice discounts.  

Before you can do this, you must have already set up the necessary accounts for posting discount amounts in the chart of accounts. You must also check that you have entered the correct account numbers in the general posting setup in the **Purch. Line Disc. Account** and **Purch. Inv. Disc. Account** fields.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchases & Payables Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. In the **Discount Posting** field, choose one of the following principles for posting discounts.

|**Discount Posting Principle**|**Invoice Discount**|**Line Discount**|  
|------------------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------|  
|**All Discounts**|Posted separately|Posted separately|  
|**Invoice Discounts**|Posted separately|Subtracted|  
|**Line Discounts**|Subtracted|Posted separately|  
|**No Discounts**|Subtracted|Subtracted|  

## Purchase invoice discounts and service charges

If you have fixed terms for invoice discounts with any vendors, you can enter them for those vendors. Then the discount will be calculated when you fill in a purchase invoice.  

Before you can use invoice discounts with purchases, you must specify the vendors that offer you the discounts.  

You link discount percentages to specific invoice amounts in **Vend. Invoice Discounts** pages. You can enter any number of percentages in each page. Each vendor can have its own page, or you can link several vendors to the same page.  

In addition to a discount percentage, you can link a service charge amount to a specific invoice amount.  

You can define the terms of the invoice discount in LCY for domestic vendors and in foreign currency for foreign vendors.  

You can choose to have [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically calculate the invoice discounts for quotes, blanket orders, orders, invoices, or credit memos.  

> [!TIP]  
> Before you enter this information, it is a good idea to prepare an outline of the discount structure that you want to use. This makes it easier to see which vendors can be linked to the same invoice discount page. The fewer pages that you have to set up, the faster that you can enter the basic information.

## Best price calculation

When you have recorded special prices and line discounts for sales and purchases, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] ensures that your profit on item trade is always optimal by automatically calculating the best price on sales and purchase documents and on project and item journal lines.

The best price is the lowest permissible price with the highest permissible line discount on a given date. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically calculates this price when it inserts the unit price and the line discount percentage for items on new document and journal lines.

> [!NOTE]  
> The following describes how the best price is calculated for sales. The calculation is the same for purchases.

1. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] checks the combination of the bill-to customer and the item and then calculates the applicable unit price and line discount percentage, using the following criteria:

    - Does the customer have a price/discount agreement, or does the customer belong to a group that does?
    - Is the item or the item discount group on the line included in any of these price/discount agreements?
    - Is the order date (or the posting date for the invoice and credit memo) within the starting and ending date of the price/discount agreement?
    - Is a unit of measure code specified? If so, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] checks for prices/discounts with the same unit of measure code, and prices/discounts with no unit of measure code.

2. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] checks if any price/discount agreements apply to information on the document or journal line, and then inserts the applicable unit price and line discount percentage, using the following criteria:

    - Is there a minimum quantity requirement in the price/discount agreement that is fulfilled?
    - Is there a currency requirement in the price/discount agreement that is fulfilled? If so, the lowest price and the highest line discount for that currency are inserted, even if LCY would provide a better price. If there is no price/discount agreement for the specified currency code, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] inserts the lowest price and the highest line discount in LCY.

If no special price can be calculated for the item on the line, then either the last direct cost or the unit price from the item card is inserted.

# Purchase items for a sale by creating purchase invoices

From sales orders and sales invoices, you can use functions to quickly create purchase documents for missing item quantities that are required by the sale. You can use two different functions depending on the document type.

> [!Note]
> This functionality is for replenishing sales items into your own inventory. To purchase items for direct delivery from your vendor to your customer, you must create a drop shipment. For more information, see [Make Drop Shipments](sales-how-drop-shipment.md).   

|Function|Description|
|--------|-----------|
|**Create Purchase Orders**|From a sales order, this function creates a purchase order for each vendor of items on the sales order. You can edit the purchase quantity before you create the purchase orders. Only unavailable sales quantities are suggested.
|**Create Purchase Invoice**|From a sales order and from a sales invoice, this function creates a purchase invoice for a selected vendor for all lines or selected lines on the sales document. The full sales quantity is suggested.|

## To create one or more purchase orders from a sales order
To create a purchase order for each unavailable item quantity on the sales order, you use the **Create Purchase Orders** function.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Orders**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open a sales order that you want to purchase items for.
3. Choose the **Create Purchase Orders** action.

    The **Create Purchase Orders** page opens showing a line for each different item on the sales order. Lines for both fully available sales quantities and unavailable sales quantities (grayed) are shown by default. You can choose the **Show Unavailable** action to only see lines for unavailable sales quantities.

    The **Quantity to Purchase** field contains the unavailable sales quantity by default.
4. To purchase another quantity than the unavailable sales quantity, edit the value in the **Quantity to Purchase** field.

    > [!NOTE]  
    >   You can also change the **Quantity to Purchase** field on grayed lines even though they represent fully available sales quantities.
5. Choose the **OK** button.

    A purchase order is created for each vendor of items on the sales order, including any quantity changes that you made on the **Create Purchase Orders** page.
7. Proceed to process the purchase order or orders, for example, by editing or adding purchase order lines. For more information, see [Record Purchases](purchasing-how-record-purchases.md).


## To create a purchase invoice from a sales order or sales invoice
To create a single purchase invoice for one or more lines on a sales document by first selecting which vendor to buy from, you use the **Create Purchase Invoice** function.

> [!NOTE]  
>   This function creates a purchase invoice for the exact item quantity on the selected sales document. To change the purchase quantity, you must edit the purchase invoice after it is created.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Orders**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open a sales invoice that you want to purchase items for.
3. Select one or more sales invoice lines that you want to use on the purchase invoice. To use all the sales invoice lines, select either all of them or don't select any lines.
4. Choose the **Create Purchase Invoice** action.
5. Select either **All Lines** or **Selected Lines**, and then choose the **OK** button.  
6. In the list of vendors that appears, select the vendor that you want to buy all the items from, and then choose the **OK** button.

    A purchase invoice is created that contains one, more than one, or all the lines on the sales invoice.
7. Proceed to process the purchase invoice, for example, by editing or adding purchase invoice lines. For more information, see [Record Purchases](purchasing-how-record-purchases.md).

# Integrate with Microsoft Dynamics 365 Field Service

Service organizations require a front-to-back application in which finance, inventory, and procurement are tightly coupled with service delivery. They generate financial data with every transaction. Every work order represents cost and revenue, and every resource generates profit and loss. Customer interactions add entries on the general ledger. The integration between [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] streamlines the end-to-end process of managing service operations and ensures a smooth flow of information between the two systems.  

You can easily create and manage work orders in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)], track the progress of service tasks, assign resources, and capture consumption details. When you complete a work order in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)], the integration enables the smooth transfer of data to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] for further processing.  

The integration also facilitates the invoicing and fulfillment of work orders in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. You can generate accurate invoices based on the service activities and the consumption recorded in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)].  

By integrating [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)], you don't have to enter data manually or duplicate efforts. Integration also provides a comprehensive view of service operations and finances, enabling better decision-making and operational efficiency.

## Prerequisites

Because [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] is built on top of Dynamics 365 Sales, you must [set up a connection to Dataverse](/dynamics365/business-central/admin-how-to-set-up-a-dynamics-crm-connection#to-use-the-dataverse-connection-setup-assisted-setup-guide) and [enable integration to Dynamics 365 Sales](/dynamics365/business-central/admin-prepare-dynamics-365-for-sales-for-integration#connection-settings-in-the-setup-guide).

You must download the following apps from AppSource, and install them in your [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] environment:

- [Field Service Integration](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2277917)
- [Business Central Virtual Table](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2304910)

> [!NOTE]
> The [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Virtual Table app is optional. You only need it if you want to view information about item availability from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)]. To learn more, go to [View item availability in Business Central from Field Service](#view-item-availability-in-business-central-from-field-service).

### Permissions and security roles for user accounts

When you install the Integration Solution, permissions for the integration user account are configured. If those permissions change, you might need to reset them. To do that, reinstall the Integration Solution from the **Dynamics 365 Connection Setup** page by choosing **Redeploy Integration Solution**. The following sections list the permissions and security roles that the solution deploys for each app.

#### Sales

- Dynamics 365 [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Integration Administrator
- Dynamics 365 [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Integration User
- Dynamics 365 [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Product Availability User

#### Business Central

Users who post project journals must have the following permission set:

- Dynamics 365 Sales Integration

#### Field Service

To use the integrated data, users must have the following security role:

- Business Central Field Service Integration

For example, users must have this role to connect work orders to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] for processing.

> [!NOTE]
> Ensure that users are assigned to the standard security roles and profiles in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)].  
>
> To learn more about column security profiles in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)], go to [Field Service security roles](/dynamics365/field-service/users-licenses-permissions#field-service-security-roles).
>
> Administrators must add one of the appropriate column security profiles to users in Power Platform. To learn more, go to [Add teams or users to a column security profile to control access](/power-platform/admin/add-teams-users-field-security-profile).

> [!NOTE]
> To use the **Open in Business Central** action in Sales, you must have the following privileges for the following tables:
>
> - You must have **Read** permissions for the **Dynamics 365 Business Central Connection** (nav_connection) table.
> - You must have **Read**, **Write**, and **Delete** permissions for the **Default Dynamics 365 Business Central Connection** (nav_defaultconnection) table.

### Other settings in Field Service

On the **Field Service Setting** page, make the following changes:

- On the **Purchase** tab, clear the **Use of Products Out of Stock** field. Otherwise, you might get an "out of stock" warning when you choose a product that's out of stock in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)], but is in stock in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].
- On the **Work Order / Booking** tab, turn off the **Calculate Price** and **Calculate Cost** toggles. In the **Work Order Invoice Creation** field, choose **Never**.

> [!NOTE]
> Setting up a connection to [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] removes the coupling between resources and products. To make [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] items available in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)], update the **Field Service Product Type** field to match the **Type** field on the items in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. To learn more, go to [Create a product or service](/dynamics365/field-service/create-product-or-service#create-a-product-or-service).

## Set up the integration in Business Central

After you have a connection to Dataverse and Sales, you can set up your integration to [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)].

1. Download and install the **Field Service Integration** app from [AppSource](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2277917). Afterward, on the **Extension Management** page, find the Field Service Integration app, and choose the **Set up** action to run the assisted setup guide.
2. On the **Assisted Setup** page in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], choose **Set up integration to Dynamics 365 Field Service** to run the assisted setup guide.

This section describes the key settings in the guide.

Optionally, if you want to enable technicians to view information about item availability from work orders, choose the **Install Business Central Virtual Table app** link.

To let people post consumption of items and services in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] work orders, specify the **Project Journal Template** and **Project Journal Batch** to use to post consumption of products and services.

Because services are expressed in duration in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)], specify the **Hours Unit of Measure** to use to convert durations to quantities in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

You can also specify when work order products and service lines synchronize to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For example, they might synchronize when work order lines are used, or when someone completes a work order. Choose the appropriate option in the **Synchronize work order products/services** field.

After work order products and services synchronize to project journals in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can choose whether to post the project journals manually. Choose the appropriate option in the **Automatically post project journals lines** field:

- When a work order is complete
- When work order products or services are used

After you finish the setup, run a full synchronization from the **Dynamics 365 Field Service Integration Setup** page. This action synchronizes table mappings for things like:

- Project tasks for projects with the **Apply Usage Link** set. This synchronization makes [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] projects available for selection in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)].
- Resources that aren't blocked, don't have **Use Time Sheet** selected, and do have **Hours** specified as the unit of measure on the **Dynamics 365 Field Service Integration Setup** page.
- Service items (requires that you're using the Premium experience in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]).

## Integration table mappings for synchronization

The basis of synchronizing data is mapping the tables and fields in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with tables and columns in Dataverse, so they can exchange the data. Mapping happens through integration tables. To learn more about table mappings, go to [Mapping the Tables and Fields to Synchronize](/dynamics365/business-central/admin-how-to-modify-table-mappings-for-synchronization).

The following integration table mappings install if you choose the **Project (default)** integration type.

|Integration table mapping  |Data the mapping synchronizes  |
|---------|---------|
|**PJLINE-WORDERPRODUCT** | Maps work order products in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] to project journal lines in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  |
|**PJLINE-WORDERSERVICE** |  Maps work order services in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] to project journal lines in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  |
|**PROJECTTASK** |  Maps projects and project tasks in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to products in external projects in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)].  |
|**RESOURCE-BOOKABLERSC**  | Maps resources in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to bookable resources in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)].  |
|**SVCITEM-CUSTASSET**     | (Premium Experience only) Maps service items in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to customer assets in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)].        |
|**LOCATIONS**     |  Maps locations in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to warehouses in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)]. <br><br> **Note:** The **LOCATIONS** integration table mapping is available only if you turn on the **Location Mandatory** toggle on the **Inventory Setup** page.      |

In addition to those, the following integration table mappings install if you choose the **Project and Service** integration type.

|Integration table mapping  |Data the mapping synchronizes  |
|---------|---------|
|**SRVORDER**| Maps service orders in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to work orders in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)], including the status of the orders. |
|**SRVORDERITEMLINE**| Maps service item lines in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to work order incidents in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)].|
|**SRVORDERLINE-ITEM**| Maps items on service order lines in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with work order products in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)]. |
|**SRVORDERLINE-RESOURCE**| Maps resources on service order lines in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with bookable resource booking in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)].|
|**SRVORDERLINE-SERVICE**|Maps service lines in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with work order services in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)]. |
|**SRVORDERTYPE**| Maps service order types in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to work order types in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)].|
|**SVCITEM-CUSTASSET**|Maps service items in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with customer assets in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)].|

> [!NOTE]
> The integration also maps fields that show item availability information in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on work orders and products in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)]. However, the mapping happens through a virtual table, and not an integration table. Some setup is required. To learn more about virtual tables and viewing item availability, go to [View item availability in Business Central from Field Service](#view-item-availability-in-business-central-from-field-service).

### Synchronize location and warehouse data

You can integrate [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] warehouses with locations in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The integration gives technicians information about the availability of a product or item at a specific location.

The data synchronizes through a unidirectional (from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]) integration table mapping between locations in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and warehouses in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)]. To use the integration table mapping, you must turn on the **Location Mandatory** toggle on the **Inventory Setup** page in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] .

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] synchronizes locations with the following settings on the **Location Card** page:

- The **Use as In-Transit** toggle is turned off.
- **Project Consump. Whse. Handling** is different from Warehouse Pick (mandatory)
- **Assm. Consump. Whse. Handling** is different from Warehouse Pick (mandatory)

In [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], on the **Locations** and **Location Card** page, you can use the **Warehouse** action to open a coupled location in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)], synchronize it, set up and delete couplings, and view synchronization logs.

### View item availability in Business Central from Field Service

When technicians prepare work orders, it's helpful that they can be sure that the items they need to do the work are available. This section describes how to let people view item availability information from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)].

The first thing to do is to install the [Business Central Virtual Table](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2277917) app from AppSource.

Afterward, on the **Dynamics 365 Field Service Integration Setup** or **Set up integration to Dynamics 365 Field Service** pages in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], turn on the **Enable Inventory Availability by Location** toggle. When you enable inventory availability by location, a **dyn365bc_availabilitybylocation_v2_0** virtual table becomes available. You must create a synthetic relation between the following tables:

- The native **Product** and **Work Order Product** tables in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] and the **Item Availability** virtual table that shows item availability. 

There's an assisted setup guide to help you create the synthetic relation.

To create the synthetic relation, follow these steps:

1. In [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], on the **Dataverse Connection Setup** page, use the **Synthetic Relations** action
1. On the **Synthetic Relations** page, choose the **New** action to start the **New Synthetic Relation** assisted setup guide.
1. In the **Native Dataverse Table** field, choose the :::image type="content" source="media/assist-edit-icon.png" alt-text="The AssistEdit icon."::: button, and then choose **CRM Product**.
1. In the **Virtual Dataverse Table** field, choose the :::image type="content" source="media/assist-edit-icon.png" alt-text="The AssistEdit icon."::: button, and then choose **Inventory Availability by Location**.
1. On the **Synthetic Relations** page, choose the **New** action to start the **New Synthetic Relation** assisted setup guide again.
1. In the **Native Dataverse Table** field, choose the :::image type="content" source="media/assist-edit-icon.png" alt-text="The AssistEdit icon."::: button, and then choose **FS Work Order Product**.
1. In the **Virtual Dataverse Table** field, choose the :::image type="content" source="media/assist-edit-icon.png" alt-text="The AssistEdit icon."::: button, and then choose **Inventory Availability by Location**.
1. Choose **Next**.
1. In the **Field in the FS Work Order Product table** field, choose **Product Id**.
1. In the **Field in the Item Availability by Location table** field, choose **itemNo**.
1. Choose **Finish** to complete the guide.
1. To make your setup available in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)], in the **Power Apps admin center**, choose the view, and then choose the **Save and Publish** action.

> [!NOTE]
> It can take a few moments to create the synthetic relations.

To learn more about virtual tables and synthetic relationships, go to [Use virtual tables to get more data](admin-synchronizing-business-central-and-sales.md#use-virtual-tables-to-get-more-data).  

The next thing to do is to create and customize the associated view that people use in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] to check the inventory of products.

To create the view, follow these steps:

1. In **Power Apps admin center**, on the navigation pane, choose **Tables**.
1. Choose the **Item Availability by Location** table.
1. In the **Data experiences** part, choose **Views**.
1. Choose the **View column** action, and then choose the columns you want the view to include. The following columns are typical choices:

    - **Location Code** shows where the product is available.
    - **Item No.** confirms you're looking at the correct product.
    - **Item Description** provides information about the product.
    - **Unit of Measure Code** gives you an idea of the space you need.
    - **Remaining Quantity** shows how much of the product is available at each location.

### Integrate service management features

Integrating [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] lets you manage service tasks, consumption, and financial transactions to benefit service technicians, service managers, and finance teams. It's a powerful solution for managing work orders and consumption in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] and efficiently invoicing and fulfilling them in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The integration is bi-directional, meaning that when you enter or change data in either app, the data updates in the other.

> [!NOTE]
> When you enable the integration with service management features, you also enable the integration with projects. You can't enable only the service management integration.

#### Set up the integration with service management features

You must have a **Premium** license. When you do, on the **Company Information** page in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], set the **User Experience** field to **Premium**.

You can enable the integration in the **Integration Type** field by selecting **Project and Service** in the following places:

- In the **Set up integration to Dynamics 365 Field Service** assisted setup guide.
- On the **Dynamics 365 Field Service Integration Setup** page.

When the **Integration Type** field is set to **Project and Service**, the following things happen when you enable the integration:

- Creates a solution in Power Apps named **Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central Field Service Integration (service)**.
- Adds integration table mappings for service order types, service documents, service lines, and service item lines. To learn more about the table mappings, go to [Integration table mappings for synchronization](#integration-table-mappings-for-synchronization).
- Fields in the headers on service orders and work orders transfer information, such as the **Service Account**, **Billing Account**, and **Work Order Type**.
- **Service Item Lines** and **Work Order Incidents** in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] transfer information about the customer assets being repaired.
- **Service Line** fields and **Work Order Products** and **Work Order Services** fields, such as **Qty. to Ship**, **Qty. to Invoice**, and **Qty. to Consume**.

In [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], make the following settings on the **Service Management Setup** page:

- Turn on the **Service Order Type Mandatory** toggle. This setting is required because [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] requires a work order type.
- Make sure that the number series you use for service orders is set up to allow manual numbering. On the **No. Series** page, select the **Manual Nos.** checkbox for the number series. Manual numbering lets you create work orders in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] and synchronize them with service orders. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses the order number from [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)].
- Turn off the **One Service Item Line/Order** toggle. This setting lets you have more than one work item line.
- Turn on the **Archive Orders** toggle.
- Make the **Service Order Type** field on service orders mandatory because the **Work Order Type** is mandatory on [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] work orders.

If you choose **Enable Inventory Availability by Location** when you set up the integration, you can view the allocated product quantity from work orders in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] as part of the gross requirements in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]'s inventory availability calculation. Demand generated by orders in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] automatically becomes input for planning through synchronized service orders.

As service or work orders progress toward completion, their status changes. The following table shows how the statues align in both apps.

|[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] status  |[!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] status  | Alignment |
|---------|-----------|---------|
|Pending  |Unscheduled| Bidirectional per mapping to account for item demand. |
|Pending  |Scheduled  | [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Synchronizes the quantity to ship and the quantity to invoice.|
|In process | In progress | [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Synchronizes the quantity to ship and the quantity to invoice. |
|Finished | Completed     | [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Ready for posting in Business Central. |
|Finished | Posted        | [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. When fully invoiced or deleted after partial invoicing in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].|
|N/A     | Canceled      | Not synchronized. Manual alignment is needed for canceled work orders. |

### Upgrade your integration to include service management features

If you set up the integration to only include projects, but decide to add service management features later, that's easy to do in just a few steps. Remember that you must have a Premium license though.

1. On the **Dynamics 365 Field Service Integration Setup** page, turn off the **Enabled** toggle.
1. In the **Integration Type** field, choose **Project and Service**.
1. Turn on the **Enabled** toggle.

## Use data in both applications

The following sections describe the features where you can use the data that comes from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)].

### Field Service

You can [create work orders](/dynamics365/field-service/create-work-order) using the **Service Account** and **Billing Account** from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. On work orders, you must select the **Business Central Project Task** in the **External Project** field. Selecting a project lets you synchronize work order products and services to the appropriate project task in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

You can add inventory and noninventory items as **Work Order Products** on work orders and get the quantity on hand and costs and prices from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. To learn more, go to [Create a work order from the work order form and record list](/dynamics365/field-service/create-work-order#create-a-work-order-from-the-work-order-form-and-record-list).

You can add items of the type service as **Work Order Services**, and get costs and prices from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. To learn more, go to [Products and services tab](/dynamics365/field-service/work-order-experience#products-and-services-tab).

> [!NOTE]
> When a product or service's status on a work order changes from **Estimated** to **Used** in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)], they synchronize to project journal lines in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

You can book a resource and relate the **Bookings** to work order services using a **Bookable Resource** from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

You can use the **Open in Business Central** action in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] to open a location that's coupled to a warehouse.

Use the **Open in Business Central** action to open a location that's coupled to a warehouse. On the **Products** page, technicians can check how much of particular product is available at a warehouse they specify.

From the **Work Order** and **Product** pages, you can view where, and how much, of an item is available. On the **Related** menu, choose **Items Availability by Location**.

When you mark a work order product or service as **Used** on a work order with a specific work order type, the lines synchronize to a service order. Consumption is also posted, based on settings on the **Dynamics 365 Field Service Integration Setup** page.

During consumption and invoice posting in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the quantities are updated on the original work order product and work order service lines in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)].

### Business Central

Depending on your settings on the **Field Service Integration Setup** page, when work orders include products and services, consumption information is transferred and posted using a **Project Journal** in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

The **Quantity To Bill** and **Duration To Bill** values are copied to the **Qty- to Transfer to Invoice** field. Based on those values, you can create and post sales invoices in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to invoice the customer. After the invoice is posted and synchronized to the Dynamics 365 Sales environment, or consumption is processed in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the quantity invoiced and quantity consumed display on the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] tab on the **Work Order Product** and **Work Order Service** pages.  

Use the **Project Planning Lines** page to track posting and invoicing of consumption on work orders. From the **Project Planning Lines** page, you can create and post sales invoices in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Afterward, you can synchronize them with [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] and keep track of the status of the invoices.

> [!NOTE]
> Work order services with a booking that uses a bookable resource that's coupled to a [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] resource synchronize to two project journal lines:
>
> - One line of type **Budget** for the coupled resource
> - One line of type **Billable** for the item being serviced
>
> The product that's chosen on the work order service must be coupled to an item of the type **Service** in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Also, the base unit of measure for the item must be set to the **Hours Unit of Measure** that's chosen on the **Dynamics 365 Field Service Integration Setup** page.
>
> You can create an invoice for an item of the type **Service** from the billable project planning line, and use the budget project planning line to register cost with the resource.

Use the **Locations in Field Service** action on the **Locations** and **Location Card** pages to open a coupled location in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)], synchronize it, set up and delete couplings, and view synchronization logs. You can view the allocated product quantity from work orders in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] as part of the gross requirements in Business Central's inventory availability calculation. Demand generated by orders in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] automatically become an input for planning.

# Allocated Hours (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Allocated Hours** report gives an overview of the allocated time, in hours, for each work center. The view of allocated hours can help you identify over and underused work centers. Additionally, the report includes indicators such as the load percentage, allocated time (hours), and capacity available (hours) for a quick summary of resource use.

:::image type="content" source="media/manufacturing/allocated-hours.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Allocated Hours Power BI Report" lightbox="media/manufacturing/allocated-hours.png":::

## Use the report

Manufacturing managers use the report to plan and allocate resources effectively. The data shows which work centers are over or underutilized, so you can make informed decisions about how to allocate resources.

For example, if you notice that a work center is underused, you can assign more work orders to that center to optimize the use of its resources. Conversely, if a work center is over utilized, you can reallocate work orders or consider adding more resources to that work center.

Manufacturing workers use this report to optimize the use of resources. You can analyze the allocated time in hours of each work center, and then plan your work accordingly.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The *Allocated Hours* report includes the following KPIs and measures: 

- [Load %](manufacturing-powerbi-kpis.md#load)
- [Allocated Time (Hours)](manufacturing-powerbi-kpis.md#allocated-time-hours)
- [Capacity Available (Hours)](manufacturing-powerbi-kpis.md#capacity-available-hours)

# Design Details: Searching for Dimension Combinations
When you close a page after you edit a set of dimensions, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] evaluates whether the edited set of dimensions exists. If the set does not exist, a new set is created and the dimension combination ID is returned.  

## Building Search Tree  
 Table 481 **Dimension Set Tree Node** is used when [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] evaluates whether a set of dimensions already exists in table 480 **Dimension Set Entry** table. The evaluation is performed by recursively traversing the search tree starting at the top level numbered 0. The top level 0 represents a dimension set with no dimension set entries. The children of this dimension set represent dimension sets with only one dimension set entry. The children of these dimension sets represent dimension sets with two children, and so on.  

### Example 1  
 The following diagram represents a search tree with six dimension sets. Only the distinguishing dimension set entry is displayed in the diagram.  

 ![Example of dimension tree structure.](media/nav2013_dimension_tree.png "Example of dimension tree structure")  

 The following table describes a complete list of dimension set entries that make up each dimension set.  

|Dimension Sets|Dimension Set Entries|  
|--------------------|---------------------------|  
|Set 0|None|  
|Set 1|AREA 30|  
|Set 2|AREA 30, DEPT ADM|  
|Set 3|AREA 30, DEPT PROD|  
|Set 4|AREA 30, DEPT ADM, PROJ VW|  
|Set 5|AREA 40|  
|Set 6|AREA 40, PROJ VW|  

### Example 2  
 This example shows how [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] evaluates whether a dimension set that consists of the dimension set entries AREA 40, DEPT PROD exists.  

 First, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] also updates the **Dimension Set Tree Node** table to make sure that the search tree looks like the following diagram. Thus dimension set 7 becomes a child of the dimension set 5.  

 ![Example of dimension tree structure in NAV 2013.](media/nav2013_dimension_tree_example2.png "Example of dimension tree structure in NAV 2013")  

### Finding Dimension Set ID  
 At a conceptual level, **Parent ID**, **Dimension**, and **Dimension Value**, in the search tree, are combined and used as the primary key because [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] traverses the tree in the same order as the dimension entries. The GET function (record) is used to search for dimension set ID. The following code example shows how to find the dimension set ID when there are three dimension values.  

```  
DimSet."Parent ID" := 0;  // 'root'  
IF UserDim.FINDSET THEN  
  REPEAT  
      DimSet.GET(DimSet."Parent ID",UserDim.DimCode,UserDim.DimValueCode);  
  UNTIL UserDim.NEXT = 0;  
EXIT(DimSet.ID);  

```  

However, to preserve the ability of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to rename both a dimension and a dimension value, table 349, **Dimension Value**, is extended with an integer field, **Dimension Value ID**. This table converts the field pair, **Dimension** and **Dimension Value**, to an integer value. When you rename the dimension and dimension value, the integer value is not changed.  

```  
DimSet."Parent ID" := 0;  // 'root'  
IF UserDim.FINDSET THEN  
  REPEAT  
      DimSet.GET(DimSet.ParentID,UserDim."Dimension Value ID");  
  UNTIL UserDim.NEXT = 0;  
EXIT(DimSet.ID);  

```

# Set Up the AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals extension
A global provider of services to convert payment information to any data format that your bank requires is connected and ready to be enabled in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. This is referred to in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] as the AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals extension.

You can export payment lines from the **Payment Journal** page to a file or a data stream that you then upload to your bank for automatic processing so that you do not have to make electronic payments individually. For more information, see [Export Payments to a Bank File](finance-make-payments-with-bank-data-conversion-service-or-sepa-credit-transfer.md#exporting-payments-to-a-bank-file).

You can import bank statement files into the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page by using the AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals extension to convert a file that you receive from your bank to a data stream that [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can import. For more information, see [Applying Payments Automatically and Reconciling Bank Accounts](receivables-apply-payments-auto-reconcile-bank-accounts.md).

As an alternative to importing bank statements with the AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals extension, you can use the Envestnet Yodlee Bank Feeds service. For more information, see [Set Up the Envestnet Yodlee Bank Feeds Service](bank-how-setup-bank-statement-service.md).

To import or export bank files, you must set up your own bank account and your vendors' bank accounts. For more information, see [Set Up Bank Accounts](bank-how-setup-bank-accounts.md).

> [!NOTE]  
> The AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals extension may impose a limit on the number of lines that can be exported in one file. You will receive an error message if the limit is exceeded. It is recommended that bank statement files do not exceed 1000 lines as the processing time in the AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals extension may otherwise increase significantly.

# Make check payments

You can issue electronic and manual checks in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Both methods use the payment journal to issue checks to vendors. You can also void checks and view check ledger entries.

The following procedure shows how to pay a vendor with a computer checks by:

- Applying the payment to the relevant vendor invoice.
- Printing the check.
- Posting the payment as paid.

These steps result in positive vendor ledger entries that are applied to negative bank ledger entries, and physical checks for processing in the bank.

You can pay with two types of checks. For both types, the **Bal. Account Type** or the **Account Type** field must contain **Bank Account**.

- **Computer Check**: Select this option if you want to print a check for the amount on the payment journal line. You must print the checks before you can post the journal lines.
- **Manual Check**: Select this option if you have created a check manually and want to create a corresponding check ledger entry for this amount. By using this option, you can't print the check.

> [!NOTE]  
> To make sure that your bank only clears validated checks and amounts, you can send them a file that contains vendor, check, and payment information. To learn more, go to [Export a Positive Pay file](finance-how-positive-pay.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Your printer must be correctly set up with the check forms, and you must define which check layout to use. To learn more, go to [Select a Check Layout](finance-how-define-check-layouts.md). Alternatively, you can send the check as a PDF file, for example.  

You can print up to 10 invoices on a page for a check stub. If a check applies to more than 10 invoices, when you print the stub we void the check on the first page and print the word VOID on the check. We then print the remainder of the invoices and the total check amount on the second page.

## To pay a vendor invoice with a check

The following describes how to pay a vendor by check. The steps are similar to refund a customer by check.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Payment Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. Fill in the payment journal lines. To learn more, go to [Record Payments and Refunds](payables-how-post-payments-refunds.md).
3. In the **Payment Method Code** field, select **Check**.
4. Choose the **Print Check** action.
5. On the **Check** page, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
6. If your printer is set up to print checks, choose the **Print** button. Otherwise, choose the **Send to** button, select the **PDF Document** option, choose the **OK** button, and then print the PDF document.

    You can now send the physical checks to the vendors.
7. Choose the **Post** action.

    The payment is applied to the vendor and paid. Fully applied vendor ledger entries and bank ledger entries are created.

> [!NOTE]  
> If you want to print and pay checks in more than one currency from different bank accounts, you must run the **Print Check** batch job separately for each currency and specify the appropriate bank account.

## To cancel printed checks that aren't posted

You can cancel non-posted checks after they have been printed by using the **Void Check** action on the **Payment Journal** page.

1. On the **Payment Journal** page, choose the **Void Check**, and then choose which checks to cancel.

## To void checks

After you post a check payment, you can only cancel (void) a check from the resulting bank ledger entries.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If the check is applied to an invoice, unapply the payment first so that the invoice can be repaid. To learn more, go to [To unapply an application of vendor entries](payables-how-apply-purchase-transactions-manually.md#to-unapply-an-application-of-vendor-entries). The steps are the same for customers. After you unapply the payment, void the check. If the check was printed but didn't pay an invoice, then choose **Void Check Only** as described in this section.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Bank Accounts**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the relevant bank account, and then choose the **Check Ledger Entries** action.
3. On the **Check Ledger Entries** page, choose the **Void Check** action.
4. Select the **Void Check Only** checkbox.
5. Choose the **OK** button.

## To view a summary of posted checks

If you want to review posted checks, for example to verify multiple checks paid to one vendor, you can use the **Bank Account - Check Details** report.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Bank Account - Check Details**, and then choose the related link.
2. Set filters as relevant, and then choose the **Preview** button.

# Use non-deductible VAT

This article explains how to use and report non-deductible VAT.

## Create a purchase invoice with non-deductible VAT

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 3.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Invoices**, and then select the related link.
2. Select **New** to create a purchase invoice, and enter the appropriate information on the invoice header.
3. In the **Lines** section, create a new line of any type, based on the VAT business posting group and the VAT product posting group where you configure non-deductible VAT.
4. In the **Quantity** and **Direct Unit Cost** fields, enter appropriate values.

    If you selected the **Show Non-Ded. VAT In Lines** checkbox on the **VAT Setup** page, the amounts in the **Non-Deductible VAT Base** and **Non-Deductible VAT Amount** fields are calculated based on the **Non-Deductible VAT %** field on the **VAT Posting Setup** page.

5. Post the invoice.

## Create a purchase order with non-deductible VAT

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 3.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Orders** and then select the related link.
2. Select **New** to create a purchase order, and enter the appropriate information on the document header.
3. In the **Lines** section, create a new line of any type, based on the VAT business posting group and the VAT product posting group where you configure non-deductible VAT.
4. In the **Quantity** and **Direct Unit Cost** fields, enter appropriate values.

    If you selected the **Show Non-Ded. VAT In Lines** checkbox on the **VAT Setup** page, the amounts in the **Non-Deductible VAT Base** and **Non-Deductible VAT Amount** fields are calculated based on the **Non-Deductible VAT %** field on the **VAT Posting Setup** page.

5. Post the purchase order.

## Adjust rounded VAT amounts before document posting

If VAT amounts aren't rounded in the same way in your environment and in the external accounting system (the original invoice document), you can adjust the VAT amount before you post the document. To make this adjustment, follow these steps before you post the document.

1. On the Action Pane, select **Statistic**.
2. If you're working with a purchase invoice, follow these steps:

    1. On the **Lines** FastTab, select the VAT amount or non-deductible VAT amount.
    2. Set the values that you need from the original document, and then close the **Purchase Invoice Statistics** page.

3.	If you're working with the purchase order, follow these steps:

    1. On the **Invoicing** FastTab, select **No. of Tax Lines** to open the **VAT Amounts Lines** page.
    2. Select the VAT amount or non-deductible VAT amount that you want to correct.
    3. Enter the values that you need from the original document, close the **VAT Amount lines** page, and then close the **Purchase Order Statistics** page.

To use adjustments of VAT amounts, you must enable the adjustments. On the **General Ledger Setup** page, in the **Max. VAT Difference Allowed** field, enter the maximum allowed VAT amount for correction. Then, on the **Purchases & Payables Setup** page, select **Allow VAT Difference**.

You can adjust the values of the **VAT Amount** and **Non-Deductible VAT Amount** fields. The value of the **Deductible VAT Amount** field is the result of these two values. The amount that you enter in the **Non-Deductible VAT Amount** field can't be more than the amount that you enter in the **VAT Amount** field. The **Max. VAT Difference Allowed** field on the **General Ledger Setup** page works independently for deductible and non-deductible VAT amounts on statistic pages when you want to adjust VAT amounts.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You can't use non-deductible VAT on the prepayment invoices.

> [!NOTE]
> For more information about the Microsoft Fabric release plan, see [aka.ms/FabricRoadmap](https://aka.ms/FabricRoadmap)
> 
> The regular publishing of this roadmap will help you stay informed about how [!INCLUDE[microsoft_fabric](includes/microsoft_fabric.md)] will address your needs.

## Where does [!INCLUDE[microsoft_fabric](includes/microsoft_fabric.md)] fit into [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] analytics

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] comes with many out-of-the-box reports and data analysis capabilities such as financial reporting, open in Excel, and analysis mode on lists and queries. On top of this, it's easy to define Power BI reports that read data from standard and custom APIs, define Power BI metrics scorecards, and embed all of these directly in the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] client. But for customers with more advanced data science or business intelligence scenarios that require richer data engineering or data integration, [!INCLUDE[microsoft_fabric](includes/microsoft_fabric.md)] might be a good option. 

## OneLake

A key part of [!INCLUDE[microsoft_fabric](includes/microsoft_fabric.md)] offering is OneLake. OneLake is a single, unified, logical data lake for the whole organization. You can think of OneLake as the OneDrive for data. It provides you with data lake as a service without having to build it yourself. OneLake comes automatically with every [!INCLUDE[microsoft_fabric](includes/microsoft_fabric.md)] tenant with no infrastructure to manage. All the data, which lands in OneLake, automatically takes part in out-of-the-box data governance such as data lineage, data protection, certification, and catalog integration. It breaks down data silos by enabling different parts of the organization to work independently while still contributing to the same data lake.

[!INCLUDE[microsoft_fabric](includes/microsoft_fabric.md)] items store your data in OneLake in an open file format. For structured tabular data, this format is *delta parquet*. Delta parquet format allows every analytics engine in [!INCLUDE[microsoft_fabric](includes/microsoft_fabric.md)] to access the data from other analytics engines. This way, it allows flexibility for data practitioners to use the tools of your choice.

# Moving Annual Total (MAT) (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Moving Annual Total (MAT)** report calculates total purchases over the last 12 months. It's a rolling calculation where the date is always moving. This report showcases figures for the Moving Annual Total (MAT) and Previous Year Moving Annual Total (PYMAT).

:::image type="content" source="media/purchases/purchases-moving-annual-total.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Moving Annual Total Power BI report" lightbox="media/purchases/purchases-moving-annual-total.png":::

## Use the report

The report is ideal for business leaders and purchasing managers who need to monitor purchase performance in the last 12 months.
  
CEOs can use the report to monitor the overall purchasing performance over the last 12 months. You can analyze the figures for Moving Annual Total (MAT) and Previous Year Moving Annual Total (PYMAT) and identify trends in purchasing amounts in line with the company's growth. If your purchasing amount exceeds your growth rate, you can use this information to develop a strategic plan that focuses on reducing inventory costs or optimizing purchasing budget. The report can also help you identify periods of high purchasing costs and work with purchasing managers to reduce them.

Purchasing managers can use this report to analyze the purchasing data over the last 12 months, and analyze purchase amounts for specific periods. You can identify purchasing performance by analyzing the MAT growth and growth percentage in each month. These measures offer insight into how your team performs during each period. By identifying the areas where purchasing increased, you can take necessary actions to optimize the purchasing process and ensure you're using purchasing budget efficiently.


## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

# Trace item-tracked items

You can see where an item-tracked item was used, including how and when it was received or produced, transferred, sold, consumed, or returned. You can also find all current instances of a specific serial or lot number in the database. You do this by using the Item Tracing and the [Find Entries](ui-find-entries.md) features.  

These features can be useful in quality control when you need to find out which customers received products with a particular lot number or when you need to find out which lot a defective component came from.  

 On the **Item Tracing** page, you can trace forwards and backwards in a sequence of posted inventory transactions for the serial or lot number.  

 On the **Find Entries** page, you can't see the sequence of transactions, but you can see all records of the serial or lot number, both posted entries and open records.  

 The two features can be used in combination by transferring a traced serial or lot number to the **Find Entries** page to finish a complete trace scenario. <!-- For more information, see [Walkthrough: Tracing Serial-Lot Numbers](walkthrough-tracing-serial-lot-numbers.md).   -->

## To trace item-tracked items  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Item Tracing**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  In the filter fields at the top of the page, enter the specific item numbers or a filter on the item numbers that you would like to trace.  
3.  In the **Show Components** field, select whether to also see where the components for the items came from. The following table describes the options.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**No**|Don't show components.|  
    |**Item-tracked Only**|Show only components that have lot or serial numbers.|  
    |**All**|Show all components.|  

4.  In the **Trace Method** field, select the method to use for tracing the item. The following table describes the options.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Usage->Origin**|Trace the item from where it was used to where it came from. For instance, if a manufactured item was sold to a customer, the **Item Tracing** page shows this with the sales shipment line first, which you can then expand to see from which production order it came.|  
    |**Origin->Usage**|Trace the item from where it came into inventory to where it was used. For instance, if a manufactured item was sold to a customer, the **Item Tracing** page shows this with the finished production order first, which you can then expand to see the sale shipment lines where the item was used.|  

5.  Choose the **Trace** action to run the trace.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  Only applied transactions are shown. If you have received the same lot on multiple transactions, the **Item Tracing** page may not show all transactions.   

> [!NOTE]  
>  If additional transaction history under an item tracing line has already been traced by another line above it, then the **Already Traced** check box is selected. To provide a simpler view, such underlying lines are not shown.  
>   
>  To find the item tracing lines where the transaction history has already been traced, choose the **Go to Already Traced** button. The item tracing line in question is selected, and all underlying lines are expanded.  

## To find item-tracked items with Find Entries  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Find Entries**, and then select the related link.  
2. Choose **Search for item references**.
3. In the **Serial No.** and **Lot No.** fields, enter the item tracking numbers that you want to trace.  
4. Choose the **Find** action to find all instances of the serial or lot number in the database.

title: Work with inventory periods
description: You can control the timeframe in which people can post post changes to inventory by defining inventory periods.

# Work with inventory periods

Inventory periods define a period of time in which you can post changes to inventory. An inventory period is defined by the date on which it ends, or the ending date. When you close an inventory period, you can't post any changes to inventory, either expected or invoiced, before this ending date. You can't post any new values to inventory before the ending date. If you have open item entries in the closed period, meaning positive quantities that haven't yet been applied to outbound transactions, you can still apply outbound quantities to these entries, even if the period is closed.  

The following sections describe how to:

* Create inventory periods.  
* Close inventory periods.  
* Reopen inventory periods.  

## To create an inventory period

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Inventory Periods**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Create a new line.  
3. In the **Ending Date** field, enter the last date in the inventory period that you want to define. When the period is closed, you won't be able to post inventory changes before this date.  
4. Enter a descriptive name in the **Name** field. Choose the **OK** button.  

## To close inventory periods

The **Closed** field indicates whether or not the inventory period is closed to inventory value changes. You can't edit this field.  

You can close any inventory period, if the following is true:  

* There are no open outbound item ledger entries, meaning negative inventory, in that period.  
* The cost of all items has been adjusted using the **Adjust Cost – Item Entries** batch job.  

This means that all outbound transaction quantities, such as those from sales orders, outbound transfers, sales invoices, purchase returns, or purchase credit memos, must be applied to existing quantity in inventory.  

### To close an inventory period  

1. Before closing an inventory period, choose the **Adjust Cost – Item Entries** action to ensure that all cost adjustments are posted.

    Run the **Close Inventory Period – Test** report to determine if there are any open outbound item entries within the inventory period or any items whose cost hasn't yet been adjusted.  
2. Choose the **Test Report** action.  

    Run the **Post Inventory Cost to G/L** batch job to ensure that all costs are posted to the general ledger.  
3. Choose the **Post Inventory to G/L** action.  
4. On the **Inventory Periods** page, select the inventory period you want to close.  
5. Choose the **Close Period** action. After the inventory period has been closed, you can't post inventory changes before the ending date. The cost of all items must be adjusted with the **Adjust Cost – Item Entries** batch job before you close the inventory period.  
6. Choose the **Yes** button to confirm that you want to close the period, or choose **No** to cancel the closing.  
7. The inventory period is closed and a confirmation message is displayed when it's finished.  

## Reopening inventory periods  
After you have closed the inventory period, you can't delete the inventory period. You can, however, reopen it, if you would like to allow posting before the ending date of the inventory period. Reopening a period also reopens all inventory periods with ending dates later than the period you reopen.  

### To reopen an inventory period  
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Inventory Periods**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the inventory period you want to reopen.  
3. Choose the **Reopen Period** period action. Confirm that you want to reopen the period.  
4. All inventory periods with ending dates later than the period you selected are reopened.

# Prioritize Vendors

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can suggest various payments to vendors, for example, payments that will be due soon or payments where a discount is available. For more information, see [Suggest Vendor Payments](payables-how-suggest-vendor-payments.md).

First, you must prioritize your vendors by assigning numbers to them.
<br><br>
> [!Video https://learn-video.azurefd.net/vod/player?id=283f5ccb-3cbb-48c5-b50d-fd91466e8094]

## To prioritize vendors

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Vendors**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the relevant vendor, and then choose **Edit**.
3. In the **Priority** field, enter a number.

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] considers the lowest number, except 0, to have the highest priority. So, for example, if you use 1, 2, and 3, then 1 will have the highest priority.

If you do not want to prioritize a vendor, leave the **Priority** field blank. Then, if you use the payment suggestion feature, the vendor will be listed after all the vendors that have a priority number. You can enter as many priority levels as necessary.

# Automate reminders in collections

Make your collections more effective by automating the process of creating, issuing, and sending reminders to your customers. Automation can significantly reduce the time you spend on collections, provide a better overview of the process, and give you full control over each step.

On the **Reminder Automation** page, you define the individual actions (steps). You can combine the steps to create, issue, and send reminders, or you can create a separate automation for each step if that's better for your collection processes. Automations are based on reminder terms and reminder levels. To learn more, go to [Set Up Reminder Terms and Levels](finance-setup-reminders.md). You can set filters for reminder terms for an automation as a whole, and set filters for each action in the automation. You can also attach outstanding invoices to emails as PDF files.

Automation happens through a job queue entry. When you set up an automation, use the **Cadence** field to specify how and when it runs. If you choose **Manual**, the automation runs one time when you use the **Start** action. You can also choose **Weekly**, **Monthly**, or choose **Custom** to set up a more detailed cadence. If you choose **Custom**, you must enter a date formula. To learn more about entering a date formula, go to [Use Date Formulas](ui-enter-date-ranges.md#use-date-formulas). When you choose an option other than **Manual**, the automation runs until you pause it to put it on hold. If you want to be even more specific about when it runs, use the **Job queue entries** action to open the **Job Queue Entries** page and adjust the recurrence, for example to daily or a specific weekday.

## Automate the reminders flow

The following sections describe how to set up reminders to create, issue, and send automatically.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Reminders Automation**, and then choose the related link.
1. Choose **New**, and then fill in the fields on the **General** FastTab.
1. In the **Reminder Terms Filter** field, choose the reminder term or terms to use this automation for.
1. In the **Cadence** field, choose how often the automation runs.
1. On the **Actions** FastTab, choose **New**, and then choose whether the automation creates, issues, or sends reminders. Choose **OK**.
1. Depending on the type of action the automation performs, fill in the fields as necessary on the setup page. To learn more about the settings, go to [Settings for reminder actions](#settings-for-reminder-actions).
1. After you set up the actions for the automation, you can use the **Move up** and **Move down** actions to adjust the order in which they run.

## Settings for reminder actions

The setup settings differ for the Create, Issue, and Send reminder actions. The following sections describe how to use them.

### Create

* Set the highest level on all reminder lines.  
* Create reminders for entries that are on hold. For example, this setting is useful if you're in an ongoing dispute with a customer and want them to see the big picture.
* Create reminders for all unpaid invoices, and not just invoices that are overdue. The report displays overdue invoices and invoices that are unpaid but not overdue in separate sections.
* Set filters to make the reminder more specific.

### Issue

When you issue a reminder, you create entries in the customer ledger that contain the posting date and tax date. Use the settings on the **Issue Reminders Setup** page to specify whether to replace that information on the issued reminder with the information from the created reminder. For example, if you created the reminder yesterday, and issue it today, the due date moves one day.

### Send

> [!NOTE]
> The Send automation requires that you've set up email in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. To learn more about setting up email, go to [Set up email](admin-how-setup-email.md).

The content of the emails, such as attachment texts, email body texts, and language come from the setup for the reminder term. To learn more about email settings, go to [Set Up Reminder Terms and Levels](finance-setup-reminders.md).

Use the settings on the **Send Reminders Setup** page control the following:

* General settings, such as the description, and how many times you send the same reminder.
* Settings for what to include in the reminder.
* Settings for tracking the reminders you send by creating interactions, whether you print or send the reminder by email, and whether you want to attach overdue invoices only, all invoices, or no invoices. 

## Access the history of a reminder

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] keeps track of each time an automation runs. You can access the history by choosing the **Log entries** action. You can also use the **Issued Reminders** action to access a list of the reminders you've issued.

## Handle errors

On the **Actions** FastTab, for each action you can specify whether you want the automation to stop if the action has an error. If you do, the automation won't process the actions that come afterward. To turn this feature on or off, use the **Set stop on error** or **Clear stop on error** actions.

## Change action settings for an automation

You can change settings for an automation at any time. On the **Actions** FastTab, choose **Setup**, and then make your changes.

# Analyzing financial statements in Microsoft Excel (obsolete)

> [!NOTE]
> This feature is deprecated and will be removed in a later [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] release. Learn more in [Deprecated features in the base app](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/upgrade/deprecated-features-w1). Learn more about alternative finance reporting in [Financial analytics overview](bi.md).

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides KPIs and get overviews of your company's finances. The following are examples of ways to analyze KPIs and overviews in Excel:

* Open lists in Excel and analyze the data.
* Export heavy financial statements such as your balance sheet or income statement to Excel, analyze the data, and print the reports.  

> [!TIP]
> By default, the reports you can view in Excel are designed to help you analyze the current year. The Income Statement report is an exception, however. That report lets you filter the data to include previous years in your analyses.

## Get the overview and the details in Excel

In the Business Manager and Accountant Role Centers, the **Reports** action lets you choose the financial statements to view in Excel. When you choose a statement, it will be opened in Excel or Excel Online. An add-in connects the data to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. However, you have to sign in with the same account that you use with [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The following table lists the reports and where they're available.  

|Report  |Role Center  |
|---------|---------|
|Balance Sheet                 | Business Manager, Accountant |
|Income Statement              | Business Manager, Accountant |
|Statement of Cash Flows       | Business Manager, Accountant |
|Statement of Retained Earnings| Business Manager, Accountant |
|Sales Taxes Collected         | Business Manager, Accountant |
|Customer Statements           | Business Manager, Accountant |
|Aged Accounts Payable         | Accountant |
|Aged Accounts Receivable      | Accountant |

Let's say you want to dig deeper into your cash flow. From the Business Manager or Accountant Role Center, you can open the **Statement of Cash Flows** report in Excel, but what actually happens is that we export the relevant data for you and create an Excel workbook based on a predefined template. Depending on your browser, you might be prompted to open or save the workbook.  

In Excel, you see a tab where the data is laid out for you on the first worksheet. All the data that was exported is also present in other worksheets in case you need it. You can print the report right away, or you can modify it until you have the overview and the details that you want. Use the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Excel Add-in to further filter and analyze data.  

### Understand the Excel templates

The predefined Excel reports are based on the data in the current company. For example, the demonstration company has set up the chart of accounts to list three cash accounts under *Current Assets*: 10100 **Checking account**, 10200 **Saving account**, and 10300 **Petty Cash**. The accounts have the **Account Subcategory** field set to *Cash*, and it's their combined amount that shows up as *Cash* in the **Balance Sheet** Excel report.  

Other sheets in the Excel workbook show the data behind the report. To find out what's behind the groupings in the Excel reports, you might have to filter the lists in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

## The [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Excel add-in

Your [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] experience includes an add-in for Excel. Depending on your subscription, you're signed in automatically, or you must provide your sign-in details for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. To learn more, go to [Viewing and Editing in Excel From Business Central](across-work-with-excel.md).  

The add-in lets you get fresh data from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], and you can push changes back to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. However, the ability to push data back to the database is not available for the financial reports you can view in Excel.

# Report VAT to tax authorities

This article describes the reports in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] that you can use to submit information about value-added tax (VAT) amounts for sales and purchases to tax authorities in your region. Depending on the specific country/region, the reports might include specific information, or there might be additional reports that you must submit. Check the articles for your country/region in the [Local Functionality](about-localization.md) section.  

You can use the following built-in reports:

* The **EC Sales List** report  

    The European Community (EC) Sales List report lists the value added tax (VAT) amounts that you have collected for sales to VAT-registered customers in the European Union (EU) countries/regioins.  
* The **VAT Return** report  

    The VAT Return report includes VAT for sales and purchases to customers and from vendors in all countries/regions that use VAT.  

In both cases (as in other VAT-related reports), VAT is calculated based on the VAT posting setup and the VAT posting groups that you have set up. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] shows VAT entries always based on their **VAT Date** as a primary reporting date.  

> [!NOTE]
> All VAT related reports now run using the **VAT Date** to filter relevant records. Even if you set up **VAT Date Usage** as **Do not use VAT Date functionallity** [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will hide all instances of the **VAT Date** across the application. However, the **VAT Date** is still used in all reportings and is auto-populated with the **Posting Date**.

If you want to view a complete history of VAT entries, every posting that involves VAT creates an entry on the **VAT Entries** page. These entries are used to calculate your VAT settlement amount, such as your payment and refund, for a specific period. To view VAT entries, choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Entries**, and then choose the related link.

> [!NOTE]
> Each [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] environment is meant to handle regulatory reporting in one single country/region. For example, the Dutch version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] handles VAT reporting in The Netherlands but not in other countries/regions. Similarly, the United States version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] handles 1099 reporting in the United States and does not support claiming VAT reporting in other countries/regions, unless brought by an extension delivered by our partner ecosystem or a customer-specific code modification.

## <a name="ecsaleslist"></a>About the EC Sales List report

In the European Union (EU) and in the UK, all companies that sell goods and services to VAT-registered customers, including customers in other European Union (EU) countries/regions, must submit an electronic version of the European Community (EC) Sales List report to their customs and tax authorities. The **EC Sales List** report works only for countries/regions in the EU.

The report includes one line for each type of transaction with the customer, and displays the total amount for each type of transactions. There are three types of transactions that the report can include:  

* B2B Goods  
* B2B Services  
* B2B Triangulated Goods  

*B2B* goods and services specify whether you sold a good or a service, and are controlled by the **EU Service** setting in the VAT posting setup. *B2B Triangulated Goods* indicate whether you engaged in trade with a 3rd party, and are controlled by the **EU 3-Party Trade** setting on sales documents, such as sales orders, invoices, credit memos, and so on.  

After the tax authority reviews your report, they'll send an email to the contact person for your company. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the contact person is specified on the **Company Information** page. Before you submit the report, make sure that a contact person is chosen.  

### Submit an EC sales list report

[!INCLUDE [finance-ecsaleslist](includes/finance-ecsaleslist.md)]

## <a name="vatreturn"></a>About the VAT Return report

Use this report to submit VAT for sales and purchase documents, such as purchase and sales orders, invoices, and credit memos. The information in the report is in the same format as on the declaration form from the customs and tax authorities.  

For the VAT return, you can specify the entries to include:

* Submit open transactions only, or open and closed. For example, this is useful when you prepare your final annual VAT return.
* Submit only entries from the specified periods, or also include entries from previous periods. This is useful for updating a VAT return that you have already submitted, for example, if a vendor sends you a late invoice.    

## To connect to your tax authority's web service
[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides service connections to tax authority websites. For example, if you are in the UK, you can enable the **GovTalk** service connection to submit the EC Sales List and VAT Return reports electronically. If you want to submit the report manually, for example by entering your data on the tax authority's website, this isn't required.   

To report VAT to a tax authority electronically, you need to connect [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to the tax authority's web service. This requires that you set up an account with your tax authority. When you have an account, you can enable a service connection that we provide in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 2.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Connections**, and then choose appropriate link.
2. Fill in the required fields. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > It is a good idea to test your connection. To do this, choose the **Test Mode** check box, then prepare and submit your VAT report as described in the [To prepare and submit a VAT report](#to-prepare-and-submit-a-vat-report) section. While in Test Mode, the service tests whether the tax authority can receive your report, and the status of the report will indicate whether the test submission was successful. It is important to remember that this is not an actual submission. To submit the report for real, you must clear the **Test Mode** check box, and then repeat the submission process.

## To set up VAT reports in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]

[!INCLUDE [vat-report-setup](includes/vat-report-setup.md)]

### To set up VAT return periods

Optionally, if your business isn't located in the UK, use the **VAT Returns Periods** page to set up scheduled VAT returns. If your business is located in the UK, see [Making Tax Digital in the United Kingdom](LocalFunctionality/UnitedKingdom/making-tax-digital-submit-vat-return.md).  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Return Periods**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **VAT Return Periods** page, fill in the fields to set up the first period. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)].  
3. Repeat step 2 for any additional periods that you want to add.  

Now, when the time has come to submit a VAT report for a VAT return period, choose the period in  the **VAT Return Periods** page, and then choose the **Create VAR Return** action. Then, in the **VAT Return** card, choose the **Suggest Lines** action as described in step 3 in the following procedure.  

## To prepare and submit a VAT report

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 3.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **EC Sales List** or **VAT Returns**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose **New**, and then fill in the required fields. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
3. To generate the content of the report, choose the **Suggest Lines** action.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  For the EC Sales List report, you can review the transactions included in the report lines before you submit the report. To do that, choose the line, and then choose the **Show VAT Entries** action.  

4. To validate and prepare the report for submission, choose the **Release** action.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] validates whether the report is set up correctly. If the validation fails, the errors display under **Errors and Warnings** so that you know what to fix. Typically, if the message is about a missing setting in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can click the message to open the page that contains the information to correct.  
5. To submit the report, choose the **Submit** action.  

After you submit the report, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] monitors the service and keeps a record of your communications. The **Status** field indicates where the report is in the process. For example, when the authorities process your report, the status of the report changes to **Succeeded**. If the tax authority found mistakes in the report you submitted, the status of the report will be **Failed**. You can view the errors under **Errors and Warnings**, correct them, and then submit the report again. To view a list of all your EC Sales List reports, go to the **EC Sales List Reports** page.  

### VAT return statuses

VAT returns can have different statuses, as described in the following table.

| Status | Description |
|------------|-------------------------|
| Open | When you create a new VAT return. You can run the **Suggest Lines** action. If you need to correct values, you can run the **Suggest Lines** action again. You can't submit a VAT return that has this status. |
| Released | Status will be changed when you use the **Release** action. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will show the **Errors and Warnings** FastTab. You can't make changes or use the **Suggest Lines** action. To make changes, you must reopen the VAT return. |
| Rejected | If your submission wasn't successful (for example, if authentication failed), the status will change to **Rejected**. You can't reopen a VAT Return that has this status. |
| Submitted | The VAT return is submitted using the **Submit** action, or it's marked as submitted by using the **Mark as Submitted** action. |
| Accepted | The VAT return has this status if the report is marked as accepted by using the **Mark as Accepted** action. If the **VAT Return** report is marked as **Accepted**, you can run the **Calculate and Post VAT Settlement** action. |

## Viewing communications with your tax authority

In some countries/regions, you exchange messages with the tax authority when you submit reports. You can view the first and the last message you sent or received by choosing the **Download Submission Message** and **Download Response Message** actions.  

## Submitting VAT reports manually
If you use another method to submit the report, for example by exporting the XML and uploading it to a tax authority website, afterward you can choose **Mark as Submitted** to close the reporting period. When you mark the report as released, it becomes non-editable. If you must change the report after you mark it as released, you must reopen it.

## VAT settlement
Periodically, you must remit the net VAT to the tax authorities. If you need to settle VAT frequently, you can run the **Calc. and Post VAT Settlement** batch job to close the open VAT entries and transfer purchase and sales VAT amounts to the VAT settlement account.

When you transfer VAT amounts to the settlement account, the purchase VAT account is credited, and the sales VAT account is debited with the amounts calculated for the specified period. The net amount is credited or debited, if the purchase VAT amount is larger, to the VAT settlement account. You can post the settlement immediately or print a test report first.  

> [!Note]
> When you use the **Calc. and Post VAT Settlement** batch job, if you do not specify a **VAT Bus. Posting Group** and a **VAT Prod. Posting group**, entries with all business posting groups and product posting group codes are included.

## Configuring your own VAT reports

You can use the **EC Sales List** report out-of-the-box. However, you can also create your own reports, if you have a development license so that you can create codeunits. If you need assistance, contact a Microsoft Partner.  

The following table describes the codeunits that you must create for your report.  

| Codeunit | What it must do |
|----|-----|
|Suggest Lines| Fetch information from the **VAT Entries** table, and display it in lines on the VAT report.|
|Content | Control the format of the report. For example, whether it's XML or JSON. The format to use depends on the requirements of your tax authority's web service. |
|Submission | Control how, and when, you submit the report based on the requirements of your tax authority. |
|Response Handler | Handle the return from the tax authority. For example, it might send an email message to your company's contact person. |
|Cancel | Send a cancellation of a VAT report that was submitted earlier to your tax authority. |  

> [!Note]
> When you create codeunits for the report, pay attention to the value in the **VAT Report Version** field. This field must reflect the version of the report that is, or was, required by the tax authority. For example, you might enter **2021** in the field to indicate that the report conforms to the requirements that were in place that year. To find the current version, contact your tax authority.

# Set Up Universal Print Printers

[!INCLUDE[azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id](~/../shared-content/shared/azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id.md)]

Universal Print is a Microsoft 365 subscription-based service that runs entirely on Microsoft Azure. It gives you centralized printer management through the Universal Print portal. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] makes printers set up in Universal Print available to client users through the **Universal Print Integration** extension.

![Universal Print setup.](media/Universal-Print-arch.png)

The complete setup requires you work in both Microsoft Azure, using the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), and in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The setup is divided between two main tasks as described in this article:

1. In Microsoft Azure, set up Universal Print and add the printers you want to use in Business Central to a print share. Go to [this section](#set-up-universal-print-and-printers-in-microsoft-azure).
2. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], add the printers from the print shares in Universal Print. Go to [this section](#add-printers-in-business-central-online) for online or [here](#add-printers-in-business-central-on-premises) for on-premises.

## Prerequisites

- Supported printers

  [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports the same printers as Universal Print, which can be either Universal Print–compatible or non-compatible printers. Non-compatible printers can't communicate with Universal Print directly, so they require extra connector software, which is provided by Universal Print. Some older printers may not be supported. 

- Universal Print:

  - A Universal Print subscription/license for your organization.

    Learn more at [License Universal Print](/universal-print/fundamentals/universal-print-license).

  - You have at least the [Printer Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#printer-administrator) role in Microsoft Entra ID.

    To manage Universal Print, your account must have at least the [Printer Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#printer-administrator) role in Microsoft Entra ID. These roles are only needed for managing Universal Print. They aren't required by people setting up and  the printers from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

- [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online and on-premises:

  - [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] 2021 release wave 1 or later.
  - **Universal Print Integration** extension is installed.

    This extension is published and installed by default as part of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online and on-premises. You can verify whether it's installed on the **Extension Management** page. Learn more at [Installing and Uninstalling Extensions in Business Central](ui-extensions-install-uninstall.md).
- [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises only:
  - Microsoft Entra ID or NavUserPassword authentication is configured.
    > [!NOTE]
    >  Universal Print extension doesn't support service-to-service (S2S) authentication. It requires a signed-in user to send print jobs to the Universal Print service through Graph API.
  - An application for Business Central is registered in your Microsoft Entra tenant and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

    Like other Azure services that work with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], Universal Print requires an app registration for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in Microsoft Entra ID. The app registration provides authentication and authorization services between [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and Universal Print.

    Your deployment may already use an app registration for other Azure services, like Power BI. If so, then use the existing app registration for Universal Print as well, instead of adding a new one. The only thing you'll need to do, in this case, is modify the app registration to include the relevant print permissions for Microsoft Graph API: **PrinterShare.ReadBasic.All**, **PrintJob.Create**, and **PrintJob.ReadBasic.** 

    To register an app and set the proper permissions, follow the steps described in [Register an application in Microsoft Entra ID](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/register-app-azure#register-an-application-in-azure-active-directory).

## Set up Universal Print and printers in Microsoft Azure

Before you can start managing Universal Print printers in Business Central, there are several tasks to get Universal Print up and running in Azure with the printers you want to use.

For detailed instructions on how to get set up, see [Get started: Set up Universal Print](/universal-print/fundamentals/universal-print-getting-started) in the Universal Print documentation. Here's an overview of the steps you'll need to complete. Most of these steps are done in the Azure portal.

1. Assign Universal Print licenses to yourself and other users.

    How you assign the license depends on whether you're integrating with Business Central online or on-premises.

    - With [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, you assign licenses using the Microsoft 365 admin center.

      Learn more at [Microsoft Admin Center Help - Assign licenses to users](/microsoft-365/admin/manage/assign-licenses-to-users).

    - With [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, you assign licenses in your tenant using the Azure portal.

      Learn more at [Assign or remove licenses in the Azure portal](/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/license-users-groups).

2. Install the Universal Print connector for registering printers that can't communicate with Universal Print directly.

    Most in-market printers can't communicate with Universal Print directly, so you'll need to install the Universal Print connector. Learn more at [Installing the Universal Print Connector](/universal-print/fundamentals/universal-print-connector-installation).

3. Register your printers in Universal Print.

    Registering a printer makes Universal Printer aware of the printer.

    - For printers that can communicate directly with Universal Print, follow the steps provided by the printer manufacturer.

    - For other printers, register the printers by using the Universal Print connector. 

      Learn more at [Printer registration](/universal-print/fundamentals/universal-print-connector-printer-registration).

4. Change printer properties (optional)

    After a printer is registered, you can view and modify printer properties, such as default preferences.

    Learn more at [Managing Printer Settings using the Universal Print Portal](/universal-print/reference/portal/printer-settings).

5. Share the printers with users.

    Any printer you want to use in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will need to be added to a *printer share* in Universal Print. Any user who needs access to the printer must be added as a member of the printer share. Learn more at [Share a Printer](/universal-print/reference/portal/share-printers).

    > [!TIP]
    > You can always add or remover users later. Learn more at [Configure user permssions for printer share](/universal-print/reference/portal/share-printers#configure-user-permissions-for-a-printer-share).

6. Enable document conversion.

    Universal Print renders content for print in XPS format. Some legacy in-market printers don't support XPS content rendering&mdashin many cases, only PDF format. Printing to these printers will fail unless Universal Print is set up to convert documents to the printer-supported format.

    Learn more at [Document conversion](/universal-print/reference/portal/settings#2-document-conversion).

Now, you're ready to add the printers to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], set up default printers for reports, and print.  

## Add printers in Business Central online

After printers are set up and shared in Universal Print, you're ready to add them to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] for use. There are two ways to add Universal Print printers. You can add the printers all at once or individually, one at a time.

Adding printers individually let's you set up the same Universal Print printer in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] more than once. Then, for each added printer, you can change the print settings, like paper tray, size, and orientation. This way, you can set up printers for different reports and documents with special output requirements.

> [!NOTE]
> Are you using [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises? If so, go to the [next section](#add-printers-in-business-central-on-premises), the first time setup is slightly different.  
<!-- To Do Adding printers individually lets you duplicate printers with custom , like different paper trays and paper size and orientation.  To add printers individually, you'll need to know printer's share name in Universal Print. -->

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Printer Management**, then select the related link.
2. Select **Universal Print**, then choose one of the following options:

   - **Add all Universal Print printers** to add all printers not already added. You can use this option even if there are already printers added.
   - **Add a Universal Print printer** to add a specific printer.  
3. Follow the on-screen instructions.

    - If you chose **Add all Universal Print printers**, then the **Add Universal Print Printers** setup starts. 

    - If you chose to **Add a Universal Print printer**, then the **Universal Printer Settings** page appears. Fill in the **Name** field, then select **...** next to the **Print Share in Universal Print** field to select the printer share that contains the Universal Print printer. Fill in the remaining fields as needed. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)].

After a printer has been added, you can view and change its settings from the **Printer Management** page. Just select the printer, then choose **Edit printer settings**.

## Add printers in Business Central on-premises

<!--With [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, unlike online, users aren't automatically authenticated with the registered app in Azure used for the Universal Print service. So, before any Business Central user (including admins) can add or even use Universal Print printers, they'll have to authenticate with the Azure app and grant access to the Universal Print service. The following procedure describes how to initiate this authentication flow. Each user typically only has to do this task once.-->

Before a user can add or use Universal Print printers Business Central, they have to authorize access to the Azure services used by Universal Print and grant it to permission to data and operations like:

- Signing in and reading user profile
- Reading basic print job information
- Creating print jobs

This is typically done the first time they connect to the Azure registered app used for Universal Print. In Business Central online does, this authorization flow is done seamlessly, with no user interaction. But Business Central on-premises operates differently. It requires that you, or any other user who wants to use Universal Print printers, initiate the authentication flow&mdash;usually, one time only. The most direct way is described in the following steps. A less direct way is by connecting to another integrated service that uses the same Azure registered app, like Power BI or OneDrive. Each user typically only has to do this task once.

> [!NOTE]
> If you're an admin, we recommend you complete this task before other users. Then afterwards, inform users who will need to use Universal Print printers how to do it. If the Azure registered app for Universal Print requires admin consent for API permissions, it's easier if you grant consent on behalf of the organization. You can grant admin consent from the Azure Portal or when you run the steps that follow. 

<!-- To Do Adding printers individually lets you duplicate printers with custom , like different paper trays and paper size and orientation.  To add printers individually, you'll need to know printer's share name in Universal Print. -->
### Connect to Universal Print for the first-time

Complete these steps to connect to the Universal Print service for the first-time.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Printer Management**, then select the related link.
2. Select **Universal Print** > **Add all Universal Print printers** to start the **Add Universal Print Printers** assisted setup guide (wizard).
3. Follow the on-screen instructions until you get to the **MICROSOFT ENTRA SERVICE PERMISSIONS** page.

    <!--The MICROSOFT ENTRA SERVICE PERMISSIONS page appears. You'll be prompted to give consent to Azure Services. You'll be lead through the process of verifying your Microsoft Entra ID setup, checking your Universal Print license, and then adding the printers.-->

   ![Shows the MICROSOFT ENTRA SERVICE PERMISSIONS page](media/azure-ad-services-permissions.png "Shows the MICROSOFT ENTRA SERVICE PERMISSIONS page")

4. Select the **Authorize Azure Services** link.

   1. If the **Permission Requested** page appears, read it carefully and select **Accept** to agree and continue. If you're running as an admin, you can select **Consent on behalf of organization** if you want to consent for all users.

      ![Shows the Azure request permissions page](media/azure-ad-permissions-requested.png "Azure request permissions page").

   2. If you're prompted, sign in using your name and password.

5. When authorization completes successfully, you're returned to the **Add Universal Print Printers** page. Select **Next** > **Finish** to complete the setup.

After a printer has been added, you can view and change its settings from the **Printer Management** page. Just select the printer, then choose **Edit printer settings**.

Once you complete the initial sign-in, you can use the Universal Print printers to print reports and other print jobs. For more information, go to [Printing a Report](ui-work-report.md#PrintReport). If you want to add, remove, or change any printers, just go back to the **Print Management** page and select **Universal Print**.

## Common problems and resolutions

In this section, you'll learn about the common problems that users may experience when trying to set up or use Universal Print printers.

### You don't have access to the printer \<your-printer\>.

# FAQ for mapping e-documents with purchase orders using Copilot (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]

These frequently asked questions (FAQ) describe the AI impact of **E-documents Matching Assistance** feature in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/production-ready-preview-dynamics365.md)]

## What is E-documents Matching Assistance?

Electronic documents (e-documents) serve as the foundation for modern business transactions. They represent critical paperwork such as invoices and receipts that flow in both directions through delivery and receipt. You can generate and transmit electronic invoices digitally in a structured format that facilitates automated invoice processing. However, handling incoming digital invoices can be more intricate for accounts payable teams.  

In small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs), the accounts payable team plays a pivotal role in accurately tracking vendor obligations. Their primary responsibility is to accurately record incoming invoices. Achieving precision can require effort, particularly when they reconcile external invoices from vendors with existing purchase orders. Discrepancies in codes, descriptions, and units of measurement often present challenges because these elements might not match across different systems and companies. Also, unexpected costs, such as transportation fees, might appear as separate line items that need manual adjustment. Accountants must also include invoice numbers and dates in the documents. Importantly, the relationship between purchase orders and external invoices isn't always one-to-one. You might receive multiple external invoices for the same purchase order.

Historically, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] could generate new purchase invoices based on received electronic invoices. However, manually matching invoices with existing purchase orders was a time-consuming and error-prone process.

**E-documents Matching Assistance** uses generative AI to streamlines this process by automating the analysis of external electronic invoices. The feature allows accountants to ask Copilot to match lines on incoming electronic invoices with lines on purchase orders in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## What are capabilities of the E-documents Matching Assistance?

Copilot provides AI-powered assistance to match received digital invoice with existing purchase orders in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Copilot matches lines based on the following:

- Similarity of descriptions
- Units of measure
- Quantities available for invoicing
- Amounts

Copilot identifies similar descriptions if they have proper unit of measures and the prices, but it can also find matches in more complex cases. For example, it can identify if an electronic invoice has two lines with a variant of the same item, and just one line in the purchase order; [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] matches these lines as long as the descriptions are similar and the prices are the same.

Copilot doesn't connect to your e-documents endpoint service to retrieve or send digital vouchers. This task remains fully within your control and is a prerequisite to using Copilot's assistance. This is true, regardless of whether the digital documents are added to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] using a connection with an endpoint service or entered manually.  

## What is the intended use of the E-documents Matching Assistance?  

The goal of the **E-documents Matching Assistance** feature is to assist the accounts payable team match existing purchase orders with incoming electronic invoices. Much of this activity revolves around string matching. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers a feature that automates some of this activity, and LLMs have been identified as an opportunity to supplement that feature and further reduce manual effort.  

## How was E-documents Matching Assistance evaluated? What metrics are used to measure performance?

This feature was tested using combinations of the following information:

- External item descriptions
- Units of measure
- Quantities and amounts
- Standard item descriptions
- Different languages
- Other parameters that cover the typical variations and data limits for each field 

Test data represents both typical use and use by bad actors. Performance was measured compared to manual matching the same data in electronic invoices and purchase orders.

## What are the limitations of E-documents Matching Assistance? How can users minimize the impact of the E-documents Matching Assistance limitations when using the system?

**E-documents Matching Assistance** performs best when external (e-invoice) and internal ([!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]) item descriptions, and unit of measures are all in the same language. Mixed languages or mixed language of item descriptions often result in fewer matches and suggestions.  

Suggested matching of items from e-invoices with items in purchase orders performs best in English language. Although you can use this feature in any language that [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports, you might experience fewer item matches in other languages. Learn more in the section [In which geographies and languages is E-documents Matching Assistance available?](#in-which-geographies-and-languages-is-e-documents-matching-assistance-available).

## In which geographies and languages is E-documents Matching Assistance available?

[!INCLUDE[copilot-geo-and-language-availability-en-only](includes/copilot-geo-and-language-availability-en-only.md)]

## What operational factors and settings allow for effective and responsible use of the feature?

Copilot supplements the mapping algorithm that [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] already provides and maps the lines that the algorithm didn't.

### What is expected of users while using E-Documents Matching Assistance?

<!--Not sure that this is the right content for this section. Seems like it belongs more in the overview article because it's more related to how to use the feature-->

After you map incoming electronic invoices with purchase orders, you must map the lines on the documents.

The **Purchase Order Mapping** page shows all lines from both of documents. Here, you can do the mapping manually, which can be difficult if there are many lines.

You can use **E-Documents Matching Assistance** to map lines based on the following criteria:

- Similarity in their descriptions
- Units of measure
- Quantities available for invoicing
- Amounts

Copilot's matches might be incorrect or incomplete. You should always review their accuracy before you choose to keep them. Copilot’s matches and suggestions are saved in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] when you choose **Keep it** and exit Copilot. You can edit and correct any matches or suggestions before you choose to keep them. 

### What is expected of administrators and users when operating E-Documents Matching Assistance?

Users, such as accountants or others who receive e-invoices, should always review the accuracy of matches and suggestions provided by Copilot before choosing to keep them. We recommend that you review the purchase order lines to verify their accuracy and find any discrepancies. You decide whether to use the **E-Documents Matching Assistance**. Even when the **E-Documents Matching Assistance** is enabled by administrators and available, you can still choose to use it always, sometimes, or never.  

Administrators make the overall decision on whether to use Copilot in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. If they enable Copilot, administrators should ensure they grant access to the appropriate.

> [NOTE!]
> - We don't support the feature for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises or in private clouds.
> - Partners can't extend this feature. Partner developers can't modify, replace, or extend this feature. 

## Is Copilot the only way to match e-documents to purchase orders?  

No, whether you use Copilot is up to you. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers non-AI-powered ways to match items from received electronic invoice with items on purchase orders in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Organizations can also use both approaches at the same time.  

## How do I give feedback about AI-generated content?  

Each time Copilot provides matches or suggestions, you can provide feedback to Microsoft directly from the Copilot window, using the **Like** and **Dislike** controls. Your feedback remains anonymous, and we use this data to improve the quality of the service.

## Fixing problems

The Power BI dashboard relies on the published web services that are listed above. It shows data from the demonstration company or your own company if you import data from your current finance solution. However, if something goes wrong, this section provides a workaround for the most typical issues.  

### You don't have a Power BI account

A Power BI account hasn't been set up. You must have a license to get a valid Power BI account. Also, you must have previously signed into Power BI to create your Power BI workspace.  

### Message: There are no enabled reports. Select report to see a list of reports that you can display.

This message appears if the default report failed to deploy to your Power BI workspace. Or the report deployed but didn't successfully refresh. If this problem happens, navigate to the report in your Power BI workspace, select **Dataset**, **Settings**, and then manually update the credentials. Once the dataset successfully refreshes, navigate back to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and manually select the report from the **Select Reports** page.

### You need a Power BI Pro license to install the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app in Power BI

You need a [Power BI Pro license](/power-bi/service-features-license-type) to share your content, and the people you share it with do too. The content must be in a workspace in a [Premium capacity](/power-bi/service-premium-what-is). For more information, see [Ways to share your work in Power BI](/power-bi/service-how-to-collaborate-distribute-dashboards-reports).  

### "Parameter validation failed, please make sure all parameters are valid"

This error indicates that one more of the parameters aren't valid.

- The specified environment parameter doesn't match any existing [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] production or sandbox environment.
- The specified company parameter doesn't match any existing [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] companies. Verify the company name in the **Companies** page in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].
- If connecting to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, you entered a URL that isn't valid. You can verify the URL in the **Web Services** page in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]  
- A port isn't open to allow the request through your firewall.

### Can't sign in

If you get a "login failed" error after using your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] user credentials to sign in, then you're probably experiencing one of the following issues:

- The account that you're using doesn't have permissions to retrieve the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] data from your account. Verify that you have permissions to the required data in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and try again.
- You've selected an authentication type other than Basic, if connecting to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises.
- You haven't entered a valid user name or password.

### Message: Your data source can't be refreshed because the credentials are invalid. Please update your credentials and try again

For [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, the problem might be that the OData URL is only exposed to the local network.

### Incorrect company name

A common mistake is to enter the company display name instead of the company name. To find the company name search for **Companies**. Then use the **Name** field when entering your company name.

### The key didn't match any rows in the table

If you enter a non-valid company name during the connection process, you may get the error message "The key didn't match any rows in the table". Provide the correct company name and try connecting again.

### Historical data appears to be missing

Once the Power BI app installs and your data show in Power BI, you notice that not all your data displays. The datasets are filtered to only return the previous 365 days of data. This default is in place to help make the reports faster.  

### I only see data for a single company

The Power BI app will only display data from the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] company that was defined when the Power BI app was installed. Data from additional companies can be added to the reports by adding new queries that use different companies as the data source.  

### What now?

- Try [asking a question in the Q&A box](/power-bi/service-q-and-a-tips) at the top of the dashboard.
- [Change the tiles](/power-bi/service-dashboard-edit-tile) in the dashboard.  
- [Select a tile](/power-bi/service-dashboard-tiles) to open the underlying report.  
- By default, your dataset isn't scheduled to refresh. You can change the refresh schedule or try refreshing it on demand using **Refresh Now**. For more information, see [Configuring scheduled refresh](/power-bi/refresh-scheduled-refresh).

title: Set Up FA User-Defined Depreciation Method
description: In Business Central, you can apply a user-defined depreciation method for defining your asset's depreciation method on the Fixed Asset Card page.

# Set Up Fixed Assets with User-Defined Depreciation Methods

You can use [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to set up the user-defined depreciation methods as described here.

For each user-defined method, you use the **Depreciation Tables** page, where you must enter a depreciation percentage for each period (month, quarter, year, or accounting period). Then, when you assign a depreciation book with a user-defined method to a fixed asset, you must set the **First User-Defined Depr. Date** and **Depreciation Starting Date** fields on the **FA Depreciation Books** page for the specific fixed asset.  

The formula for calculating the depreciation amounts is:  

*Depreciation Amount = (Depreciation % x Number of Depreciation Days x Depr. Basis) / (100 x 360)*


> [!NOTE]  
> While the date in the field **First User-Defined Depr. Date** is used to determine the time intervals, it is the **Depreciation Starting Date** that is used to determine the number of depreciation days. If the **First User-Defined Depr. Date** is earlier than the **Depreciation Starting Date**, the percentage for the first period in the depreciation table will be only partially used when the program calculates the first depreciation. This means that the asset will not be completely depreciated by the end of the last period.

## To assign a depreciation book to a fixed asset with a user-defined depreciation method

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Fixed Assets**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the fixed asset that you want to set up a fixed asset depreciation book for.
3. Choose the **Related** action, and then choose **Fixed Asset**, and then **Depreciation Books**. This opens the **FA Depreciation Books** page.

   By default, some of the fields that need to be filled in per the instructions below are hidden, so you must display them. To do this you need to personalize the page. For more information, see [To start personalizing a page through the Personalizing banner](ui-personalization-user.md#start-personalizing-by-using-the-personalization-mode).
4. In the field **Depreciation Method**, select **User-Defined**.
5. In the field **Depreciation Table Code**, select the **Depreciation Table** you want to use.
6. In the field **Depreciation Starting Date**, select the starting date for the depreciation calculation.
7. When you use a user-defined method, the **First User-Defined Depr. Date** field must be set to a date that is the same or earlier than the field **Depreciation Starting Date**. If you have selected a value in the **Period Length** field in the depreciation table, the date in the field **First User-Defined Depr. Date** must be the starting date of an accounting period.
8. Either fill in the field **No. of Depreciation Years** or the field **Depreciation Ending Date**. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)] 

## To set up user-defined depreciation methods

On the **Depreciation Table** page, you can set up user-defined depreciation methods. For example, you can set up depreciation based on number of units.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Depreciation Tables**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Depreciation Table List** page, choose the **New** action.  
3. On the **Depreciation Table Card** page, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  

> [!TIP]
> Use the **Create Sum of Digits Table** function to define a depreciation table based on the *Sum of Digits* method.

With the *Sum of Digits* method, if a fixed asset is depreciated over 4 years, then the depreciation for each year is calculated in the following way:

Sum of Digits = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10
Depreciation:

* Year 1 = 4/10  
* Year 2 = 3/10  
* Year 3 = 2/10  
* Year 4 = 1/10  

### Depreciation Based on Number of Units

This user-defined method can also be used to depreciate based on number of units, for example, in the case of production machines with an established lifetime capacity. On the **Depreciation Tables** page, you can enter the number of units that can be produced in each period (month, quarter, year,or accounting period).  

### Example - User-defined Depreciation

You use a depreciation method that allows you to depreciate assets in an accelerated manner for income tax purposes.  

You would use the following depreciation rates for a fixed asset with a three-year lifetime for tax purposes:  

* Year 1: 25%  
* Year 2: 38%  
* Year 3: 37%  

The acquisition cost is LCY 100,000, and the depreciable lifetime is five years. Depreciation is calculated annually.  

| Date | FA Posting Type | Days | Amount | Book Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 01/01/20 |Acquisition Cost |(Depreciation starting date) |100,000.00 |100,000.00 |
| 12/31/20 |Depreciation |360 |-25,000.00 |75,000.00 |
| 12/31/21 |Depreciation |360 |-38,000.00 |37,000.00 |
| 12/31/22 |Depreciation |360 |-37,000.00 |0 |
| 12/31/23 |Depreciation |None |None |0 |
| 12/31/24 |Depreciation |None |None |0 |

In the previous example, both the **First User-Defined Depr. Date** and **Depreciation Starting Date** fields would be set to 01/01/20 in the **FA Depreciation Books** page for the specific fixed asset. If, however, the **First User-Defined Depr. Date** field contained 01/01/20 and the **Depreciation Starting Date** field contained 04/01/20, the result would be:  

| Date | FA Posting Type | Days | Amount | Book Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 01/01/20 |Acquisition Cost |(Depreciation starting date) |100,000.00 |100,000.00 |
| 12/31/20 |Depreciation |270 |-18,750.00 |81,250.00 |
| 12/31/21 |Depreciation |360 |-38,000.00 |42,250.00 |
| 12/31/22 |Depreciation |360 |-37,000.00 |6,250.00 |
| 12/31/23 |Depreciation |90 |-6,250.00 |0 |
| 12/31/24 |Depreciation |None |None |0 |

# View the Status of Synchronization Jobs


Use the **Coupled Data Synchronization Errors** page to view the status of synchronization jobs that have been run for coupled records in a Dataverse or [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] integrations. This includes jobs that were run from the job queue and manual synchronization jobs that ran on records from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For example, viewing their status is helpful when troubleshooting because it gives you access to details about errors related to coupled records. Typically, these types of errors are caused by user actions, for example, when:  

* Two people made a change to the same data in both business apps.
* Someone deleted data in one of the apps, but not both.

> [!Note]
> The **Coupled Data Synchronization Errors** page shows information about jobs related to coupled records. If you resolve all of the errors but records are still not synchronizing, it might have something to do with a setting for the integration. Typically, your administrator will need to resolve those types of errors.   

## Example
This video shows an example of how to troubleshoot errors that happened while synchronizing with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)]. The process will be the same for all integrations. 

> [!VIDEO https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2097304]


## To view and resolve synchronization errors for coupled records
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Coupled Data Synchronization Errors**, and then choose the related link.
2. The **Coupled Data Synchronization Errors** page shows issues that occurred when you synchronized coupled records. The following table includes actions that you can use to resolve issues one by one:

|Action|Description|
|----|----|
|**Remove Coupling**|Uncouples the records and they will no longer synchronize. To restart the synchronization you must couple them again. |
|**Retry** and **Retry All**|For each record where an error is found, synchronization is skipped unless you fix the issue. Retry will include the selected record in the next synchronization, and **Retry All** includes all of the records.|
|**Synchronize**|The app will try to resolve a conflict where data was changed in both business apps. You can choose the data to use.|
|**Restore Records** and **Delete Records**|These are useful when a record was deleted in one of the business apps. Delete Records deletes the record or row in the app where it still exists. Restore Records recreates the record or row in the business app where it was deleted.|

> [!NOTE]
> To reduce the number of conflicts you need to resolve, you can set up your integration table mappings to apply these actions automatically. For more information, [Mapping Integration Tables](admin-how-to-modify-table-mappings-for-synchronization.md#mapping-integration-tables).

## To view the synchronization log for a specific (manually synchronized) record
1. Open, for example, a customer, item or any other record that is synchronizing data between [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and Dataverse or [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)].
2. Choose the **Synchronization Log** action to view the synchronization log for a selected record. For example, a specific customer you synchronized manually.

## Remove Couplings Between Records
When something goes wrong in your integration and you need to uncouple records to stop synchronizing them, you can do so for one or more records at a time. You can uncouple one or more records from list pages or the **Coupled Data Synchronization Errors** page by choosing one or more lines and choosing **Delete Coupling**. You can also remove all couplings for one or more table mappings on the **Integration Table Mappings** page. 

If an entity with a unidirectional coupling is deleted in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you must manually delete the broken coupling. To do that, on the **Coupled Data Synchronization Errors** page, choose the **Find for Deleted** action, and then delete the couplings.

# Create production BOMs

A production bill of material (BOM) holds master data that describes the components and subassemblies used in the production of an item. When you create a production order for an item, its production BOM governs the calculation of material requirements as represented on the **Prod. Order Components** page.

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] also supports assembly BOMs. Use assembly orders to make end items from components in a process that one or more basic resources, which aren't machine or work centers, can do. Or, a process that can complete without any resources. For example, an assembly process could be to pick two wine bottles and one coffee sack and then pack them as a gift item. To learn more, go to [Assembly BOMs or Production BOMs](inventory-how-work-boms.md#assembly-boms-or-production-boms).  

> [!TIP]
> The **Contoso Coffee Demo Data** app includes demonstration products for a variety of production BOM scenarios that can be used on a test environment, including during a trial. Learn how to set up the Contoso Coffee Data and find walkthroughs for different scenarios at [Introduction to Contoso Coffee Demo Data](contoso-coffee/contoso-coffee-intro.md).

Before you can set up a routing, the following setups must be in place:  

- Item cards are created for parent items that take part in manufacturing. To learn more, go to [Register New Items](inventory-how-register-new-items.md).
- Production resources are set up. To learn more, go to [Set Up Work Centers and Machine Centers](production-how-to-set-up-work-and-machine-centers.md).

## To create a production BOM

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Production BOMs**, then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
4. To edit the BOM, set the **Status** field to **New** or **Under Development**. To activate it, set the **Status** field to **Certified**.  

    Proceed to fill in the production BOM lines.
5. In the **Type** field, select whether the item on this BOM line is an ordinary item or a production BOM. If the item on the line is a production BOM, then it must already exist as a certified production BOM.  
6. In the **No.** field, look up and select the item or production BOM in question, or type it in the field.  

   > [!TIP]
   > If you need to add several items, you can use the **Select items** action to select and add them. You can also use the **Edit in Excel** action. You can make changes to records in Excel, and then update the data in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. To learn more about the Edit in Excel action, go to [Edit in Excel](across-work-with-excel.md#edit-in-excel).

7. In the **Quantity per** field, enter how many units of the item go into the parent item, for example, 4 wheels for 1 car.  
8. In the **Scrap %** field, you can enter a fixed percentage of components that are scrapped during production. When the components are ready to be consumed in a released production order, this percentage is added to the expected quantity in the **Consumption Quantity** field in a production journal. To learn more, go to [Register Consumption and Output](production-how-to-register-consumption-and-output.md).  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > This scrap percentage represents components that are scrapped during production when picking from inventory. The scrap percentage on routing lines represents scrapped output before it's put in inventory.  

9. In the **Routing Link Code** field, enter a code to connect the component to a specific operation. To learn more, go to [To create routing links](production-how-to-create-routings.md#to-create-routing-links).
10. To copy lines from an existing production BOM, choose the **Copy BOM** action to select existing lines.  
11. Certify the production BOM.  
12. You can now attach the new production BOM to the card of the parent item in question. To learn more, go to [Register New Items](inventory-how-register-new-items.md).  

> [!NOTE]  
> [!INCLUDE [bom-standard-cost](includes/bom-standard-cost.md)] To recalculate the item's standard cost from the item card, choose the **Production** action, then choose the **Calc. Production Std. Cost** action. You can also calculate and update the standard cost for one or many items on the **Standard Cost Worksheet** page. To learn more, go to [Update Standard Costs](finance-about-calculating-standard-cost.md#updating-standard-costs-with-standard-cost-worksheet).  

## To create a new version of a production BOM

For example, use new versions of production BOMs when an item is replaced, or when a customer requires a special version of a product. The version principle enables various versions of a production BOM to be managed. The structure of the production BOM version corresponds to the structure of the production BOM. The basic difference is in the time validity of the versions. The starting date defines the validity.  

The starting date indicates the start of the period in which this version is valid. For all other considerations, the starting date is a filter criterion for calculations and evaluations. The BOM version is valid until the next version becomes valid for its starting date. You can quickly go to the certified BOM or BOM version that's valid on the work date by choosing the **Prod. Active BOM Version** action.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Production BOMs**, then choose the related link.  
2. Select the production BOM to be copied, then choose the **Versions** action.  
3. Choose the **New** action.  
4. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
5. In the **Version Code** field, enter the unique identification of the version. Any combination of numbers and letters is permitted.  

    The newly created version is automatically assigned the status **New**.
6. When the BOM version is completed, setting the **Status** field to **Certified**.  

The time validity of the version is specified by the **Starting Date** field.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Select the **Item** option in the **Type** field to use an item from your item master data in the production BOM. If the item also has a production BOM, whereby the **Production BOM No.** field is filled in on the item card, this production BOM is also considered.  
>
> Select the **Production BOM** option if you want to use a phantom production BOM on the line.  
>
> Phantom production BOMs serve for structuring products. This production BOM type never leads to a finished product but is used exclusively for determining the dependent demand. Phantom production BOMs don't have their own item master data.

## Compare production BOM versions

Use the **Production BOM Version Comparison** page to access a list of all production BOM versions and items and the quantity used per item. You can use the matrix to compare different production BOM versions for the used items per version, including the original BOM as the first column. This page gives you an overview of all BOM versions and their respective quantities.

## Quantity calculation formula on production BOMs

The quantity is calculated taking into consideration different dimensions that are also entered on the production BOM lines. The dimensions refer to an order unit of the respective item. The length, width, depth, and weight can be entered as dimensions.  

The Calculation Formula, Length, Width, Depth, and Weight columns aren't displayed, because they're only used by some users. If you wish to use the calculation of the quantity, you must first display these columns.  

The calculation formula defines the relation of the individual components. The following options are available as a calculation formula:  

- **Empty** - No consideration of dimensions. (Quantity = Quantity per.)  
- **Length** - Quantity = Quantity per * Length  
- **Length x Width** - Quantity = Quantity per * Length x Width  
- **Length x Width x Depth** - Quantity = Quantity per x Length x Width x Depth  
- **Weight** - Quantity = Quantity per x Weight  
- **Fixed Quantity** - Quantity = Quantity per

> [!NOTE]
> The **Fixed Quantity** calculation formula ensures that the consumption of a component is the same, regardless of the scrap or output quantities. For production order components, when the **Calculation Formula** field is set to **Fixed Quantity**, the **Expected Quantity** field value is always equal to the **Quantity per** field. The scrap percentage that is defined on the same line is ignored. Fixed quantity is respected by the **Availability by BOM** report. The report will show the item as the bottleneck if the available quantity is less than the quantity in the **Quantity Per Parent** field. The **Able to Make Parent** and **Able to Make Top Item** fields are always blank, regardless of the available quantity. Fixed quantity is also included in calculations for standard costs. The lot size for the produced item impacts the cost that is allocated for one item.

### Example

A production BOM requires 70 metal parts with the dimensions length = 0.20 m and width = 0.15 m. Enter the values as follows: Calculation Formula = Length x Width, Length = 20, Width = 15, Quantity per = 70.

Quantity per x Length * Width, that is, Quantity = 70 x 0.20 m x 0.15 m = 2.1 m2, gives the quantity.

# Manufacturing

> [!NOTE]
> The features this article describes are available only if you have the **Premium** experience. To learn more, go to [Change Which Features are Displayed](ui-experiences.md).

When demand is planned for and the materials are issued according to production BOMs, production operations can start in the sequence defined by the production order routing.  

An important part of production, from a system point of view, is to post production output to report progress and to update inventory with the finished items. You can post output manually, by filling in and posting journal lines after production operations. Or, it can post automatically with the use of backward flushing. In that case, material consumption is automatically posted along with output when the production order changes to finished.  

As an alternative to the batch journal for output posting for multiple production orders, you can use the **Production Journal** page to post consumption and/or output for one production order line.

There are a few things to set up before you can start production. For example, work centers, routings, and production BOMs. To learn more, go to [Setting Up Manufacturing](production-configure-production-processes.md).

# Terminology in cost accounting

This article defines the key terms that are used in cost accounting.  

## Key terms

 The following table shows definitions of the key terms in cost accounting.  

|**Term**|**Definition**|  
|--------------|--------------------|  
|Allocation key|The allocation key is the basis that is used to allocate costs. It's typically a quantity, such as square meters occupied, number of employees, or work hours used. For example, two departments, with 20 and 10 employees respectively, share canteen costs. The costs are distributed between the departments by using an allocation key that represents the number of employees. Two thirds of the costs are allocated to the first department, and one third of the costs are allocated to the second department.|  
|Allocation source|The allocation source establishes which costs are allocated. Allocations are defined in allocation source and allocation target tables. Each allocation consists of an allocation source and one or more allocation targets. For example, all costs for the heating cost type, which is an allocation source, can be allocated to the workshop, production, and sales cost centers, which are three allocation targets.|  
|Allocation target|The allocation targets determine where the costs are allocated. Allocations are defined in allocation source and allocation target tables. Each allocation consists of an allocation source and one or more allocation targets. For example, all costs for the heating cost type, which is an allocation source, can be allocated to the workshop, production, and sales cost centers, which are three allocation targets.|  
|Cost accounting|In cost accounting, actual costs of operations, processes, departments, or products are recorded. These costs are allocated to cost centers and cost objects by using different cost allocation methods. Managers use statistics and reports, such as cost distribution sheet and profit and loss analysis to make decisions and reduce costs. Cost accounting retrieves data from the general ledger, but works independently. Therefore transactions posted in cost accounting don't affect the data in the general ledger.|  
|Cost type|The chart of cost types has the same function as the chart of accounts in the general ledger. They're often structured similarly. Therefore it's possible to transfer the general ledger chart of accounts to the chart of cost types and then modify it. The chart of cost types can also be created from scratch.|  
|Cost center|Cost centers are most often departments and profit centers that are largely responsible for company’s costs and income. Cost centers can be synchronized with dimensions in the general ledger. It's also possible to add new cost centers and define their own sorting with subtotals.|  
|Cost object|Cost objects are products, product groups or services of a company, the finished goods of a company, that in the end carries the costs. Cost objects can be synchronized with dimensions in the general ledger. It's also possible to add new cost objects and define their own sorting with subtotals.|  
|Cost allocation|Cost allocation is a process of allocating costs to cost centers or cost objects. For example, the wage of the truck driver of the sales department is allocated to the sales department cost center. It isn't necessary to allocate the wage cost to other cost centers. Another example is that the cost of an expensive computer system is allocated to the products of the company that use the system.|  
|Dynamic allocation|Dynamic allocations are dependent on changeable allocation bases, for example, the number of department employees, or the sales revenue of the project within a certain period of time. There are nine predefined dynamic allocation bases that users can define by using five filters.|  
|Direct cost|Direct costs are the costs that can be directly allocated to a cost object, for example, material purchase for a specific product.|  
|Fixed cost|Fixed costs are the costs that aren't dependent on the level of goods or services produced by the company. They tend to be time-related, such as salary or rent being paid per month. They are in contrast to variable costs, which are volume-related, and are paid per quantity produced.|  
|Indirect cost|Indirect costs aren't directly accountable to a cost object, such as a particular function or product. Indirect costs may be either fixed or variable. Indirect costs can be tax, administration, personnel, and security costs and are also known as overhead costs.|  
|Level|Level is used to define allocation order. Level is defined as a number between 1 and 99. The allocation posting follows the order of the levels. For example, level ensures that first administration is allocated to workshop before workshop is allocated to vehicle and production.|  
|Static allocation|Static allocations are based on a fixed set of values, for example, the square meters used, or an established allocation ratio, such as 5:2:4.|  
|Operational cost|Operational costs are the recurring expenses, which are related to the operation of a business, a device, and a component.|  
|Overhead cost|Overhead costs refer to ongoing expenses of operating a business. They're all costs on the income statement except for direct labor, direct materials, and direct expenses. Overhead costs include accounting fees, advertising, depreciation, insurance, interest, legal fees, rent, repairs, supplies, taxes, telephone bills, travel, and utilities costs.|  
|Step variable cost|Step variable costs are costs that change dramatically at certain points because they involve large purchases that can't be spread out over time. For example, one employee can produce 100 tables in a month. The employee’s wage is constant over a production range of 1 to 100 tables. If the company wants to produce 110 tables, the company needs two employees. So the cost will double.|  
|Share|The portion or part that is allocated among cost centers or cost objects.|  
|Static weighting|Costs are allocated according to allocation keys, which can be modified by using a multiplier. <br />For example, two departments, with 20 and 10 employees respectively, share canteen costs. The costs are distributed between the departments by using an allocation key that represents the number of employees that eat in the canteen. In the first department, only five employees eat in the canteen, so this department has a multiplier of 0.25. The basis for allocation is 20 x 0.25 = 5. The total number of employees that eat in the canteen is 15. One third of the costs are allocated to the first department and two thirds of the costs are allocated to the second department.|  
|Variable cost|Variable costs are expenses that change in proportion to the activity of a business. Variable costs are the sum of marginal costs over all units produced. Fixed costs and variable costs make up the two components of total costs.|  
|Variant|A variant is used as an optional user-defined label for allocations. The purpose of the label is to filter groups of allocation.|

# Find Your Warehouse Assignments

To find your warehouse assignments, open the card page for a selected item. If warehouse instructions have been created, Take and Place lines are visible, and you can begin working on an assignment. In some warehouses, the manager may have assigned specific instructions to each employee. For more information, see [Set Up Warehouse Employees](warehouse-how-to-set-up-warehouse-employees.md).

## To find an instruction assigned to you

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Warehouse Put-aways**, **Warehouse Picks**, or **Warehouse Movement**, and then choose the related link.

    All three pages show assignments for all warehouse locations.  

2. Sort the items by location. You can now see the instructions that have been assigned to you.  
3. Select one of the lines with your initials in the **Assigned User ID** field and then choose the **OK** button. The put-away assignment then appears on the page, with your initials in the **Assigned User ID** field on the **General** FastTab.  

You can use the **Assigned User ID** field on the header to claim work assignments, if the warehouse manager does not assign particular instructions to individuals. Simply enter your user ID in the header of the warehouse before you begin work on an instruction. Your co-workers can then choose to work on other instructions, and the warehouse will avoid a duplication of effort.

# Set Up Cash Customers

You cannot create an invoice without a customer number. This is true, even if you make a cash sale and do not have anything to record in a customer account.  

## To set up a cash customer

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customer**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Create a new **Customer** card. For more information, see [Register New Customers](sales-how-register-new-customers.md).
3. In the **No.** field, enter **Cash**, for example.  
4. In the **Name** field, enter **Cash Sale**, for example.  
5. On the **Invoicing** FastTab, fill in the **Customer Posting Group** and the **Gen. Bus. Posting Group** fields.  

 Now you have set up a customer that contains sufficient information for invoicing.  

> [!NOTE]  
> You may have chosen a posting group that is also used for domestic credit sales. If you want to maintain separate data on cash sales, for example, with a special sales or receivables account, you can set up an extra posting group for this purpose.  
>
> You must enter a number for a receivables account for the posting group, even though the balance in this account will always be 0 after you post an invoice.

# Pick for production, assembly, or projects in advanced warehouse configurations

How you pick components for production, projects, or assembly orders depend on how your warehouse is set up as a location. Learn more at [Setting Up Warehouse Management](warehouse-setup-warehouse.md).

In an advanced warehouse configuration for the outbound flow (pick), on the **Location Card** page for the location, use the following settings:

- Production, in the **Prod. Consumption Whse. Handling** field, select **Warehouse Pick (optional)** or **Warehouse Pick (mandatory)**.
- Assembly, in the **Asm. Consumption Whse. Handling** field, select **Warehouse Pick (optional)** or **Warehouse Pick (mandatory)**.
- Project management, in the **Project Consumption Whse. Handling** field, select **Warehouse Pick (optional)** or **Warehouse Pick (mandatory)**.

When the location is set up to require warehouse pick processing, use warehouse pick documents to create and process pick information before you post the usage or consumption of components.  

You can't create a warehouse pick document from scratch. Picks are part of a workflow where a person who is processing an order creates them in a push fashion, or the warehouse employee creates them in a pull fashion:

- In a push fashion, where you use the **Create Pick** action in the **Production Order**, **Assembly Order**, **Project Card** page. Select the lines to pick and prepare the picks by specifying, for example, which bins to take from and place in, and how many units to handle. Bins can be predefined for the warehouse location or resource.
- In a pull fashion, where you release **Production Order**, **Assembly Order**, **Project Card** to warehouse making the items available for picking. Then, on the **Pick Worksheet** page, warehouse employees can use the **Get Warehouse Documents** action to pull their assigned picks.

To pick or move components for source documents in a pull fashion, you must release the source document to make it ready for picking. Release source documents for internal operations in the following ways.  

|Source Document|Release Method|  
|---------------------|--------------------|  
|Production Order|Change the order status to Released or create a released production order right away.|  
|Assembly Order|Change status to Released.|
|Projects | Change status to Open or create project with status Open right away.|  

## Production

Use **Warehouse Pick** documents for picking production components in the flow to production.

For a location that uses bins to move items to open shop floor bins, you can use the following methods:

- For a location that uses directed put-away and pick, follow the steps in the [Move Items in advanced warehouse configurations](warehouse-how-to-move-items-in-advanced-warehousing.md) article.
- For other locations, follow the steps in the [Move Items Internally in Basic Warehouse Configurations](warehouse-how-to-move-items-ad-hoc-in-basic-warehousing.md) article.

### Over-picking in production

[!INCLUDE [manufacturing-overpicks](includes/manufacturing-overpicks.md)]

## Assembly  

Use **Warehouse Pick** documents to move assembly components to the assembly area.

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports assemble-to-stock and assemble-to-order types of assembly flows. To learn more about assemble-to-order in the outbound warehouse flow, go to [Handling Assemble-to-Order Items in Warehouse Shipments](warehouse-how-ship-items.md#handling-assemble-to-order-items-in-warehouse-shipments).

## Project management  

Use **Warehouse Pick** documents to pick project components in the flow to project management.

> [!NOTE]
> You can't use the **Project No.** and **Project Task No.** fields in a purchase order together with locations where the **Directed Put-Away and Pick** toggle is turned on. You must post receipts and consumption separately with the fully directed warehouse flow.

## Check whether items are available for picking

[!INCLUDE [inventory-availability-overview](includes/inventory-availability-overview.md)]

## To create pick documents in bulk with the pick worksheet

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Pick Worksheet**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **Get Warehouse Documents** action.  

    The list shows the released production, projects, and assembly orders that have been forwarded to the pick function. The orders include those for which pick instructions are already created. Documents with pick lines that have been picked and registered aren't shown on this list.  
3. Select the orders for which you want to prepare a pick.

    > [!NOTE]  
    > If you select a document that already has instructions for all its lines, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] informs you that there is nothing to handle. To combine the already created warehouse pick instructions into one pick instruction, delete the individual warehouse picks first.

4. Fill in the **Sorting Method** field to sort the lines the way you prefer.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > The way the lines are sorted in the worksheet doesn't automatically carry through to the pick instruction. However, the same sorting tools are available, along with bin ranking. You can easily recreate the order of the lines you plan in the worksheet when you create the pick instructions or by sorting in the pick instructions.

5. Fill in the **Qty. to Handle** field. Choose the **Autofill Qty.to Handle** action, or fill in the fields manually.  

    The page shows the quantities available in cross-dock bins, which is useful for planning work assignments in cross-docking situations. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will always propose a pick from a cross-dock bin first.

6. If needed, edit the lines manually. You can also delete some of the lines to make the pick more efficient. For example, if there are multiple lines with items that are in cross-dock bins, you might create a pick for all of the lines. The cross-docked items are picked with the other items on the source document, and the cross-dock bins have space for more incoming items.

    > [!NOTE]  
    > The lines are only deleted from this worksheet, not from the pick selection list.  

7. Choose the **Create Pick** action. The **Create Pick** page opens, where you can add more information to the pick.  

    Specify how to combine pick lines in the pick documents by selecting one of the following options.  

    |Option|Description|
    |-|-|
    |Per Whse. Document|Creates separate pick documents for worksheet lines with the same warehouse source document.|
    |Per Cust./Vend./Loc.|Creates separate pick documents for each customer (project)|
    |Per Item|Creates separate pick documents for each item in the pick worksheet.|
    |Per From Zone|Creates separate pick documents for each zone that you take the items from.|
    |Per Bin|Creates separate pick documents for each bin that you take the items from.|
    |Per Due Date|Creates separate pick documents for source documents that have the same due date.|

    Use the following options to specify how to create the pick documents.  

    |Option|Description|
    |-|-|
    |Max. No. of Pick Lines|Creates pick documents that have no more than the specified number of lines in each document.|
    |Max. No. of Pick Source Docs.|Creates pick documents that cover up to the specified number of source documents.|
    |Assigned User ID|Creates pick documents only for worksheet lines that are assigned to the selected warehouse employee.|
    |Sorting Method for Pick Lines|Select from the available options to sort lines in the created pick document.|
    |Set Breakbulk Filter|Hides intermediate breakbulk pick lines when a larger unit of measure is converted to a smaller unit of measure and picked.|
    |Don't Fill Qty. to Handle|Leaves the **Qty. to Handle** field empty on the created pick lines.|
    |Print Pick|Prints the pick documents when they're created. You can also print from the created pick documents.|

8. Choose the **OK** button.  

## To pick items for a production order, assembly order, or project

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Picks**, and then choose the related link.  

    If you need to work on a particular pick, select the pick from the list or filter the list to find the picks that have been assigned to you. Open the pick card.  
2. If the **Assigned User ID** field is empty, enter your ID to identify yourself, if needed.  
3. Pick the items.  

    If the warehouse is set up to use bins, the items’ default bins are used to suggest where to take the items from. The instructions contain at least two separate lines for Take and Place actions.  

    Operation areas such as production shop floors might have a default bin for the components they require. If so, the default bin code is added to the warehouse pick document to indicate where to put the items. For more information, see the tooltips for the **To-Production Bin Code**, the **To-Assembly Bin Code**, the **To-Project Bin Code** fields.

    If the warehouse is set up to use directed put-away and pick, the bin rankings are used to calculate the best bins to pick from. Those bins are suggested on the pick lines. The instructions contain at least two separate lines for Take and Place actions.  

    - The first line, with **Take** in the **Action Type** field, indicates where the items are located in the picking area. If you're shipping a large number of items on one shipment line, you might have to pick the items in several bins, so there's a Take line for each bin.
    - The next line, with **Place** in the **Action Type** field, shows where you must place the items in the warehouse. You can't change the zone and bin on this line.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you must pick or place the items for one line in more than one bin, for example because the designated bin is full, use the **Split Line** action on the **Lines** FastTab. The action creates a line for the remaining quantity to handle.

      You can sort the pick lines by various criteria, for example, by item, shelf number, or due date. Sorting can help optimize the put-away process, for example:

    - If the take and place lines for each shipment line don't immediately follow one another, and you want them to, sort the lines by selecting **Item** in the **Sorting Method** field.  
    - If bin rankings reflect the physical layout of the warehouse, use the **Bin Ranking** sorting method to organize the work by bin locations.

  > [!NOTE]  
  > Lines are sorted in ascending order by the selected criteria. If you sort by document, sorting is done first by document type based on the **Warehouse Activity Source Document** field. If you sort by ship-to, sorting is done first by destination type based on the **Warehouse Destination Type** field.

4. After you pick and place the items in the production, assembly or project area or bin, choose the **Register Pick** action.  

    You can now bring the items to the respective area and post the usage or consumption of the picked components by posting consumption journal, assembly order, or project journal. The following articles provide more information:

    - [Register Consumption and Output for One Released Production order line](production-how-to-register-consumption-and-output.md)
    - [Assemble Items](assembly-how-to-assemble-items.md)
    - [Record Consumption or Usage for Projects](projects-how-record-job-usage.md)

## Flushing production components in an advanced warehouse configuration

Flushing methods affect the flow of components in production. Learn more at [Flush Components According to Operation Output](production-how-to-flush-components-according-to-operation-output.md). Depending on the selected flushing method, you can pick components for production om the following ways:

* Use a **Warehouse Pick** document to record the pick for items that use the **Pick + Manual** flushing method. You need to register consumption separately. Learn more at [Batch Post Production Consumption](production-how-to-post-consumption.md).
* Use a **Warehouse Pick** document to record the pick for items that use the **Pick + Forward**, **Pick + Backward** flushing method. Consumption of the components happens automatically either when you change the status of the production order or by starting or ending an operation. All required components must be available. Otherwise, posting flushed consumption stop for that component.
* Use a **Warehouse Movement** document without a reference to a source document or other ways to record the movement of components that use the **Forward** or **Backward** flushing method. Components are automatically consumed either when you change of status of the production order or start or end an operation. All required components must be available. Otherwise, posting flushed consumption stops for that component. Learn more at [Move Items](warehouse-move-items.md).
* Use a **Warehouse Movement** document without a reference to a source document or other ways to record the movement of components that use the Manual flushing method. You need to register consumption separately. For example, skipping the pick might be useful for components which, due to their nature, you store in the shop floor zone so there's no need to pick. However, you might still have to manually post consumption, for example, because the consumed quantity can vary or require item tracking. To learn more, go to [Flushing methods](production-how-to-flush-components-according-to-operation-output.md#flushing-methods).

### Example

You have a production order for 15 PCS of item SP-SCM1004. Some of the items on the component list must be flushed manually in a consumption journal. Other items can be picked and flushed automatically using the **Pick + Backward** flushing method.  

The following steps describe the actions that different people take and the related response:  

1. The shop floor supervisor releases the production order. Items with **Forward** flushing method and no routing link are deducted from the open shop floor bin.  
2. The shop floor supervisor chooses the **Create Warehouse Pick** action on the production order. A warehouse pick document is created pick for items with **Manual**, **Pick + Backward**, and **Pick + Forward** flushing methods. These items are placed in the To-Production bin.  
3. The warehouse manager assigns the picks to a warehouse employee.  
4. The warehouse employee picks the items from the appropriate bins and places them in the To-Production bin or in the bin specified on the warehouse pick. The bin might be a work center or machine center bin.
5. The warehouse employee registers the pick. The quantity is transferred from the pick bin to the consumption bin. The **Qty. Picked** field on the component list for all picked items is updated.

    > [!NOTE]  
    > Only the quantity picked can be consumed.  
6. The machine operator informs the production manager that the end items are finished.
7. The shop floor supervisor uses the consumption journal or production journal to post the consumption of component items that use either **Manual** flushing method.
8. The shop floor supervisor uses the output journal or production journal to post the output. The quantity of component items that use **Pick + Forward** or **Pick + Backward** flushing methods with routing links is deducted from the To-Production bin.
9. The production manager changes the status of the production order to **Finished**. The quantity of component items that use **Backward** flushing method is deducted from the open shop floor bin, and the quantity of component items that use **Pick + Backward** flushing method and no routing link is deducted from the To-Production bin.  

The following illustration shows when the **Bin Code** field on the component list is filled according to your location or machine/work center setup.  

:::image type="content" source="media/binflow.png" alt-text="Overview of when and how the Bin Code field is filled in.":::

## Make-to-Order (MTO) production components in an advanced warehouse configuration

In scenarios where a produced item consists of raw materials and semi-finished items with the manufacturing policy set to **Make-to-order**, the warehouse pick for those semi-finished components is added to the same production order with the **Planning Level Code** field filled in. It's expected that the semi-finished items are available for consumption immediately and won't require pick so they aren't included in the warehouse pick document. The created warehouse picks only include raw materials for produced item and for semi-finished items.

However, if semi-finished items are available on stock, the planning system suggests that you consume those instead of producing the whole quantity. For example, a produced item requires five semi-finished components, but three are already in stock. In this case, five semi-finished items are listed in the production order components, but only two are produced in the same production order as a separate production order line.
Such a setup isn't compatible with warehouse picks and, depending on frequency, you must either change the manufacturing policy for such semi-finished items to **Make-to-stock** or manually split the production order component line when you need to pick the semi-finished items produced earlier.

# Create new companies in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the container for business data that belongs to a business unit or legal entity is referred to as a *company*. When you sign up for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you're given a demonstration company and an empty company, *My Company*. Switching between the companies is easy: just go to **My Settings** and move to the other company. But you can also create new companies in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] depending on your business needs.  

> [!NOTE]
> To create a new company, you must be assigned to the **Super** permission set.

When you create a new company, an assisted setup guide helps you get the basics in place. Then, you can import data from your legacy system or another company in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

[!INCLUDE [about-ui-learn](includes/about-ui-learn.md)]

## Choose the right template

If you decide to add a company to your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can use the **Create New Company** assisted setup guide to get started. The setup guide is available from the **Companies** page and from the lookup in the **Company** field on the **My Settings** page.  

The setup guide offers three templates and a blank option:

- **Evaluation - Sample Data**  
    Create a company that's similar to the demonstration company with sample data and setup data. This type of company is available to you without switching to a 30-day trial period, which the other types do.  
- **Advanced Evaluation - Complete Sample Data**
    Create a company with the Advanced functionality scope, which has everything you need to evaluate the product for companies with advanced processes. This type of company is available to you without switching to a 30-day trial period, which the other types do.
- **Production - Setup Data Only**  
    Create a company that's similar to **My Company**, with setup data such as a chart of accounts, payment methods, and financial report definitions, but without sample data. You can use this company for a 30-day trial period.
- **Create New - No Data**  
    Create a blank company without setup data. You can use this company for a 30-day trial period.  

If you want to get started easily with a new company, choose **Production - Setup Data Only** and then import your own business data, such as customers, items, and vendors. Choose the **New** template if you want to set up everything from scratch. In that case, you can use the **Company Setup** assisted setup guide to help you get started with essential setup data.  

> [!NOTE]  
> When you create a new company, it takes a few minutes before you can access it in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The setup status on the **Companies** page shows when the new company is ready for you. Then, you can switch to the new company by using **My Settings**.  

During your 30 day trial, you can create any number of new companies, but they're only available during your trial. For more information, contact your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] partner. See also the [Dynamics 365 Business Central trial FAQ](trial-faq.md) article.  

Your administrator can learn more about trials and subscriptions [here](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/trials-subscriptions).  

## Copy a company

On the **Companies** page, you can use the **Copy** action to create a second company based on the contents of an existing company. Copying a company is useful, for example, when you want to test a company without disrupting production data.

> [!Important]
> Don't use the Copy action to take a backup of a company. To take a backup, start by exporting the database as a .bacpac file. For more information, see [Exporting Databases](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/tenant-admin-center-database-export) in the development and administration help.

[!INCLUDE [email-copy-company](includes/email-copy-company.md)]

[!INCLUDE [dataverse-copy-company](includes/dataverse-copy-company.md)]

## Set up the company

When you sign in to a new company, the **Company Setup** assisted setup guide helps you get started. The guide asks for information about your business, such as the address, bank details, and inventory costing method. This information forms the basis for many areas in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] so you won't have to set them up manually.  

For example, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes your company address in invoices and other documents and your bank information in payments. The costing method is used to calculate prices and inventory valuation.  

After the basics are in place, you can set up the remaining core areas. Then, you're ready to add business data, such as customers and vendors. For more information, see [Set Up [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]](setup.md).  

## Companies and environments

[!INCLUDE [company_environment](includes/company_environment.md)]

For more information, see [Switching to Another Company or Environment](ui-organization-switch.md). For more information about environments, see [Understanding the Infrastructure of Business Central Online](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/tenant-environment-topology) (in English only).  

## Changing a company's name

After you create a company, you can't change its name. You can, however, change its **Display Name**, which is text that shows for the company throughout the application.  

> [!TIP]
> You can rename a company if you're using [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises.

## Add Contoso Coffee

The Contoso Coffee app provides demonstration data to help you explore the advanced capabilities of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Find the app in AppSource, and install it in an empty company, for example a company in a sandbox environment. For more information, see [Introduction to Contoso Coffee Demo Data](contoso-coffee/contoso-coffee-intro.md).

# Delivery date calculation for sales

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically calculates the earliest possible date that an item on a sales order line can be shipped.

* If the customer has requested a specific delivery date, then the date on which the items must be available to pick to meet that delivery date is calculated.
* If the customer doesn't request a specific delivery date, then the date on which the items can be delivered is calculated. The calculation starts from the date on which the items are available for picking.

## Calculating a requested delivery date

If you specify a requested delivery date on the sales order line, that date becomes the starting point for the following calculations.

- *requested delivery date - shipping time = planned shipment date*
- *planned shipment date - outbound whse. handling time = shipment date*

If the items are available to pick on the shipment date, then the sales process can continue. Otherwise, a stock-out warning is displayed.

> [!NOTE]
> If your process is based on backward calculation, for example, if you use the requested delivery date to get the planned shipment date, we recommend you use date formulas with fixed durations, such as "5D" for five days or "1W" for one week. Date formulas without fixed durations, such as "CW" for current week or CM for current month, can result in incorrect date calculations.

## Calculating the earliest possible delivery date

If you don't specify a requested delivery date on the sales order line, or if the requested delivery date can't be met, then the earliest date on which the items are available is calculated. That date is then entered in the **Shipment Date** field on the line, and the date on which you plan to ship the items and the date on which they'll be delivered to the customer are calculated using the following formulas.

- *shipment date + outbound whse. handling time = planned shipment date*
- *planned shipment date + shipping time = planned delivery date*

# Allocate Resources
The key element to service management is the people who supply service. You can set up [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to assign the appropriate people to the appropriate projects. Assignments can be based on service zones where the people are located or where the service occurs. In addition, you can group resources together when responding to service requests. For more information, see [Set Up Resource Allocation](service-how-setup-resource-allocation.md).

You can allocate resources, for example, technicians, by using the **Dispatch Board**, or from a service order. You can use resource availability to allocate resources to perform the service tasks in the orders or quotes.

You can allocate the same resource, for example, a technician, or resource group to all the service items in a service order. Allocation entries are created for the other service items in the order with the same resource number and allocation date as the line you allocated. The allocated hours are the hours you allocated divided by the number of service items in the order. The **Status** field is automatically set to **Active** for all the entries that were created.

## To see an overview of service orders and service quotes  
You may often need to see the list of service orders or service quotes that meet certain requirements to be able to perform specific actions with them one by one. For example,you may need to allocate resources to service orders that belong to a specific customer.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Dispatch Board**, and then choose the related link.  
2. In the **Document Filter** field, choose the type of the documents you want to see.
3. To get a list of documents that contain service tasks a certain resource or resource group is allocated to, fill in the **Resource Filter** and **Resource Group Filter** fields and select <kbd>Enter</kbd>.  
4. To get a list of documents with a certain response date or response dates within a certain date period, fill in the **Response Date Filter** field and select <kbd>Enter</kbd>.  
5. To get a list of documents with a specified allocation state or document status, fill in the **Allocation Filter/Status Filter** field and select <kbd>Enter</kbd>.  
6. To get a list of documents that belong to a certain contract, customer, or zone, fill in the **Contract Filter/Customer Filter/Zone Filter** field and select <kbd>Enter</kbd>.  
7. Choose a line that corresponds to a service order or service quote, and then choose the **Show Document** action.  

    The **Service Order** or **Service Quote** page opens, and you can work with the document. To return to the **Dispatch Board** page, choose **OK**.

## To allocate a resource using resource or resource group availability    
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Dispatch Board**, and choose the related link.  
2. Choose the service order, and then choose the **Resource Allocations** action.  
3. Choose the entry with the service task to which you want to allocate a resource.  
4. Choose either the **Resource Availability** or **Res. Group Availability** action.  
5. On the **Res. Availability (Service)** page, choose **Show Matrix**.  
6. Choose a resource to allocate. You can base your selection on whether the resource is skilled for the task, whether it is located in the customer zone, and/or whether it is preferred by the customer.  
7. Specify a date on which the resource has enough available hours for the task, and which is close to the response date of the service order.  
8. In the **Qty. to Allocate** field, enter the number of hours you want to allocate the resource to the service task for.  
9. Choose the **Allocate** action to allocate the selected resource on the selected date.  

     The **Status** field is automatically set to **Active**.  

 Repeat these steps for each date that you want to allocate the resource to the service task.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  For a service item in a service order, there can only be **Active** allocation entries with one resource or resource group at a time.  

## To allocate a resource using a service order  
After you have created and filled in a service order or service quote, you can allocate resources, for example, technicians, to perform service tasks registered as service item lines in the document.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the service order, and then choose **Edit**.  
3. Choose the service item line corresponding to the service task you want to allocate a resource to.  
4. Choose **Resource Allocations**.
5. On the **Resource Allocations** page, choose a nonactive allocation entry with the service task you want to allocate the resource to. If the allocation entry does not exist, you can create a new one by choosing **New**.  
7. Specify the service task by filling in the **Service Item No.** field on the same line.  
8. In the **Resource No.** field, choose the resource. If the resource is a member of a resource group, the number of the resource group is entered automatically into the **Resource Group No.** field.  
9. Fill in the **Allocation Date** and **Allocated Hours** fields. The **Status** field is set to **Active**. This means that the resource is allocated to the service task.  
10. Optionally, to assign the resource to all items, choose **Allocate to All Service Items**.

> [!NOTE]  
>  For a service item in a service order, there can only be active allocation entries with one resource or resource group at a time.

## To reallocate resources on a service order  
You can reallocate resources directly from a service order or service quote when you are working with it. The original entry will still exist, but its status is updated as follows:  

* If service was started while the allocation was **Active**, that is, if the repair status of the service item in the entry was changed to **In Process**, the allocation status changes from **Reallocation Needed** to **Finished**.  
* If service was not started while the allocation was **Active**, allocation status changes from **Reallocation Needed** to **Canceled**.  
* If you are reallocating a service order that you have converted from a quote, the status of the allocation entries registered for the quote always changes to **Finished** when you reallocate the service items in the service order.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the relevant service order.  
3. Select the service item line corresponding to the service task you want to allocate a resource to, and then choose the **Resource Allocations** action.  
4. On the **Resource Allocations** page, select an allocation entry with the service task you want to reallocate the resource to. In the **Resource No.** field, select the relevant resource. This overwrites the resource number already in the field.  
5. Select <kbd>Enter</kbd>. A dialog box opens, asking whether you want to reallocate this entry. Fill in the **Reason Code** field if appropriate and choose the **Yes** button to confirm the reallocation.  
6. Fill in the **Allocation Date** and **Allocated Hours** fields. The entry now contains the new resource and its status is **Active**.

## To reallocate a resource using the dispatch board  
If the resource allocated to a service task cannot accomplish the work, it means that this service task needs reallocation. Usually you reallocate resources to a service task by using the **Dispatch Board**.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Dispatch Board**, and then choose the related link.  
2. In the **Allocation Filter** field, select **Reallocation Needed**. The **Dispatch Board** page now shows the list of service orders that include service tasks that need reallocation.  
3. Select the relevant service order, and then choose the **Resource Allocations** action. The **Resource Allocations** page opens.  
4. Select the allocation entry with the service task you want to reallocate a resource to.  
5. In the **Resource No.** field, select the relevant resource. It overwrites the resource number already in the field.  
6. Select <kbd>Enter</kbd>. The **Reallocation Entry Reasons** dialog box opens, asking whether you want to reallocate this entry. Fill in the **Reason Code** field if appropriate and choose the **Yes** button to confirm the reallocation.  
7.  Fill in the **Allocation Date** and **Allocated Hours** fields. The entry now contains the new resource and its status is **Active**.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  The old entry still exists but the status is updated in the following ways:  
    >   
    >  * If service was started while the allocation was **Active**, that is, if the repair status of the service item in the entry was changed to **In Process**, the allocation status changes from **Reallocation Needed** to **Finished**.  
    > * If service was not started while the allocation was **Active**, the allocation status changes from **Reallocation Needed** to **Canceled**.  
    > * If you are reallocating a service order that you have converted from a quote, the status of the allocation entries registered for the quote always changes to **Finished** when you reallocate the service items in the service order.  

## To register resource hours  
When working on service items in service orders, you need to register the resource hours used for the service. The following procedure shows how to register the resource hours on the **Service Item Worksheet** page.  

You can use the same procedure to register the hours on the **Service Lines** page, which you can open from the Service Order page. Open the relevant service card, and then choose the **Service Lines** action.  

If the same resource works on all the service items in the service order, you can register the total resource hours for one service item only and then split the resource line to assign the resource hours to the other service items.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Tasks**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the line that includes the relevant service item, and then choose the **Item Worksheet** action.  
3. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

## To assign a resource to all service items in an order
If the same resource, for example a technician, works on all the service items in the service order, you can register the total resource hours for one service item only and then split the resource line to divide the resource hours onto the resource lines for the other service items.  

The following procedure shows how to split resource lines on the **Service Invoice Lines** page.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the relevant service order.  
3. On the **Lines** FastTab, choose the **Service Lines** action. The **Service Lines** page opens.  
4. Select the resource line you want to split. The contents of the **Quantity** field is divided between all the service items in the order.  
5. Choose the **Split Resource Line** action. Choose **Yes** to confirm.  

    Resource lines for the other service items in the order are created with the same resource number as the line you split. The quantity is the quantity for the line you split divided by the number of service items in the order.  

## To cancel an allocation  
You can cancel resource allocations for service tasks without reallocating the tasks.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Dispatch Board**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the service order, and then choose the **Resource Allocations** action.  
3. Choose the allocation entry with the service task that you want to cancel allocation for.  
4. Choose the **Cancel Allocation** action.  
5. In the **Reason Code** field, select the appropriate reason code.  
6. Choose **Yes** to confirm the cancellation.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > In the **Status** field, the **Reallocation Needed** option is automatically selected. If the repair status of the service item in the entry is **Initial**, the repair status is changed to **Referred**, that is, no service has been started. If the repair status is **In Process**, it is changed to **Partly Serviced**, that is, some service has been completed.

# The Microsoft Pay extension

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Effective February 8 2020, changes in the Microsoft Pay service will affect the Microsoft Pay extension in Microsoft [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_long.md)]. Due to the changes, after February 8, the **Pay now** payment links that the Microsoft Pay extension generates for invoices in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will not open Microsoft Pay. Customers who are using the extension should change their Payment Services setup to start using the PayPal extension instead.<br /></br>
>
> From January 8, we will display a notification in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The notification will contain a link to the settings that you need to change and to more information. After February 8, the Microsoft Pay extension will no longer be available in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].<br /></br>
>
> The changes impact the following versions of Business Central:
> - Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central October 2018
> - Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central April 2019
> - Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central 2019 Release Wave 2

Customers continuously require higher customer service, both in terms of the quality of product but also in terms of delivery and payment services. The Microsoft Pay service helps you increase your customer service.

The Microsoft Pay extension adds a Microsoft Pay link to your sales documents so customers can easily pay using Microsoft Pay. Then you can send the documents by email to provide higher customer service and shorten the time it takes for customers' payments to arrive on your bank account.

The Microsoft Pay extension provides the following benefits:
- Customer payments appear faster on your bank account.
- Customers have more ways to pay invoices.
- Microsoft Pay offers a trustworthy payment service, which customers prefer to entering credit card information on unknown web sites.
- Microsoft Pay offers multiple ways of handling payments, including credit card processing, such as PayPal and Stripe.
- The Microsoft Pay link can be embedded automatically on every invoice document or by the user.
- Because this functionality is built as an extension, it gives you full control to enable it when and if your business processes require it.

Enabling payment service extensions is free in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], however, you'll need to contact the payment service to get an account. For more information, see [Enable Customer Payment Through Payment Services](sales-how-enable-payment-service-extensions.md).

# Create Service Quotes
You can think of service quotes as the basis for service orders. In fact, they are almost identical. They both contain information such as who the customer is, the type of order, the item that needs service, billing and shipping information, and information about the actual service work.
 
You can use a service quote as a preliminary draft for a service order, and then convert the quote to a service order.  
  
## To create a service quote  
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Quotes**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Create a new service quote.  
3. In the **No.** field, enter a number for the service quote. Alternatively, if you have set up a number series for service quotes on the **Service Mgt. Setup** page, you can select <kbd>Enter</kbd> to select the next available service quote number.  
4. In the **Customer No.**  field, select the relevant customer from the list.  

  > [!Note]  
  >  The customer fields are filled in automatically with information from the **Customer** card. If a **Customer** card does not exist for the customer, and you have set up a customer template, you can create the customer from the service quote. Fill in the relevant fields, and then choose the **Create Customer** action.  
  
5. Depending on the settings on the **Mandatory Fields** FastTab on the **Service Mgt. Setup** page, you may need to fill in the **Service Order Type** field and the **Salesperson Code** field.  
6. Fill in the service item lines.  
7. Register estimated costs on the service lines.

# Understanding WIP methods in project management

As a project progresses, materials, resources, and other expenses are consumed and must be posted to the project. Work in Process (WIP) is a feature that enables you to estimate the financial value of projects in the general ledger while the projects are ongoing. In many cases, you might post expenses for a project before invoicing a project. When only expenses are posted, your financial statement is inaccurate.

To track the value in the general ledger, you can calculate WIP and post the value to the general ledger. For more information, see [Monitor Project Progress and Performance](projects-how-monitor-progress-performance.md).

Out of the box, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports the following methods of calculating and recording the value of work in process.

| WIP Method | Description | Recognized Costs | Recognized Sales |
| --- | ------- |--- | --- |
| Cost Value |Recognizes cost when the customer is invoiced. Recognizes sales based on the invoiced sales. |Cost Value|Contract (Invoice Price)|
| Cost of Sales |Recognizes cost when the customer is invoiced. Recognizes sales based on the invoiced sales.|Cost of Sales|Contract (Invoiced Price)|
| Sales Value |Recognizes costs as they're reported. Recognizes sales proportionally to the reported costs.|Usage (Total Cost)|Sales Value|
| Percentage of Completion |Recognizes costs as they're reported. Recognizes sales proportionally to the reported costs.|Usage (Total Cost)|Percentage of Completion|
| Completed Contract |No sales or costs are part of the WIP calculation. Completed contract doesn't recognize revenue and costs until the project is complete. For example, this option is useful when there's high uncertainty around the estimates of costs and revenue for the project.|At Completion|At Completion|

Exact formulas and general ledger transactions are defined by the selection in the [**Recognized Cost**](#recognized-cost) and [**Recognized Sales**](#recognized-sales) fields.

## Create a project WIP method

Create a project WIP method that meets the needs of your organization and set it as the default.  

> [!NOTE]
> After you use a method to create WIP entries, you can't modify or delete the method.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Project WIP Methods**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action, select the appropriate values for the **Recognized Costs** and **Recognized Sales** fields, and then fill in the other fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  
3. Close the page.
4. To make this method the default, choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **projects setup**, and then choose the related link.  
5. In the **Default WIP Method** field, choose the method from the list.

### Recognized cost

| Recognized Cost | Recognized Cost Calculation Formula | General Ledger Entries |
| --- | --- | ---------- |
|At Completion|0 (Zero)|Dt **Recognized Costs Account** Cr **WIP Costs Account** </br>Amount: RecognizedCost </br></br>Dt **WIP Costs Account** Cr **Project Costs Applied Account** </br>Amount: MAX[RecognizedCost; Actual (Total Cost)]|
|Cost of Sales|Actual (Total Cost) - Budget (Total Costs) * Invoiced%, where:</br></br> Invoiced% = Invoiced (Total Price) / Billable (Total Price)</br></br>**Note:** This calculation requires that the Billable (Total Price) and Budget (Total Costs) are correctly entered for the whole project.|Dt **Recognized Costs Account** Cr **WIP Costs Account** </br>Amount: RecognizedCost </br></br>Dt **WIP Costs Account** Cr **Project Costs Applied Account** </br>Amount: MAX[RecognizedCost; Actual (Total Cost)] </br></br>Dt **Project Costs Adjustment Account** Cr **WIP Accrued Costs Account** </br>Amount: RecognizedCost – Actual (Total Cost), If RecognizedCost > Actual (Total Cost)|
|Cost Value|Actual (Total Cost) – [Completion% – Invoiced%] * Billable (Total Price) * BudgetCostPriceRatio, where: </br></br> BudgetCostPriceRatio = Budget(Total Cost) / Budget (Total Price)</br>Invoiced% = Invoiced (Total Price) / Billable (Total Price)</br>Completion% = Actual (Total Cost)/Budget (Total Cost)</br></br>**Note:** This calculation requires that the Billable (Total Price), Budget ( Total Price), and Budget (Total Costs) be correctly entered for the whole project.|Dt **Recognized Costs Account** Cr **WIP Costs Account** </br>Amount: RecognizedCost</br></br>Dt **WIP Costs Account** Cr **Project Costs Applied Account** </br>Amount: MAX[RecognizedCost; Actual (Total Cost)] </br></br>Dt **Project Costs Adjustment Account** Cr **WIP Accrued Costs Account** </br>Amount:	RecognizedCost – Actual (Total Cost), If RecognizedCost > Actual (Total Cost)|
|Contract (Invoiced Cost)|Invoiced (Total Cost) |Dt **Recognized Costs Account** Cr **WIP Costs Account** </br>Amount: RecognizedCost </br></br> Dt **WIP Costs Account** Cr **Project Costs Applied Account** </br>Amount: MAX[RecognizedCost; Actual (Total Cost)] </br></br>Dt **Project Costs Adjustment Account** Cr **WIP Accrued Costs Account**	</br>Amount: RecognizedCost – Actual (Total Cost), If RecognizedCost > Actual (Total Cost)|
|Usage (Total Cost)|Actual (Total Cost) |Dt **Recognized Costs Account** Cr **WIP Costs Account** </br>Amount: RecognizedCost </br></br>Dt **WIP Costs Account** Cr **Project Costs Applied Account** </br>Amount: MAX[RecognizedCost; Actual (Total Cost)]|

When project status is changed to Completed, the **Calculate WIP** task reverts the WIP transaction and posts instead.

Dt **Recognized Cost Account** Cr **Project Cost Applied Account** , Amount: **Actual (Total Cost)**

> [!NOTE]
> Depending on the selection in the **WIP Posting Method Used** field, the **Item Cost Applied Account**, **Resource Cost Applied Account**, or **G/L Cost Applied Account** could be used instead of **Project Cost Applied Account**. For more information, see [Project posting groups](projects-how-setup-jobs.md#to-set-general-information-for-projects).

### Recognized sales

| Recognized Sales | Recognized Sales Calculation Formula | General Ledger Entries |
| --- | --- | ---------- |
|At Completion|0 (Zero)|Dt **WIP Invoiced Sales Account** Cr **Recognized Sales Account** </br>Amount: RecognizedSales</br></br>Dt **Project Sales Applied Account** Cr **WIP Invoiced Sales Account** </br>Amount: Invoiced (Total Price)|

|Sales Value| Actual (Total Price) * Billable (Total Price)/Budget (Total Price)</br></br>**Note:** This calculation requires that the Billable (Total Price) and Budget (Total Price) are correctly entered for the whole project.|Dt **WIP Invoiced Sales Account** Cr **Recognized Sales Account** </br>Amount: RecognizedSales</br></br>Dt **Project Sales Applied Account** Cr **WIP Invoiced Sales Account** </br>Amount: MAX[RecognizedSales; Invoiced (Total Price)]</br></br>Dt **WIP Accrued Sales Account** Cr **Project Sales Adjustment Account** </br>Amount: MAX[RecognizedSales; Invoiced (Total Price)] - Invoiced (Total Price)|

When the project status is changed to Completed, the **Calculate WIP** task reverts the WIP transaction and posts instead.

# Detecting Mandatory Fields

When you enter data, you might see a red asterisk next to a field. The asterisk means that the field is required for a certain process. For example, you're about to post a transaction, but you've not filled in an important field.

The visual clue doesn't force you to fill in the field. The red asterisk is a reminder that you're blocked from completing a process.

## Examples

On the **Customer Card** page, the red asterisk appears in the **Name** field, in the **Tax Area Code** field, and in the posting group fields to indicate that you can't post a sales transaction for the customer unless the fields are filled.

On the **Item Card** page, the red asterisk appears in the **Description** field to indicate that you can't enter the item on a document line, such as a sales order, unless this field is filled.

# Column definitions in Financial Reporting

Use column definitions to specify the columns to include in a report. For example, you can design a report layout to compare net change and balance for the same period this year and last year. You can have up to 15 columns in a column definition. For example, multiple columns are useful for displaying budgets for 12 months with a column that shows the total.

## Create a new column definition

To create a new column definition, follow these steps:

1. On the **(Financial Report) Column Definitions** page, choose the **New** action.
1. Provide a unique name for the definition.
1. In the **Description** field, provide a descriptive name for the definition. This description provides context when you use the definition, but doesn't show on the report.
1. Provide an internal description for the definition.

## Edit the content of a column definition

To edit the content of a column definition, follow these steps.

> [!NOTE]
> Printed, previewed, and saved versions of a financial report display a maximum of five columns. In contrast, if a financial report is only meant for analysis on the **Financial Report** page, you can create as many columns as you want.

1. On the **(Financial Report) Column Definitions** page, select the definition, and then choose the **Edit Column Definition** action.
1. On the **Column Definition** page, create a row for each column of financial data that should show in the financial report. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
1. Choose **OK**.

> [!TIP]
> Open the **Financial Report** page from time to time to verify that the new column definition works as intended.

## Built-in column definitions

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides sample column definitions that can help you to quickly get started setting up finance reports that suit your needs.

<!-- update this when we release the new templates in 24.1
| Column definition code | Description | How to use this column definition | 
| ------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------ | 
| TBA 1 | TBA 1 | TBA 1 |
| TBA 2 | TBA 2 | TBA 2 |
| TBA 3 | TBA 3 | TBA 3 |
| TBA 4 | TBA 4 | TBA 4 |
-->

## Example: Create a column definition to calculate percentages

You might want to include a column in a financial report to calculate percentages of a total. For example, if you have rows that break down sales by dimension, you might want a column to indicate the percentage of total sales in each row.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 2.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Financial Reports**, then choose the related link.
1. On the **Financial Reports** page, select a financial report.  
1. Choose the **Edit Financial Report** action to set up a financial report row to calculate the total on which the percentages are based.  
1. Add a line immediately above the first row for which you want to display a percentage.  
1. Fill in the fields on the line as follows: 
    1. In the **Totaling Type** field, enter **Set Base for Percent**. 
    1. In the **Totaling** field, enter a formula for the total that the percentage is based on. For example, if row 11 contains the total sales, enter **11**.  
1. Choose the **Edit Column Definition** action to set up a column.  
1. Fill in the fields on the line as follows. 
    1. In the **Column Type** field, select **Formula**. 
    1. In the **Formula** field, enter a formula for the amount you want to calculate a percentage for, followed by the percentage sign (%). So, if column number N contains the net change, enter **N%**.  
1. Repeat steps 4 through 7 for each group of rows you want to break down by percentage.

## Comparing accounting periods using period formulas

Your financial report can compare the results of different accounting periods, such as the past month versus the same month last year. To do that, open the **Column Definition** page, and personalize it by adding the **Comparison Period Formula** field as a column. Learn more at [Personalize Your Workspace](ui-personalization-user.md). You can then set that field to a period formula.  

An accounting period doesn't need to match the calendar. However, each fiscal year must have the same number of accounting periods, although each period can be different in length.  

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses the period formula to calculate the duration of the comparison period in relation to the period represented by the date filter on the report. The comparison period is based on the period of the start date of the date filter. The following table shows the abbreviations for period specifications.

| Abbreviation | Description                                                                           |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| P            | Period.                                                                                |
| LP           | Last period of a fiscal year, half-year, or quarter.                                   |
| CP           | Current period of a fiscal year, half-year, or quarter. Use CP in formulas to set the period that starts or ends the formula. For example, FY\[1..CP\] denotes the time from the beginning of the current fiscal year to the current period.|
| FY           | Fiscal year. For example, FY\[1..3\] denotes the first quarter of the current fiscal year. |

Examples of formulas:

| Formula | Description |
|-----|-----|
| \<Blank\>       | Current period. |
| \-1P            | Previous period.            |
| \-1FY\[1..LP\]  | Entire previous fiscal year.                  |
| \-1FY           | Current period in previous fiscal year.       |
| \-1FY\[1..3\]   | First quarter of previous fiscal year.        |
| \-1FY\[1..CP\]  | From the beginning of the previous fiscal year to the current period in the previous fiscal year, including both periods. |
| \-1FY\[CP..LP\] | From the current period in previous fiscal year to the last period of the previous fiscal year, including both periods.   |

To calculate by regular time periods, enter a formula in the **Comparison Date Formula** field instead. For example, if the field is set to -1Y, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] compares to the same period one year earlier.

> [!NOTE]
> It isn't always obvious which periods you're comparing because you can set a date filter on a report that spans dates that are different than the accounting periods in your chart of accounts. So, if you create a financial report where you want to compare this period to the same period last year, set the **Comparison Date Formula** field to **-1FY**. Then, run the report on **February 28th** and set the date filter to **January and February**. As a result, the financial report compares January and February this year to January last year, which is the only completed accounting period of the two for last year.  

Learn more at [Work with Calendar Dates and Times](ui-enter-date-ranges.md).

## Find the reports that use a column definition

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/introduced_in_2025rw1.md)]

Before you change a column definition, it can be helpful to know which reports use it so that you understand the effect of your change. To find out which reports use a column definition, follow these steps:

1. On the **(Financial Report) Column Definitions** page, select the definition, and then choose the **Edit Column Definition** action.
1. To open a list of reports that use the definition, choose the **Where-Used** action.

## Best practices for working with column definitions

<!-- [!INCLUDE [report-best-practices-column-defs](includes/report-best-practices-column-defs2.md)] -->

## Import or export financial report column definitions

Starting with the 2024 release wave 1 (version 24.1), you can import and export financial report column definitions as RapidStart configuration packages. For example, configuration packages are useful for sharing information with other companies. The package is created in a .rapidstart file, which compresses the contents.

> [!NOTE]
> When you import financial report column definitions, they replace existing records with the same names. The configuration package for a report definition won't overwrite any existing row or column definitions that are used in the report definition.

To import or export financial report column definitions, follow these steps:

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 4.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Column Definitions**, and then choose the related link.
1. Choose the row definition, and then choose the **Import Column Definition** or **Export Column Definition** action, depending on what you want to do.

# Payment practices report  

Authorities in some country/regions require large companies to report their payment practices and performance regarding how quickly they pay their vendors. For example, each year Swedish companies with 250 or more employees must report to the Swedish Companies Registration Office the payment times they have for purchases from smaller companies. Similar acts exist in the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand. The legislation is intended to protect smaller businesses from bearing financial burdens that late payments cause.

> [!NOTE]
> Only some countries currently require this type of reporting. Because the requirements are largely the same, this is a global feature that all countries/regions can use.  

You can base the report on different sources, and can sort vendors based on their size or defined payment terms. Companies can provide reports for vendors for the following information, as required by local authorities:  

- The average agreed payment period.  
- The average actual payment term.
- The percentage of invoices they paid within the agreed payment period.

You can select the period for which to run a calculation and to find details based on a grouping that you choose. For each of these groupings, you can find sourced entries.

## Generate the report

To run the **Payment Practices** report, use the following steps:

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that op the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Payment Practices**, and then select the related link. 
2. Select **New**.
3. On the **General** FastTab, enter values in the following fields:

   | Field | Description |
   |---------|-----------------------------------|
   | No. | Specify the number of the entry or record for the report. |
   | Aggregation Type | Specify how data is aggregated. If you choose **Period**, the report is covers the period defined in the **Starting Date** and **Ending Date** fields. If you choose **Company Size**, the report is based on the number of employees in the vendor company. **Note:** To use the **Company Size** option, you must first create sizes in the **Company Sizes** page and assign them to the relevant vendors in the **Company Size Code** field on the **Vendor Card** page.  |
   | Header Type | Specifies the source for entries in the payment practice, and you can choose Vendors, Customers or both. |
   | Starting Date | Specifies the starting date of the payment practice. |
   | Ending Date | Specifies the ending date of the payment practice. |

4. After you fill in the fields in the header, use the **Generate** action to generate the report data.

When you generate the report, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] fills in the **Generated On** and **Generated By** fields with the date and time it was generated and by whom, respectively.

## Edit the results

Based on the selection in the **Aggregation Type** field, you get different lines. You can change the values on the lines. If you do, the report is marked as **Modified Manually**.

## Review the calculations

To explore the calculations behind the values on the **Statistics** FastTab, choose the value in the field to open the **Payment Practice Data List** page.

## Print the report

To print the document, choose the **Print** action.

# Ad-hoc analysis of sustainability data

This article explains how to use the **Data Analysis** feature to analyze sustainability data directly from list pages and queries. You don't have to run a report or switch to another application, such as Excel. The feature provides an interactive and versatile way to calculate, summarize, and examine data. Instead of running reports using options and filters, you can add multiple tabs that represent different tasks or views on the data. Some examples are "Emission overview" or "Emission By Scope," or any other view you can imagine. To learn more about how to use the **Data Analysis** feature, go to [Analyze list and query data with analysis mode](analysis-mode.md).

Use the following list pages for ad-hoc analysis of sustainability data:

- [Sustainability Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=6220&layout=analysis)

## Sustainability ad-hoc analysis scenarios

Use the **Data Analysis** feature for quick fact checking and ad-hoc analysis:

- If you don't want to run a report.
- If a report for your specific need doesn't exist.
- If you want to quickly iterate to get a good overview on a part of your business.

The following sections provide examples of sustainability scenarios in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## Data foundation for ad-hoc analysis on sustainability

The information that you enter in a sustainability journal is temporary and you can change it while it's in the journal. When you post a sustainability journal, the information is transferred to sustainability ledger entries on individual sustainability accounts, where you can't change it. However, you can post reversing or correcting entries. The [Sustainability Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=6220) list page is the main data source for ad-hoc analysis of sustainability data.

To learn more about posting sustainability entries, go to [Record sustainability entries](finance-sustainability-journal.md).

# Set up basic warehouses with operations areas

If you have internal operation areas, such as production or assembly areas, you can use the following basic warehouse documents to record your warehouse activities:  

- **Inventory Movement** page.  
- **Inventory Pick** page.  
- **Inventory Put-away** page.

To use these documents, you must set up one or more of the following fields on the the **Location Card** page for the location:

- The **Bin Mandatory** field.
- The **Inventory Pick/Movement** option in the **Prod. Consumption Whse. Handling** field.
- The **Inventory Movement** option in the **Asm. Consumption Whse. Handling** field.
- The **Inventory Put-Away** in the **Prod. Output Whse. Handling** field.

> [!NOTE]
> You can still post output and consumption directly from the source documents and journals.  

To use these pages with internal operations such as to pick and move components to production, depending on how much control you need you must do some or all the following steps:  

- Enable the inventory pick, move, and put-away documents.  
- Define default bin structures for components and end items flowing to and from operation resources.  
- Make to- and from- bins that are dedicated to specific operation resources. Dedicated bins prevent the items from being picked for outbound documents.

Bin codes that are set up on location cards define a default warehouse flow for certain activities, such as components in an assembly department. Other functionality exists to make sure that when items are placed in a certain bin, they can't be moved or picked to other activities. To learn more, go to [To create dedicated component bins](warehouse-how-to-set-up-basic-warehouses-with-operations-areas.md#to-create-dedicated-component-bins).

The following procedures are based on setting up basic warehouse activities around a production area. The steps are similar for other operation areas, such as assembly, service management, and jobs.  

> [!NOTE]  
> The following procedures assume that the **Bin Mandatory** toggle is turned on for the location.  

## To enable inventory documents for internal operation activities

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Locations**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the location card you want to set up.  
3. On the **Warehouse** FastTab, select **Inventory Put-Away** in the **Prod. Output Whse. Handling** field to indicate that when someone releases an internal source document with a bin code, an inventory put-away or movement document can be created.  
4. To require that an inventory pick or an inventory movement document when you create an outbound or internal source document with a bin code, fill in the following fields:

   - In the **Prod. Consumption Whse. Handling field**, choose **Inventory Pick/Movement**.
   - In the **Asm. Consumption Whse. Handling** field, choose **Inventory Movement**.  

## To define a default bin structure in the production area

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Locations**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the Location you want to set up.  
3. On the **Bins** FastTab, in the **Open Shop Floor Bin Code** field, enter the code of the bin in the production area with plenty of components that the machine operator can consume from without requesting a warehouse activity to bring them to the bin. Items that are placed in this bin are typically set up for automatic posting, or flushing. This setup means that the **Flushing Method** field contains **Forward**, **Backward**, or **Manual**.  

   > [!TIP]
   > You can also record flushing without requiring a pick. For example, skipping the pick might be useful for components which, due to their nature, you store in the shop floor zone so there's no need to pick. However, you might still have to manually post consumption, for example, because the consumed quantity can vary or require item tracking. To flush without picking, the item must use the **Pick + Manual** flushing method. To learn more, go to [Flushing methods](production-how-to-flush-components-according-to-operation-output.md#flushing-methods).

4. In the **To-Production Bin Code** field, enter the code of the bin in the production area where components that are picked for production at this location are placed by default before they can be consumed. Items that are placed in this bin are typically set up for manual picking. The **Flushing Method** field contains **Pick + Forward**, **Pick + Backward**, or **Pick + Manual** for warehouse picks and inventory movements.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > When you use inventory picks, the **Bin Code** field on a production order component line defines the *take* bin from where components are decreased when posting consumption. When you use inventory movements, the **Bin Code** field on production order component lines defines the *place* bin in the operation area where the warehouse worker must place the components.  

5. On the **Bins** FastTab, in the **From-Production Bin Code** field, enter the code of the bin in the production area where finished end items are taken from by default when the process involves a warehouse activity. In basic warehouse configurations, the activity is recorded as an inventory put-away or an inventory movement.  

Now, production order component lines with the default bin code require that forward-flushed components are placed there. However, until the components are consumed from that bin, other component demands might pick or consume from that bin because they're still considered available bin contents. To make sure that bin content is only available to component demand that uses that to-production bin, you must select the **Dedicated** field on the line for that bin code on the **Bins** page that you open from the location card.

This flow chart shows how the **Bin Code** field on production order component lines is filled according to your setup.  

![Bin flow chart.](media/binflow.png "BinFlow")

## To define a default bin structure in the assembly area

Components for assembly orders can't be picked or posted with inventory picks. Instead, use the **Inventory Movement** page. To learn more, go to [Pick or move for Production, Assembly, or Jobs in Basic Warehouse](warehouse-how-to-pick-for-production.md).

When picking and shipping sales line quantities that are assembled to the order, you must follow certain rules when creating the inventory pick lines. To learn more, go to [Handling assemble-to-order items with inventory picks](warehouse-how-to-pick-items-with-inventory-picks.md#handling-assemble-to-order-items-with-inventory-picks).

To learn more, go to [Assembly Management](assembly-assemble-items.md).

### To set up that an inventory movement is automatically created when the inventory pick for the assembly item is created

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Assembly Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the **Create Movements Automatically** checkbox.

### To set up the bin in the assembly area where components are placed by default before they can be consumed in assembly

The value in this field is automatically inserted in the **Bin Code** field on assembly order lines when this location is entered in the **Location Code** field on the assembly order line.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Locations**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the Location you want to set up.
3. Fill in the **To-Assembly Bin Code** field.

### To set up the bin in the assembly area where finished assembly items are posted to when they're assembled to stock

The value in this field is automatically inserted in the **Bin Code** field on assembly order headers when this location code is filled into the **Location Code** field on the assembly order header.

Bin codes that are set up on location cards define a default warehouse flow for specific warehouse activities, such as consumption of components in an assembly area. Other functionality exists to make sure that when items are placed in a default bin, they can't be moved or picked to other activities.

> [!NOTE]
> This setup is only possible for locations where the **Bin Mandatory** field is selected.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Locations**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the Location you want to set up.
3. Fill in the **From-Assembly Bin Code** field.

### To set up the bin where finished assembly items are posted to when they're assembled to a linked sales order

From this bin, the assembly items are shipped immediately, via an inventory pick, to fulfill the sales order.

> [!NOTE]
> You can't use this field if the location is set up to use directed pick and put-away.

The bin code is copied from the sales order line to the assembly order header to communicate to assembly workers where to place the output to ready it for shipping. It's also copied to the inventory pick line to communicate to warehouse workers where to take it from to ship it.

> [!NOTE]
> The Assemble-to-Order Shipment bin is always empty. When you post an assemble-to-order sales line, then the bin content is first positively adjusted with the assembly output. Immediately after, it's negatively adjusted with the shipped quantity.

The value in this field is automatically inserted in the Bin Code field on sales order lines that contain a quantity in the **Qty. to Assemble to Order** field or if the item to be sold has **Assemble-to-Order** in the **Replenishment System** field.

If the **Asm.-to-Order Shpt. Bin Code** is blank, then the **From-Assembly Bin Code** field is used instead. If both setup fields are blank, then the last used bin with content is used in the **Bin Code** field on sales order lines.

The same bin code is in turn copied to the **Bin Code** field on the inventory pick line that manages the shipment of the assemble-to-order quantity. To learn more, go to [Handling assemble-to-order items with inventory picks](warehouse-how-to-pick-items-with-inventory-picks.md#handling-assemble-to-order-items-with-inventory-picks).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Locations**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the Location you want to set up.
3. Fill in the **Asm.-to-Order Shpt. Bin Code** field.

## To create dedicated component bins

You can specify that quantities in a bin are protected from being picked for other demands than demand from their current purpose.

Quantities in dedicated bins can still be reserved. Accordingly, the quantities in dedicated bins are included in the **Total Available Quantity** field on the **Reservation** page.

For example, is a work center is set up with a bin code in the **To-Production Bin Code** field. Production order component lines with that bin code require that forward-flushed components are placed there. However, until the components are consumed from that bin, other component demands might pick or consume from that bin because they're still considered available bin contents. To make sure that bin content is only available to component demand that uses that to-production bin, you must select the **Dedicated** field on the line for that bin code on the **Bins** page that you open from the location card.

Making a bin dedicated provides similar functionality to using bin types, which is only available in advanced warehousing. To learn more, go to [Set Up Bin Types](warehouse-how-to-set-up-bin-types.md).

> [!CAUTION]
> Items in dedicated bins are not protected when they are picked and consumed as production components with the Inventory Pick page.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Locations**, and then choose the related link. Select the location that you want to update.  
2. Choose the **Bins** action.  
3. Select the **Dedicated** field for each bin that you want to use exclusively for certain internal operations and where you want quantities to be reserved for that internal operation once placed there.  

> [!NOTE]  
> The bin must be empty before you can select or clear the **Dedicated** field.

# Use item charges to account for additional trade costs

To ensure correct valuation, your inventory items must carry any added costs, such as freight, physical handling, insurance, and transportation that you incur when purchasing or selling the items. For purchases, the landed cost of a purchased item consists of the vendor's purchase price and all other direct item charges that can be assigned to individual receipts or return shipments. For sales, knowing the cost of shipping sold items can be as vital to your company as knowing the landed cost of purchased items.

In addition to recording the added cost in your inventory value, you can use item charges for the following tasks:

* Identify the landed cost of an item for making more accurate decisions on how to optimize the distribution network.
* Break down the unit cost or unit price of an item for analysis purposes.
* Include purchase allowances into the unit cost and sales allowances into the unit price.

Before you can assign item charges, you must set up item charge numbers for the different types of item charges. The numbers include to which G/L accounts to post costs related to sales, purchases, and inventory adjustments. An item charge number contains a combination of general product posting group, tax group code, VAT product posting group, and item charge. When you enter the item charge number on a purchase or sales document, the G/L account is retrieved. The account retrieved is selected based on the setup of the item charge number and the information on the document.

For both purchase and sales documents, you can assign an item charge in two ways:

* On the document that lists the items that the item charge relates to. Typically, you do this for documents that aren't yet fully posted.
* On a separate invoice by linking the item charge to a posted receipt or shipment where the items that the item charge relates to are listed.

> [!NOTE]  
> You can assign item charges to orders, invoices, and credit memos, for both sales and purchases. The following procedures describe how to work with item charges for a purchase invoice. The steps are similar for all other purchase and sales documents.

## Example

This video shows how to handle an extra shipping cost as part of inventory costing.

> [!Video https://learn-video.azurefd.net/vod/player?id=35aa5336-39c8-46a2-b8eb-9ac925a17802]

## To set up item charge numbers

You use item charge numbers to distinguish between the different kinds of item charges.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Item Charges**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Item Charges** page, choose the **New** action to create a new line.
3. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

## To assign an item charge directly to the purchase invoice for the item

If you know the item charge when you post a purchase invoice for the item, follow this procedure.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Invoices**, and then choose the related link.
2. Create a new purchase invoice. For more information, see [Record Purchases](purchasing-how-record-purchases.md).
3. Make sure the purchase invoice has one or more lines of type Item.
4. On a new line, in the **Type** field, select **Charge (Item)**.
5. In the **Quantity** field, enter the units of the item charge that you're invoiced for.
6. In the **Direct Unit Cost** field, enter the amount of the item charge.
7. Fill in the remaining fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

    Do the following steps to perform the actual assignment. Until the item charge is fully assigned, the value in the **Qty. to Assign** field is in red font.
8. On the **Lines** tab, choose the **Item Charge Assignment** action.

    The **Item Charge Assignment** page opens showing one line for each line of type Item on the purchase invoice. To assign the item charge to one or more invoice lines, you can use a function that assigns and distributes it for you or you can manually fill in the **Qty. to Assign** field. The following steps describe how to use the Suggest Item Charge Assignment function.

9. On the **Item Charge Assignment** page, choose the **Suggest Item Charge Assignment** action.
10. If there are more than one invoice lines of type Item, choose one of the four distribution options.  

If the item charge is fully assigned, the value in the **Qty. to Assign** field on the purchase invoice is zero.

The item charge is now assigned to the purchase invoice. When you post the receipt of the purchase invoice, the items' inventory values are updated with the cost of the item charge.  

## To assign an item charge from a separate invoice to the purchase invoice for the item

If you received an invoice for the item charge after you posted the original purchase receipt, follow this procedure.

1. Repeat steps 1 through 8 in [To assign an item charge directly to the purchase invoice for the item](payables-how-assign-item-charges.md#to-assign-an-item-charge-directly-to-the-purchase-invoice-for-the-item).
2. On the **Item Charge Assignment** page, choose the **Get Receipt Lines** action.
3. On the **Purch. Receipt Lines** page, select the posted purchase receipt for the item that you want to assign the item charge to, and then choose the **OK** button.
4. Choose the **Suggest Item Charge Assignment** action.

The item charge on the separate purchase invoice is now assigned to the item on the posted purchase receipt, thereby updating the item's inventory value with the cost of the item charge.

## Handle item charges for partial receipts

Let's explore an example of how to handle item charges for a partial receipt.

You have a purchase order with three lines:

* Two lines are for items.
* One line captures item charges allocated across the items by amount.

When the items are delivered, you find that one of the items is missing, so you can't mark that line as received. You can receive and post the purchase invoice for the second item only, and deal with the missing item later.

To handle the item cost for the partial receipt, on the **Item Charge Assignment** page, enter **0** in the **Quantity to Handle** field on the line for the missing item. Then, copy the value from the **Item Charge Qty. to Handle** field to the **Quantity to Invoice** field on the purchase order lines.

When you're ready to handle the item that was missing, update the **Quantity to Handle** field and post the order.

# Set up inventory valuation and costing

To make sure that inventory costs are recorded correctly, you must set up various fields and pages before you begin to make item transactions. Typically, businesses choose a specific costing method and apply that to inventory items, for example, to help them track the value of items on stock.  

> [!TIP]
> For an introduction to costing in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], see [About Inventory Costing](finance-learn-about-costing.md).

The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the articles that describe them.

|**To**|**See**|  
|------------|-------------|
|Specify a default costing method for the company to govern how incoming cost is used to assess inventory value and the cost of goods sold.|[Set Up General Inventory Information](inventory-how-setup-general.md)|  
|Specify a costing method on individual items if they require a different costing method.|[Register New Items](inventory-how-register-new-items.md)|

# Validate VAT Registration Numbers

It is important that the VAT registration numbers you have for customers, vendors, and contacts are valid, if you use [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in a country/region that uses VAT. For example, companies sometimes change their tax liability status, and in some countries/regions tax authorities might ask you to provide reports, such as the **EC Sales List** report, that list the VAT registration numbers you use when you do business.

The European Commission provides the VIES VAT Number Validation service on its website, which is public and free. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can save you a step and let you use the VIES service to validate and track VAT numbers and other company information for customers, vendors, and contacts. The service in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is named **EU VAT Reg. No. Validation Service**. The service is available on the **Service Connections** page, and you can start using it right away. The service connection is free, and additional sign up is not required.

## Configure the service to verify VAT registration numbers automatically

To enable the **EU VAT Reg. No. Validation Service**, open the entry in the **Service Connection** page. If the **Service Endpoint** field is not already filled in, use the **Set Default Endpoint** action. Then set the **Enabled** field, and you are good to go.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To enable the validation service, you must have administrator permissions.

Optionally, set up templates for the types of VAT-related data that you want the service to also check. For more information, see the [Validation templates](#validation-templates) section.

When you use our service connection, we record a history of VAT numbers and verifications for each customer, vendor, or contact, in the **VAT Registration Log**, so you can easily track them. The log is specific to each customer. For example, the log is useful for proving that you have verified that the current VAT number is correct. When you verify a VAT number, the **Request Identifier** column in the log will reflect that you have taken action.

You can view the VAT Registration log on the Customer, Vendor, or Contact cards, on the **Invoicing** FastTab, by choosing the lookup button in the **VAT Registration No.** field.  

There are a couple of things to note about the VIES VAT Number Validation service:

* The service uses the http protocol, which means that data transferred through the service is not encrypted.  
* You may experience downtime for this service for which Microsoft is not responsible. The service is part of a broad EU network of national VAT registers.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> It is your responsibility to check that the data is valid. On occasion, data with errors is returned by the VIES VAT Number Validation service. If validation fails, validate the VAT registration numbers on the [web site](https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/vies/), print the result or save it to a shared location, and then add the link to the record for your customer, vendor, or contact. For more information, see [Manage Attachments, Links, and Notes on Cards and Documents](ui-how-add-link-to-record.md).

## Validation templates

You can use the VIES service to also check other company information, such as the address, as well as the VAT registration number. In the **VAT Reg. No. Validation Templates** page, create an entry for each country/region that you want to get further validation for, and then specify the information that you want to get validated automatically.  

For example, add an entry for Spain where you want to get validation for name, street, city, and post code, and then another entry for Germany where you just want validation for post code, for example. Then, in the **EU VAT Registration No. Validation Service Setup** page, specify the default template.  

> [!NOTE]
> Always make sure that the default template works for your needs. You can change the default to match your requirements, such as get validation for all fields or no fields.

The next time that you specify a VAT registration number, the service validates the number and any additional data as determined by your validation templates. If the specified values are different from the values that are returned by the service, you will see the details in the **Validation Details** page where you can accept or reset the values.

# Use time sheets

This article describes how to use time sheets to track absence, and to track time and resources that are spent on a project. Tracking time helps you identify issues early and avoid delays or cost overruns. Time sheets make it easy for a resource to report time usage for an individual or a machine so that managers can review the usage and its allocation.

You can copy and use your project planning lines in a time sheet. In that way, you must only enter the information in one place and the line information is always correct. To learn more, go to [To copy project planning lines to a time sheet](#copy-project-planning-lines-to-a-time-sheet).

After you approve time sheet entries for a project, you can post them to the relevant project journal or resource journal. To learn more, go to [To post time sheet lines in a project journal](#post-time-sheet-lines-in-a-project-journal) and [To post time sheet lines in a resource journal](#post-time-sheet-lines-in-a-resource-journal).

Before you can use time sheets, you must set up general information and specify an administrator and one or more approvers of time sheets. To learn more about setting up time sheets, go to [Set Up Time Sheets](projects-how-setup-time-sheets.md).  

> [!TIP]
> You can use time sheets on a mobile device. To do that, you might have to turn on the **Use New Time Sheet Experience** toggle on the [Resources Setup](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=462) page.

## Create time sheets

You can use the **Create Time Sheets** page to set up time sheets for a specified number of time periods or weeks. Then, the time sheet owner can open it and record time that has been spent on a task. You can also [schedule the batch job to run automatically](ui-work-report.md#ScheduleReport).  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must have permissions to create time sheets. To learn more about permissions, go to [Set Up Time Sheets](projects-how-setup-time-sheets.md).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Create Time Sheets**, and then choose the related link.

    > [!TIP]
    > You can also use the **Create Time Sheets** action on the **Resources** list page and the **Resource Card** page.
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

    > [!NOTE]  
    > Before you create time sheets for a resource, make sure that the **Use Time Sheet** and **Time Sheet Owner User ID** fields are specified for them on the **Resource Card** page.

    Optionally, choose the **Schedule** action to specify how often to automatically run the task. For example, to configure the task to run weekly for four weeks, on the **Schedule a Report - Create Time Sheets** page, in the **Next Run Date Formula** field, enter **4W**. To learn more about how to schedule reports, go to [Scheduling a Report to Run](ui-work-report.md#ScheduleReport).  

You can view the time sheets that you create on the **Time Sheets** page. Each time sheet consists of one or more lines that define the time that you want to submit for approval. The following table describes the types of lines that you can add to the time sheet.

| **Field** | **Description** |
|---|---|
| | Use to add a note or marker in the **Description** field of the time sheet line. For example, you can use this field to categorize time sheet entries. If you leave the **Type** field empty for a time sheet line, you can't enter time values in the weekday fields for that line. |
| Absence | Use to register the time you're absent during a work week. To complete the information for the line, specify the type of absence in the **Cause of Absence Code** field. |
| Assembly Order | Used to register time for assembly orders. A time sheet line of this type is created while posting assembly order lines for which the resource is set up to use time sheets. You can't manually select a line of this type. |
| Project | Use to register time usage for a project. To complete the information for the line, specify the project number and the project task number for which you want to register time. You can register time for lines that you haven't scheduled.|
| Resource | Use to register time usage for a resource. To complete the information for the line, provide a description of the work. |
| Service | Use to register time usage for a service order or service credit memo. |

For example, you want to submit a time sheet for a week where you did cleaning tasks and had a day off for a medical appointment. The following table shows how you would add lines to the time sheet.

| Type | Description | Work Type Code | Absence Type Code |
|--|--|--|--|
| Resource | Work hours | Cleaning |  |
| Absence | Time off |  | Health |
|  | I had to take off Tuesday due to a medical appointment. |  |  |

In this hypothetical example, you can then register the hours across the relevant days for each weekday.  

> [!TIP]
> In most cases, your company will have predefined work types for the various types of lines. In those cases, you just choose the relevant work type from the list, and then you add your own description.  
>
> Choose the work type by choosing the :::image type="icon" source="media/assist-edit-icon.png" border="false"::: button in the **Description** field, by choosing the **Activity Details** action and then specifying it in the page that opens, or by choosing it in the **Work Type Code** field or the **Absence Type Code** field, respectively. In this case, you can ignore the [To define work types and add one to a time sheet](#define-work-types-and-add-one-to-a-time-sheet) section.  

## Reuse time sheet lines in other time sheets

If your time sheet information remains the same from time period to time period, copy the lines from the previous time period to save time. Then, just enter your time usage for the new period.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Time Sheets**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the time sheet for a period later than the period for an existing time sheet with lines.  
3. Choose the **Copy Lines from Previous Time Sheet** action.

The lines are copied, including details such as type and description. For example, if the line is related to a project, the **Project No.** is copied. All copied lines have the status **Open**. You can now modify the lines as needed.

## Copy project planning lines to a time sheet

The following procedure describes how to quickly add project planning lines to a time sheet.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Time Sheets**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Time Sheets** page, select a time sheet for the relevant time period.  
3. Choose the **Create lines from project planning** action. Any project planning lines in the time sheet time period are copied to the time sheet for the person or machine in the **Resource No.** field on the time sheet.

## Define work types and add one to a time sheet

You can define the work type for all-time sheet lines for service orders, project orders, and resources. In this way, you can add information that you need to bill the customer for different types of work.  

1. On the **Time Sheets** page, choose the relevant time sheet.
2. On the first of the lines in the **Lines** section, choose the **Type** field, and then choose the relevant type, such as *Resource*.  
3. Choose the **Description** field, and then, in the **Time Sheet Line Resource Detail** page, fill in the fields. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  
    1. If no work types exist, choose the **New** action.
    2. On the **Work Types** page, fill in the fields as necessary, and then return to the time sheet.
4. Fill in the rest of the time sheet. For more information, see the [To fill in time sheet lines and submit for approval](#fill-in-time-sheet-lines-and-submit-for-approval) section.  

> [!TIP]
> You can follow similar steps to define absence codes.

## Fill in time sheet lines and submit for approval

Time sheet registration is tracked in hours, the standard base unit of measure for resources. By default, a time sheet shows the common work days of Monday through Friday.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Time Sheets**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select a time sheet for the relevant period.
3. Fill in the fields on a line as necessary. Enter the number of hours used by the resource on each day of the week.  

    In most cases, to track work, you add a line of type *Resource*, and then register hours spent each day. If you want to register absence, add a line of type *Absence*.  

    > [!TIP]  
    > You can review the sum of time sheet hours entered in the **Actual/Budgeted Summary** FactBox.  
4. Repeat step 3 for other work types that the resource performs.  

    Next, decide whether to submit all, or selected, lines on the time sheet.  

    * To submit the time sheet for one or more lines, choose the relevant line, and then choose the **Submit** action.

        On the submission page, choose the **Selected lines only** option. The state of the line changes from **Open** to **Submitted**.
    * To submit the time sheet for all open lines, choose the **Submit** action at the top of the **Time Sheet** page.  

        Confirm that you want to submit all open lines on the current time sheet.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > You can only submit time sheet lines for which you have entered time.  
5. To modify information on a line that has been set to **Submitted**, select the line, and then choose the **Reopen** action.

    > [!NOTE]  
    > A manager might reject a time sheet line that is submitted for approval. If a line has the status **Rejected**, you can make changes to the line, and then choose **Submit** again.  
6. Choose the **OK** button.

## Approve or reject a time sheet

A time sheet must be submitted for approval before it can be used. You can approve and reject individual lines on a time sheet or send them back to the submitter. You approve a time sheet in two ways:

* A time sheet administrator can approve any time sheet.
* The person who is specified in the **Time Sheet Approver User ID** field on a resource card can approve that resource's time sheets. To learn more about setting up approval, go to [Set Up Time Sheets](projects-how-setup-time-sheets.md).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Manager Time Sheets**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select a time sheet from the list.  
3. On the **Time Sheet** page: 
    1. Choose the **Process** action, then choose the **Approve** action.
    2. Choose the **All submitted lines** action to approve all lines or the **Selected lines only** action to approve only the lines that are selected on the **Time Sheet** page.
4. Choose the **OK** button.  
5. Alternatively, choose the **Reject** action and follow steps 4 through 5.  

> [!TIP]  
> Use the **Time Sheet Status** and **Actual/Budgeted Summary** FactBoxes to get an overview of time sheet information.

After you approve or reject a time sheet, it can't be modified unless it's first reopened. The following procedure explains how to reopen an approved or rejected time sheet.

## Reopen a time sheet

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Manager Time Sheets** or **Time Sheets**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open a time sheet from the list.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > You can only reopen lines with the status **Approved**. You can't reopen lines with the status **Rejected** or that are posted.  
3. On the **Time Sheet** page, choose the **Reopen** action, and then choose the **All submitted lines** action to reopen all lines, or the **Selected lines only** action to reopen only the lines that are selected on the **Time Sheet** page.
4. Choose the **OK** button. The status of the time sheets line or lines is changes to **Submitted**.  

## View and approve time sheets by project

On a project, you can specify a person who is responsible for the project. That information is linked to time sheet lines. The link gives project managers a list of the time sheets to approve. For example, the team's project manager might be responsible for certain projects in your company. In that case, the manager should be designated as the **Person Responsible** on the Project Card page. This view of time sheet information shows the project tasks associated with a project and the quantity of hours used.

> [!NOTE]
> To approve time sheets on the **Manager Time Sheet by Project** page, you must first select a **Time Sheet by Project Approval** option in the **Resources Setup** page. To learn how to set up approvals for resources, go to [Set Up Resources](projects-how-setup-resources.md).

### Approve or reject a time sheet by project

1. In the **Search** box, enter **Manager Time Sheet by Project**, and then choose the related link. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] displays a list of time sheet lines associated with the projects for which you're responsible.
2. Choose the **Approve** action, and then choose the **All submitted lines** action to approve all lines or the **Selected lines only** action to approve only the lines that are selected on the **Time Sheet** page.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You can only approve time sheets with the status of **Submitted**.

3. To provide additional information about the approval or rejection, select the **Related** action, then **Comments**, and then **Line Comments**.
4. Choose the **OK** button.

> [!NOTE]
> After you approve or reject a time sheet line by project, you can't reopen or modify it on the **Time Sheet** page.

## Post time sheet lines in a resource journal

After you have approved time sheet entries for a resource, you can post them to the relevant resource journal.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Resource Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **Suggest Lines from Time Sheets** action.  
3. On the **Suggest Res. Jnl. Lines** page, in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

    > [!NOTE]  
    > Information about the work type and whether the work is chargeable is copied from the time sheet line. If needed, you can reduce the quantity of hours and do a partial posting. If you reduce the quantity, the next time you choose the **Suggest Lines From Time Sheets** action, the line will contain the remaining quantity of hours.  
5. Choose the **Post** action.  
6. To verify the posting, choose the **Ledger Entries** action. The **Project Ledger Entries** page opens showing the result of posting the resource journal.

## Archive time sheets

# Set up general fixed assets information

Before you can manage fixed assets (FA), you must set up default G/L accounts, allocation keys, and journal templates and batches to post and reclassify fixed assets. Also, define a classification hierarchy (classes and sub classes) to structure your assets and, if needed, define the locations where you store assets.

## To set up general behavior for fixed assets functionality

Define the general behavior of the fixed asset functionality and its document number series on the **Fixed Assets Setup** page.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Fixed Assets Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

## To set up fixed asset posting groups

Use posting groups to define groups of fixed assets. Entries for these posting groups post to the same general ledger accounts.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **FA Posting Groups**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.
3. On the **FA Posting Group Card** page, fill in the fields as necessary.

    > [!NOTE]  
    >   To make sure that balancing accounts for different fixed assets postings are automatically inserted when you choose the **Insert FA Bal. Account** action on journal lines, follow the next step, based on appreciation posting.
4. On the **Balancing Account** FastTab, in the **Appreciation Bal. Account** field, select the general ledger account to which you want to post balancing entries for appreciation.

For more information about using the **Insert FA Bal. Account** action on fixed asset G/L journal lines, see [Revalue Fixed Assets](fa-how-revalue.md).

## To set up fixed asset journal templates

A template is a predefined layout for a journal. The template contains information about trace codes, reports, and number series. For more information, see [Work with General Journals](ui-work-general-journals.md).

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically creates a fixed asset journal template the first time that you open the **Fixed Asset Journal** page, but you can set up other journal templates.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **FA Journal Templates**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary.

## To set up fixed asset class and subclass codes

In fixed assets, you can define a classification hierarchy that can be used to group assets. The hierarchy has two levels: classes and subclasses.

### Fixed asset class codes

Fixed asset classes are the top-level entries in the classification hierarchy in which you group assets. For example, use classes to divide assets into tangible or intangible assets. You must create at least one fixed asset class in your setup.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **FA Classes**, and then choose the related link.
2. Enter codes and names for the fixed asset classes that you want to create.

### Fixed asset subclass codes

Fixed asset subclasses are the second level entries in the classification hierarchy in which you group assets. Each subclass points to a top-level class. Use fixed asset subclass codes to group fixed assets in more specific categories, such as buildings, vehicles, furniture, or machinery. You must create at least one fixed asset subclass in your setup.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **FA Subclasses**, and then choose the related link.
2. Enter codes and names for the fixed asset subclasses that you want to create.

## Start to register assets

If you're using the fixed assets in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] for the first time, you must set up the general ledger application area before you set up fixed assets. How you do so depends on whether you integrate fixed assets with the general ledger.  

The following procedure is used if fixed asset transactions are to be posted to the general ledger.  

1. Complete the basic setups for fixed assets.  
2. Fill in a fixed asset card for each existing asset.  
3. Create a fixed asset depreciation book for each depreciation purpose (such as tax and financial statements). For each depreciation book, define the terms and conditions, such as integration with the general ledger.

    Enable general ledger integration by following the next steps. First, ensure that general ledger integration isn't enabled for all depreciation books, then post the opening entries, and finally, turn on general ledger integration.  
4. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Depreciation Books**, and then choose the related link.  
5. Select the relevant depreciation book, and then choose the **Edit** action to open the **Depreciation Book Card** page.
6. On the **Integration** FastTab, turn off all of the toggles. If you have more than one depreciation book, repeat this step for each one.  
7. In the fixed asset journal, enter the following lines for each asset:
   * A line with the acquisition cost.
   * A line with the accumulated depreciation to the end of the previous fiscal year.
   * A line with the accumulated depreciation from the start of the current fiscal year to the date that [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is set to start calculating the depreciation.

    If you have other opening balances you can also enter them now, such as write-down and appreciation.  
8. After you enter and post the journal lines for each asset, turn on general ledger integration in the
depreciation books.

If the fixed assets aren't integrated with the general ledger, skip steps six and eight.

## To set up fixed asset location codes (optional)

Fixed asset location codes define identifiers for where assets can be located, such as sales department, reception, administration, production, or warehouse. You can use them to register the location of a fixed asset. This information is useful for insurance and inventory purposes.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **FA locations**, and then choose the related link.
2. Enter codes and names for the fixed asset locations that you want to create.

## To set up fixed asset allocation keys (optional)

Use allocation keys to allocate transactions to various departments or projects. For example, you can set up an allocation key to allocate vehicle depreciation costs with 35 percent to the administration department and 65 percent to the sales department. For more information, see [Allocate Costs and Income](year-allocate-costs-income.md).

Allocation keys apply to fixed asset classes, not to individual assets.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **FA Posting Groups**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **FA Posting Groups** page, choose the **Allocations** action, and then choose a posting type.
3. On the **FA Allocations** page, fill in the fields as necessary.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for each posting type that you want to define allocation keys for.

## To set up fixed asset journal batches (optional)

You can set up multiple journal batches, which are individual journals for each journal template. For example, employees can have their own journal batch that uses the employee’s initials as the journal batch name. For more information, see [Work with General Journals](ui-work-general-journals.md).  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **FA Journal Templates**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the relevant journal template, and then choose the **Batches** action.
3. On the **FA Journal Batches** page, fill in the fields as necessary.

## To set up fixed asset reclassification journal templates (optional)

Use dedicated reclassification journals to transfer, split, or combine fixed assets. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically creates a fixed asset reclassification journal template the first time you open the **FA Reclass. Journal** page, but you can set up other reclassification journal templates. For more information, see [Work with General Journals](ui-work-general-journals.md).  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **FA Reclass. Journal Templates**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary.

## To set up fixed asset reclassification journal batches (optional)

You can set up multiple journal batches, which are individual journals for each reclassification journal template. For example, employees can have their own reclassification journal batch that uses the employee’s initials as the reclassification journal batch name. For more information, see [Work with General Journals](ui-work-general-journals.md).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **FA Reclass. Journal Templates**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the relevant journal template, and then choose the **Batches** action.
3. On the **FA Reclass. Journal Batches** page, fill in the fields as necessary.

# Privacy Notices Status in [!INCLUDE[prod_long](includes/prod_long.md)]

This article discusses what a privacy notice is and explains the purpose of the **Privacy Notices Status** page in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. You'll also learn how administrators can use this page.

## Privacy notice

A privacy notice states the data collection, data processing, and data privacy policies followed by the organizations's data controller. It's a document that describes what data is collected and for what purposes, how the user's data is processed, how it's being stored, and who to contact if a user wants to ask something about their data. 

## Privacy Notices Status page

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], if users want to integrate their data with Microsoft Exchange, Microsoft OneDrive, and Microsoft Teams, they must accept the privacy notice for each entity. Or an admin can approve the privacy notices on their behalf. Admins can see the status of privacy notices on the **Privacy Notices Status** page. You can find the **Privacy Notices Status** page in the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] by typing the name of the page in the search bar.  

On that page, you'll find a table with approval options for each of the services mentioned above. 

| Column | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- | 
| **Integration Name** | Name of the service, such as Microsoft OneDrive. |
| **Agree for All** | An admin approves the privacy notice for all users. |
| **Disagree for All** | An admin does not approve the privacy notice for all users. |
| **Let User Decide** | Users decide to approve the privacy notice for the service or not. |

> [!NOTE]
> You can only view the status of privacy notices on the main **Privacy Notices Status** page. To edit the responses, go to **Edit List** on the action bar of the page where options are now clickable and not greyed out.

## Privacy Notice Approvals

Admins can see individual approvals and manage them on the **Privacy Notice Approvals** subpage. Go to the *Action* bar of the **Privacy Notices Action** page, under *Actions*, to find the *Show individual approvals* option. This option goes to the **Privacy Notice Approvals** page.<br>

On that page, you'll find a table with approval options. 

| Column | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- | 
| **Integration Name** | Name of the service, such as Microsoft OneDrive. |
| **User Name** | The user who holds this approval. If *Organization* is written in the User Name column, approval belongs to the whole organization. 
| **Agree** | The user approves the privacy notice. |
| **Disagree** | The user does not approve the privacy notice. |
| **Approver User Name** | The one who approves the privacy notice. |

# Sharing Business Central records and page links in Microsoft Teams

[!INCLUDE [online_only](includes/online_only.md)]

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers a couple ways to share data from Business Central directly in a Microsoft Teams conversation:

- With the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app installed in Teams, you can include an interactive card of any Business Central record in a Teams conversation.

- With or without the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app installed, you can share a link from pages in Business Central to a Teams conversation.

The following sections describe the different ways in detail.

## Include and view a Business Central card in a Teams conversation

With the Business Central app for Teams, you can copy a link from any Business Central record, like a customer or sales order, and paste the link into a Teams conversation. The app connects Microsoft Teams to your business data in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]\. It then expands the link into a compact, interactive card that displays information about the record. Once in the conversation, you and coworkers can view more details about the record, edit data, and take action&mdash;without leaving Teams.

[![Teams integration with Business Central.](media/teams-intro-vBC24.png)](media/teams-intro-vBC24.png#lightbox)

### Prerequisites

- You have access to Microsoft Teams.
- You've installed the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app in Teams. Learn more in [Install the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] App for Microsoft Teams](across-install-app-for-teams.md)

> [!NOTE]
> All participants in a Teams conversation will be able to view cards for Business Central records that you submit to the conversation. But to view more details about records, by using the **Details** or **Pop out** buttons on a card, they'll need access to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Learn more in [Managing Microsoft Teams Integration](admin-teams-integration.md#minimum-requirements-1).

### Include a Business Central card in a Teams conversation

1. Sign in to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] using your browser.
2. Open the record that you want to share.

    The app is designed to display a card for almost any type of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] page. But it provides the best experience when used for pages that display a single record, such as an item, customer, or sales order.
3. Copy the link to the page.

    There are two ways to copy the link. The easiest and preferred way is to select **Share** ![Share icon in Business Central](media/share-icon.png) > **Copy Link**. Alternatively, copy the entire URL from the browser's address bar.

    [![Copy Business Central URL from browser.](media/teams-copy-link.png)](media/teams-copy-link.png#lightbox)
4. Go to Teams and start a conversation, which can be chat with a person, group of persons, or a team channel.
5. Paste the link (URL) in the message box where you compose a message. You might need to add a space or press <kbd>Enter</kbd> for the URL to be recognized.

    ![Paste Business Central URL in Teams.](media/teams-paste-url-v3.png)

    > [!TIP]
    > If you get a message like: *Business Central wants to show a preview of this link.*, it means that you don't have the Business Central app for Teams installed. To install the app, select **Show Preview** and follow the instructions.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Depending on your Business Central version, the first time you paste a link into a conversation, you might be asked to sign in to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and give consent for the app to connect to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Follow the on-screen instructions. You'll only have to do this step once.

6. Wait a moment while a card is generated in the message box.
7. When the card appears, review the contents of the card carefully for any sensitive information before sending the message. This step is important because once you send the message, everyone in the conversation can see the card.
8. If the card looks good, select **Send** to submit it to the conversation.
9. To view more details or make changes to the record shown in the card, select **Details**. Learn more in the next section.

### View card details

Once a card's been sent to a conversation, all participants with the [proper permissions](admin-teams-integration.md#permissions) can select **Details** to open a window that displays more information about the record&mdash;and possibly make changes to the record. It doesn't matter if you're the one sending the card or the one receiving the card. The **Details** feature is especially useful to recipients because it quickly provides concise, targeted information about the record.

The details window is similar to what you'd see in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], but it's focused on the page or record that the card is about. When you're finished viewing and making changes, close the window to return to the Teams conversation.

Here are a couple things to keep in mind when working with the card details:

- To open the card details, users must have permission on the page and its data in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]\.
- Cards in Teams chats aren't automatically updated to changes. Any changes you save to a record in the details window are saved in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]\. But the card in Teams won't show the changes in the conversion, until you paste the link again.

Learn more about working with cards and card details in [Teams FAQ](teams-faq.md).

## <a name="share-link"></a>Share a link to page from Business Central to Teams

Directly from most collection pages, like the **Items** page, and details pages, like the **Items** card, you can send a link to the page to specific recipients in a Teams conversation. For example, you can share a link to a filtered view of your records. Recipients can then select the link to open the page in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]\.

[![!The Share menu displayed on a card.](media/teams-share-link-v2.png "The Share menu displayed on a card.")](media/teams-share-link-v2.png#lightbox)

### Prerequisites

- You have access to Microsoft Teams.
- (Optional) You've installed the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app in Teams. 

  With the app installed, messages you send with the link will also include a compact card for the page. For more information about how to install the app, see [Install the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] App for Microsoft Teams](across-install-app-for-teams.md).

### Share a link

1. In [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]\, open the page that you want to share.
2. At the top of the page, select the ![!Share to other apps action on pages.](media/share-icon.png) icon, then **Share to Teams**.
3. If you're asked, sign in to Teams with your user name and password.
4. In the **Share to Teams** page, type a name of a person, group, or channel that you want send the message to.
5. The message box includes a link to the page. If the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams is installed, a card for the linked record or page will also appear in the message box.

   Add more information if you like, then select **Share**.
6. The link is now shared. To view the conversation, select **Go to Teams**.

# Post service orders and credit memos

After you create a service order, when you're ready you can post it. The order must contain at least one service item line and one service line. If the order has more than one service line, all lines post at the same time.  

If you have a large number of service orders, you can save time by using a batch job to post them. You can run the batch job from any service order.

> [!Tip]
> Before you post a service document, it's a good idea to use the **Test Report** action to to check for errors or missing information. If there are errors, you must correct the problem. You can print a new test report to verify the fix, and then post the document.

## To post a service order

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the service order.  
3. On the **Service Order** page, choose one of the following actions.  

    |**Action**|**Result**|  
    |------------------|----------------|  
    |**Test Report** | Checks all parts of the document and presents the result in a report. If the report indicates any errors or a lack of information, you must correct the problem. You can then print a new test report.|  
    |**Post** | Posts the order without printing a shipment or an invoice.|  
    |**Post and Print** | Posts the order and prints a shipment (if you ship the order without invoicing it) or an invoice (if you invoice the order).|  
    |**Post Batch** | Posts multiple service orders at one time once.|  

4. For the **Post** action, there are several options that control what happens.  

    |**Posting Option**|**Result**|  
    |------------------------|----------------|  
    |**Ship** | Posts shipment of the items.|  
    |**Invoice** | Invoices items that have already been shipped.|  
    |**Ship and Invoice** | Invoices and ships the items.|  
    |**Ship and Consume** | Posts shipment and consumption on the order. It updates the relevant quantities on the service lines of the order and on the previously posted service shipment document.|  

You can post consumption only if the line contains a quantity that shipped but isn't invoiced or consumed.  

When you post the order, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates the corresponding ledger entries and posted documents and updates the service order.  

## To batch post service orders

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **Post Batch** action.  
3. You can set a filter to select specific service order numbers or an interval of order numbers for the batch job to process.  
4. Choose **OK** to start the batch job.  

## To post a service credit memo  

After you create a service credit memo, you can post it when you're ready. If there are errors or a lack of information on the credit memo while posting, an error message displays and stops the process.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Credit Memos**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Create a new service credit memo. Choose the **New** action.  
3. Fill in the necessary fields.  
4. Choose the **Post** action. If you want to print the credit memo at the same time as your post, choose the **Post and Print** action instead.  
5. To test credit memos before you post them, choose **Test Report**. When you run the report, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] verifies the posting dates in the document.  
6. To post several service credit memos at the same time, run the **Batch Post Service Cr. Memos** batch job. Using the batch job is helpful when you have to post a lot of credit memos.  

> [!NOTE]  
> It is important to enter all the necessary information on the credit memos before you batch post them. Otherwise, it is possible that they will not be posted. When the batch job finishes, a message shows how many of the service credit memos it posted.  

## To post consumption from a service order  

The following procedure describes how to post the items, resource hours, and costs used for a specific service operation for which you won't charge your customer. You can post consumed items, hours, or costs only for a posted shipment that has no posted invoices or consumption.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the service order to post consumption for.  
3. Choose the service item. Choose the **Service Lines** action.  
4. Find the required entries, and specify the quantities for which you'll post consumption in the **Qty. to Consume** field. The quantity can't be larger than the quantity already shipped and the quantity remaining but not invoiced after partial invoicing of this shipment.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > To register consumption for a project, fill in the **Project No.**, **Project Task No.**, and the **Project Line Type** fields on the service line.  

5. Choose the lines to post, and then choose the **Post** action. On the page that opens, select **Ship and Consume**.  

The service is posted as either partially or fully consumed, depending on the value in the **Qty. to Consume** field, and the relevant ledger entries are created. Also, previously posted service shipment documents are updated chronologically with the consumed quantities. The relevant quantities are updated on the service lines of the order.  

## To post shipments from service orders  

After you specify the details of a service, you can adjust and post the quantities of items used, time spent, and costs incurred. As a result, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] makes the necessary changes to reflect the new state of your inventory and current status of the specific order processing.  

The following procedure shows how to post shipment of service line items in locations that aren't set up to require warehouse handling.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Order**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the service order, and then choose the **Service Lines** action.  
3. On the **Service Lines** page, find the required entries and then specify the quantity to post in the **Qty. to Ship** field.  

   > [!NOTE]  
   > The quantity to ship value depends on whether you want to fully or partially post the shipment. If you choose to ship fully, the value in the **Qty. to Ship** field must be equal to the value in the **Quantity** field. When you post a partial shipment, you must specify the quantity you want to ship initially. If you already shipped part of the service on the order, make a note of the value in the **Quantity Shipped** field. The maximum quantity you can enter in the **Quantity to Ship** field is the number of units that haven't shipped.  

4. Choose the **Post** action, and then choose **Ship**.

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates ledger entries (in the warranty ledger, item ledger, service ledger, or G/L), produces the posted service shipment document, and updates the relevant fields on the service lines of the service order.  

If the location is set up to require warehouse handling, shipping and moving service line items works in the same way as they do for other source documents. The only difference is that service line items can be consumed either externally or internally, and therefore require two different release functions. To learn more about shipping service line items in advanced warehouse configurations, go to [Picking Items for Warehouse Shipments](warehouse-how-to-pick-items-for-warehouse-shipment.md).  

## Combine shipments from multiple service orders into a single service invoice

If needed, you can gather posted shipments that you haven't invoiced in a single invoice. For example, combining shipments can reduce the overall number of invoices to process, which can lower administrative costs and save time for your bookkeeping team. To learn more, go to [Combine shipments on a single invoice](sales-how-to-combine-shipments-on-a-single-invoice.md).

## To undo posted consumption  

You can cancel the consumption on the service orders. For example, because it was posted by mistake.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Posted Service Shipments**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the posted service shipment for which the erroneous consumption was posted.  
3. Choose the **Service Shipment Lines** action.  
4. Choose the lines that contain the incorrect consumption, and then choose the **Undo Consumption** action.  

 A balancing service shipment line is inserted with negative values in the quantity fields for the selected lines.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
> You can't undo service consumption if:  

> * The service order has been closed.  
> * It was posted to a project, so there are project ledger entries linked to it.  

## To post service lines  

If you have to work on a service order for a considerable time without posting it, you might want to post some of the service lines linked to it as a way, for example, of keeping your inventory updated. You can post by specifying the relevant quantities on the lines to be posted. You might choose to post the lines one by one or by selecting several lines at a time.  

The following procedure describes shipment posting directly from a service order in locations without warehouse handling set up. If the location is set up to require warehouse handling, then shipment posting happens in a different warehouse document, depending on the location setup.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the service order, and then choose the **Service Lines** action.  
3. On the lines you're going to post, fill in the **Qty. to Ship**, **Qty. to Invoice**, and **Qty. to Consume** fields, depending on how you post the lines.  
4. Choose the **Post** action.

# Enable picking items by FEFO

First-Expired-First-Out (FEFO) is a sorting method that ensures that items with the earliest expiration dates are picked first.  

 This functionality only works when the following criteria are met:

- The item must be assigned an item tracking code where the **SN Warehouse Tracking**, **Lot Warehouse Tracking**, or **Package Warehouse Tracking** fields are selected. The item must be posted to inventory with an expiration date.
- On the location, the **Pick According to FEFO** toggle must be turned on.

Depending on which document you plan to use, make some more settings:

- **Inventory Pick**. You can use picking by FEFO for locations with and without bins.
- **Warehouse Pick**. On the location, the **Bin Mandatory** toggles must be turned on.

When all the criteria are met, the serial/lot-numbered items to pick are sorted with the oldest first in all picks and movements.  

> [!NOTE]  
> If some serial or lot-numbered items have specific tracking defined in the source document, such as sales order, then those are respected first and under them, the remaining, non-specific, serial/lot numbers are listed according to FEFO.
<br /><br />
If two serial or lot-numbered items have the same expiration date, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] selects the item with the lowest serial or lot number.
<br /><br />
When picking serial or lot-numbered items in locations set up for directed put-away and pick, only quantities in bins of the type *Pick* are picked according to FEFO.  
<br /><br />
To enable movements according to FEFO, leave the **From Bin** field empty on the **Inventory Movement** or **Movement Worksheet** pages.  
<br /><br />
If the **Strict Expiration Posting** field is selected on the **Item Tracking Code Card**, only items that aren't expired are included in the pick, and the lines are sorted according to the FEFO principle.
<br /><br />
> If you posted the item to inventory without an expiration date, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] populates the serial or lot number as a warehouse pick, but not an inventory pick.

# Pick items for warehouse shipment

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you pick and ship items using one of four methods, as described in the following table.

|Method|Outbound Process|Require Pick|Require Shipment|Complexity Level (Learn more at [Warehouse Management Overview](design-details-warehouse-management.md))|  
|------|----------------|-----|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
|A|Post the pick and shipment from the order line|||No dedicated warehouse activity.|  
|B|Post the pick and shipment from an inventory pick document|Turned on||Basic: Order-by-order.|  
|C|Post the pick and shipment from a warehouse shipment document||Turned on|Basic: Consolidated receive/ship posting for multiple orders.|  
|D|Post the pick from a warehouse pick document, and post the shipment from a warehouse shipment document|Turned on|Turned on|Advanced|  

Learn more at [Outbound Warehouse Flow](design-details-outbound-warehouse-flow.md).

This article refers to method D in the table. To learn more about shipping items, go to [Shipping Items](warehouse-how-ship-items.md).

When a location is set up to require warehouse pick processing and warehouse shipment processing, use warehouse pick documents to create and process pick information before you post the warehouse shipment.  

You can't create a warehouse pick document from scratch. Picks are part of a workflow where the person processing an order creates them in a push fashion, or the warehouse employee creates them in a pull fashion:

- In a push fashion, where you use the **Create Pick** action in the **Warehouse Shipment** page. Select the lines to be picked and prepare the picks by specifying, for example, which bins to take from and place in, and how many units to handle. Bins can be predefined for the warehouse location or resource.
- In a pull fashion, where you use the **Release** action in the **Warehouse Shipment** page to make the items available for picking. Then, on the **Pick Worksheet** page, warehouse employees can use the **Get Warehouse Documents** action to pull their assigned picks.

> [!NOTE]  
> Picking for a warehouse shipment of items that are assembled for a sales order follows the same steps as for regular warehouse picks for shipments, as described in this article. However, the number of pick lines for the quantity to ship may be many to one because you pick the components, not the assembled item.  
>
> Warehouse pick lines are created for the value in the **Remaining Quantity** field on the lines of the assembly order that's linked to the sales order line being shipped. All components are picked in one action. Learn more at [Handling Assemble-to-Order Items in Warehouse Shipments](warehouse-how-ship-items.md#handling-assemble-to-order-items-in-warehouse-shipments).  
>  
> To learn more about picking components for assembly orders, including situations where assembly items aren't related to a sales shipment, go to [Pick for Production, Assembly, or Jobs in Advanced Warehouse Configurations](warehouse-how-to-pick-for-internal-operations-in-advanced-warehousing.md).  

## Check whether items are available for picking

[!INCLUDE [inventory-availability-overview](includes/inventory-availability-overview.md)]

## To create pick documents in bulk with the pick worksheet

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Pick Worksheet**, and then choose the related link.  

2. Choose the **Get Warehouse Documents** action.  

    The list will include all shipments that have been released for picking, including those for which pick instructions have already been created. Documents with pick lines that have been completely picked and registered are not shown in this list.  
3. Select the shipments for which you want to prepare a pick.

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  If you try to select a shipment or internal pick document for which you've already created instructions for all of its lines you'll get a message that says something like, "there is nothing to handle." To combine warehouse pick instructions that you've already created into one pick instruction, you must delete the individual warehouse picks first.

4. Fill in the **Sorting Method** field to sort the lines.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  The way the lines are sorted in the worksheet doesn't automatically carry through to the pick instruction. However, the same sorting and bin ranking opportunities exist. You can easily recreate the line order you plan in the worksheet when you create the pick instructions or sort in the pick instructions.

5. Fill in the **Qty. to Handle** field either manually, or by using the **Autofill Qty.to Handle** action.  

    The page shows the quantities available in cross-docking bins. This information is useful for planning work assignments in cross-docking situations. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will always propose a pick from a cross-dock bin first.
6. If needed, edit the lines. You can also delete lines to make the pick more efficient. For example, if there are multiple lines with items that are in cross-dock bins, you might create a pick for all of the lines. The cross-docked items will be shipped with the other items on the shipment, and the cross-dock bins will have space for more incoming items.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  If you delete lines, they're only deleted from the worksheet. They aren't deleted from the pick selection list.  

7. Choose the **Create Pick** action. The **Create Pick** page opens, where you can add more information to the pick you are creating. Specify how to combine pick lines in the pick documents by selecting one of the following options.  

    |Option|Description|
    |-|-|
    |Per Whse. Document|Creates separate pick documents for worksheet lines with the same warehouse source document.|
    |Per Cust./Vend./Loc.|Create separate pick documents for each customer (sale orders), vendor (purchase return orders), and location (transfer orders).|
    |Per Item|Create separate pick documents for each item on the pick worksheet.|
    |Per From Zone|Create separate pick documents for each zone that you'll take items from.|
    |Per Bin|Create separate pick documents for each bin that you'll take items from.|
    |Per Due Date|Create separate pick documents for source documents that have the same due date.|

    Specify how the pick documents are created by selecting from the following options.

    |Option|Description|
    |-|-|
    |Max. No. of Pick Lines|Creates pick documents that have no more than the specified number of lines in each document.|
    |Max. No. of Pick Source Docs.|Creates pick documents that each cover no more than the specified number of source documents.|
    |Assigned User ID|Creates pick documents only for worksheet lines that are assigned to the selected warehouse employee.|
    |Sorting Method for Pick Lines|Select from the available options to sort lines in the created pick document.|
    |Set Breakbulk Filter|Hides intermediate breakbulk pick lines when a larger unit of measure is converted to a smaller unit of measure and completely picked.|
    |Do Not Fill Qty. to Handle|Leaves the Qty. to Handle field in the created pick lines empty.|
    |Print Pick|Prints the pick documents when they are created. You can also print from the created pick documents.|

8. Choose **OK**. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will create the pick according to your selections.  

## To pick items for a warehouse shipment

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Warehouse Picks**, and then choose the related link.  

    If you need to work on a particular pick, select the pick from the list or filter the list to find the picks that have been assigned to you specifically. Open the pick card.  
2. If the **Assigned User ID** field is empty, enter your ID to identify yourself if needed.  
3. Pick the items.  

    If the warehouse is set up to use bins, the items’ default bins are used to suggest where to take the items from. The instructions contain at least two separate lines for Take and Place actions.  

    If the warehouse is set up to use directed put-away and pick, bin ranking is used to calculate the best bins to pick from. Those bins are suggested on the pick lines. The instructions contain at least two separate lines for Take and Place actions.  

    * The first line, with **Take** in the **Action Type** field, indicates where the items are located in the picking area. If you're shipping a large number of items on one shipment line, you might have to pick the items in several bins, so there's a Take line for each bin.
    * The next line, with **Place** in the **Action Type** field, shows where you must place the items in the warehouse. You can't change the zone and bin on this line.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you must pick or place the items for one line in more than one bin, for example because the designated bin is full, use the **Split Line** action on the **Lines** FastTab. The action creates a line for the remaining quantity to handle.
        
    You can sort the pick lines by various criteria, for example, by item, shelf number, or due date. Sorting can help optimize the put-away process, for example:

    * If the Take and Place lines for each shipment line don't immediately follow one another, and you want them to, sort the lines by selecting **Item** in the **Sorting Method** field.  
    * If bin rankings reflect the physical layout of the warehouse, use the **Bin Ranking** sorting method to organize the work by bin locations.

  > [!NOTE]  
  > Lines are sorted in ascending order by the selected criteria. If you sort by document, sorting is done first by document type based on the **Warehouse Activity Source Document** field. If you sort by ship-to, sorting is done first by destination type based on the **Warehouse Destination Type** field.

4. After you pick and place the items in the shipping area or shipping bin, choose the **Register Pick** action.  

You can now bring the items to the shipment dock and post the shipment, including the related source document, on the **Warehouse Shipment** page. Learn more at [Ship Items](warehouse-how-ship-items.md).

# Intelligent insights and cloud migration (on-premises only)

If you're using [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, you have full access to scenarios that are based on the intelligent cloud. For example, key performance indicators (KPIs) that are based on machine learning, or when you view your data in Power BI.  

However, if you use [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, you don't have access to the same insights. If you want to benefit from online scenarios, you must migrate to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online. For more information, see [Migrating On-Premises Data to Business Central Online](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/migrate-data) in the administration content for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

## Viewing Insights in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Online

For an on-premises environment for which data was migrated to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, the **Intelligent Cloud Insights** page in the online environment shows four key points of interest for most businesses:

- Cash availability
- Sales profitability
- Net income
- Inventory value

Next to the KPI charts, you get insights into potential areas of concern, including overdue payments. Choose each insight to explore the data.  

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Intelligent cloud insights.](media/across-intelligent-cloud/intelligentcloudApril19.png "Shows the Intelligent Cloud Insights page in Business Central online")

The page also connects to Power BI for even more insights. Optionally, connect to Azure AI for even more intelligent insights. For more information, see [The Sales and Inventory Forecast Extension](ui-extensions-sales-forecast.md).

# Create interactions on contacts and segments

You can create interactions to track the communications you have with a single contact, or with multiple contacts in your segments. To make it easy to create interactions, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides the **Create Interaction** assisted setup guide. The guide helps you capture the important details about the interaction.

Before you create interactions though, you must set up interaction templates. To learn more about interaction templates, go to [Set Up Interaction Templates](marketing-interactions.md).

## To create an interaction with a contact

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Contacts**, **Salesperson**, or **Interaction Log Entry**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **Create Interaction** action.
3. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

> [!NOTE]  
> If you need to stop before you've finished the interaction, you can choose **Cancel** and then specify whether you want to save your settings so you can continue later. To learn more about postponed interactions, go to [To finish setting up a postponed interaction](#to-finish-setting-up-a-postponed-interaction).

## To create an interaction on a segment

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Segments**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **Create Interaction** action.
3. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

> [!TIP]
> After you assign an interaction to a segment, there are several other actions you can take on the **Segment** page:
>
> * Personalize the interaction for each particular contact within the segment, for example, by selecting another interaction template on the lines.  
>* Log the segment and interactions by choosing the **Log** action to open the **Log Segment** page.
> * Create a new segment containing the same contacts by choosing the **Create Follow-up Segment** checkbox. This setting requires that a number series is specified for segments on the **Marketing Setup** page.

An interaction is recorded for each contact within the segment in the **Interaction Log Entry** table, and the segment is logged. Logged segments are available on the **Logged Segment** page.

## To finish setting up a postponed interaction

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Postponed Interactions**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the interaction you want to finish, and then choose the **Resume** action.

# Count, adjust, and reclassify inventory using journals

To ensure that your quantities are correct, physically count all of the items in your inventory. Some businesses do an annual physical count, and others count all or only some items more often. After you count items, use journals to post the actual quantities to the general ledger. For example, when you valuate inventory at the end of a period.

To count some items more often than others, perhaps because of their value, use cycle counts. For cycle counts, assign special counting periods to the items. Learn more at [To do cycle counting](inventory-how-count-adjust-reclassify.md#to-do-cycle-counting).

To adjust quantities after a physical count or other purposes, use an item journal to change the inventory ledger entries without posting transactions. You can also adjust the quantity for a single item on an item card.

To change attributes on item ledger entries, use an item reclassification journal. Typical attributes to reclassify include dimensions and sales campaign codes. You can also use reclassification journals for transfers by reclassifying bin and location codes. Special steps apply when you want to reclassify serial or lot numbers and their expiration dates. For more information, see [Work with Serial and Lot Numbers](inventory-how-work-item-tracking.md).

> [!NOTE]
> In multi-step processes, items are registered in bins as warehouse entries, not as item ledger entries. Therefore, you do counting, adjusting, and reclassifying in warehouse journals that support bins. Then you synchronize the new or changed warehouse entries with their related item ledger entries to reflect the changes in inventory quantities and values.

[!INCLUDE [edit-in-excel](includes/edit-in-excel.md)]

## To count physical inventory

To check whether the quantity registered is the same as the physical quantity in stock, count your physical inventory. That is, count the actual items on hand. Typically, counts happen at the end of a fiscal year, but some businesses count items more often. If there are differences, post the actual quantities to the item accounts before you do inventory valuation.

> [!NOTE]
> This procedure describes how to do a physical inventory using a journal on the **Phys. Inventory Journal** page. You can use documents on the **Physical Inventory Order** and **Physical Inventory Recording** pages. These documents offer more control and support for distributing the counting work to multiple employees. Learn more at [Count Inventory Using Documents](inventory-how-count-inventory-with-documents.md).<br /><br />
> Note that you can't use the document-based functionality to count items in bins or warehouse entries.

The counting process also involves the following tasks:

- Calculate the expected inventory.
- Print the report you want to use for the count.
- Enter and post the actual quantities.

Depending on your warehouse setup, count physical inventory in one of the following ways. For more information, see [Setting Up Warehouse Management](warehouse-setup-warehouse.md).  

- If your location doesn't use directed put-away and pick, use the **Phys. Inventory Journal** page. The procedure is similar to physical inventory without cycle counting.  
- If your location uses directed put-away and picks, use the **Warehouse Physical Inventory Journal** page. Then use the **Item Journals** page to run the **Calculate Warehouse Adjustment** action. <!--We should say what to do on each of these pages.-->

### To calculate expected inventory in basic warehouse configurations

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Physical Inventory Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **Calculate Inventory** action from **Prepare**.
3. On the **Calculate Inventory** page, specify the conditions to use to create the journal lines, such as whether to include items that have zero recorded inventory.
4. Set filters if you only want to calculate inventory for certain items, bins, locations, or dimensions.
5. Choose the **OK** button.

> [!NOTE]  
> Item entries are processed according to the information that you specified, and lines are created in the physical inventory journal. Notice that the **Qty. (Phys. Inventory)** field has the same quantity as the **Qty. (Calculated)** field. You don't need to enter the counted quantity for items where these values match. However, if the quantity counted differs, enter the quantity that was counted.

### To print the report to be used when counting

1. On the **Physical Inventory Journals** page containing the calculated expected inventory, Choose the **Print** action from **Home**.
2. On the **Physical Inventory List** page, specify whether the report will show the calculated quantity and inventory items by serial and lot numbers.
3. Set filters if you only want to print the report for certain items, bins, locations, or dimensions.
4. Choose **Print**.

Warehouse employees can now count inventory and record any differences on the printed report.

> [!NOTE]
> It can take several days before printed reports come back for final processing and posting. When you specify and post actual counted inventory, the system adjusts inventory to reflect the difference between the expected and the actual counted inventory. You must keep the originally calculated journal lines and not recalculate the expected inventory, because the expected inventory may change and lead to incorrect inventory levels. If you need to issue multiple reports, such as for different locations or group of items, you must create and keep separate journal batches.

### To enter and post the actual counted inventory in basic warehouse configurations

1. On each line on the **Physical Inventory Journals** page where the actual inventory on hand, as determined by the physical count, differs from the calculated quantity, enter the actual inventory on hand in the **Qty. (Phys. Inventory)** field.
  
  > [!NOTE]  
  > If the physical count reveals differences caused by items posted with incorrect locations, don't enter the differences in the physical inventory journal. Instead, use a reclassification journal or a transfer order to redirect the items to the correct locations. 

2. To adjust the calculated quantities to the actual counted quantities, choose the **Post** action from **Home**.

    Posting creates item ledger entries and physical inventory ledger entries. Open the Item Card page for the item to find its physical inventory ledger entries.

3. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, and then choose the related link.
4. To verify the count, open the **Item Card** page for the item, and choose the **Phys. Inventory Ledger Entries** action from **Item**
1. .

### To calculate the expected inventory in advanced warehouse configurations

Synchronize item ledger and warehouse <!--warehouse what?--> before you count physical inventory. Otherwise, what you post to the physical inventory journal and item ledger is the physical inventory results combined with other warehouse adjustments for the items. Learn more at [Synchronize quantities in the item ledger and warehouse](inventory-how-count-adjust-reclassify.md#to-synchronize-the-adjusted-warehouse-entries-with-the-related-item-ledger-entries).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Warehouse Physical Inventory Journal**, and choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **Calculate Inventory** action to open the **Whse. Calculate Inventory** page.  
3. Set the filters to specify the items to count in the journal, and then choose **OK**.

   [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates a line for each bin that meets the filter requirements. You can delete lines, but if you want to post the results as a physical inventory, count the item in all the bins that contain it.  

   If you only count an item in some bins but not others, you can enter differences and post them in the **Item Journal** page later by using the **Calculate Warehouse Adjustment** action.  

### To enter and post the actual counted inventory in advanced warehouse configurations

1. On the **Warehouse Physical Inventory Journal** page, enter the actual quantities in the **Qty. (Phys. Inventory)** field.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > The **Qty. (Calculated)** field is filled in based on bin records. This quantity is copied to the **Qty. (Physical)** field on each line. If the quantities in these fields don't match, enter the actual quantity.  

2. After you enter all actual quantities, choose the **Register** action.  

    When you register the journal, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates two warehouse entries in the warehouse register for every line that was counted and registered:  

    - If the calculated and the actual quantities differ, a negative or positive quantity is registered for the bin, and a balancing quantity is posted to the location's adjustment bin.  
    - If the calculated quantity equals the physical quantity, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] registers **0** for both the bin and the adjustment bin. 

When you register physical inventory, you don't post to the item, physical inventory, or the value ledgers. However, the records are available for reconciliation when needed. To keep quantities accurate, after you count items in all bins, post the results.<!--physical inventory journal--> Learn more at [Synchronize quantities in the item ledger and warehouse](inventory-how-count-adjust-reclassify.md#to-synchronize-the-adjusted-warehouse-entries-with-the-related-item-ledger-entries).

## To do cycle counting

You can count items as often as you'd like. For example, because they're more valuable or top sellers. Specify the counting frequency by assigning special counting periods to the items.

Depending on your warehouse setup, you can do cycle counting in the following ways. Learn more at [Setting Up Warehouse Management](warehouse-setup-warehouse.md).  

- If your location doesn't use directed put-away and picks, use the **Physical Inventory Journal** page. The steps are similar to counting physical inventory without cycle counting.  
- If your location uses directed put-away and picks, use the **Warehouse Physical Inventory Journal** page. Then use the **Item Journals** page to run the **Calculate Warehouse Adjustment** action. <!--we should say what to do on each of these pages-->  

### To set up counting periods

Counting physical inventory is typically a recurring task, for example monthly, quarterly, or annually. You can set up the inventory counting periods you need and assign one to each item. Afterward, use the **Calculate Counting Period** action on the **Physical Inventory Journal** page to automatically create lines for the items.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Physical Inventory Counting Periods**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

### To assign a counting period to an item

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the item to which you want to assign a counting period.  
3. In the **Phys Invt Counting Period Code** field, select the counting period.  

> [!NOTE]
> If you're changing the counting period, a message displays information about the results of the change. Choose **Yes** to change the code and calculate the first counting period for the item. The next time you choose to calculate a counting period in the physical inventory journal, the item appears as a line on the **Phys. Invt. Item Selection** page. You can then count the item periodically.

### To start a count based on counting periods in basic warehouse configurations

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Physical Inventory Journal**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **Calculate Counting Period** action.

    The **Phys. Invt. Item Selection** page shows items that need to be counted according to their counting periods.
3. Count the physical inventory. Learn more at [To count physical inventory](inventory-how-count-adjust-reclassify.md#to-count-physical-inventory).

### To start a count based on counting periods in advanced warehouse configurations

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Warehouse Physical Inventory Journal**, and choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **Calculate Counting Period** action.

    The **Phys. Invt. Item Selection** page show items need to be counted according to their counting periods.
3. Count the physical inventory. Learn more at [To count physical inventory](inventory-how-count-adjust-reclassify.md#to-count-physical-inventory).  

   > [!NOTE]  
   > Count the item in all bins that contain it. If you delete bin lines that were retrieved for counting on the **Whse. Phys. Inventory** page, the count will be incorrect when you post it in a physical inventory journal.  

## To adjust the quantity of one item

After you do a physical count of an item, use the **Adjust Inventory** action to record the actual inventory quantity.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the item for which you want to adjust inventory, and then choose the **Adjust Inventory** action.
3. In the **New Inventory** field for the location, enter the result of the count.
4. Choose the **OK** button.

<!-- I don't see a "Quantity on Hand" field on the Item Card page. Should this point to the options for viewing availability?

The item’s inventory is adjusted. The new quantity is shown in the **Quantity on Hand** field on the **Item Card** page.-->

You can also use the **Adjust Inventory** action as an easy way to add purchased items to inventory if you don't use purchase invoices or orders to record your purchases. Learn more at [Record Purchases](purchasing-how-record-purchases.md).

> [!NOTE]  
> After you adjust inventory, update its current value. For more information, see [Revalue Inventory](inventory-how-revalue-inventory.md).

### To adjust the quantities of multiple items in basic warehouse configurations

On the **Item Journals** page, you can post item transactions directly to adjust inventory for purchases, sales, and positive or negative changes without using documents.

If you often use the item journal to post the same or similar journal lines, for example, for material consumption, the **Standard Item Journal** page can make this recurring work easier. For more information, see [Work with Standard Journals](ui-work-general-journals.md#work-with-standard-journals).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Item Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
3. Choose the **Post** action to adjust the quantities.

### To adjust bin quantities in advanced warehouse configurations

If your location uses directed put-away and picks, use the **Warehouse Item Journal** page to post unplanned positive and negative quantity changes. For example, for items posted as missing that show up unexpectedly, or losses due to breakage.  

Warehouse item journals give you more levels of adjustment to make your quantities more precise. The warehouse knows how many items are on hand and where they're stored, but each adjustment isn't posted to the item ledger. Credits or debits are made to the real bin with the quantity adjustment. A balancing entry is made in an adjustment bin. The adjustment bin is a virtual bin with no real items. You specify the virtual bin in the **Invt. Adjustment Bin Code** field on **Location Card** pages.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Warehouse Item Journal**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the header information.  
3. In the **Item No.** field on the line, choose the item.  
4. Enter the bin in which you're putting the extra items or where items are missing.  
5. In the **Quantity** field, if you find extra items, enter a positive quantity. If items are missing, enter a negative quantity.  
6. Choose the **Register** action.

## To synchronize the adjusted warehouse entries with the related item ledger entries

Post the adjustment bin records in the item ledger for the defined periods. Some companies post daily adjustments to the item ledger, while others reconcile less often.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Item Journal**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields on each journal line.  
3. Choose the **Calculate Warehouse Adjustment** action, and then add filters on the **Calculate Warehouse Adjustment** page. Adjustments are calculated only for the entries in the adjustment bin that meet the filter requirements.  
4. On the **Options** FastTab, fill in the **Document No.** field with a number. The number displays on the item journal lines.
5. Choose **OK**. The positive and negative adjustments are totaled for each item, and lines are created in the item journal.  
6. Post the journal lines to enter the quantity differences in the item ledger. The quantities in the bins and the item ledger now match.

# FAQs for analysis assist (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]

These frequently asked questions (FAQ) describe the AI impact of the analysis assist feature in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/production-ready-preview-dynamics365.md)]

## What is analysis assist?

Analysis assist is a copilot that provides assistance for working with the [data analysis mode](analysis-mode.md) in Business Central. The data analysis mode enables you to organize, aggregate, and summarize data on pages and queries to make it more suitable for analyzing and extracting meaningful insights. With analysis assist, you can automatically construct the view of the data you want to analyze by expressing your needs in simple, natural language, like "show vendors by location sorted by number of purchases." Analysis assist makes it easier to work with data without the need for complex technical skills.

## What are capabilities of analysis assist?

Analysis assist converts natural language instructions into a structured design for displaying data in the analysis mode, without creating, modifying, or updating customer business data itself.

## What is the intended use of analysis assist?

Analysis assist helps create analysis tabs in the data analysis mode to present data in a manner that makes it easier for you to draw conclusions. However, it's important to note that analysis assist doesn't provide direct insights or conclusions about the data. It's a tool to help users organize and view their data. It's up to the user to extract actionable information, discover trends, and make informed decisions to drive business value.

## How was analysis assist evaluated? What metrics are used to measure performance?

- The feature underwent extensive testing based on [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]'s demonstration data and other fictitious business data. Copilot was given numerous prompts in the supported languages that covered a broad range of instructions and styles of expressing intent. The outcomes were evaluated against accuracy, relevance, and safety.

- The feature is built in accordance with Microsoft's Responsible AI Standard. [Learn more about responsible AI from Microsoft.](https://aka.ms/RAI)

## How does Microsoft monitor the quality of generated content?

Microsoft has various systems in place to ensure that content generated by Copilot is of the highest quality, detect abuse, and ensure safety for our customers and their data.

Users have the opportunity to provide feedback to every Copilot response and report inaccurate or inappropriate content to help Microsoft improve this feature.

- If you encounter inappropriate generated content, report it to Microsoft by using this feedback form: [Report abuse](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2249810)

- We analyze user feedback on the feature and use it to help us improve responses.

  You provide feedback by using the like (thumbs up) or dislike (thumbs down) icon on the **Copilot** pane in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

- Microsoft might disable the Copilot features for selected customers if abuse of the functionality is detected.

## What are the limitations of analysis assist? How can users minimize the impact of the analysis assist limitations when using the system?

- General AI limitations:

  AI systems are valuable tools but they're nondeterministic. The content they generate might not be accurate. It's important to use your judgment to review and verify responses before making decisions that could affect stakeholders like customers and partners.

- Geographic and language availability

   [!INCLUDE[copilot-geo-and-language-availability](includes/copilot-geo-and-language-availability.md)]

- Certain industry, product, and subject limitations:

  Organizations that operate in some business domains, such as medical, drugs, legal, and weapons, might experience lower quality of service.

## What data does analysis assist collect and how is it used?

The analysis assist capability collects the minimum data required by Business Central to offer the service. Microsoft doesn't use your company data, including the text you send to Copilot, to train the foundational models for the benefit of others. For more information, see [Dynamics 365 terms for Azure OpenAI-powered features](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2236010).

It also collects data from the feedback users can provide using the like (thumbs up) or dislike (thumbs down) icons in the analysis assist **Copilot** page. The data is anonymous and includes the choice of like or dislike, the dislike reason if provided, and the Copilot feature the feedback applies to.

# Manage Many Incoming Document Records

As you create or process incoming document records, the number of lines on the **Incoming Documents** page may grow to an extent where you lose overview. Therefore, you can set incoming document records to *Processed* to remove them from the default view. When you choose the **Show All** action, you can view both processed and unprocessed records.

> [!NOTE]  
> You cannot edit information, attach files, or perform other processes on incoming document records that are set to *Processed*. You must first set it to *Unprocessed*.

The **Processed** check box is automatically selected on incoming document records that have been processed, but you can also select or deselect the check box manually. Depending on your business process, an incoming document record may be processed when a related document has been created for it or a file has been attached.

> [!NOTE]  
> When you open the **Incoming Documents** page with the **My Incoming Documents** action on the Role Center, only unprocessed incoming document records are shown by default. This is referred to in this topic as "the default view".

## To remove incoming document records from the default view

1. On the **Incoming Documents** page, select one or more lines for incoming document records that you want to remove from the default view.
2. Choose the **Set to Processed** action.

    The incoming document records are removed from the default view, and the **Processed** check box is selected on the lines.

> [!NOTE]  
> You can also perform this action for the individual record on the **Incoming Document Card** page.

## To view all incoming document records

1. On the **Incoming Documents** page, choose the **Show All** action.

All incoming document records are displayed, including records where the **Processed** check box isn't selected.

## To add incoming document records to the default view

1. On the **Incoming Documents** page, choose the **Show All** action.
2. Select one or more lines for incoming document records that you want to appear in the default view.
3. Choose the **Set to Unprocessed** action.

# Reconcile bank accounts with Copilot

This article explains how bank account reconciliation assist can help you reconcile bank transactions with ledger entries in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central.

## About bank account reconciliation assist

Bank account reconciliation assist is a set of AI-powered features that help you reconcile bank accounts. It offers two distinct tasks through Copilot:

- Improved matching of transactions with ledger entries

    As you might already know, the **Match Automatically** button on the **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** page automatically matches most bank transactions with ledger entries. We refer to this operation as *automatch*. Although automatch works well, the algorithms that it uses can sometimes result in many unmatched transactions. Copilot uses AI technology to inspect those unmatched transactions and identify more matches, based on the dates, amounts, and descriptions. For example, if a customer paid multiple invoices in one lump sum that you have registered as individually paid invoices, Copilot reconciles the single bank statement line with the multiple bank ledger entries.

    [Learn more about this task](#reconcile-bank-accounts-with-copilot).

- Suggested general ledger (G/L) accounts

    For residual bank transactions that can't be matched to any ledger entries, Copilot compares the transaction description with G/L account names and then suggests the most likely G/L account to post to. For example, if unmatched transactions have the narrative *Fuel Stop 24*, Copilot might suggest that you post them to the *Transportation* account.

    [Learn more about this task](#post-unmatched-bank-transaction-amounts-to-suggested-gl-accounts).

## Supported languages

[!INCLUDE[copilot-language-support](includes/copilot-language-support.md)]

## Prerequisites

- The **Bank account reconciliation** capability is activated. An administrator must complete this task. Learn more in [Configure Copilot and agent capabilities](enable-ai.md).
- You're familiar with bank account reconciliation in Business Central. Learn more in [Reconcile Bank Accounts](bank-how-reconcile-bank-accounts-separately.md).

## Reconcile bank accounts with Copilot

<!-- Similar to the **Match Automatically** capability on the **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** page, Bank account reconciliation assist can also automatically matches transactions in banks statements with bank entries. The difference is that **Match Automatically** uses a native rules-based algorithm, while Bank account reconciliation assist is based AI technology though Copilot. Bank account reconciliation assist is intended to supplement the **Match Automatically** capability. While **Match Automatically** is fairly successful at matching transactions, there are some instances where it can't&mdash;which is where Bank account reconciliation assist comes. By using the **Reconcile with Copilot** action on **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** page, you can find even more matches.-->

Copilot in bank account reconciliation is intended to supplement the automatch operation. Therefore, when you use Copilot, the automatch operation runs first to make the initial matches. Then Copilot runs to try to match transactions that the automatch operation didn't handle.

You can use two approaches to reconcile bank accounts with Copilot:

- Use Copilot to start a new reconciliation on a bank account, directly from the **Bank Account Reconciliations** list.
- Use Copilot on a new or existing reconciliation on a **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** card.

# [From the Bank Account Reconciliation list](#tab/fromlist)

For this approach, you create and reconcile a new bank account reconciliation from scratch. This approach requires that you select the bank account. If the bank account isn't linked to an online account, you must also import the bank statement file.

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Bank Account Reconciliations**, and then select the related link.
1. Select ![Shows the copilot icon](media/copilot-icon.png) **Start a Copilot prompt action** > **Reconcile** to open the **Reconcile with Copilot** window.
1. Set the **Perform reconciliation for this bank account** field to the bank account that you want to reconcile.

    ![Screenshot that shows the Reconcile with Copilot window for reconciling from scratch.](media/reconcile-bank-accounts-new-copilot.svg)

1. If the selected bank account isn't linked to an online bank account, you must import the bank statement file. To import the file, either select the value in the **Use transaction data from** field or select the paper clip button next to the **Generate** button. Then use **Select the file to import** to import the bank statement file by either dragging it from your device or browsing your device.
1. To reconcile with Copilot, select **Generate**.

    Copilot starts to generate proposed matches. When it finishes, the **Reconcile with Copilot** window shows the results of the matching process.

1. Review the proposed matches as described in the next section.

# [From a Bank Acc. Reconciliation card](#tab/fromcard)

For this approach, you use Copilot either on a new bank account reconciliation that you manually create or by editing an existing reconciliation.

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Bank Account Reconciliations**, and then select the related link.
1. Follow one of these steps:

    - Select **New** to start a new reconciliation. Add the statement lines, either manually or by using **Suggest Lines** action to get a copy of the bank ledger entries as a starting point.
    - Select and open an existing reconciliation in the list.

1. On the **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** card, select ![Shows the Copilot icon](media/copilot-icon-rainbow.png) > **Reconcile with Copilot** in the upper-right corner.

    ![Screenshot that shows the Reconcile with Copilot button on a Bank Acc. Reconciliation card.](media/bank-reconciliation-copilot-card.png)

    Copilot starts to generate proposed matches. When it finishes, the **Reconcile with Copilot** window shows the results of the matching process.

1. Review the proposed matches as described in the next section.
---

### Review, save, or discard proposed matches

After you run Copilot, the **Reconcile with Copilot** window shows the detailed results, including any proposed matches. At this point, no match that Copilot proposed has been saved. Therefore, you have an opportunity to inspect the proposals and save or discard them as you want.

![Screenshot that shows proposed matches in the Reconcile with Copilot window.](media/bank-reconciliation-copilot-window.png)

The **Reconcile with Copilot** window is divided into two sections. The upper section provides some general details about the result. The lower section, **Match proposals**, lists the matches that Copilot proposed.

The following table describes the fields in the upper section.

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| Auto-matched | The number of bank statement lines that the automatch operation matched. Select the value to view the reconciliation card. |
| Copilot matched | The number of bank statement lines that Copilot proposed matches for. You can view details of the matches in the **Match proposals** section. |
| Statement Ending Balance | The ending balance that is shown on the bank statement that you're reconciling with. |
| Post if fully applied | Turn on this option to automatically post the bank account reconciliation when all lines (100 percent) are matched and you select **Keep it**. |

In the **Match proposals** section, review the proposed matches line by line. Then take the appropriate action:

- To discard a single proposed match, select it in the list, and then select **Delete Line**.
- To discard all proposed matches and close the **Reconcile with Copilot** window, select the ![Discard button.](media/copilot-delete-trash-can.png) **Discard it** button next to the **Keep it** button at the bottom of the window.
- To automatically post the fully matched reconciliation when you save it, turn on the **Post if fully applied** option.
- To save the matches that are currently shown in the **Reconcile with Copilot** window, select **Keep it**.

## Post unmatched bank transaction amounts to suggested G/L accounts

This section explains how to use Copilot to post unreconciled bank account statement line amounts (as specified in the **Difference** field) to a G/L account. This task can be done only from an existing reconciliation.

1. Go to the **Bank Account Reconciliations** list, and open the existing reconciliation that includes the unreconciled lines.

    This step gives you a clear view of any unreconciled bank statement lines that must be transferred to the G/L account.

1. In the **Bank statement lines** pane, identify the unmatched bank statement lines, and select one or more lines that you want to reconcile.

    Copilot focuses on the selected lines to post new payments to the G/L account.

1. Select ![Shows the Copilot icon](media/copilot-icon-rainbow.png) > **Post Difference to G/L Account** to start the process.

    ![Screenshot that shows the Post Difference to G/L Account button on the Bank Acc. Reconciliation card.](media/bank-reconciliation-transfer-gl-copilot-card.png)

    Copilot starts to generate proposals for posting new payments.

1. After Copilot finishes generating proposals, the **Copilot Proposals for Posting Differences to G/L Accounts** window appears.

    The **Match proposals** section of this window shows the proposals. The experience resembles the experience for reconciling with Copilot.

    ![Screenshot that shows Copilot Proposals for Posting Differences to G/L Accounts window.](media/bank-reconciliation-gl-transfer-proposed-matches-v2.png)

    To post the differences as regular journal entries, you must specify the general journal template and batch to use. This allows you to reverse the transaction if you need to later.

1. Review the proposals line by line to ensure the accuracy of the suggested payments for posting.

    - If you drill down on the proposal by selecting it in the list, you're taken to a list of accounts. From there, you can select another account. You can do this type of manual correction only when you use the **Post Difference to G/L Account** flow, not the matching flow.
    - If you select **Save** next to a proposal, you can add the mapping to the **Text-to-Account Mapping** page. Then, the next time that this text appears during matching, it's mapped to the proposed account.

1. Discard or save proposals.

    - To discard a specific proposal, select it in the list, and then select **Delete Line**. To discard all proposals and close Copilot, select the ![Discard button.](media/copilot-delete-trash-can.png) **Discard it** button next to the **Keep it** button at the bottom of the window.
    - If the proposals meet your requirements, and you want to save them, select **Keep it**.

         This step confirms the transfer of the currently selected proposals from the bank account ledger to the G/L account. It posts new payments to the proposed G/L accounts and applies corresponding lines to the resulting bank account ledger entries.

# Design Details: Item Tracking Availability
The **Item Tracking Lines** and **Item Tracking Summary** pages provide dynamic availability information for serial or lot numbers. The purpose of this is to increase transparency for users on outbound documents, such as sales orders, by showing them which serial numbers or how many units of a lot number are currently assigned on other open documents. This reduces uncertainty that is caused by double allocation and instills confidence in order processors that the item tracking numbers and dates that they are promising on unposted sales orders can be fulfilled. For more information, see [Design Details: Item Tracking Lines Page](design-details-item-tracking-lines-window.md).  

 When you open the **Item Tracking Lines** page, availability data is retrieved from the **Item Ledger Entry** table and the **Reservation Entry** table, with no date filter. When you choose the **Serial No.** field or the **Lot No.** field, the **Item Tracking Summary** page opens and shows a summary of the item tracking information in the **Reservation Entry** table. The summary contains the following information about each serial or lot number on the item tracking line:  

|Field|Description|  
|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
|**Total Quantity**|The total quantity of the serial or lot number that is currently in inventory.|  
|**Total Requested Quantity**|The total quantity of the serial or lot number that is currently requested in all documents.|  
|**Current Pending Quantity**|The quantity that is entered in the current instance of the **Item Tracking Lines** page but is not yet committed to the database.|  
|**Total Available Quantity**|The quantity of the serial or lot number that is available for the user to request.<br /><br /> This quantity is calculated from other fields on the page as follows:<br /><br /> total quantity – (total requested quantity + current pending quantity).|  

> [!NOTE]  
>  You can also see the information in the preceding table by using the **Select Entries** function on the **Item Tracking Lines** page.  

 To preserve database performance, availability data is only retrieved once from the database when you open the **Item Tracking Lines** page and when you use the **Refresh Availability** function on the page.  

## Calculation Formula  
 As described in the preceding table, the availability of a given serial or lot number is calculated as follows.  

 total available quantity = quantity in inventory – (all demands + quantity not yet committed to the database)  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  This formula implies that the serial or lot number availability calculation considers only inventory and ignores projected receipts. Accordingly, supply that is not yet posted to inventory does not affect item tracking availability, as opposed to regular item availability where projected receipts are included.

# About the Data Exchange Framework

You can use the Data Exchange Framework to manage the exchange of business documents, bank files, currency exchange rates, and any other data files with your business partners or authorities.

As an administrator or Microsoft partner, you can use the framework in new integration features by setting up which data to exchange and how. For example, the format of files for exchange of data in bank files, electronic documents, currency exchange rates, and other with ERP systems vary depending on the provider of the data file or stream and on the country/region. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports various bank file formats and data service standards. To provide support for other electronic document formats, you use the data exchange framework.

 The following diagrams show the architecture of the data exchange framework.  

 ![Data Exchange Framework &#45; Import.](media/across-data-exchange/dataexchangeframework_import.png)  

 ![Data Exchange Framework &#45; Export.](media/across-data-exchange/dataexchangeframework_export.png)  

## Electronic documents

As an alternative to emailing business documents as file attachments, you can send and receive them electronically. An "electronic document" is a standard-compliant file representing a business document, such as an invoice from a vendor that you can receive and convert to a purchase invoice in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Trading partners exchange electronic documents through external document exchange services. By default, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports sending and receiving electronic invoices and credit memos in the PEPPOL format, which is supported by the largest providers of document exchange services. Currently, Avalara and Pagero exchange services are pre-configured and ready to be set up for your company (Microsoft will support more exchange services in near future). To provide support for other electronic document formats, you must check if they're already delivered in your localization to create new data exchange definitions.  

From PDF or image files representing incoming documents, you can have an external OCR service (Optical Character Recognition) create electronic documents that you can then convert to document records in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], like for electronic PEPPOL documents. For example, when you receive an invoice in PDF format from your vendor, you can send it to the OCR service from the **Incoming Documents** page. After a few seconds, you receive the file back as an electronic invoice that can be converted to a purchase invoice for the vendor. If you send the file to the OCR service by email, then a new incoming document record is automatically created when you receive the electronic document back.  

To send, for example, a sales invoice as an electronic PEPPOL document, read this [instruction](finance-how-use-edocuments.md). The data conversion and sending of the PEPPOL sales invoice are performed by dedicated codeunits and XMLports.  

To receive, for example, an invoice from a vendor as an electronic PEPPOL document, read the following [instruction](finance-how-use-edocuments-purchase.md). You can either set up the Job Queue feature to process such files regularly or you can start the process manually. For both sales and purchase processes, first, [you must set up](finance-how-setup-edocuments.md) various master data, such as services, company information, vendors, items, and units of measure. These are used to identify the business partners and items when you convert data in elements in the incoming document file to fields in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The receiving and data conversion of PEPPOL invoices are performed by the Data Exchange Framework.  

To receive, for example, an invoice as an electronic OCR document, you process it the same way as you would when receiving an electronic PEPPOL document. The receiving and conversion of electronic documents from OCR are performed by the Data Exchange Framework, represented by the **OCR – Invoice** data exchange definition.  

## Bank files

The formats of files for exchanging bank data with business management applications vary depending on the supplier of the file and the country or region. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports import and export of Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) bank files. Additionally, the AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals extension lets you connect to a AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals extension provided by an external provider, AMC Consult. For more information, see [Make Payments with the AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals extension or SEPA Credit Transfer](finance-make-payments-with-bank-data-conversion-service-or-sepa-credit-transfer.md). To provide support for other electronic document formats, you use the Data Exchange Framework.  

To export SEPA credit transfers, you choose **Export Payments to File** button on the **Payment Journal** page and then upload the file to process the payments in your bank. First you must set up various master data, such as bank account, vendors, and payment methods. The data conversion and export of SEPA bank data is performed by a dedicated codeunit and XMLport, represented by the **SEPA Credit Transfer** bank export/import setup. Alternatively, you can set up the AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals extension to perform the export, represented by the **AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals extension - Credit Transfer** data exchange definition.  

 To export SEPA direct debit instructions, you choose the **Export Direct Debit File** button on the **Direct Debit Collections** page and then send to your bank to automatically collect the involved customer payments. First you must set up bank accounts, customers, direct-debit mandates, and payment methods. The data conversion and export of SEPA bank data is performed by dedicated a codeunit and XMLport, represented by the **SEPA Direct Debit** bank export/import setup.  

 To import SEPA bank statements, you choose the Import Bank Statement button in the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** and **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** pages and then you proceed to apply each bank statement entry to payments or bank ledger entries, manually or automatically. First you must set up bank accounts. The import and data conversion of SEPA bank data is performed by the Data Exchange Framework, represented by the **SEPA CAMT** data exchange definition. Alternatively, you can set up the AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals extension to perform the import, represented by the **AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals extension – Bank Statement** data exchange definition.  

 In addition, the local versions of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] support various other file formats for importing and exporting bank data, payroll transactions, and other data. For more information, see the [Local Functionality](about-localization.md) landing page for your country/region in the Help.  

## Currency exchange rates

You can set up an external service to keep your for currency exchange rates up to date. The service that provides updated currency exchange rates is enabled by a data exchange definition. Accordingly, the **Exch. Rate Update Setup Card** page is a condensed view of the **Data Exchange Definition** page for the data exchange definition in question.  

For all exchanges of data in XML files, you can prepare the data exchange setup by loading the related XML schema file on the **XML Schema Viewer** page. Here you select the data elements that you want to exchange with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]  and then you either initialize a data exchange definition or generate an XMLport.

## Intrastat

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses the Data Exchange Framework for Intrastat reporting where you can easily create timestamped files in different formats for export. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] contains prepared formats for localized countries/regions and for default version. But you can change the out-of-box report or make your own.

# Pick for production, assembly, or projects in basic warehouse configurations

How you pick components for production, projects, or assembly orders depends on how your warehouse is set up as a location. Learn more at [Setting Up Warehouse Management](warehouse-setup-warehouse.md).

In a basic warehouse configuration for the outbound flow (pick), on the **Location Card** page for the location, activate following settings:

* Production, select **Inventory Pick/Movement** in the **Prod. Consumption Whse. Handling** field.
* Assembly, select **Inventory Movement** in the **Asm. Consumption Whse. Handling** field.
* Project management, select **Inventory Pick** in the **Project Consumption Whse. Handling** field.

Use the following documents for internal operations:

* Inventory pick
* Inventory movement

## Inventory picks

* When you register an inventory pick for an internal operation, such as production or a project, the consumption of the picked components is posted at the same time.

* The **Bin Mandatory** toggle on the **Location Card** page is optional.
* When you use inventory picks, the **Bin Code** field on a production order component line or project planning lines defines the *take* bin. Components are decreased in the take bin when you post consumption.

## Inventory movements

* Inventory movements require that you turn on the **Bin Mandatory** toggle on the **Location Card** page for the location.
* Inventory movements only work with production order component lines and assembly order lines.
* When you register an inventory movement for an internal operation, you only record the physical movement of the components to a bin in the operation area. You don't post consumption.
* When you use inventory movements, the **Bin Code** field on production order component lines defines the *place* bin in the operation area. The place bin is where warehouse employees must place the components.
* Register the consumption of the picked components separately by posting a consumption journal or assembly order.

### Production

Use **Inventory Pick** documents for picking production components in the flow to production.

For a location that uses bins, you can extend the flow to production by using **Inventory Movement** documents. Inventory movements are especially useful for component flushing. To learn more about how component consumption is flushed from the To-Production or Open Shop Floor Bins, go to [Flushing Production Components in a Basic Warehouse Configuration](#flushing-production-components-in-a-basic-warehouse-configuration).

#### Over-picking in production

[!INCLUDE [manufacturing-overpicks](includes/manufacturing-overpicks.md)]

### Assembly  

Use **Inventory Movement** documents to move assembly components to the assembly area.

> [!NOTE]
> **Inventory Movement** documents require bins.

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports assemble-to-stock and assemble-to-order types of assembly flows. To learn more about assemble-to-order in the outbound warehouse flow, go to [Handling Assemble-to-Order Items with Inventory Picks](warehouse-how-to-pick-items-with-inventory-picks.md#handling-assemble-to-order-items-with-inventory-picks).

### Project management  

Use **Inventory Pick** documents to pick project components in the flow to project management.

For locations that use bins, you can extend the flow to project with **Inventory Movement** documents.

> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses the value in the **Remaining Quantity** field on the project planning line when it creates inventory picks. To use inventory picks for projects, you must turn on the **Apply Usage Link** toggle on the **Project Card** page for the projects. This setting lets you track usage against your plan. If you don't turn on the toggle, the remaining quantity stays at **0** and the inventory pick isn't created. To learn more, go to [To set up project usage tracking](projects-how-setup-jobs.md?tabs=current-experience#to-set-up-project-usage-tracking).

## Pick or move for production, assembly, and projects in a basic warehouse configuration

You can create an inventory pick or inventory movement in three ways:  

* From the source document itself.  
* For several source documents at the same time by using a batch job.  
* In two steps. Release the source document to make the source document ready for picking. Create the inventory pick or movement from the **Inventory Pick** or **Inventory Movement** documents. The inventory pick or movement are based on the source document.  

### To create an inventory pick from the source document

1. On the source document, which can be a production order or project, choose the **Create Inventory Put-away/Pick** action.  
2. Select the **Create Invt. Pick** checkbox.
3. Choose the **OK** button.

### To create an inventory movement from the source document

1. On the source document, which can be a production order, assembly order, or project, choose the **Create Inventory Put-away/Pick** action.  
2. Select the **Create Invt. Movement** checkbox.
3. Choose the **OK** button.

### To create multiple inventory picks or movements with a batch job

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Create Inventory Put-away/Pick/Movement**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Warehouse Request** FastTab, use the **Source Document** and **Source No.** fields to filter on types of documents or ranges of document numbers. For example, you might create picks only for productions orders.
3. On the **Options** FastTab, turn on the **Create Invt. Pick** or **Create Invt. Movement** toggles.
4. Choose the **OK** button.

### To create inventory picks or movements in two steps

To pick or move components for source documents in two steps, you must release the source document to make it ready for picking. Release source documents for internal operations in the following ways.  

|Source Document|Release Method|  
|---------------------|--------------------|  
|Production Order|On the **Planned Production Order** page, change the status of an order to **Released**, or use the **Released Production Order** page to create a released production order.|  
|Assembly Order|Change status of an assembly order to **Released**.|
|Projects | Change a project's status to **Open**, or create project with status Open right away.|  

A warehouse employee assigned to picking items can create an inventory put-away document for the source document.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Inventory Picks** or **Inventory Movement**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. In the **Source Document** field, select the type of source document that the put-away is for.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You can't use **Inventory Pick** documents for picking assembly components.
4. In the **Source No.** field, select the source document.  
5. Alternatively, choose the **Get Source Document** action to select the document from a list of inbound source documents that are ready for picking at the location.  
6. Choose the **OK** button to fill the pick or movement lines according to the selected source document.  

## To record the inventory pick

1. On the **Inventory Pick** page, open the document to record a pick for.  
2. In the **Bin Code** field on the pick lines, the bin where the items must be picked from the bin where the item is available. You can change the bin if needed.
3. Perform the pick, and then enter the pick quantity in the **Qty. to Handle** field.

    If you must pick the items for a line from more than one bin, for example because a bin doesn't contain the full quantity, use the **Split Line** action on the **Lines** FastTab. The action creates a line for the remaining quantity to handle.  
4. Choose the **Post** action.  

The following things happen during the posting process:

* Post the consumption of the source document lines that were picked.
* If the location uses bins, posting creates warehouse entries to post the changes to the bin quantity.

[!INCLUDE [preview-posting-warehouse](includes/preview-posting-warehouse.md)]

## To record the inventory movement

1. On the **Inventory Movement** page, open the document to record a movement for.  
2. In the **Bin Code** field on the movement lines, the bin to pick from is suggested based on the item's default bin and availability. You can change the bin if needed.  
3. Perform the move, and then enter the moved quantity in the **Qty. to Handle** field. The value on the Take and the Place lines must be the same. Otherwise, you can't register the movement.

    If you must take the items for a line from more than one bin, for example because a bin doesn't contain the full quantity, use the **Split Line** action on the **Lines** FastTab. The action creates a line for the remaining quantity to handle.  
4. Choose the **Register Invt. Movement** action.  

The following things happen during the posting process:

* Warehouse entries now indicate that the components are in the bins specified on the source document order lines. For example, the assembly order, production component, or project planning line.

>[!NOTE]
> Unlike when you move components with inventory picks, consumption isn't posted when you register an inventory movement. You register consumption as a separate step by posting the source document.

## Flushing production components in a basic warehouse configuration

Flushing methods affect the flow of components in production. Learn more at [Flush Components According to Operation Output](production-how-to-flush-components-according-to-operation-output.md). Depending on the flushing method you select, you can pick components for production in the following ways:

* Use an **Inventory Pick** document to record the pick for items that use the **Pick + Manual** flushing method. When you register an inventory pick, the consumption of the picked components is posted.
* Use an **Inventory Movement** document without a reference to a source document or other ways to record the movement of components that use the **Manual** flushing method. You must register consumption separately. Learn more at [Batch Post Production Consumption](production-how-to-post-consumption.md).

### Example

You have a production order for 15 PCS of item SP-SCM1004. Some of the items on the component list must be flushed manually in a consumption journal, and other items can be picked and flushed automatically using the **Pick + Backward** flushing method.  

The following steps provide an example of the actions that different people take and the related responses:  

1. The shop floor supervisor releases the production order. Items with **Forward** flushing method and no routing link are deducted from the open shop floor bin.  
2. The shop floor supervisor chooses the **Create Inventory Put-away/Pick** action on the production order and turns on the **Create Invt. Pick** and **Create Invt. Movement** toggles. An inventory pick document is created for items with **Manual** flushing method, and an inventory movement is created for items with **Pick + Backward** and **Pick + Forward** flushing methods.
3. The warehouse manager assigns the picks and movements to a warehouse employee.
4. The warehouse employee picks the items from the appropriate bins and places them in the To-Production bin or in the bin specified on the inventory movement. The bin can be a work center or machine center bin.  
5. The warehouse employee posts the pick. The quantity is deducted from the bins.
6. The warehouse employee posts the movement. The quantity is deducted from the pick bins and added to the consumption bin. The **Qty. Picked** field on the component list for all picked items is updated.  
7. The machine operator informs the production manager that the end items are finished.  
8. The shop floor supervisor uses the output journal or production journal to post the output. The quantity of component items that use **Pick + Forward** or **Pick + Backward** flushing methods with routing links is deducted from the To-Production bin.
9. The production manager changes the status of the production order to **Finished**. The quantity of component items that use **Backward** flushing method is deducted from the open shop floor bin, and the quantity of component items that use **Pick + Backward** flushing method and no routing link is deducted from the To-Production bin.  

 The following illustration shows when the **Bin Code** field on the component list is filled according to your location or machine/work center setup.

# Enable Automatic Breaking Bulk with Directed Put-away and Pick

For locations that use directed put-away and pick, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can break larger units of measure into smaller units of measure when it creates warehouse instructions for source documents, production orders, or internal picks and put-aways. To breakbulk can also mean gathering items in smaller units of measure to equal the quantity of a larger unit of measure on a source document or production order.

## Breakbulk in picks  

If you want to store items in several different units of measure in a location and allow them to be automatically combined in the picking process, turn on the **Allow Breakbulk** toggle on the Location Card page. Afterward, to fulfill a task [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will look for an item in the same unit of measure. If it doesn't find one, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will suggest that you break a larger unit of measure into the unit of measure that is needed.  

If only smaller units of measure are available, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will suggest that you gather items to fulfill the quantity on the shipment or production order. In effect, it breaks the larger unit of measure on the source document into smaller units for picking.  

## Breakbulk in put-aways  

In warehouse put-aways, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] suggests Place action lines in the put-away unit of measure. For example, it might suggest pieces even though the items arrive in a different unit of measure.  

## Breakbulk in movements  

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can also breakbulk in replenishment movements if the **Allow Breakbulk** toggle on the **Calculate Bin Replenishment** page is turned on.  

You can view the results of the conversion process from one unit of measure to another as intermediate breakbulk lines in the put-away, pick, or movement instructions.  

> [!NOTE]  
> If you select the **Set Breakbulk Filter** field on the warehouse instruction header, application will hide the breakbulk lines whenever the larger unit of measure is going to be completely used. For example, if a pallet is 12 pieces and you'll use all 12 pieces, the pick will then direct you to take 1 pallet and place 12 pieces. However, if you must pick only 9 pieces the breakbulk lines aren't hidden, even if you've selected the **Breakbulk Filter** field. The lines aren't hidden because you must put the remaining three pieces somewhere in the warehouse.  

> [!NOTE]  
> If you want your units of measure to perform optimally in the warehouse, also in connection with breakbulk, you should try to:  
>
> - Set up the base unit of measure for an item as the smallest unit of measure that you expect to handle in your warehouse processes.  
> - Set up your alternative units of measure for the item as multiples of the base unit of measure.
