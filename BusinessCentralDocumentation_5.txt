# Sandbox Environments in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]

With [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, you can easily get a safe environment where you can test, train, or troubleshoot without disturbing your company's work processes or business data. Such a non-production environment is called a *sandbox*. Isolated from production, a sandbox environment is the place to safely explore, learn, demo, develop, and test the service without the risk of affecting the data and settings of your production environment.  

> [!TIP]
> Did you land on this article after you chose the name of your [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] environment in the top bar? Currently, you cannot change the name or the environment that way. Instead, you must ask your admin to change the name, or ask them to share the link to another environment.

Your administrator manages sandbox environments in the [administration center](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/tenant-admin-center-environments?toc=/dynamics365/business-central/toc.json).  

For example, if you want to create a sandbox for benchmarking, your administrator can create a dedicated environment in the administration center. For more information, see [Production and Sandbox Environments](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/environment-types) in the developer and administration content.  

You can also safely use sandboxes for training, such as for following a learning path from [Microsoft training](/training/dynamics365/business-central?WT.mc_id=dyn365bc_landingpage-docs), because it's a safe environment to experiment with. If anything goes wrong, you just delete the sandbox and start over.  

Once you're done, you can remove the sandbox, using the administration center.  

> [!NOTE]
> Technically, sandbox environments are very different from production environments. Your administrator can create a sandbox that includes production data, but it is still a sandbox, and you cannot request a database export, for example. For more information, see [Sandbox environments](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/environment-types#sandbox-environments) in the developer and administration content.

The sandbox environment is not least useful because it includes a couple of handy features:

* [Advanced user experience](#advanced-user-experience)  
<!--* [Complete sample data](#complete-sample-data)  -->
* [Designer](#designer)  

## Advanced user experience

It is possible to enable and try the full functionality of the standard version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in a sandbox tenant by setting the **Experience** field on the **Company Information** page to *Premium*. Find the **Company Information** page in the :::image type="content" source="media/ui-experience/settings_icon_small.png" alt-text="Settings icon."::: menu.  

After you have enabled the *Premium* user experience, you get access to all the standard profiles (roles) and Role Centers in the standard version. Alternatively, contact a reselling partner for a demonstration of the capabilities. For more information, see [How do I find a reselling partner?](across-faq.yml#how-do-i-find-a-reselling-partner).  

### Complete sample data

For situations where you need additional sample data, please talk to your reselling partner.
<!-- In the sandbox environment, you can also create a new company with the **Advanced Evaluation - Complete Sample Data** option so that you can take training or step through walkthroughs that require additional sample data, such as [Walkthrough: Receiving and Putting Away in Basic Warehouse Configurations](walkthrough-receiving-and-putting-away-in-basic-warehousing.md).   -->

<!--#### To create a company with complete sample data in a sandbox

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Companies**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action, and then choose **Create New Company**.  
3. In the **Assisted Setup for Creating a Company** page, choose **Next**.  
4. Specify a name for the new company, and then, in the **Select the data and setup to get started** field, choose **Advanced Evaluation - Complete Sample Data**.  
5. Complete the rest of the assisted setup guide.  

When the assisted setup guide completes, you can start exploring the new company with the complete sample data. For more information, see [Creating New Companies in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]](about-new-company.md).  -->

## Designer

In a sandbox environment, you will find the **Designer** enabled. You can activate Designer by selecting the design icon ![Designer.](./media/across-sandbox/sandbox-inclient-design-icon.png) on a page, or by choosing the **Design** menu item in the ![Settings](media/ui-experience/settings_icon_small.png) Settings menu.  

For more information, see [Use Designer](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-inclient-designer) in the developer and admin content (in English only).  

<!-- ![In-client Designer.](./media/across-sandbox/sandbox-inclient-designer.png) -->

# Set Up Opportunity Sales Cycles and Cycle Stages

Before you start using sales opportunities, you must set up sales cycles and sales cycle stages. A sales cycle is made up of a series of stages that go from the initial contact to the closing of a sale. For each stage, you define any requirements that must be met, such as requiring a sales quote, before an opportunity can go to the next stage. You can also specify whether a stage can be skipped. You can set up as many sales cycles as you need. You can set up as many sales cycle stages as necessary within a sales cycle.

To use opportunity sales cycles, you must set up the sales cycle, define the different stages of the cycle, and then assign the cycle to opportunities. Assigning the relevant activity or tasks to the opportunity may also be part of setting up a sales cycle.

This article also describes how to set up tasks and activities, and how to assign tasks to activities. For more information, see [To set up activities with tasks](marketing-how-setup-opportunity-sales-cycles-stages.md#to-set-up-activities-with-tasks).

## To set up opportunity sales cycle codes

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Cycles**, and then choose the related link. The **Sales Cycles** page opens, and lists all the existing sales cycles.
2. Choose the **New** action, and fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

Repeat these steps to set up as many sales cycles as you want. After you have set up opportunity sales cycles, you may want to set up the different stages within each cycle.

## To define opportunity sales cycle stages

1. On the **Sales Cycles** page, select the opportunity sales cycle for which you want to set up stages, and then choose the **Stages** action. The **Sales Cycle Stages** page opens.
2. Choose the **New** action to enter a new stage in the sales cycle.

Repeat these steps to set up as many stages as you want within the sales cycle.

## To assign stage cycles to opportunities

After you add the opportunities stage cycle, you can start to add sales opportunities, and then assign the stage cycle to opportunities by setting the **Sales Cycle Code** field. For more information, see [Create Sales Opportunities](marketing-how-create-opportunities.md).

## To set up activities with tasks

You can combine multiple tasks, such as tasks that each represent a step, in activities. Activity tasks are related to each other by a date formula. You can assign activities to opportunities, salespeople, or contacts.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Activities**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action, and fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
3. On the **Lines** FastTab, fill in the fields as necessary to define one or more tasks in the activity.

## To assign tasks or activities of tasks to opportunities

When you have set up a task, you can assign it to a sales opportunity and thereby assign the activity that the task belongs to.

> [!NOTE]
> You cannot create tasks of type *Meeting* in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online. The capability requires access to an on-premises deployment.

The following procedure describes how to assign activity tasks to opportunities. The steps are similar when you assign tasks to salespeople and contacts.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Opportunities**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select an opportunity, and then choose the **Tasks** action.
3. On the **Task List** page, choose the **Create Task** action.
4. The **Create Task** page, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

    > [!TIP]
    > As you can see in the **Opportunity** field, the task is automatically assigned to the relevant opportunity.
5. Choose the **OK** button.
6. On the **Task List** page, select the new task, and then choose the **Assign Activities** action.
7. On the **Assign Activity** page, fill in the fields as necessary, and then choose the **OK** button.

The **Income Statement by Month** report provides a detailed, month-to-month view of net changes across all income statement accounts, organized in a hierarchy for intuitive navigation. You can explore specific details by drilling down to the **Income Statement Drill-Through** report, which provides access to the underlying ledger entries.

This report is for senior management and finance administrators, offering a profit and loss overview that supports financial analysis, performance tracking, and informed decision-making.

:::image type="content" source="media/finance/income-statement-by-month-report.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Income Statement by Month report" lightbox="media/finance/income-statement-by-month-report.png":::

## Use the report

CFOs use the report to analyze monthly profitability trends for the fiscal year. For example, you might review the month-to-month changes in both operating expenses and revenue to identify drivers in overall profitability.

Finance administrators use the report to manage and review the operating expenses by a Department dimension. For example, if you spot an unexpected rise in costs, you could filter the report by department to identify the department responsible for the increased expenditure. This information can help you investigate and realign the department budget, if needed.

# Record and reimburse employees' expenses

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports transactions for employees in a similar way as for vendors. Accordingly, employee posting groups exist to make sure that employee ledger entries are posted to the relevant accounts in the general ledger.

> [!NOTE]  
> Reimbursement payments to employees do not support discounts and payment tolerances.

If employees spend their own money during business activities, you can post the expense to the employee's account. Then you can reimburse the employee by making a payment to the employee's bank account, similarly to how you pay vendors.  

This article explains how to record the expense in the books and how to reimburse the employee. Your organization might have a portal or app where employees can submit their expense reports.

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is flexible enough to suit many different practices. The exact account numbers to use depend on your organization's configuration and processes.  

You can use general journals for employee accounts to register employee expenses and reimbursement transactions in foreign currencies, and then easily track the amounts and compare them to receipts. Leave your calculator in your desk drawer—Business Central can adjust the exchange rate for you. When you use general journals to post transactions for employee accounts, such as when you reimburse expenses, you can use the **Currency Code** field to specify the currency for the transactions. Specifying a currency lets you use the same features as when you register transactions in the customer and vendor ledgers. For example, employees can register an expense in euros but get paid in dollars.

To ensure that the exchange rate for the amounts is up to date, you can adjust employee balances when you run the currency exchange rate batch job. If you want to use the exchange rate table, but settle employee balances in your local currency, you can exclude employee accounts when you adjust exchange rates.

## To record an employee's expense

You post employees' expenses on the **General Journal** page.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the relevant general journal batch. For more information, see [Work with General Journals](ui-work-general-journals.md).
3. On a new journal line, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  

    > [!NOTE]
    > [!INCLUDE[journal-showhide-columns-inline-tip](includes/journal-showhide-columns-inline-tip.md)]
4. Repeat step 3 for all the expenses that the employee has incurred.

    > [!TIP]  
    > If you want to enter multiple expense lines above one balance-account line for the employee's bank account, then select the **Suggest Balancing Amount** check box on the line for your batch on the **General Journal Batches** page. Then the **Amount** field on the balance-account line is automatically prefilled with the value that is required to balance the expenses.
5. Choose the **Post** action to record the expenses on the employee's account.

## To reimburse an employee

You reimburse employees by posting payments to their bank account on the **Payment Journal** page.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Payment Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the relevant payment journal batch. For more information, see [Work with General Journals](ui-work-general-journals.md).
3. Fill in the fields as necessary. For more information, see [Making Payments](payables-make-payments.md).
4. Alternatively, choose the **Suggest Employee Payment** action to automatically insert journal lines for pending employee reimbursements.
5. Choose the **Post** action to register the reimbursement.  

## To reconcile reimbursements with employee ledger entries

You apply employee payments to their related open employee ledger entries in the same way as you do for vendor payments, for example on the **Payment Reconciliation Journals** page, based on the related bank statement entries. For more information, see [Applying Payments Automatically and Reconciling Bank Accounts](receivables-apply-payments-auto-reconcile-bank-accounts.md). Alternatively, you can apply manually on the **Employee Ledger Entries** page. For more information, see the related [Reconcile Vendor Payments with the Payment Journal or from Vendor Ledger Entries](payables-how-apply-purchase-transactions-manually.md).

# Set up basic warehouses with operations areas

If you have internal operation areas, such as production or assembly areas, you can use the following basic warehouse documents to record your warehouse activities:  

- **Inventory Movement** page.  
- **Inventory Pick** page.  
- **Inventory Put-away** page.

To use these documents, you must set up one or more of the following fields on the the **Location Card** page for the location:

- The **Bin Mandatory** field.
- The **Inventory Pick/Movement** option in the **Prod. Consumption Whse. Handling** field.
- The **Inventory Movement** option in the **Asm. Consumption Whse. Handling** field.
- The **Inventory Put-Away** in the **Prod. Output Whse. Handling** field.

> [!NOTE]
> You can still post output and consumption directly from the source documents and journals.  

To use these pages with internal operations such as to pick and move components to production, depending on how much control you need you must do some or all the following steps:  

- Enable the inventory pick, move, and put-away documents.  
- Define default bin structures for components and end items flowing to and from operation resources.  
- Make to- and from- bins that are dedicated to specific operation resources. Dedicated bins prevent the items from being picked for outbound documents.

Bin codes that are set up on location cards define a default warehouse flow for certain activities, such as components in an assembly department. Other functionality exists to make sure that when items are placed in a certain bin, they can't be moved or picked to other activities. To learn more, go to [To create dedicated component bins](warehouse-how-to-set-up-basic-warehouses-with-operations-areas.md#to-create-dedicated-component-bins).

The following procedures are based on setting up basic warehouse activities around a production area. The steps are similar for other operation areas, such as assembly, service management, and jobs.  

> [!NOTE]  
> The following procedures assume that the **Bin Mandatory** toggle is turned on for the location.  

## To enable inventory documents for internal operation activities

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Locations**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the location card you want to set up.  
3. On the **Warehouse** FastTab, select **Inventory Put-Away** in the **Prod. Output Whse. Handling** field to indicate that when someone releases an internal source document with a bin code, an inventory put-away or movement document can be created.  
4. To require that an inventory pick or an inventory movement document when you create an outbound or internal source document with a bin code, fill in the following fields:

   - In the **Prod. Consumption Whse. Handling field**, choose **Inventory Pick/Movement**.
   - In the **Asm. Consumption Whse. Handling** field, choose **Inventory Movement**.  

## To define a default bin structure in the production area

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Locations**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the Location you want to set up.  
3. On the **Bins** FastTab, in the **Open Shop Floor Bin Code** field, enter the code of the bin in the production area with plenty of components that the machine operator can consume from without requesting a warehouse activity to bring them to the bin. Items that are placed in this bin are typically set up for automatic posting, or flushing. This setup means that the **Flushing Method** field contains **Forward**, **Backward**, or **Manual**.  

   > [!TIP]
   > You can also record flushing without requiring a pick. For example, skipping the pick might be useful for components which, due to their nature, you store in the shop floor zone so there's no need to pick. However, you might still have to manually post consumption, for example, because the consumed quantity can vary or require item tracking. To flush without picking, the item must use the **Pick + Manual** flushing method. To learn more, go to [Flushing methods](production-how-to-flush-components-according-to-operation-output.md#flushing-methods).

4. In the **To-Production Bin Code** field, enter the code of the bin in the production area where components that are picked for production at this location are placed by default before they can be consumed. Items that are placed in this bin are typically set up for manual picking. The **Flushing Method** field contains **Pick + Forward**, **Pick + Backward**, or **Pick + Manual** for warehouse picks and inventory movements.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > When you use inventory picks, the **Bin Code** field on a production order component line defines the *take* bin from where components are decreased when posting consumption. When you use inventory movements, the **Bin Code** field on production order component lines defines the *place* bin in the operation area where the warehouse worker must place the components.  

5. On the **Bins** FastTab, in the **From-Production Bin Code** field, enter the code of the bin in the production area where finished end items are taken from by default when the process involves a warehouse activity. In basic warehouse configurations, the activity is recorded as an inventory put-away or an inventory movement.  

Now, production order component lines with the default bin code require that forward-flushed components are placed there. However, until the components are consumed from that bin, other component demands might pick or consume from that bin because they're still considered available bin contents. To make sure that bin content is only available to component demand that uses that to-production bin, you must select the **Dedicated** field on the line for that bin code on the **Bins** page that you open from the location card.

This flow chart shows how the **Bin Code** field on production order component lines is filled according to your setup.  

![Bin flow chart.](media/binflow.png "BinFlow")

## To define a default bin structure in the assembly area

Components for assembly orders can't be picked or posted with inventory picks. Instead, use the **Inventory Movement** page. To learn more, go to [Pick or move for Production, Assembly, or Jobs in Basic Warehouse](warehouse-how-to-pick-for-production.md).

When picking and shipping sales line quantities that are assembled to the order, you must follow certain rules when creating the inventory pick lines. To learn more, go to [Handling assemble-to-order items with inventory picks](warehouse-how-to-pick-items-with-inventory-picks.md#handling-assemble-to-order-items-with-inventory-picks).

To learn more, go to [Assembly Management](assembly-assemble-items.md).

### To set up that an inventory movement is automatically created when the inventory pick for the assembly item is created

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Assembly Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the **Create Movements Automatically** checkbox.

### To set up the bin in the assembly area where components are placed by default before they can be consumed in assembly

The value in this field is automatically inserted in the **Bin Code** field on assembly order lines when this location is entered in the **Location Code** field on the assembly order line.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Locations**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the Location you want to set up.
3. Fill in the **To-Assembly Bin Code** field.

### To set up the bin in the assembly area where finished assembly items are posted to when they're assembled to stock

The value in this field is automatically inserted in the **Bin Code** field on assembly order headers when this location code is filled into the **Location Code** field on the assembly order header.

Bin codes that are set up on location cards define a default warehouse flow for specific warehouse activities, such as consumption of components in an assembly area. Other functionality exists to make sure that when items are placed in a default bin, they can't be moved or picked to other activities.

> [!NOTE]
> This setup is only possible for locations where the **Bin Mandatory** field is selected.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Locations**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the Location you want to set up.
3. Fill in the **From-Assembly Bin Code** field.

### To set up the bin where finished assembly items are posted to when they're assembled to a linked sales order

From this bin, the assembly items are shipped immediately, via an inventory pick, to fulfill the sales order.

> [!NOTE]
> You can't use this field if the location is set up to use directed pick and put-away.

The bin code is copied from the sales order line to the assembly order header to communicate to assembly workers where to place the output to ready it for shipping. It's also copied to the inventory pick line to communicate to warehouse workers where to take it from to ship it.

> [!NOTE]
> The Assemble-to-Order Shipment bin is always empty. When you post an assemble-to-order sales line, then the bin content is first positively adjusted with the assembly output. Immediately after, it's negatively adjusted with the shipped quantity.

The value in this field is automatically inserted in the Bin Code field on sales order lines that contain a quantity in the **Qty. to Assemble to Order** field or if the item to be sold has **Assemble-to-Order** in the **Replenishment System** field.

If the **Asm.-to-Order Shpt. Bin Code** is blank, then the **From-Assembly Bin Code** field is used instead. If both setup fields are blank, then the last used bin with content is used in the **Bin Code** field on sales order lines.

The same bin code is in turn copied to the **Bin Code** field on the inventory pick line that manages the shipment of the assemble-to-order quantity. To learn more, go to [Handling assemble-to-order items with inventory picks](warehouse-how-to-pick-items-with-inventory-picks.md#handling-assemble-to-order-items-with-inventory-picks).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Locations**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the Location you want to set up.
3. Fill in the **Asm.-to-Order Shpt. Bin Code** field.

## To create dedicated component bins

You can specify that quantities in a bin are protected from being picked for other demands than demand from their current purpose.

Quantities in dedicated bins can still be reserved. Accordingly, the quantities in dedicated bins are included in the **Total Available Quantity** field on the **Reservation** page.

For example, is a work center is set up with a bin code in the **To-Production Bin Code** field. Production order component lines with that bin code require that forward-flushed components are placed there. However, until the components are consumed from that bin, other component demands might pick or consume from that bin because they're still considered available bin contents. To make sure that bin content is only available to component demand that uses that to-production bin, you must select the **Dedicated** field on the line for that bin code on the **Bins** page that you open from the location card.

Making a bin dedicated provides similar functionality to using bin types, which is only available in advanced warehousing. To learn more, go to [Set Up Bin Types](warehouse-how-to-set-up-bin-types.md).

> [!CAUTION]
> Items in dedicated bins are not protected when they are picked and consumed as production components with the Inventory Pick page.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Locations**, and then choose the related link. Select the location that you want to update.  
2. Choose the **Bins** action.  
3. Select the **Dedicated** field for each bin that you want to use exclusively for certain internal operations and where you want quantities to be reserved for that internal operation once placed there.  

> [!NOTE]  
> The bin must be empty before you can select or clear the **Dedicated** field.

# Set up item tracking with serial, lot, and package numbers

Keep track of inventory items, even in complex warehouse configurations, by assigning numbers that are specific to each item. You can use numbers for individual objects, lots, or packages. With item tracking, you can trace items across internal warehouse movements, and outbound and inbound documents.

Items with serial and lot numbers can be traced both backwards and forward in the supply chain. Tracing is useful for general quality assurance and for product recalls. For more information, see [Trace Item-Tracked Items](inventory-how-to-trace-item-tracked-items.md).  

## Numbers and item tracking

As part of your warehouse processes, you can bundle your stock in packages, boxes, containers, and so on. But in order to keep track of the items, you assign unique numbers as identification. For example, you manufacture and sell a chair that has the item number *1900-S*. Each chair has a serial number, *1001*, but you also bundle four chairs into a lot, *LOT0001*. You also ship the chairs in a container with the package number *CONTAINER010* that also includes *LOT0100* with side tables, and *LOT200* with lamps.  

Depending on your configuration, you use these different numbers to keep track of inventory in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] at the various stages of purchasing, sales, warehouse operations, and so on.

## To set up item tracking codes

An item tracking code reflects the different considerations a company has regarding the use of serial and lot numbers for items moving through the inventory.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Item Tracking Codes**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.
3. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  
4. On the **Serial No.**, **Lot No.**, and the **Package Tracking** FastTabs, define policies of item tracking by serial, lot, and package numbers respectively.  

> [!NOTE]  
> If you want to track specific items or specific lots throughout their lifetime, you must choose the **SN Specific Tracking**, **Lot Specific Tracking**, and **Package Specific Tracking** fields, respectively. As a result, when you handle an outbound unit of an item with this item tracking code, you must always specify which serial number or lot number to handle. This means that when you sell a unit of the item, it must be applied against a specific pool of serial numbers or lot numbers. In other words, the serial, lot, or package number assigned to the item when it enters inventory must follow the item when it leaves inventory.

Because these setup fields cover all possible transactions with the item, the individual inbound/outbound fields are selected. However, the individual inbound/outbound fields have nothing to do with application across inventory. They merely define your company's work flow concerning when to assign item tracking numbers.  

> [!NOTE]  
> To assign item tracking numbers in warehouse activities, the **SN Warehouse Tracking** and **Lot Warehouse Tracking** fields must be selected on the item's item tracking code card.  

## To set up expiration rules for serial or lot numbers

For some items, you might want to set up specific expiration dates and rules in the item tracking code. This functionality allows you to keep track of when specific serial numbers and lot numbers expire.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Item Tracking Codes**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select an existing item tracking code, and then choose the **Edit** action.  
3. On the **Misc.** FastTab, select the following fields:  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Strict Expiration Posting**|Specifies that the expiration date for the item tracking number when it entered inventory is respected when it exits inventory.|  
    |**Require Expiration Date Entry**|Specifies that you must enter an expiration date on the item tracking line.|  
    |**Use Expiration Dates**|Specifies that you want to calculate expiration dates. |  

## To set up warranties for serial or lot numbers

For some items, you might want to set up specific warranties in the item tracking code. This functionality allows you to keep track of when the warranties on specific serial or lot numbers in your inventory expire.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Item Tracking Codes**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select an existing item tracking code, and then choose the **Edit** action.  
3. On the **Misc.** FastTab, fill in the **Warranty Date Formula** field, and then select the fields as follows:  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Warranty Date Formula**|Specifies the last day of warranty for the item.|  
    |**Require Warranty Date Entry**|Specifies that you must manually enter a warranty date on the item tracking line.|  

## To set up items for tracking with the correct item tracking codes

To enable item tracking, you first have to assign the item tracking codes to an item. There are two ways to add item tracking codes, by selecting the code from a predefined list or by assigning a new unique code. Hover over the fields to read a short description.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Item**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select an existing item from the list, and open the **Item Card** page.  
3. On the **Item Tracking** FastTab, assign the appropriate item tracking codes and choose the **Item Tracking Code**, the **Serial Nos.**, and the **Lot Nos.**.
    1. Alternatively you can also create a new item tracking code by selecting the **New** action.

## To specify opening balances for the items, you track

You can create opening balances for the items you track. Because you can choose different warehouse configurations, there are two options:

* Enable specific batches on the **Item Journal** page to let people enter serial, lot, and package data directly on journal lines.
* For locations where the **Directed Put-away and Pick** toggle is turned on, use the **Warehouse Physical Inventory Journal** page to make all item tracking fields available. The fields that are available include the **Warranty Date** and **Expiration Date** fields.

### Item journals

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Item Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. To open a list of item journal batches, choose the **Name** field.
3. Choose **New** to create a new batch, and then turn on the **Item Tracking on Lines** toggle.
4. Choose **OK** to select the batch you created.
5. Fill in the fields on the item journal line as necessary. The **Lot No.**, **Serial No.**, **Expiration Date**, **Warranty Date**, and **Package No.** fields are available if you enabled item tracking.
    1. Alternatively choose the **Edit in Excel** action. Using Excel lets you quickly fill in columns, including **Serial No.**, **Lot No.**, **Package No.**, **Expiration Date**, and **Warranty Date**. When you're done, choose **Publish** to send changes to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].
6. Choose the **Post** action to adjust inventory.

> [!NOTE] 
> [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] does a few minor validations when you enter or import data. A more comprehensive check happens when you post or transfer data from journal lines to the **Item Tracking** page. The latter happens automatically when you open the **Item Tracking** page from the item journal line or if you choose the **Update Item Tracking Lines** action.

### Warehouse physical inventory journal for locations where directed pick and put-away is turned on  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Warehouse Physical Inventory Journal**, and then choose the related link.
2. Fill in the fields on the item journal line as necessary. The **Lot No.**, **Serial No.**, **Expiration Date**, **Warranty Date**, and **Package No.** fields are available if you enabled item tracking.
3. Choose the **Register** action to make the inventory adjustments. Remember to synchronize the adjusted warehouse entries with the related item ledger entries. To learn more, go to [synchronize the adjusted warehouse entries](/dynamics365/business-central/inventory-how-count-adjust-reclassify#to-synchronize-the-adjusted-warehouse-entries-with-the-related-item-ledger-entries).

For bulk imports, use configuration packages to import data to the journals.

# Post the Year-End Closing entry

After you use the **Close Income Statement** batch job to generate the year-end closing entry or entries, you must open the journal you specified in the batch job, and then review and post the entries.  

> [!TIP]
> Depending on your organizations work processes, you can choose to close or not close accounting periods and fiscal years in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The following procedure assumes that you have closed the fiscal year using the *Accounting Periods* option, generated a year-end closing entry using the **Close Income Statement** batch job, and are now ready to post the year-end closing entry along with the offsetting equity account entries. Your organization can choose to work differently, such as post the year-end closing entry as part of closing the fiscal year.

## To post the year end closing entry

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **General Journals** page, in the **Batch Name** field, select the batch that contains the closing entries.
3. Review the entries.
4. To post the journal, choose the **Post** action.

> [!NOTE]  
> If an error is detected, an error message is displayed. If the posting is successful, the posted entries are removed from the journal. After posting is complete, an entry is posted to each income statement account so that its balance becomes zero and the year's result is transferred to the balance sheet.

# Suggest substitute items with Copilot

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](includes/preview-banner.md)]

This article explains how to find and assign substitute items faster by letting Copilot suggest the items to add.

[!INCLUDE [production-ready-preview-dynamics365](includes/production-ready-preview-dynamics365.md)]

## About item substitution suggestions

To ensure they can fulfill orders quickly, businesses often assign similar items to each other so they can use them as substitutes. For example, substitutes are good to have when the item that was originally requested is out of stock. Finding and assigning the right items to use as substitutes can be time consuming, and that's where Copilot can help. The suggest item substitutions capability for Copilot can speed up the process of finding similar items.

Information about products is stored in multiple places in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For example, item numbers and descriptions are stored in the Item table, multiple barcodes are stored in the Item Reference table, and item properties are stored in the Item Attributes table. Copilot uses a large language model combined with embedded search to comb through this information and suggest items that might be good substitutes. While you might prompt for *Red bicycle*, the actual product might be *Crimson Tourer**, where *Bicycle* is an item category and *Red* is an attribute.

## Available languages

[!INCLUDE [copilot-geo-and-language-availability](includes/copilot-geo-and-language-availability.md)]

## Prerequisites

- Your administrator must activate the **Create product information** capability on the **Copilot & agent capabilities** page. [Learn more about how to configure Copilot and agent capabilities](enable-ai.md).
- You're familiar with creating and managing product (item) information.

## Suggest item substitutions on item substitution entries

This process describes how to get Copilot to suggest substitute items.

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, and then select the related link.
2. Select the item you want Copilot to find substitutes for.
3. Choose the **Substitutions** action.
4. On the **Item Substitution Entry** page, choose **Suggest with Copilot**.
5. Review the suggestions. To learn more, go to [Review, save, discard, or regenerate suggestions](#review-save-discard-or-regenerate-suggestions).

## Adjust the search

By default, the capability uses the item description as search criteria, which you can adjust if you want to fine-tune the search results. To edit the prompt, select the :::image type="content" source="media/edit-pencil.png" alt-text="Edit the prompt."::: icon in the Copilot window. For example, you can add more details to the prompt such as colors, sizes, or other item attributes.

## Review, save, discard, or regenerate suggestions

After Copilot suggests the items to add, review the suggestions and decide whether they're what you want:

- To discard a single proposed line, select it in the list, and then choose the **Delete Line** action.
- To discard all proposed lines and close the Copilot window, choose **Discard** (trash can).
- To transfer the lines shown in the Copilot window, choose **Insert all**. This step confirms that you want to transfer the lines to the **Item Substitution Entry** page. You can delete or edit the transferred lines there as well. The **Score** field that displays **High (85+)**, **Medium (83-85)**, and **Low (79-83)** scores and points you to lines that need attention.

# Scheduling a Synchronization between Business Central and Dataverse

You can synchronize [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] on scheduled intervals by setting up jobs in the job queue. The synchronization jobs synchronize data in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] records and [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] records that are coupled. For records that are not already coupled, depending on the synchronization direction and rules, the synchronization jobs can create and couple new records in the destination system.

There are several synchronization jobs that are available out-of-the-box. The jobs are run in the following order to avoid coupling dependencies between tables. For more information, see [Use Job Queues to Schedule Tasks](admin-job-queues-schedule-tasks.md).

1. CURRENCY - Common Data Service synchronization job.
2. VENDOR - Common Data Service synchronization job.
3. CONTACT - Common Data Service synchronization job.
4. CUSTOMER - Common Data Service synchronization job.
5. SALESPEOPLE - Common Data Service synchronization job.

You can view the jobs on the **Job Queue Entries** page. For more information, see [Use Job Queues to Schedule Tasks](admin-job-queues-schedule-tasks.md).

## Default synchronization job queue entries

The following table describes the default synchronization jobs for [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)].  

| Job Queue Entry | Description | Direction | Integration Table Mapping | Default Synchronization Frequency (mins) | Default inactivity sleep time (mins) |
|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|
| CONTACT - Common Data Service synchronization job | Synchronizes [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] contacts with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] contacts. | Bidirectional | CONTACT | 30 | 720 <br>(12 hours) |
| CURRENCY - Common Data Service synchronization job | Synchronizes [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] transaction currencies with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] currencies. | From [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] | CURRENCY | 30 | 720 <br> (12 hrs) |
| CUSTOMER - Common Data Service synchronization job | Synchronizes [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] accounts with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] customers. | Bidirectional | CUSTOMER | 30 | 720<br> (12 hrs) |
| VENDOR - Common Data Service synchronization job | Synchronizes [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] accounts with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] customers. | Bidirectional | VENDOR | 30 | 720<br> (12 hrs) |
| SALESPEOPLE - Common Data Service synchronization job | Synchronizes [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] salespeople with [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] users. | From [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] | SALESPEOPLE | 30 | 1440<br> (24 hrs) |

## Synchronization process

Each synchronization job queue entry uses a specific integration table mapping that specifies which [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] table and [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] table to synchronize. The table mappings also include some settings that control which records in the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] table and [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] table to synchronize.  

To synchronize data, [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] table records must be coupled to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] records. For example, a [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] customer must be coupled to a [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] account. You can set up couplings manually, before running the synchronization jobs, or let the synchronization jobs set up couplings automatically. The following list describes how data is synchronized between [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] when you are using the synchronization job queue entries. For more information, see [Couple and Synchronize Records Manually](admin-how-to-couple-and-synchronize-records-manually.md).

- The **Sync. Only Coupled Records** check box controls whether new records are created when you synchronize. By default, the check box is selected, which means that only records that are coupled will be synchronized. In the integration table mapping, you can change the table mapping between a [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] table and a [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] table so that the integration synchronization jobs will create new records in the destination database for each row in the source database that is not coupled. For more information, see [Creating New Records](admin-how-to-modify-table-mappings-for-synchronization.md#create-new-records).

    **Example**
    If you clear the **Sync. Only Coupled Records** check box, when you synchronize customers in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with accounts in [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)], a new account is created for each customer in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and automatically coupled. Additionally, because the synchronization is bidirectional in this case, a new customer is created and coupled for each [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] account that is not already coupled.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > There are rules and filters that determine what data is synchronized. For more information, go to [Synchronization Rules](admin-synchronizing-business-central-and-sales.md).

- When new records are created in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the records use the either the template that is defined for the integration table mapping or the default template that is available for the row type. Fields are populated with data from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] or [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] depending on the synchronization direction. For more information, see [Modify Table Mappings for Synchronization](admin-how-to-modify-table-mappings-for-synchronization.md).  

- With subsequent synchronizations, only records that have been modified or added after the last successful synchronization job for the table will be updated.  

     New records in [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] are added in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. If data in fields in [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] records has changed, the data is copied to the corresponding field in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

- With bidirectional synchronization, the job synchronizes from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)], and then from [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## About inactivity timeouts

Some job queue entries, such as those that schedule synchronization between [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)], use the **Inactivity Timeout** field on the **Job Queue Entry** page to prevent the job queue entry from running unnecessarily.  

:::image type="content" source="media/on-hold-with-inactivity-timeout.png" alt-text="Flowchart for when job queue entries are put on hold due to inactivity.":::

When the value in this field is not zero, and the job queue did not find any changes during the last run, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] puts the job queue entry on hold. When that happens, the **Status of Job Queue** field will show **On Hold Due to Inactivity**, and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will wait for the period of time specified in **Inactivity Timeout** field before it runs the job queue entry again.  

For example, by default, the CURRENCY job queue entry, which synchronizes currencies in [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] with exchange rates in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], will look for changes to exchange rates every 30 minutes. If no changes are found, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] puts the CURRENCY job queue entry on hold for 720 minutes (twelve hours). If an exchange rate is changed in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] while the job queue entry is on hold, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will automatically reactivate the job queue entry and restart the job queue. 

> [!Note]
> [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will automatically activate job queue entries that are on hold only when changes happen in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Changes in [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] will not activate job queue entries.

## To view the synchronization job log

# Set up information for contacts

When you create contacts you can enter information about them, such as:

- The industry the contact belongs to.
- Your business relationship with them.

Before you create contacts and record details about your business relationships, you must set up some of the information that you assign to them. For example:

- Mailing groups
- Industry groups
- Business relations
- Web sources
- Organizational levels
- Job responsibilities

You can set up this information on their pages, or from the Contact Card page by choosing the **New** action in the drop-down menu for the fields.  

This information helps you organize your contacts so they're easier to find when you want to communicate with them. For example, you can find all contacts based on a certain group.

## To assign industry groups to a contact

Industry groups indicate the type of industry that your contacts are in. For example, the retail industry or the automobile industry.

> [!NOTE]
> You can only assign industry groups to contacts of type **Company**.

The industry group code defines the type or category of the group, such as ADVERT for advertising, or PRESS, for TV and radio. You can have several industry group codes. Define industry groups on the **Industry Groups** page.

1. Open the relevant contact card.
2. Choose the **Company** action, and then the **Industry Groups** action. The **Contact Industry Groups** page opens.
3. In the **Industry Groups Code** field, select the industry groups you want to assign.

Repeat these steps to assign as many industry groups as you want. You can also assign industry groups from the contact list by following the same procedure.

<!--The number of industry groups that you assigned to the contact displays in the **No. of Industry Groups** field in the **Segmentation** section on the **Contact Card** page. -->

After you assign industry groups to your contacts, you can use this information to select contacts for your segments. To learn more, go to [Add Contacts to Segments](marketing-add-contact-segment.md).

## Assign mailing groups to a contact

You can use mailing groups to identify groups of contacts that you want to send the same information to. For example, you can set up a mailing group for the contacts that you want to notify about an office move, or a group for sending holiday gifts.

The mailing group code defines the type or category of the group, such as MOVE for office move, or GIFT for holiday gift. You can have several mailing group codes. Define mailing groups on the **Mailing Groups** page.

1. Open the relevant contact card.
2. Choose the **Mailing Groups** action. The **Contact Mailing Groups** page opens.
3. In the **Mailing Groups Code** field, select the mailing group that you want to assign.

Repeat these steps to assign as many mailing groups as you want. You can also assign mailing groups from the contact list.

<!--The number of mailing groups you have assigned to the contact is displayed in the **No. of Mailing Groups** field in the **Segmentation** section on the **Contact Card** page.-->

After you assign mailing groups to your contacts, you can use the information to select contacts for your segments. To learn more, go to [Add Contacts to Segments](marketing-add-contact-segment.md).

## Define an alternate address for a contact

You can assign an alternate address where your contact sometimes wants to receive mail and information. For example, their vacation home. You can also assign date ranges that specify when to use each alternate address.

1. Open the relevant contact card.
2. Choose the **Card** action.

    To define that the alternate address applies in a specific period, choose the **Date Range** action instead.
3. On the **Contact Alt. Address List** page, enter a new alternate address and fill in the fields on the **Contact Alternative Address** page.

Repeat these steps to assign as many alternate addresses as you want. You can specify one or more date ranges for each alternate address.

## Assign job responsibilities to a contact

You can add information about the job responsibilities of contact persons to indicate what the contact person is responsible for. For example, IT, management, or production.

> [!NOTE]
> You can only specify job responsibilities for contacts of the type **Person**.

The job responsibility code defines the type or category of the job, such a MARKETING or PURCHASE. You can have several job responsibility codes. Define job responsibilities on the **Job Responsibilities** page.

1. Open the relevant contact card.
2. Choose the **Job Responsibilities** action. The **Contact Job Responsibilities** page opens.
3. In the **Job Responsibility Code** field, select the job responsibility.

Repeat these steps to assign as many job responsibilities as you want. You can also assign job responsibilities from the contact list.

<!--The number of job responsibilities you have assigned to the contact is displayed in the **No. of Job Responsibilities** field in the **Segmentation** section on the **Contact** page. -->

After you assign job responsibilities to your contacts, you can use this information to select contacts for your segments. To learn more, go to [Add Contacts to Segments](marketing-add-contact-segment.md).

## Assign organizational levels to a contact

You can use organizational levels on your contacts to specify where they are in their company. For example, top management.

> [!NOTE]
> You can only assign organizational levels to contacts of the type **Person**.

The organizational level code defines the type or category of the organizational level, such a CEO or CFO. You can have several organizational level codes. Define organizational levels on the **Organizational Levels** page.

1. Open the relevant contact card.
2. In the **Organizational Levels** field, select the code you want to assign.

After you assign organizational levels to your contacts, you can use this information to create segments.

After you assign job responsibilities to your contacts, you can use this information to select contacts for your segments. To learn more, go to [Add Contacts to Segments](marketing-add-contact-segment.md).

## Assign web sources to a contact

You can use web sources with your contact companies to identify, for example, web sites that you want to use to search for information about the contacts. When assigning web sources, you specify which search engine and search word to use to find the requested information.

> [!NOTE]
> You can only assign web sources to contacts of the type **Company**.

1. Open the relevant contact card.
2. Choose the **Web Sources** action. The **Contact Web Sources** page opens.

2. Choose the **Business Relations** action.
3. On the **Contact Business Relations** page, in the **Business Relation Code** field, select the business relation you want to assign.

Repeat these steps to assign as many business relations as you want.

<!--The number of business relations you have assigned to the contact is displayed in the **No. of Business Relations** field in the **Segmentation** section on the **Contact** page. -->

After you assign business relations to your contacts, you can use this information to select contacts for your segments. To learn more, go to [Add Contacts to Segments](marketing-add-contact-segment.md).

## Copy information from contact companies to contact persons

Some information about contact companies is the same for their contact persons. For example, the address details. On the **Inheritance** FastTab on the **Marketing Setup** page, you can specify which fields on the contact card for a company is copied to the contact card for a person each time you create a contact person for the contact company.

When you change the value in one of these fields on the contact company card, the same fields on the contact person card update. The exception is if you manually changed the field on the contact person card.

To learn more, go to [Create Contacts](marketing-create-contact-companies.md).

## Use predefined default settings on new contacts

You can use the **Defaults** FastTab on the **Marketing Setup** page to specify default values that [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically assigns to new contacts.

> [!NOTE]
> You can also enter a default sales cycle code that application automatically assigns to each new opportunity you create.

The settings for inheritance overwrite the default values you set up. For example, if you have set up English as the default language, but the contact company's language is German, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] assigns German as the language code for the contact persons for that company.

## Synchronize contacts with customers, vendors, and bank accounts

To synchronize the contact card with a linked customer, vendor, or bank account, fill in the relevant field in the **Bus. Relation Code for** section on the **Interactions** FastTab on the **Marketing Setup** page.  

To learn more, go to [Synchronizing contacts with customers, vendors, and bank accounts](marketing-create-contact-companies.md#synchronizing-contacts-with-customers-vendors-employees-and-bank-accounts).

## Search for duplicate contacts

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can automatically search for duplicates each time you create a contact. Or, you can search manually after you create a contact. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can update the search strings automatically each time you change a contact's information or create a contact. You can specify the **Search Hit %**, that is, the percentage of identical strings that two contacts must have to consider them as duplicates. You enter the percentage on the **Duplicates** FastTab on the **Marketing Setup** page.

When you find a duplicate contact, you can use the **Merge Duplicate** page to merge it with a contact record that you want to keep. To learn more, go to [Merge Duplicate Records](sales-how-merge-duplicate-records.md).

# General Ledger Entries (Power BI report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **General Ledger Entries** report provides a detailed view of individual entries from the general ledger, so you can quickly filter and locate specific entries. This report is a valuable tool for tracking financial transactions, reconciliation, and facilitating efficient audits by giving easy access to detailed entry information.

:::image type="content" source="media/finance/general-ledger-entries-report.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the General Ledger Entries report" lightbox="media/finance/general-ledger-entries-report.png":::

## Use the report

The audiences for the report are:

- Finance managers
- Finance staff

Finance managers use the report to reconcile transactions for a specific fiscal period. By filtering the report to display only entries from that period, you can systematically review all recorded transactions. This process helps you find discrepancies, such as missing entries or erroneous amounts, and ensure that the general ledger accurately reflects the company's activities. Once reconciled, you can confidently prepare financial statements and provide insights into the organization's financial health for that period.

# Set Up Service Contracts
Before you can work with contracts, you must set up the following: 

* **Service contract groups**, which gather service contracts that are related in some way.
* **Service contract account groups**, which are used to group the service contract accounts together for service invoices created for service contracts. You assign these groups to service contracts.  
* **Contract templates** that define contract layouts of contracts that include the most commonly used service contract details. When you create service contract quotes, you can create them by using templates. When you create a contract quote, the fields automatically contain the contents of the template fields.
* **Customer templates** that let you create quotes for contacts or potential customers who are not registered as customers in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

## To set up a service contract group  
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Contract Groups**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
3. Choose the **Disc. on Contr. Orders Only** check box if you want contract or service discounts to be valid only for contract service orders, such as maintenance.

# Design details: average cost

The average cost of an item is calculated with a periodic weighted average. The average is based on the average cost period you have specified in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

The valuation date is set automatically.  

## Setting up average cost calculation

The following table describes the two fields on the **Inventory Setup** page that must be filled to enable average cost calculation.  

|Field|Description|  
|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
|**Average Cost Period**|Specifies which period the average cost is calculated in. The following options exist:<br /><br /> - **Day**<br />- **Week**<br />- **Month**<br />- **Accounting Period**<br /><br /> Inventory decreases that are posted in the average cost period get the average cost calculated for that period.|  
|**Average Cost Calc. Type**|Specifies how the average cost is calculated. The following options exist:<br /><br /> - **Item**<br />- **Item, Variant, and Location**<br /> With this option, the average cost is calculated for each item, for each location, and for each variant of the item. The average cost of this item depends on where you store it and the variant you select, such as color.|  

> [!NOTE]  
> You can only use one average cost period and one average cost calculation type in a fiscal year.  
>
> The **Accounting Periods** page shows which average cost period and which average cost calculation type is in effect during that period, for each accounting period.  

## Calculating average cost

 When you post a transaction for an item that uses the Average costing method, an entry is created in the **Avg. Cost Adjmt. Entry Point** table. This entry contains the transaction’s item number, variant code, and location code. The entry also contains the **Valuation Date** field, which specifies the last date of the average cost period in which the transaction was posted.  

> [!NOTE]  
> This field should not be confused with the **Valuation Date** field in the **Value Entry** table, which shows the date when the value takes effect and is used to determine the average cost period in which the value entry belongs.  

 The average cost of a transaction is calculated when the item’s cost is adjusted. For more information, see [Design Details: Cost Adjustment](design-details-cost-adjustment.md). A cost adjustment uses the entries in the **Avg. Cost Adjmt. Entry Point** table to identify which items (or items, locations, and variants) to calculate average costs for. For each entry with a cost that hasn't been adjusted, the cost adjustment uses the following to determine the average cost:  

- Determines the cost of the item at the start of the average cost period.  
- Adds the sum of the inbound costs that were posted during the average cost period. These include purchases, sales returns, positive adjustments, and production and assembly outputs.  
- Subtracts the sum of the costs of any outbound transactions that were fixed-applied to receipts in the average cost period. These typically include purchase returns and negative outputs.  
- Divides by the total inventory quantity for the end of the average cost period. Excludes inventory decreases that are being valued.  

 The calculated average cost is then applied to the inventory decreases for the item (or item, location, and variant) with posting dates in the average cost period. For inventory increases that are fixed-applied to inventory decreases in the average cost period, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] forwards the calculated average cost from the increase to the decrease.  

### Example: average cost period = day

The following example shows the effect of calculating average cost based on an average cost period of one day. The **Average Cost Calc. Type** field on the **Inventory Setup** page is set to **Item**.  

The following table shows item ledger entries for the sample average-cost item, ITEM1, before you run the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job.  

| **Posting Date** | **Item Ledger Entry Type** | **Quantity** | **Cost Amount (Actual)** | **Entry No.** |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| 01-01-23 |   Purchase | 1 | 20.00 | 1 |
| 01-01-23 |   Purchase | 1 | 40.00 | 2 |
| 01-01-23 |   Sale | -1 | -20.00 | 3 |
| 02-01-23 |   Sale | -1 | -40.00 | 4 |
| 02-02-23 |   Purchase | 1 | 100.00 | 5 |
| 02-03-23 |   Sale | -1 | -100.00 | 6 |

> [!NOTE]  
> Because cost adjustment has not yet occurred, the values in the **Cost Amount (Actual)** field of the inventory decreases corresponding to the inventory increases that they are applied to.  

 The following table shows the entries in the **Avg. Cost Adjmt. Entry Point** table that apply to the value entries that result from the item ledger entries in the preceding table.  

| **Item No.** | **Variant Code** | **Location Code** | **Valuation Date** | **Cost is Adjusted** |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| ITEM1 |  | BLUE | 01-01-23 |   No |
| ITEM1 |  | BLUE | 02-01-23 |   No |
| ITEM1 |  | BLUE | 02-02-23 |   No |
| ITEM1 |  | BLUE | 02-03-23 |   No |

 The following table shows the same item ledger entries after you run the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job. The average cost per day is calculated and applied to the inventory decreases.  

| **Posting Date** | **Item Ledger Entry Type** | **Quantity** | **Cost Amount (Actual)** | **Entry No.** |
|--|--|--|--|--|--|
| 01-01-23 |   Purchase | 1 | 20.00 | 1 |
| 01-01-23 |   Purchase | 1 | 40.00 | 2 |
| 01-01-23 |   Sale | -1 | -30.00 | 3 |
| 02-01-23 |   Sale | -1 | -30.00 | 4 |
| 02-02-23 |   Purchase | 1 | 100.00 | 5 |
| 02-03-23 |   Sale | -1 | -100.00 | 6 |

### Example: average cost period = month

 This example shows the effect of calculating the average cost based on an average cost period of one month. The **Average Cost Calc. Type** field on the **Inventory Setup** page  is set to **Item**.  

 If the average cost period is one month, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates one entry for each combination of item number, variant code, location code, and valuation date.  

 The following table shows item ledger entries for the sample average-cost item, ITEM1, before you run the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job.  

| **Posting Date** | **Item Ledger Entry Type** | **Quantity** | **Cost Amount (Actual)** | **Entry No.** |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| 01-01-23 |   Purchase | 1 | 20.00 | 1 |
| 01-01-23 |   Purchase | 1 | 40.00 | 2 |
| 01-01-23 |   Sale | -1 | -20.00 | 3 |
| 02-01-23 |   Sale | -1 | -40.00 | 4 |
| 02-02-23 |   Purchase | 1 | 100.00 | 5 |
| 02-03-23 |   Sale | -1 | -100.00 | 6 |

> [!NOTE]  
> Because cost adjustment has not occurred yet, the values in the **Cost Amount (Actual)** field of the inventory decreases corresponding to the inventory increases that they are applied to.  

The following table shows the entries in the **Avg. Cost Adjmt. Entry Point** table that apply to the value entries that result from the item ledger entries in the preceding table.  

| **Item No.** | **Variant Code** | **Location Code** | **Valuation Date** | **Cost is Adjusted** |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| ITEM1 |  | BLUE | 01-31-23 |   No |
| ITEM1 |  | BLUE | 02-28-23 |   No |

> [!NOTE]  
> The valuation date is set to the last day in the average cost period, which in this case is the last day of the month.  

The following table shows the same item ledger entries after you run the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job. The average cost per month is calculated and applied to the inventory decreases.  

|**Posting Date** | **Item Ledger Entry Type** | **Quantity** | **Cost Amount (Actual)** | **Entry No.** |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| 01-01-23 | Purchase | 1 | 20.00 | 1 |
| 01-01-23 | Purchase | 1 | 40.00 | 2 |
| 01-01-23 | Sale | -1 | -30.00 | 3 |
| 02-01-23 | Sale | -1 | -65.00 | 4 |
| 02-02-23 | Purchase | 1 | 100.00 | 5 |
| 02-03-23 | Sale | -1 | -65.00 | 6 |

The average cost of entry number 3 is calculated in the average cost period for January. The average cost for entries 4 and 6 is calculated in the average cost period for February.  

To get the average cost for February, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] adds the average cost of the item received in inventory (100.00) to the average cost at the beginning of the period (30.00). The sum (130.00) is then divided by the total quantity in inventory (2). This calculation gives the resulting average cost of the item in the February period (65.00). The average cost is assigned to the inventory decreases in the period (entries 4 and 6).  

## Setting the valuation date

 The **Valuation Date** field in the **Value Entry** table determines the average cost period in which an inventory decrease entry belongs. This setting also applies to work in process (WIP) inventory.  

 The following table shows the criteria that are used to set the valuation date.  

| Scenario | Posting Date | Valued Quantity | Revaluation | Valuation Date |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| 1 |  | Positive | No | Posting date of item ledger entry |
| 2 | Later than the latest valuation date of applied value entries | Negative | No | Posting date of item ledger entry |
| 3 | Earlier than the latest valuation date of applied value entries | Positive | No | Latest valuation date of the applied value entries |
| 4 |  | Negative | Yes | Posting date of the revaluation value entry |

### Example

The following table of value entries illustrates the different scenarios.  

| Scenario | Posting Date | Item Ledger Entry Type | Valuation Date | Valued Quantity | Cost Amount (Actual) | Item Ledger Entry No. | Entry No. |
|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|
| 1 | 01-01-20 | Purchase | 01-01-20 | 2 | 20.00 | 1 | 1 |
| 2 | 01-15-20 | (Item Charge) | 01-01-20 | 2 | 8.00 | 1 | 2 |
| 3 | 02-01-20 | Sale | 02-01-20 | -1 | -14.00 | 2 | 3 |
| 4 | 03-01-20 | (Revaluation) | 03-01-20 | 1 | -.4.00 | 1 | 4 |
| 5 | 02-01-20 | Sale | 03-01-20 | -1 | -10.00 | 3 | 5 |

> [!NOTE]  
> In entry number 5 in the preceding table, the user has entered a sales order with a posting date (02-01-20) that comes before the latest valuation date of applied value entries (03-01-20). If the corresponding value in the **Cost Amount (Actual)** field for this date (02-01-20) were used for this entry, then it would be 14.00. This would give a situation where the quantity on inventory is zero, but the inventory value is –4.00.  
>
> To avoid such a quantity-value mismatch, the valuation date is set to equal the latest valuation date of the applied value entries (03-01-20). The value in the **Cost Amount (Actual)** field becomes 10.00 (after revaluation), which means that the quantity on inventory is zero, and the inventory value is also zero.  

> [!CAUTION]  
> Because the **Inventory Valuation** report is based on posting date, the report will reflect any quantity-value mismatches in scenarios as in the above example. For more information, see [Design Details: Inventory Valuation](design-details-inventory-valuation.md).  

If the quantity on inventory is less than zero after you post the inventory decrease, the valuation date is set to the posting date of the inventory decrease. You can change this date when the inventory increase is applied, according to the rules described in the note earlier in this section.  

## Recalculating average cost

Valuing inventory decreases as a weighted average would be straightforward in several scenarios:

- Purchases are always invoiced before sales.
- Postings are never backdated.
- You never made mistakes.

However, the reality is different.  

As the examples in this article illustrate, the valuation date is defined as the date from which the value entry is included in the average cost calculation. This setting lets you do several things for items with the Average costing method:  

- Invoice the sale of an item before you invoice its purchase.  
- Backdate a posting.  
- Recover an incorrect posting.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Another reason for this flexibility is fixed application. For more information about fixed application, see [Design Details: Item Application](design-details-item-application.md).  

Because of this flexibility, you might have to recalculate the average cost after posting. For example, if you post an inventory increase or decrease with a valuation date that's before an inventory decrease. The recalculation of the average cost occurs automatically when you run the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job, manually or automatically.  

You can change the inventory valuation base within an accounting period by changing the values in the **Average Cost Period** and **Average Cost Calc. Type** fields. However, we recommend that you use caution and consult your auditor.  

### Example of recalculated average cost

This example shows how [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] recalculates the average cost when you post on a date that's before an inventory decrease. The example is based on an average cost period of **Day**.  

The following table shows the value entries that exist for the item before the posting is introduced.  

| Valuation Date | Quantity | Cost Amount (Actual) | Entry No. |
|--|--|--|--|
| 01-01-20 | 1 | 10.00 | 1 |
| 01-02-20 | 1 | 20.00 | 2 |
| 02-15-20 | -1 | -15.00 | 3 |
| 02-16-20 | -1 | -15.00 | 4 |

The user posts an inventory increase (entry number 5) with a valuation date (01-03-20) that's before an inventory decrease. To balance the inventory, the average cost must be recalculated and adjusted to 17.00.  

The following table shows the value entries that exist for the item after entry number 5 is introduced.  

| Valuation Date | Quantity | Cost Amount (Actual) | Entry No. |
|--|--|--|--|
| 01-01-20 | 1 | 10.00 | 1 |
| 01-02-20 | 1 | 20.00 | 2 |
| 01-03-20 | 1 | 21.00 | 5 |
| 02-15-20 | -1 | -17.00 | 3 |
| 02-16-20 | -1 | -17.00 | 4 |

# Edit Posted Documents

Sometimes you have to update a posted document because information that is relevant to the document has changed. On a posted sales document, this can be the shipping agent's package tracking number, for example. On a posted purchase document, this can be a payment reference text.

You perform the change on an editable version of the original document, indicated by "**- Update**" in the page title. The page contains a subset of the fields on the original document, of which some are non-editable fields that are shown for information only.

The functionality is available for the following documents across all supported markets:

- Posted Sales Shipment
- Posted Purchase Invoice
- Posted Return Shipment
- Posted Return Receipt

The following additional documents can be edited in the specified countries or regions:

- ES: Posted Sales Invoice, Posted Sales Credit Memo, Posted Purchase Credit Memo
- APAC: Posted Sales Credit Memo, Posted Purchase Credit Memo
- RU: Posted Sales Credit Memo
- IT: Posted Transfer Shipment, Posted Service Shipment

## To edit a posted sales shipment

The following explains how to edit a posted sales shipment. The steps are similar for the other supported documents.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Posted Sales Shipments**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the document that you want to edit, and then choose the **Update Document** action. Alternatively, open the document and then choose the action.
3. On the **Posted Sales Shipment - Update** page, edit the **Package Tracking No.** field, for example.
4. Choose the **OK** button.

The posted sales shipment is updated.

# Put Items Away with Inventory Put-aways

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you receive items and put them away using one of four methods, as described in the following table.

|Method|Inbound Process|Require Receipts|Require Put-aways|Complexity Level (Learn more at [Warehouse Management Overview](design-details-warehouse-management.md))|  
|------------|---------------------|--------------|----------------|------------|  
|A|Post receipt and put-away from the order line|||No dedicated warehouse activity.|  
|B|Post receipt and put-away from an inventory put-away document||Turned on|Basic: Order-by-order.|  
|C|Post receipt and put-away from a warehouse receipt document|Turned on||Basic: Consolidated receive/ship posting for multiple orders.|  
|D|Post receipt from a warehouse receipt document and post put-away from a warehouse put-away document|Turned on|Turned on|Advanced|  

Learn more at [Inbound Warehouse Flow](design-details-inbound-warehouse-flow.md).

This article refers to method B in the table.

When your location is set up to require put-away processing but not receive processing, use an **Inventory Put-away** document to record and post put-away and receipt information for your source documents. Inbound source documents can be purchase orders, sales return orders, and inbound transfer orders.

> [!NOTE]
> Production and assembly output also represent inbound source documents. Learn more about handling production and assembly output for internal processes at [Design Details: Internal Warehouse Flows](design-details-internal-warehouse-flows.md).

You can create an inventory put-away in three ways:  

* Create the inventory put-away directly from the source document itself.  
* Create inventory put-aways for several source documents at the same time by using a batch job.  
* Create the put-away in two steps by first by releasing the source document to make the items available to be put away. You can create the inventory put-away based on the source document by using the **Inventory Put-away** page.  

## To create an inventory put-away from the source document

1. In the source document, which can be a purchase order, sales return order, or inbound transfer order, choose the **Create Inventory Put-away/Pick** action.  
2. Select the **Create Invt. Put-away** checkbox.
3. Choose the **OK** button. A new inventory put-away is created.

## To create multiple inventory put-aways with a batch job

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Create Inventory Put-away/Pick/Movement**, and then choose the related link. 
2. On the **Warehouse Request** FastTab, use the **Source Document** and **Source No.** fields to filter on certain types of documents or ranges of document numbers. For example, you can create put-aways for purchase orders only.
3. On the **Options** FastTab, select the **Create Invt. Put-away** checkbox.
4. Choose the **OK** button. The specified inventory put-aways are created.

## To create the put-away in two steps

### To request an inventory put-away by releasing the source document

When you release purchase orders, sales return orders, and inbound transfer orders, the items on the orders become available to be put away. The following steps describe how to make the items on a purchase order ready to be put away.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Orders**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the purchase order that you want to release, and then choose the **Release** action.  

### To create an inventory put-away based on the source document

A warehouse employee can create a new inventory put-away based on the released source document.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Inventory Put-away**, and then select the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. In the **Source Document** field, select the type of source document you are putting away for.  
4. In the **Source No.** field, select the source document.  
5. Alternatively, choose the **Get Source Document** action to select the document from a list of inbound source documents that are ready for put-away at the location.  
6. Choose the **OK** button to fill the put-away lines according to the selected source document.  

## To record the inventory put-away

1. On the **Inventory Put-aways** page, open a previously created put-away document.  
2. In the **Bin Code** field on the put-away lines, the bins where the items must be put away are suggested based on the items' default bin. You can change the bin if needed.  
3. Perform the put-away, and then enter the actual quantity that was put away in the **Qty. to Handle** field.

    If you must place the items for one line in more than one bin, for example because the designated bin is full, use the **Split Line** action on the **Lines** FastTab. The action creates a line for the remaining quantity to handle.  
4. After you put the items away, choose the **Post** action.  

    * Post the receipt of the source document lines that have been put away
    * If the location uses bins, posting will also create warehouse entries to post the bin quantity changes.

# Work with recurring revenue in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]

Many companies are moving from a business revenue model where revenue is made from a customer's one-time purchase to a subscription model where revenue is made on a recurring basis in return for consistent access to the delivery of a good or service.
[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] has the following options for automating how you send subscription invoices to your customers and register recurring revenue. 

## Register revenue with a recurring general journal

A recurring journal is a general journal with specific fields for managing transactions that you post frequently with few or no changes, such as rent, subscriptions, electricity, or heat. Using these fields for recurring transactions, you can post both fixed and variable amounts. 
With a recurring journal, entries that are posted regularly need to be typed in only once. That is, the accounts, dimensions and dimension values, and so on, that you enter will remain in the journal after posting. If any adjustments are necessary, you can make them with each posting.

### Why use this option

With this option, you define flexible invoicing periods with [Date Formulas](ui-enter-date-ranges.md#use-date-formulas).

However, with this option, you can't print and send invoices in the default version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

For more information, see [Work with Recurring Journals](ui-work-general-journals.md#work-with-recurring-journals).  

## Create multiple invoices based on a recurring project journal

The recurring job journal is a more advanced alternative to the general journal. You define Items, Resources, and G/L Accounts that must be repeated for each job and you specify the frequency of recurrence.  

After posting a recurring project journal, you can create multiple invoices with the **Create Job Sales Invoice** task. You can review and post created invoices in the **Sales Invoices** page.

### Why use this option

With this option, you follow the standard invoicing procedure with all the benefits of that, including standard and customer layouts for communication preferences. You can also define prices for each project individually.

However, for each new customer, you must create a new project and add lines to the recurring journal. 

For more information, see [Create project journal lines](projects-how-record-job-usage.md#to-create-project-journal-lines-manually) and [Create multiple project sales invoices](projects-how-invoice-jobs.md#to-create-multiple-project-sales-invoices).

## Create multiple invoices based on recurring sales lines

If you often need to create sales and purchase lines with similar information, you can set up recurring sales lines that you can then insert on recurring sales and purchase documents, for example, for recurring replenishment orders. Use the **Create Recurring Sales Invoices** batch job to create sales invoices according to recurring sales lines that are assigned to the customers and with posting dates within the valid-from and valid-to dates that you specify on the recurring sales lines.  

### Why use this option

With this option, you can assign the same recurring lines to multiple customers. You can define period of validity for the recurring sales lines for specific customer. You can assign multiple recurring lines to the same customer and all of them will be included in the invoice.

However, there's no way to set fixed prices for items because [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will use the actual prices and discount valid on document date, trying to find best combination that gives the lowest price.  

For more information, see [Create Recurring Sales and Purchase Lines](sales-how-work-standard-lines.md).

## Recurring invoices with service contract

A service contract contains the service contract agreements between your customers and your company. A service contract includes service level agreements and the service items that you service as a part of the contract.  

You can define the starting date of the contract, the invoice period, whether or not the contract is prepaid, price update specifications if you plan to change prices while contract is active. You can use both service items or items in service contract lines.
You can create contract templates to define how to create certain types of contracts.  

### Why use this option

With this option, you use a part of the advanced service management functionality that not limited to issuing of recurring invoices but support repair shop and field service operations.

However, this option requires the Premium license. Setting up service management and maintaining it might not give huge advantages in simpler subscription scenarios.  

For more information, see [Work with Service Contracts and Service Contract Quotes](service-how-to-create-service-contracts-and-service-contract-quotes.md) and [Invoice several service contracts](service-how-create-invoices.md#to-invoice-several-service-contracts).

## Related features
There are several related capabilities in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

### Blanket sales orders

A blanket sales order represents a framework for a long-term agreement between your company and your customer.
A blanket order is typically made when a customer has committed to purchasing large quantities that are to be delivered in several smaller shipments over a certain period of time. Often blanket orders cover only one item with predetermined delivery dates. The main reason for using a blanket order rather than a sales order is that quantities entered on a blanket order don't affect item availability, however it can be used for planning purposes.

#### Why use this option

With this option, you use the anticipated demand, so the information is considered during the normal planning routines. For more information, see [Demand Forecasts and Blanket Orders](design-details-central-concepts-of-the-planning-system.md#demand-forecasts-and-blanket-orders).  

However, the default version doesn't offer an out-of-the-box possibility to process multiple blanket orders in bulk.

For more information, see [Work with Blanket Sales Orders](sales-how-to-create-blanket-sales-orders.md).

### Recurring Orders (Norway)

You can use recurring orders to create blanket order templates so that sales orders can be created based on date intervals that you define. For example, if you deliver the same sales order every two weeks, you can use a blanket sales order and create recurring orders.
You can use recurring groups to define a range of parameters that show how you make the orders. These groups are assigned to blanket orders that have to be created regularly. To create the recurring orders, you'll have to periodically run the create recurring orders process. 

#### Why use this option

With this option, you can choose between fixed and "best" prices.

However, this is only available in Norway. Validity period can be defined on the recurring group level.

For more information, see [Recurring Orders](LocalFunctionality/Norway/recurring-orders.md).

### Recurring revenue and subscription billing by other providers

At [AppSource.microsoft.com](https://appsource.microsoft.com/), you can get extensions for Business Central. Some extensions are provided by Microsoft, and other extensions are provided by other companies. The list of the extensions by other companies grows each month. So keep an eye out for [AppSource.microsoft.com](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2081646) and get apps to help you in your work in Business Central.

# Prod. Order Routing Gantt (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2025w1](includes/applies-to-2025w1.md)]

The **Prod. Order Routings Gantt** report provides an overview of production processes, combining visual and tabular formats to enhance understanding. The report helps you monitor and analyze production tasks, offering insights into scheduling, durations, and task locations.

:::image type="content" source="media/manufacturing/prod-order-routing-gantt-v26.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Prod Order Routing Gantt Power BI Report" lightbox="media/manufacturing/prod-order-routing-gantt-v26.png":::

The **Production Time Line (Gantt Chart Visual)** visualization provides a Gantt chart representation of production processes, enabling you to effectively monitor and analyze tasks within production orders. Key features of this visualization include:

1. **Hierarchy:**  
   - *Parent:* Production orders serve as the primary grouping level.  
   - *Nested Tasks:* Routing line descriptions represent individual tasks in the process.  

2. **Timeline Configuration:**  
   - By default, the timeline displays at a daily level.  
   - Non-working days are highlighted in red for improved clarity.  

3. **Task Duration:**  
   - Task durations calculate based on the routing line's starting and ending date-time values.  

4. **Task Bar Representation:**  
   - The color of the task bars differentiates between routing through machine centers and work centers.  
   - Within each bar, the name of the machine center or work center displays, providing added context about where the task is done.  

The **Routing Line Details** table is a tabular representation of production and routing data. It includes essential information such as the **Production Order No.** and the **Operations No.** which specifies individual operations within the process. The table also highlights the **Work Center/Machine Center No.**, identifying the location associated with each routing line task. Additionally, the table displays the **Starting Date Time** and **Ending Date Time**, outlining the scheduled start and completion times for tasks. The date times are used to calculate the **Total Duration Hours**, showing the time taken to execute tasks in hours, and the **Duration Total Days**, which represents the task duration in days for an alternative perspective. Together, these details ensure you have a clear and structured view of production processes.

## Use the report

Manufacturing Managers use the report to gain an overview of production scheduling and routing processes. The **Production Time Line** Gantt chart helps you monitor task durations and sequencing. The bar colors and contextual information on machine centers or work centers allow you to quickly identify resource usage and task assignments. Paired with the **Routing Line Details** table, you can analyze production timelines, evaluate task completion dates, and compare actual durations with planned expectations. These details help you detect delays, optimize schedules, and ensure you allocate resources effectively across work centers and machine centers.  

Production supervisors rely on the report to manage day-to-day production tasks and maintain operational efficiency. The Gantt chart shows production order tasks so that you can easily track which operations are occurring at what locations and for how long. The red-marked non-working days help you identify gaps or conflicts in scheduling and address potential bottlenecks. Meanwhile, the **Routing Line Details** table provides starting and ending date times with total task durations by day and by hours. Together, the Gantt visual and tabular components of the report support effective coordination for smooth production workflows.  

## Key performance indicators (KPIs)

The Prod. Order Routing Gantt report includes the following KPIs and measures:

- [Total Duration Hours](manufacturing-powerbi-kpis.md#total-duration-hours)
- [Total Duration Days](manufacturing-powerbi-kpis.md#total-duration-days)

[!INCLUDE[click-on-a-kpi-link](includes/click-on-a-kpi-link.md)]

[!INCLUDE[powerbi-tip-track-kpis](includes/powerbi-tip-track-kpis.md)]

## Data used in the report

The report uses data from the following tables in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]:

- Prod. Order Routing Line
- Production Order

# Close accounting periods

When a fiscal year is over, you must close the periods that comprise it.

## To close accounting periods

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Accounting Periods**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Accounting Periods** page, choose the **Close Year** action.

    If more than one fiscal year is open, the earliest one is automatically selected to be closed. A message identifies the year that will close and the results of its closing.
3. To close the year, choose the **Yes** button.

The fiscal year is closed, and the **Closed** and **Date Locked** fields for all the periods in the year are selected. The fiscal year can't be opened again and you can't remove the check mark from the **Closed** or **Date Locked** fields.

> [!NOTE]  
> You can't close a fiscal year before you create a new one. Notice that after a fiscal year is closed, you can't change the starting date of the following fiscal year.

Although a fiscal year is closed, you can still post general ledger entries to it. When you do, the entries are marked as posted to a closed fiscal year and the **Prior-Year Entry** field is selected.

After a fiscal year is closed, you must close the income statement accounts and transfer the year's results to an account in the balance sheet. You can repeat this every time that you post to the closed fiscal year.

# Business Process Walkthroughs

This selection of walkthroughs provides step-by-step, end-to-end business processes that you can perform using the CRONUS demonstration company. The walkthroughs consist of multiple procedures, some of which would normally be performed by one user, while others incorporate several different user roles. In order to simulate the working environment, some of the walkthroughs contain setup steps necessary to complete the exercises as described. These steps can provide insight into the kind of information users need to share with their company's IT professionals.  

 The walkthroughs are complete scenarios, and should be performed from beginning to end for the greatest benefit. Many are based on [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] demonstrations, and enable you to try those procedures yourself, at your own pace.  

> [!NOTE]
> Some of the walkthroughs require sample data that is not available in the default demonstration company in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. <!--For more information, see [Sandbox Environments](admin-sandbox-environments.md). -->

# Personalize your workspace

You can personalize your workspace to suit your work and preferences. Change pages so that they display only the information you need, where you need it. Personalization affects only your workspace. It doesn't change how others work. You can personalize all types of pages, including the [role center](ui-change-basic-settings.md#role-center) page.

The adjustments outlined in this article are applied universally across all your devices and browsers. There are other modifications, not detailed here, that only affect the specific device and browser on which they're made. Learn more about the differences in [Where is personalization stored?](ui-personalization-stored.md).

## Video and training

The following video shows some of the ways in which you can personalize your Role Center.

> [!Video https://learn-video.azurefd.net/vod/player?id=d76e5d60-ecc2-462b-bba2-18d6deee3534]

For online training, go to [Personalize the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central user interface](/training/modules/personalize-ui-dynamics-365-business-central/).

## About personalization

You can make various adjustments, such as move or hide fields, columns, actions, and entire parts, and add new fields. You do most adjustments by first activating the **Personalizing** banner using the [personalization mode](#start-personalizing-by-using-the-personalization-mode). You can also readily make the following adjustments on any list page without using the personalization mode:

- [Resize a column](#resize-a-column)
- [Create, rename, or edit a view](ui-views.md)
- [Bookmark the page](ui-bookmarks.md)
- [Hide or resize a FactBox](#hide-or-resize-a-factbox)
- Expand/collapse hierarchical list

### Resize a column

There are two ways to change the width of a column in any list, including in dropdown lists for looking up field values:

- Select and drag the boundary between two columns in the header of a list.
- Double-click the boundary between two columns to autofit the width of the column. The width adjusts to the optimal size for readability.

### Hide or resize a FactBox

A FactBox is a pane along the right side of a page that displays more information related to the record on the page.

:::image type="content" source="media/factbox.png" alt-text="Shows the FactBox position in the web client":::

- To hide or show the FactBox, select the ![Shows the collapse or expand FactBox icon in Business Central](media/collapse-expand-factbox.png) **Collapse/Expand the FactBox pane** icon at the top of the FactBox pane.
- To resize the FactBox, drag the vertical divider between the FactBox and main content. Double-click the divider to reset the width to default.

   If you can't resize the FactBox, you're either using Business Central version earlier than 26.0, or **Feature: Optimize screen estate usage for web** isn't turned on in **Feature Management**. Contact your admin, or learn more in [Enabling Upcoming Features Ahead of Time](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/feature-management).

## Start personalizing by using the personalization mode

1. Open any page that you want to personalize.
1. In the upper-right corner, select **Settings** ![Settings.](media/ui-experience/settings_icon_small.png "Settings icon for role center") and then choose the **Personalize** action.

    The **Personalizing** banner appears at the top to indicate that you can start making changes.

    > [!NOTE]
    > To navigate during personalization, use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Click</kbd> on an action if it is highlighted by the arrowhead.

    If you see **Personalize lock** ![Personalize Lock](media/personalization-lock-icon.png "Personalize lock") or **Personalization blocked** ![Personalization blocked](media/personalization-blocked-icon.png "Personalization blocked") on the banner, you can't personalize the page. For more information, see [Why a Page is Locked from Personalization](ui-personalization-locked.md).

1. To change a user interface (UI) element, point to the element, such as an action, a field, or a part. The element is immediately highlighted with an arrowhead or border. Choose the element, and then choose either **Move**, **Remove**, **Hide**, **Show**, **Show under "Show more"**, **Show when collapsed**, **Show always**, **Set/Clear Freeze Pane**, or **Include/Exclude from Quick Entry**, depending on the type and state of the UI element.
1. To add a field, choose the **+ Field** action. From the **Add Field to Page** pane, drag and drop a field into the desired position on the page.
1. When you finish changing the layout of one or more pages, choose **Done** on the **Personalizing** banner.

For more information, see [What You Can Personalize](#What).

|Always start a list as expanded or collapsed.|Choose the **Expand All** or **Collapse All** button in the upper-left corner of the list. Alternatively, choose the **Expand All** or **Collapse All** action in the menu of the first column. |Applies to collapsible hierarchy lists.|

## <a name="Actions"></a>Personalize action bar and menus

Personalization lets you decide which actions to show on the navigation and action bars and on Role Centers, and where to show them. You can show, hide, or move individual actions or action groups.

The following video shows how you can personalize actions on pages and Role Centers.

> [!VIDEO https://learn-video.azurefd.net/vod/player?id=88d1055a-6b3d-4767-bbf7-98a78170e394]

Personalizing the navigation and action bars is done basically the same as with other UI elements. However, what you can do with an action or group depends on where the action or group is located. The best way to find out is to enter personalizing mode and then let the arrowheads guide you.

There are a couple of terms that you should be familiar with to better understand action personalization: *action group* and *promoted category*.  

An *action group* is an element that expands to display other actions or groups. For example, on the **Sales Orders** page, one action group is the **Functions** action that appears when you choose the **Actions** action.

A *promoted category* is an action group that appears before the vertical line `|` on the action bar. The categories typically include the most commonly used actions, so that you can quickly find them. For example, on the **Sales Orders** page, the **Order**, **Release**, and **Posting** actions are promoted categories.

> [!NOTE]  
> To clear personalization, select the arrowhead around the part's designer menu, and then choose **Clear personalization**.

### Remove, hide, and show actions and action groups

When you want to show or hide an action, the options under the arrowhead define what you can do depending on the action's state. 

1. Choose the arrowhead for an action or action group.
2. Choose from one of the following options:

   |Option|What it does|
   |------|------------|
   |**Remove**|This option appears if the selected action is also shown somewhere else on the navigation bar or action bar. Choosing this option deletes the action from the selected location so that it no longer appears. The action or action group remains in the other locations. |
   |**Hide**|This option appears if the action or action group isn't located anywhere else on the navigation bar or action bar. Like **Remove**, choosing this option makes the action or action group disappear from the navigation bar or action bar. However, in personalizing mode, the action, or action group is still shown in the current position, except that it appears dimmed.|
   |**Show**|This option appears if the action or action group is hidden (dimmed). Choosing this option makes the action or action group appear on the navigation bar or action bar.|

### Move actions and action groups

A horizontal line between two actions or a border around an action group indicates where you can drop actions or actions groups. There are the following limitations:

- You can move individual actions into the promoted categories, but you can't rearrange the order of the actions in the category.
- You can't move an action group into a promoted category.

To move an action or action group, drag and drop it into the desired position, like you do with fields and columns.

To move an action or action group into another action group that is empty, drag the action or action group to the new group and drop it in the **Drop an action here** box.

### About the Automate menu

- You can't hide or move the **Automate** menu or the **Power Automate** submenu and its actions.
- You can move flows included under the **Automate** item, but you can't hide them using personalization. Moving the flow makes a copy the flow in the destination, it doesn't remove it from the **Automate** item.

> [!TIP]
> As an administrator, you can hide the **Automation** item from users. Learn more at [Set Up Power Automate Integration](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/powerplatform/power-automate-setup).

## <a name="Parts"></a>Personalize parts

Hover over or select <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Up Arrow</kbd> to get information about a field.

Parts are areas on a page that are typically composed of multiple fields, charts, or other content. A part shows a colored border when you focus on the part. For example, a Role Center home screen has multiple parts. Because of their well-defined boundary, you can personalize the entire part and its contents.

- To move a part, drag and drop it into the desired position. A colored line indicates valid positions on the screen. For example, FactBoxes can only be moved next to other FactBoxes in the FactBox pane.
- You can hide a part by choosing the **Hide** option under the arrowhead.
- When you start personalizing or navigate to a new page, any parts that are currently hidden appear on the page with distinctive visuals to indicate they're hidden. You can unhide that part by choosing the **Show** option under the arrowhead.

You can clear all personalization changes that you made within a single part by choosing the **Clear personalization** option under the part's arrowhead. Clearing personalization of a part only affects changes to the contents of the part. It doesn't affect the placement or visibility of the part on the page.  

## <a name="fields"></a> Work with fields and columns

When personalizing a page, you use the **Add field to page** pane to include fields or columns on the page that are currently hidden from view. To open this pane, select the **+ Field** action near the top of the page. Unlike other hidden elements, hidden fields aren't indicated on the page itself in personalization mode. However, you can identify hidden fields by using the **Add field to page** pane.

Here are some general guidelines to follow when using the **Add field to page** pane:

- By default, the pane lists all hidden fields. To find hidden fields, look for the ![Shows the hidden field icon](media/hidden-icon.png "Shows the hidden field icon") icon.
- You can filter the list to show other fields, for example, those fields currently shown on the page, by selecting the **Recommended fields** button above the list and choosing a filter option. The name of the button changes based on the filter option you choose.
  
   :::image type="content" source="media/personlaization-filter.svg" alt-text="Shows the filter button in the Add a field pane in the personalization mode.":::
- Selecting a field in the list highlights its location on the page. If the field is hidden, its location shows in a shaded state.
- To get more details about a field in the list, hover over it or select <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Up Arrow</kbd> to display a tooltip.
- The fields available in the **Add field to page** pane are determined by the developer of the page and its source table or by a profile admin who [customized the page](ui-personalization-manage.md). You can't create new ones.
- Some pages have multiple page fields that map to the same source table. The pane shows both/all of those page fields independently. Showing/hiding/moving those fields is also independent without one affecting the other.

### Add a field so it's visible on the page

From the **Add field to page** pane, there are two ways to include a hidden field on the page:

- Drag the field to the desired position. A thick horizontal or vertical line indicates the target location.
- Select the field in the list, then go to the shaded field on the page and select the **Show** option.

> [!NOTE]
> Some fields that you add won't be editable on the page when you're done with personalization. These fields are either originally designed this way or an administrator [customized](ui-personalization-manage.md) the page to prevent you from editing them.

## Clear personalization

At some point, you might want to undo some or all of the personalization changes that you made to a page over time.

1. On the **Personalizing** banner, choose the **Clear personalization** action.
2. Choose one of the following options.  

   > [!CAUTION]
   > Clearing personalization can't be undone.

   |Option|What it does|
   |------|------------|
   |**Only Navigation Menu**|Clears any personalization changes that you made to the navigation menu that is shared across the Role Center and other pages. Such changes include any new actions that were added as bookmarks, and any changes to links and groups in the menu.|  
   |**Only Actions**|Clears any personalization changes that you made on the navigation or action bars on the page.|
   |**Only Fields and Columns**|Clears any personalization changes that you made to the page except changes on the navigation or action bars. Such changes include changes to fields, columns, parts, and tiles. |
   |**All**|Clears all personalization changes that you made to the page so it looks like it did originally. Such changes include changes to navigation and action bars, fields, columns, parts, and tiles.|

## Tips and other points of interest

To help you better understand personalization, here are some pointers:

- When you make changes to a card page that you open from a list, the changes take effect on all records that you open from that list. For example, let's say you open a specific customer from the Customers list page, and then personalize the page by adding a field. When you open other customers from the list, the field that you added is also shown.
- Changes that you make affect all your Role Centers. For example, if you make a change to the Customer list when the Role Center is set to Business Manager, you also see the change on the **Customers** page when the Role Center is set to Sales Order Processor.
- Changes to a page in a pane take effect on the page wherever it appears.  
- You can't personalize a page that's in [analysis mode](analysis-mode.md). The **Analyze** switch is deactivated. If you happen to switch to personalization mode while the page is in analysis mode, then analysis mode is automatically switched off.
- Some pages have multiple page fields that map to the same source table. The pane shows both/all of those page fields independently. Showing/hiding/moving those fields is also independent without one affecting the other.
- If a part or group is hidden, ghosted fields still show inside it, but you can't drag-and-drop or add/show that field until you make the group/part visible.

> [!NOTE]
> Due to restrictions on design capabilities in the web client, it's currently not possible to customize or personalize the controls within the `grid` and `fixed` syntax. It applies to all design modes, not just personalization.
>
> Administrators can make the same layout changes as users by customizing a profile (role), which can be assigned to multiple users. To learn more about pages for Roles, go to [Customize Pages for Roles](ui-personalization-manage.md)<br /><br />
Administrators can also override or disable users' personalization, and they can define which features are even available for users to see in all or specific companies. For more information, see [Customize Business Central](ui-customizing-overview.md).

# Sales by Salesperson (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Sales by Salesperson** report provides an overview of sales performance for each salesperson. It showcases key metrics such as total sales amount and quantity. You can also view this information for each customer a salesperson sells to, and the items they sold.

:::image type="content" source="media/powerbi/sales/sales-by-salesperson.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Sales by Salesperson Power BI report" lightbox="media/powerbi/sales/sales-by-salesperson.png":::

## Use the report

This report helps management and sales teams track the sales amounts that each salesperson generates and their contribution to the overall revenue.

Sales managers can use the report to monitor the sales performance of each salesperson and identify top-performers. For example, this information is helpful when you determine rewards. The report also helps identify under-performers who perhaps need support.

For example, you might notice that a particular salesperson's sales declined over the last few months. With this information, you can provide extra training or resources to help that salesperson achieve their sales targets.

Salespeople can use the report to monitor your own sales performance and identify areas for improvement. By analyzing the sales amount, quantity, and gross profit, you can easily identify which customers and items contribute the most to your sales. With this information, you can focus your efforts on the most profitable areas.

For example, if you notice that a particular customer contributes a significant amount to your sales numbers, you can focus on building a stronger relationship with that customer to increase their loyalty.

## Key performance indicators

The report includes the following key performance indicators (KPIs) and measures:

- [**Sales Amount**](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#sales-amount)
- [**Sales Quantity**](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#sales-quantity)

# Dispose of or retire fixed assets

When you sell or otherwise dispose of a fixed asset, you must post the disposal value to calculate and record the gain or loss. A disposal entry must be the last entry posted for a fixed asset. For partially disposed fixed assets, you can post more than one disposal entry. The total of all posted disposal amounts must be a credit amount.  

> [!NOTE]  
> If you trade-in a fixed asset for another one, you must record both the sale of the old asset (disposal) and the purchase of the new one (acquisition). For more information, see [Acquire Fixed Assets](fa-how-acquire.md).  

The following steps assume that your posting groups are set up on the **FA Posting Groups** page. For more information, see [To set up fixed asset posting groups](fa-how-setup-general.md#to-set-up-fixed-asset-posting-groups).  

## To post a disposal from the fixed asset G/L journal

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Fixed Asset G/L Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Create an initial journal line and fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  
3. In the **FA Posting Type** field, select **Disposal**.  
4. Choose the **Insert FA Bal. Account** action. A second journal line is created for the balancing account that is set up for disposal posting.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  Step 4 only works if you have set up the following: On the **FA Posting Group Card** page for the posting group of the fixed asset, the **Disposal Account** field contains the general ledger debit account and the **Disposal Bal. Account** field contains the general ledger account to which you want to post balancing entries for appreciation. For more information, see [To set up fixed asset posting groups](fa-how-setup-general.md#to-set-up-fixed-asset-posting-groups).  
5. Choose the **Post** action.  

If you sell or dispose of part of a fixed asset, you must split up the asset before you can record the disposal transaction. For more information, see [Transfer, Split, or Combine Fixed Assets](fa-how-trans-split-combine.md).  

## To view disposal ledger entries

When you sell or dispose of a fixed asset, the disposal value is posted to the general ledger where you can view the result.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Fixed Assets**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the fixed asset that you want to view entries for, and then choose the **Depreciation Books** action.  
3. Select the depreciation book that you want to view entries for, and then choose the **Ledger Entries** action.  
4. Select a line with **Disposal** in the **FA Posting Category** field, and then choose the **Find Entries** action.  
5. On the **Find Entries** page, select the general ledger entry line, and then choose the **Show Related Entries** action.  

The **General Ledger Entries** page opens where you can see the entries that the disposal posting resulted in.

# Import business data from other finance systems

When you sign up for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can choose to create an empty company so that you can upload your own data and to test your new [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] company. Depending on the finance solution that your business uses today, you can transfer information about customers, vendors, inventory, and bank accounts.  

From the Role Center, you can start an assisted setup guide that helps you transfer the business data from an Excel file or from other formats. The type of files you can upload depends on the extensions that are available. For example, you can migrate data from QuickBooks because [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes an extension that handles the conversion from QuickBooks. If you want to migrate data from other finance solutions, you must either check if an extension is available for that solution or import from Excel.  

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes templates for accounts, customers, vendors, and inventory items that you can choose to apply when you import your data. To import item pictures, you can use a dedicated function on the **Inventory Setup** page. To learn more, go to [Import Multiple Item Pictures](inventory-how-import-item-pictures.md).

> [!TIP]  
> We recommend that you use data migration wizards to import data from Dynamics GP, Dynamics NAV, or QuickBooks. To learn more, go to [Migrate On-Premises Data to Business Central Online](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/migrate-data) in the administration content, or [QuickBooks Data Migration](ui-extensions-quickbooks-data-migration.md).

## Work with Data in Excel

You can use the Excel add-in to prepare existing content for use in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. To learn more, go to [Viewing and Editing in Excel From Business Central](across-work-with-excel.md).  

## Import Data from Configuration Packages

For larger implementation work, you can set up solution-specific configuration packages. To learn more, go to [Set Up Company Configuration Packages](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/set-up-standard-company-configuration-packages) (in English only) in the administration content.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Working with configuration packages is advanced functionality, and we recommend that you contact your reselling partner. To learn more, go to [Set Up Company Configuration Packages](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/set-up-standard-company-configuration-packages) (in English only).

You can import master data and some transactional data from other finance systems based on the default configuration package in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. On the **Configuration Packages** page, you can work with the package to import and validate the data before you apply the package. For example, you can export the configuration package to Excel and set up your data there. Then, you can import the data from Excel again. The package consists of 27 tables, including master data such as customers, vendors, items, and accounts. The package also contains other basic setup tables such as shipping methods, and transactions tables such as sales header and lines.  

When you export the default configuration package to Excel, the generated workbook contains a worksheet for each table in the package. To simplify your tasks, you can take advantage of the XML manipulation tools that are built into Excel. You can also use Excel built-in functions to help with data formatting and to put data in the correct cell. For example, add a blank worksheet and copy the legacy data to it. Then make an Excel formula to map data in the transformation worksheet between the fields in the exported worksheet and customer legacy data. After you map all of the data, copy the range of data onto the table worksheet.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Don't change the columns in the worksheets. If they're moved, changed, or deleted, the worksheet can't be imported into [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

> [!NOTE]
> Fields of type Blob can't be exported/imported using Excel.

### Tables in the Default Configuration Package

The default configuration package supports the following tables:

- Payment Terms
- Customer Price Group
- Shipment Method
- Salesperson/Purchaser
- Location
- GL Account
- Customer
- Vendor
- Item
- Sales Header
- Sales Line
- Purchase Header
- Purchase Line
- Gen. Journal Line
- Item Journal Line
- Customer Posting Group
- Vendor Posting Group
- Inventory Posting Group
- Unit of Measure
- Gen. Business Posting Group
- Gen. Product Posting Group
- General Posting Setup
- Territory
- Item Category
- Sales Price
- Purchase Price

# Set up payment methods

Payment methods define the way you prefer for customers to pay you, and how you like to pay your vendors. The method can vary for each customer or vendor. Examples of typical payment methods are **bank**, **cash**, **check**, or **account**.

You can assign a payment method to customers and vendors so that the same method is always used on the sales and purchase documents you create for them. If needed, you can change the method on the sales or purchase document. For example, if you want to pay a particular purchase invoice in cash rather than by check. The default payment method assigned to the vendor doesn't change.

The same payment methods are used for sales and purchase documents. For example, a _cash_ payment method is used to make payments and to receive them. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] knows that when you're creating a sales invoice you expect to receive payment, and the opposite for purchase invoices.

Credit memos for returns, however, are exceptions because money is flowing in the opposite directions, from you to your customer and from your vendor to you. Therefore, a default payment method isn't assigned to credit memos. There is, however, a workaround. You can specify terms of payment for the customer or vendor. Though the **Calc. Pmt. Disc. on Cr. Memos** field isn't intended for this workaround, if you choose the checkbox on the **Payment Terms** page a default payment method is added when you create a credit memo. <br><br>

## To set up a payment method

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides a few payment methods that businesses often use. You can, however, add as many as you need.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Payment Methods**, and then choose the related link.
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

Optionally, add payment terms to your payment method. For more information, see [Set Up Payment Terms](finance-payment-terms.md).  

## To assign a payment method to a customer or vendor

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customer** or **Vendor**, and then choose the related link.
2. In the **Payment Method Code** field, choose the method to use by default for the customer or vendor.

## Audit changes to payment methods

You can use the Change Log feature to capture changes users make to your payment method setup. [!INCLUDE [include-audit-what-who-when](includes/include-audit-what-who-when.md)]

# About planning functionality

The planning system takes all demand and supply data into account, nets the results, and creates suggestions for balancing supply to meet demand. To learn more, go to [Design Details: Supply Planning](design-details-supply-planning.md).  

> [!TIP]  
> To understand the fields that this article mentions, read their tooltip in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

## Supply and demand

Planning has two elements, supply and demand. These must balance to ensure that the demand is met.  

- Demand is any kind of gross requirement, such as a sales order, service order, or a component need for assembly or production orders, outbound transfer, blanket order, or forecast. Additionally, there other technical types of demand, such as a negative production or purchase order, negative inventory, and purchase return.  
- Supply refers to any kind of replenishment such as inventory, a purchase order, assembly order, production order, or inbound transfer. Correspondingly, there can be a negative sales or service order, negative component need or sales return that also represent supply.  

Another goal of the planning system is to ensure that the inventory does not grow unnecessarily. In the case of decreasing demand, the planning system will suggest that you postpone, decrease in quantity, or cancel existing replenishment orders.  

## Planning calculation

The planning system is driven by anticipated and actual customer demand, as well as inventory reordering parameters. Running the planning calculation will result in application suggesting specific actions ([Action Messages](production-how-to-run-mps-and-mrp.md#action-messages)) to take concerning possible replenishment from vendors, transfers between warehouses, or production. If replenishment orders already exist, the suggested actions could be to increase or expedite the orders to meet the changes in demand.  

The basis of the planning routine is in the gross-to-net calculation. Net requirements drive planned order releases, which are scheduled based on the routing information (manufactured items) or the item card lead time (purchased items). Planned order release quantities are based on the planning calculation, and are affected by the parameters set on the individual item cards.  

> [!TIP]
> The planning system relies on how your organization uses locations. To learn more, go to [Planning With or Without Locations](production-planning-with-without-locations.md).

## Planning with manual transfer orders

In the **Replenishment System** field on a SKU card, you can set up the planning system to create transfer orders to balance supply and demand across locations.  

In addition to such automatic transfer orders, you may sometimes need to perform a general move of inventory quantities to another location, irrespective of existing demand. For this purpose you would manually create a transfer order for the quantity to move. To ensure that the planning system does not try to manipulate this manual transfer order, you must set the **Planning Flexibility** on the transfer line(s) to None.  

Contrarily, if you do want the planning system to adjust the transfer order quantities and dates to existing demand, you must set the **Planning Flexibility** field to the default value, Unlimited.

## Planning parameters

The planning parameters control when, how much, and how to replenish based on the various settings on the item card (or stockkeeping unit - SKU), and the manufacturing setup.  

The following planning parameters exist on the item or SKU card:  

- Dampener Period  
- Dampener Quantity  
- Reordering Policy  
- Reorder Point
- Maximum Inventory  
- Overflow Level  
- Time Bucket  
- Lot Accumulation Period  
- Rescheduling Period  
- Reorder Quantity  
- Safety Lead Time  
- Safety Stock Quantity  
- Assembly Policy  
- Manufacturing Policy  

The following order modifiers exist on the item or SKU card:  

- Minimum Order Quantity  
- Maximum Order Quantity  
- Order Multiple  

Global planning setup fields on the **Manufacturing Setup** page include:  

- Dynamic Low-Level Code  
- Current Demand Forecast  
- Use Forecast on Locations  
- Default Safety Lead Time  
- Blank Overflow Level  
- Combined MPS/MRP Calculation
- Components at Location  
- Default Dampener Period  
- Default Dampener Quantity  
- Default General Business Posting Group

To learn more, go to [Design Details: Planning Parameters](design-details-planning-parameters.md)  

## Other important planning fields

### Planning Flexibility

On most supply orders, such as production orders, you can select **Unlimited** or **None** in the **Planning Flexibility** field on the lines.

This specifies whether the supply represented by the production order line is considered by the planning system when calculating action messages.
If the field contains **Unlimited**, then the planning system includes the line when calculating action messages. If the field contains **None**, then the line is firm and unchangeable, and the planning system does not include the line when calculating action messages.

### Warnings

The **Warning** information field on the **Planning Worksheet** page informs you of any planning line created for an unusual situation with a text, which the user can choose to read additional information. The following warning types exist:

- Emergency
- Exception
- Attention

#### Emergency

The emergency warning displays in two situations:

- The inventory is negative on the planning starting date.
- Back-dated supply or demand events exist.

If an item's inventory is negative on the planning starting date, the planning system suggests an emergency supply order for the negative quantity to arrive on the planning starting date. The warning text states the starting date and the quantity of the emergency order.

Any document lines with due dates before the planning starting date are consolidated into one emergency supply order for the item to arrive on the planning starting date.

#### Exception

The exception warning displays if the projected available inventory drops below the safety stock quantity.

The planning system will suggest a supply order to meet the demand on its due date. The warning text states the item's safety stock quantity and the date on which it is violated.

Violating the safety stock level is considered an exception because it shouldn't occur if the reorder point has been set correctly.

> [!NOTE]
> Supply on planning lines with Exception warnings is normally not modified according to planning parameters. Instead, the planning system only suggests a supply to cover the exact demand quantity. However, you can set the planning run up to respect certain planning parameters for planning lines with certain warnings. To learn more, go to the description for the **Respect Planning Parameters for Exception Warnings** field in the [Run Full Planning, MPS or MRP](production-how-to-run-mps-and-mrp.md) article.

#### Attention

The attention warning displays in two situations:

- The planning starting date is earlier than the work date.
- The planning line suggests to change a released purchase or production order.

> [!NOTE]
> In planning lines with warnings, the **Accept Action Message** field is not selected, because the planner is expected to further investigate these lines before carrying out the plan.

## Planning worksheets and requisition worksheets

As described in [Planning](production-planning.md), you can choose between two worksheets for most planning activities, the planning worksheet and the requisition worksheet. Most processes are described based on the planning worksheet, but there are a couple of scenarios where the requisition worksheet is preferred.

[!INCLUDE [edit-in-excel](includes/edit-in-excel.md)]

> [!TIP]
> When you process lines in a planning worksheet, you can print more than one firm planned orders. The **Prod. Order** option in the **Report Selection - Production Order** page determines which report to print. The default report is **99000762 Prod. Order - Job Card**. If your production orders lack routing lines or you prefer a more compact report, consider switching to the **5500 Prod. Order Comp. and Routing** report.

### Requisition worksheet

The **Requisition Worksheet** page lists items that you want to order. You can enter items in the worksheet in the following ways:

- Enter the items manually in the worksheet and fill in the relevant fields.
- Use the **Calculate Plan** batch job. This calculates a replenishment plan for items and stockkeeping units that have been set up with a replenishment system of **Purchase** or **Transfer**. When you use this batch job, the program automatically fills in the **Action Message** field with a suggestion for an action you can take to replenish the item. This could be increasing the item quantity on an existing order or creating a new order, for example.
- If you have used the **Calculate Plan** batch job from the **Planning Worksheet** page to calculate a replenishment plan, you can use the **Carry Out Action Message** batch job to copy purchase and transfer order proposals from the planning worksheet to the requisition worksheet. This is practical if separate users are responsible for handling production orders and purchase/transfer orders.
- You can use the **Drop Shipment** action to fill in the requisition worksheet lines. This action uses the **Get Sales Orders** batch job to determine the sales order lines that you want to designate for a drop shipment.
- You can use the **Special Order** action to fill in the requisition worksheet lines. This action uses the **Get Sales Orders** batch job to determine the sales order lines that you want to designate for a special order.

Requisition worksheet lines contain detailed information about the items that need to be reordered. You can edit and delete the lines to adjust your replenishment plan, and you can further process the lines by using the **Carry Out Action Message** batch job.

To learn more about planning with locations and transfers, go to [Planning With or Without Locations](production-planning-with-without-locations.md).

> [!TIP]
> When you're working on the **Requisition Worksheet** or **Planning Worksheet** pages, you can organize the lines by sorting on a column name. This is especially useful on the Planning Worksheet page because they it can be used for multilevel production orders. By default, lines are sorted by the **Item No.** field. To group lines for a multilevel order, sort by the **Ref. Order No.** field. Also, the **MPS Order** and **Planning Level** fields can help show the hierarchy of the lines.

# Warnings and error messages

During your work day, you might see notifications in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] that something went wrong, or that it wasn't possible to post something, for example. In many cases, the notification makes it easy to resolve the matter, or to roll back any changes that you made. In other cases, you might not have the information that you need to get unblocked. This article provides tips on how to make progress.  

## In-product user assistance

The default version of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes descriptions for most fields, columns, and actions that can be accessed when you choose the name. In combination with teaching tips for important pages, descriptive captions, and instructional text, these tooltips, or callouts, are our current implementation of *embedded user assistance*, which is an important principle in today's world of software design.  

If you have a question about a field or another element of the user interface, choose the name to read a short description. Choose the **Ask Copilot** link if that isn't enough. You can also use the in-product Help pane to find answers to your questions.

* Open your default email editor, where you can paste the error details you copied and specify who you want to ask for help. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] adds a link to the page where you experienced.

## Help yourself

Error messages provide information and actions that make it easier to understand, go to, and resolve errors that come from the platform.

The error messages that the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] platform generates contain the full technical details, including field names, in the **Detailed error message** section. Select the **Copy details** icon on inline validation errors or in an error message to access the technical information.

Actions on error messages take you directly to the page where a field is causing the error. You don't have to take time to find the page or field yourself. To resolve the error, just choose the action in the error message and [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] takes you to the appropriate location.

The following video shows how to use actionable error messages to get unblocked.

### Tip for developers

If you're a developer, when you call the [TestField](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/methods-auto/record/record-testfield-joker-joker-errorinfo-method) method, but don't pass in the |`ErrorInfo` object, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically generates the link to a page where a user can correct the issue. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] first gets the lookup or drill-down page for the record, and then finds the card page or lookup page and adds a navigation link to that card page. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't add a link in the following situations:

* If the error is on the page that's currently open.
* If the user doesn't have permission to modify the underlying record.

# Design Details: Posting Engine Structure
Posting interface and some other functions in codeunit 12 use posting engine functions to prepare and insert general ledger entry and VAT entry records. The posting engine is also responsible for general ledger register creation.  
  
 The functions in the following table provide a standard framework for designing posting procedures (such as Code, CustPostApplyCustledgEntry, VendPostApplyVendLedgEntry, UnapplyCustLedgEntry, UnapplyVendLedgEntry, and Reverse) and exclusive access to table 17, G/L Entry.  
  
|Routine|Description|  
|-------------|---------------------------------------|  
|StartPosting|Initializes posting buffer TempGLEntryBuf, locks G/L Entry and VAT Entry tables, and initializes Accounting Period, G/L Register, and Exchange Rate. Should be called only once, then NextEntryNo is 0.|  
|ContinuePosting|Checks and posts unrealized VAT for previous transaction increment NextTransactionNo and prepares post of next line.|  
|FinishPosting|Completes posting by inserting G/L entries from temporary buffer into database table. Always used together with StartPosting. Checks for inconsistencies.|  
|InitGLEntry|Used to initialize new G/L entry for Gen. Jnl Line. Returns GLEntry as parameter.|  
|InitGLEntryVAT|Same as InitGLEntry, but also assigns Bal. Account No. and SummarizeVAT.|  
|InitGLEntryVATCopy|Similar to InitGLEntryVAT, but also copies posting groups data from VAT Entry before SummarizeVAT.|  
|InsertGLEntry|The only function that inserts G/L entry into global TempGLEntryBuf table. Always use this function for insert.|  
|CreateGLEntry|Performs an InitGLEntry, assigns Additional Currency Amount, and then performs InsertGLEntry. Replaces several lines of code with a single function call.|  
|CreateGLEntryBalAcc|Same as CreateGLEntry, but also assigns Bal. Account Type and Bal. Account No.|  
|CreateGLEntryVAT|Same as CreateGLEntry, but with additional processing for posting groups and saving to temporary VAT buffer:<br /><br /> `GLEntry.CopyPostingGroupsFromDtldCVBuf(DtldCVLedgEntryBuf,GenJnlLine."Gen. Posting Type");`<br /><br /> `InsertVATEntriesFromTemp(DtldCVLedgEntryBuf,GLEntry);`|  
|CreateGLEntryVATCollectAdj|Same as CreateGLEntry, but with additional collection of adjustments and saving to temporary VAT buffer:<br /><br /> `CollectAdjustment(AdjAmount,GLEntry.Amount,GLEntry."Additional-Currency Amount",OriginalDateSet);`<br /><br /> `InsertVATEntriesFromTemp(DtldCVLedgEntryBuf,GLEntry);`|  
|CreateGLEntryFromVATEntry|Same as CreateGLEntry, but also copies posting groups from VAT entry.|

# Delete cost budget entries

You use the **Delete Cost Budget Entries** batch job to cancel cost budget entries from the cost budget register.  

To prevent any gaps in the cost budget entries and cost register entries, you can't delete a single entry or a batch of entries in the middle of the list of register entries.  

## To delete a cost budget entry  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Delete Cost Budget Entries**, and then choose the related link.  

    The **To Register No.** field contains the last register entry number and can't be changed.  

    You can use the **From Register No.** field to select a register entry number from which the deletion should begin.  
2. Choose the **OK** button to delete the selected cost budget entries.  

> [!NOTE]  
> To avoid an accidental deletion of cost budget entries, you can close register entries by marking the lines as **Closed** in the **Closed** field on the **Cost Budget Registers** page.

# Fixed assets reports in Business Central

When you prepare a balance sheet and income statement, you might have to generate reports to analyze the depreciation, acquisition, disposal, and gain or loss values for an accounting period. You might also need reports that show:

* Accumulated depreciation and book value at the end of a period.
* List your fixed assets for inventory, insurance, and other management purposes.


This article describes the built-in reports for fixed assets.

# Default data for sustainability

To simplify how you manage your sustainability accounts and emissions, you can create default values for the following entities:  

- **G/L Account** (only available default sustainability account)
- **Item** (available default sustainability account and emissions)
- **Resource** (available default sustainability account and emissions)
- **Work Center** (available default sustainability account and emissions)
- **Machine Center** (available default sustainability account and emissions)

> [!NOTE]
> Although you set default values, you can change them on journals and documents as needed. These values are simply defaults and aren't mandatory.  

## G/L accounts

To set up a default sustainability account for a G/L account, follow these steps:  

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Chart of accounts**, and then select the related link.
2. In the **No.** field, choose the number for the account you want to configure to open the **G/L Account Card** page.  
3. On the **Sustainability** FastTab, use the **Default Sust. Account** field to select the sustainability account you want to use as the default.
4. Close the page.

## Items

For items, you can use the manually entered sustainability account, or use the default value you have on the **Item Category**. The following processes explain both options.

### Specify a default sustainability account for an item category

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Item categories**, and then select the related link.
2. In the **Code** field, choose the code for the category you want to configure to open the **Item Category Card** page.  
3. On the **Sustainability** FastTab, use the **Default Sust. Account** field to select the sustainability account you want to use as the default for the category.
4. Close the page.

### Specify default sustainability values for an item  

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, and then select the related link.
2. Open the card for an item for which you want to set up default values.  
3. Add the default sustainability account:

   1. On the **Sustainability** FastTab, use the **Default Sust. Account** field to select the sustainability account you want to use as the default.  
   2. If you configured default sustainability accounts on item categories, select the **Item Category Code** you want to use on the **Item** FastTab. The default value for the category updates the value in **Default Sust. Account** field.

4. Fill in the following fields for default emissions for this item:

   1. **Default CO2 Emission**
   2. **Default CH4 Emission**  
   3. **Default N2O Emission**

   > [!NOTE]
   > You can add default emissions only if the **Replenishment System** is set to **Purchase**. For other options, you can only set up the **Default Sust. Account**. CO2e (carbon equivalent) is calculated based on your production or assembly processes. If you already filled in the emissions fields and then change the replenishment system to something other than **Purchase**, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] deletes the existing emissions.

5. Run the **Calculate CO2e** action to calculate **CO2e per Unit** field if you're just setting up this item and you don't have earlier transactions. By default, this action updates this item only. However, you can change the filter and apply it to a different range of items.  

   > [!NOTE]
   > The calculation of CO2e (carbon equivalent) is based on the default emissions you specified for the item and your setup on the **Emission Fees** page.  

6. Close the page.

> [!NOTE]
> The information you enter for emissions and the calculated **CO2e per Unit** are overridden by the system's calculations for this item based on **Sustainability Value Entry**. This data comes from the **Posted Purchase Invoice** page, and uses the average method of emission calculation. Therefore, manually calculated **CO2e per Unit** is only used before posting documents with the correct values. This means you can use manual creation for data planning (**Production BOM**, **Assembly Order**, and so on) before you post the related document.  

## Resources

To set up default sustainability values for a resource, follow these steps:  

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **resources**, and then select the related link.
2. Open the card for a resource for which you want to set up default values.
3. On the **Sustainability** FastTab, use the **Default Sust. Account** field to select the sustainability account to use as the default.  
4. Fill in the following fields for default emissions for the resource:

   1. **Default CO2 Emission**
   2. **Default CH4 Emission**  
   3. **Default N2O Emission**

5. Run the **Calculate CO2e** action to calculate the value in the **CO2e per Unit** field.

> [!NOTE]
> You must use the **Calculate CO2e** action to calculate the **CO2e per Unit** field because, unlike items, no other transactions affect these values. By default, this action updates this resource only. However, you can change the filter and apply it to a different range of resources.  

> [!NOTE]
> The calculation of CO2e (carbon equivalent) is based on the default emissions you specified for the resource and your setup on the **Emission Fees** page.  

6. Close the page.

## Work centers

To set up default sustainability values for a work center, follow these steps:  

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Work centers**, and then select the related link.
2. Open the **Work Center Card** page for a work center for which you want to set up default values.  
3. On the **Sustainability** FastTab, use the **Default Sust. Account** field to select the sustainability account to use as the default.  
4. Fill in the following fields for default emissions for this work center:

   1. **Default CO2 Emission**
   2. **Default CH4 Emission**  
   3. **Default N2O Emission**

5. Run the **Calculate CO2e** action to calculate the value in the **CO2e per Unit** field.

> [!NOTE]
> You must use the **Calculate CO2e** action to calculate the **CO2e per Unit** field because, unlike items, no other transactions affect these values. By default, this action updates this work center only. However, you can change the filter and apply it to a different range of work centers.  

> [!NOTE]
> The calculation of CO2e (carbon equivalent) is based on the default emissions you specified for this work center and your setup on the **Emission Fees** page.  

7. Close the page.

> [!NOTE]
> You can also run the **Calculate CO2e** action from the **Work Centers** list page. You can also apply this action to machine centers.  

## Machine centers

To set up default sustainability values for a machine center, follow these steps:  

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Machine centers**, and then select the related link.
2. Open the **Machine Center Card** for a machine center for which you want to set up default values.  
3. On the **Sustainability** FastTab, use the **Default Sust. Account** field to select the sustainability account to use as the default.  
4. Fill in the following fields for default emissions for this machine center:

   1. **Default CO2 Emission**
   2. **Default CH4 Emission**  
   3. **Default N2O Emission**

5. Run the **Calculate CO2e** action to calculate **CO2e per Unit** field.

> [!NOTE]
> You must use the **Calculate CO2e** action to calculate the **CO2e per Unit** field because, unlike items, no other transactions affect these values. By default, this action updates this machine center only. However, you can change the filter and apply it to a different range of machine centers.  

> [!NOTE]
> The calculation of CO2e (carbon equivalent) is based on the default emissions you specified for this machine center and your setup on the **Emission Fees** page.  

6. Close the page.

> [!NOTE]
> You can also run the **Calculate CO2e** action from the **Machine Centers** list page. You can also apply this action to work centers.

# Create users according to licenses

[!INCLUDE[azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id](~/../shared-content/shared/azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id.md)]

[!INCLUDE [2023rw1-sec-group-short](includes/2023rw1-sec-group-short.md)]

This article describes how administrators create users and define who can sign in to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. This article also describes how to assign permissions to different users according to your product licenses.

When you create users in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you grant permissions to them through permission sets. You can also organize users in user groups. User groups make it easier to manage permissions and other settings for multiple users at the same time. For more information, see [Assign Permissions to Users and Groups](ui-define-granular-permissions.md).  

For more information about the different types of licenses and how licensing works in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], [download the Dynamics 365 Licensing Guide](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=866544).

> [!NOTE]
> The process of managing users and licenses varies depending on whether [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is deployed online or on-premises. For [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, you must add users from Microsoft 365. In on-premises deployments, you can create, edit, and delete users directly.  

## Manage users and licenses in online tenants

User accounts in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online must be first created in the Microsoft 365 admin center. These user accounts aren't exclusive to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. If you subscribe to other plans, they can be used to sign in to other applications, such as Power BI. For information about creating users in the Microsoft 365 admin center, go to [Add users in Microsoft admin center](/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/add-users).

Your subscription to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online defines how many [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] user licenses you're allowed. Users are added to your tenant in the Microsoft Partner Center, typically by your Microsoft partner. For more information, see [Administration of Business Central Online](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/tenant-administration).

You assign licenses to users according to the work each user does in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. You can assign licenses in several ways:

- Your company's Microsoft 365 administrator can do it in the [Microsoft 365 Admin Center](https://admin.microsoft.com). For more information, see [Add users individually or in bulk to Microsoft 365](/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/add-users).  
- A Microsoft partner can assign licenses in the Microsoft 365 Admin Center or in the Microsoft Partner Center. For more information, see [User management tasks for customer accounts](/partner-center/assign-licenses-to-users) in the Microsoft Partner Center Help.

For more information, see [Administration of Business Central Online](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/tenant-administration) in the administration Help.

After user accounts are created in the Microsoft 365 admin center, there are two ways to import them to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]:

- A user account is imported automatically when the user signs in to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] the first time.

   > [!NOTE]
   > After a user signs in to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, you can't delete the user.

- The administrator can import users by choosing the **Update Users from Microsoft 365** action on the **Users* page.

Both approaches have their own advantages, and you can use them simultaneously. Each approach allows administrators to proactively configure [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to assign the starting permissions, user groups, and user profiles. Using the **Update Users from Microsoft 365** action gives administrators more control to adjust permissions, user groups, and profiles. It's an ideal approach when you're setting up [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] the first time, before any users sign in, or when adding a new team of users.

> [!NOTE]
> After you add users in the Microsoft 365 Admin Center, we recommend that you update the user information in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] as soon as possible. Keeping user information current is easy to do, and helps ensure that people can always sign in. For more information, see [To add users or update user information and license assignments in Business Central](#adduser).<br>
>
> Updating user information is especially important if you've customized permission sets for the license. If a new user tries to sign in to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] before you've added them, they might not be able to. For more information, see [Configure permissions based on licenses](#licensespermissions).
>
> However, users who experience this problem aren't actually blocked. They can either use the **Go back home** action, or simply sign in again to resolve the issue.

[!INCLUDE [admin-gdap-users](includes/admin-gdap-users.md)]

For more information, see [Delegated administrator access to Business Central Online](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/delegated-admin).  

### <a name="licensespermissions"></a>Configure permissions based on licenses

[!INCLUDE [2022_releasewave1](includes/2022_releasewave1.md)]

Admins can configure permissions sets and user groups for each license.<!--Note to translators: The names in *italics* or capitalized in this section must not be translated.-->  

For example, the commonly used license, *Dynamics 365 Business Central Team Member*, has the following permissions sets by default:

- D365 READ
- D365 TEAM MEMBER
- EDIT IN EXCEL - VIEW
- EXPORT REPORT EXCEL
- LOCAL

Other permission sets are added automatically based on the user groups assigned to the license. When you create a new user based on this license, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] assigns the permission sets originating from the user groups and the permission sets from the license. The same starting permissions are assigned to the user if their user account was created automatically in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] or if the administrator used the **Update Users from Microsoft 365** action in the **Users** page.

If this default configuration isn't the right setup for a particular environment, the admin can change that configuration. However, customized permissions affect only new users who are assigned that license. Permissions for existing users who are assigned the license aren't affected.  

1. Sign in to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] using an administrator account.  
2. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **License Configuration**, and then choose the related link.  

    <!--Alternatively, if you're already in the **Users** page, you can run the **Update Users from Microsoft 365** guide, and then, on the first page of the guide, choose the **Configure permissions per license** link.-->  
3. In the **License Configuration** page, choose the license that you want to customize, and then choose the **Configure** action.  
4. Choose the **Customize permissions** field to switch on customization, and then make the changes.  

    In our example, the admin wants to remove the permission to edit in Excel, so they remove the *Excel Export Action* user group from the Team Member license. Afterward, new users who are assigned the Team Member license can't export data to Excel. If the organization changes their minds on the subject, they can just go back to the **License Configuration** page and switch off the customization for that license type.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This customization of permissions only takes effect for new users that you assign the relevant license. Existing users are not updated. We recommend that you customize permissions before you start assigning users licenses in the Microsoft 365 admin center.

### <a name="adduser"></a>To add users or update user information and license assignments in Business Central

After you add users or change user information in the Microsoft 365 Admin Center, you can quickly import the user information to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The import includes license assignments.  

> [!TIP]
> If you need to update user information and you have a lot of users, you can use the filter pane to narrow down the list. You can filter on basic information such as the user name, or set more technical filters, such as the user's security ID.

1. Sign in to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] using an administrator account.
2. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Users**, and then choose the related link.  
3. Choose **Update Users from Microsoft 365**.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Running the synchronization of users from Microsoft 365 using the **Update Users from Microsoft 365** guide, requires the SUPER permission set.

> [!NOTE]
> The **Update Users from Microsoft 365** guide doesn't update users that are not assigned a license, such as someone who is a [Dynamics 365 administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#dynamics-365-administrator). Those users will update the next time they sign in to the environment.

The next step for newly created users is to assign user groups and permissions. Go to [Assign Permissions to Users and Groups](ui-define-granular-permissions.md) for information. If you update a user with a license change, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] assigns users to the appropriate user group and updates their permission sets. For more information, see [To manage permissions through user groups](ui-define-granular-permissions.md).  

> [!NOTE]
> With 2024 release wave 1, a Premium license user can sign in to a company where the **User Experience** field is set to **Essentials** on the **Company Information** page. However, the Premium user can't use any of the features that the Premium license provides. This doesn't work in the opposite direction. Users who have an Essentials license can't sign in to a company where the **User Experience** is set to **Premium** on the **Company Information** page. For more information about licensing, go to [Business Central](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/business-central/overview/) website.

If you use an external accountant to manage your books and financial reporting, you can invite them to your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] so they can work with you on your fiscal data. For more information, see [Inviting Your External Accountant to Your Business Central](finance-accounting.md#inviteaccountant).

For more information about synchronizing user information with Microsoft 365, go to the [Synchronization with Microsoft 365](#m365) section.

> [!NOTE]
> If you use an external accountant to manage your books and financial reporting, you can invite them to your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] so they can work with you on your fiscal data. For more information, see [Inviting Your External Accountant to Your Business Central](finance-accounting.md#inviteaccountant).

### To remove a user's access to the system

You can remove a user's access to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online. All references to the user are kept. However, the user can't sign in and active sessions for the user are stopped.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Users**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the **User Card** page for the relevant user, and then, in the **Status** field, select **Disabled**.
3. To give the user access again, set the **Status** field to **Enabled**.

You can also remove the license from a user in the Microsoft 365 Admin Center. The user is then unable to sign in. For more information, see [Remove licenses from users](/microsoft-365/admin/manage/remove-licenses-from-users).

### <a name="m365"></a>Synchronization with Microsoft 365

When you assign a license for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to a user in Microsoft 365, there are two ways to create the user in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

- The administrator can add the user by choosing the **Update Users from Microsoft 365** action on the **Users** page as described in the [To add a user or update user information in Business Central](#adduser) section.
- The license information updates automatically when the user signs in for the first time.

In both cases, several settings are applied automatically. These settings are listed in the second and third columns in the following table.

If you change user information in Microsoft 365, you can update [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to reflect the change. Depending on what you want to update, use one of the actions on the **Users** page. The actions are described in the last two columns in the following table.

|What happens when:|First user, first sign-in|Update Users from Microsoft 365|Restore User Default User Groups|
|-|-|-|-|
|Scope:|Current user|Multiple selected users|Single selected user (except current)|
|Create the new user and assign SUPER permission set.<br /><br /><!--Platform-->|**X**|**X** | | 
|Update the user based on information in Microsoft 365: Status, Full Name, Contact Email, Authentication Email.<!--<br /><br />Codeunit "Azure AD   Graph User".UpdateUserFromAzureGraph-->|**X**|**X**|**X**|
|Synchronize user plans (licenses) with licenses and roles assigned in Microsoft 365.<!--<br /><br />Codeunit "Azure AD   Graph User".UpdateUserPlans-->|**X**|**X**|**X**|
|Add the user to user groups according to the current user plans. Remove the SUPER permission set for all users other than the first user to sign in and [administrators](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/tenant-administration). At least one SUPER is required.<!--<br /><br />Codeunit "Permission Manager". AddUserToDefaultUserGroups-->|**X**|**X**|**X**<br /><br />Removes manually assigned user groups and permissions.|

Users can access [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] records in Teams using only their Microsoft 365 license. When access is enabled for an environment, synchronizing using the **Update users from Microsoft 365** action skips users that only have a Microsoft 365 license. To include these users in synchronization, you must first update environment settings by assigning a security group that contains users with a [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] license and users with only a Microsoft 365 license.

Learn about securing access to environments using security groups at [Manage access using Microsoft Entra groups](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/tenant-admin-center-manage-access#manage-access-using-azure-active-directory-groups).

Get an overview of accessing [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in Teams with Microsoft 365 licenses at [admin-access-with-m365-license](admin-access-with-m365-license.md).

## Manage users and licenses in on-premises deployments

For on-premises deployments, the number of user licenses is specified in the license file (.bclicense or .flf). When an administrator or Microsoft partner uploads the license file, they can specify which users can sign in to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

For on-premises deployments, the administrator creates, edits, and deletes users directly from the **Users** page.

> [!NOTE]
> In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, delegated admin access isn't available like it is in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online. Microsoft partners need standard user licenses to use [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Learn more about licenses in the [Business Central on-premises licensing guide](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2009643).

### To edit or delete a user in an on-premises deployment

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Users**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the user that you want to edit, and then choose the **Edit** action.
3. On the **User Card** page, change the information as necessary.  
4. To delete a user, select the user that you want to delete, and then choose the **Delete** action.

> [!NOTE]
> For on-premises deployments an administrator can specify how to authenticate user credentials in the [!INCLUDE[server](includes/server.md)] instance. When you create a user, you provide the credential type that you are using.
>
> For more information, see the [Authentication and Credential Types](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/users-credential-types) in the administration Help for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## Analyze user status by license type

You can use the **Data Analysis** feature to analyze data on the [Users](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=9800&layout=analysis) page. You don't have to run a report or open another application, such as Excel. The feature provides an interactive and versatile way to calculate, summarize, and examine data. Instead of running reports using options and filters, you can add multiple tabs that represent different tasks or views on the data. Some examples are "Users by status" or "Users by license type," or any other view you can imagine. To learn more about how to use the **Data Analysis** feature, go to [Analyze list and query data with analysis mode](analysis-mode.md).

### User analysis scenarios

The following sections provide examples of scenarios where analyzing the user list can help you monitor the status of your users.

| Area | To... | Open this page in analysis mode | Using these fields |
| ---- | ----- | ------------------------------- |------------------- |
| [Users by status](#example-users-by-status) | See a list of users based on their status (enabled/disabled). | [Users](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=9800&layout=analysis) | **Status**, **User Name**, **Full Name**, **Authorization email**, and **License Type**. |
| [Users by license type](#example-users-by-license-type) | See a list of users based on their license type. | [Users](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=9800&layout=analysis) | **License Type**, **Status**,  **User Name**, **Full Name**, and **Authorization email**. |

### Example: Users by status

To analyze users by status, follow these steps:

1. Open the [Users](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=9800&layout=analysis) list, and choose the :::image type="content" source="media/analysis-mode-icon.png" alt-text="Enter analysis mode."::: icon to turn on analysis mode.
1. On the **Columns** menu, remove all columns (select the box next to the **Search** field on the right).
1. Drag the **Status** (user enabled/disabled) and **License Type** fields to the **Row Groups** area.
1. Choose the fields **User Name**, **Full Name**, and **Authorization email**.
1. Rename your analysis tab to **Users by status**, or something that describes this analysis.

The following image shows the result of these steps.

# Inventory by Location (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Inventory by Location** outlines inventory levels across an organization's locations. It provides an accurate picture of each location and the inventory levels broken down by category and item.

:::image type="content" source="media/inventory/inventory-by-location.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Inventory by Location Power BI Report" lightbox="media/inventory/inventory-by-location.png":::

## Use the report

The report is designed for management teams in warehousing and supply chain management.

Warehouse managers can use the report to check whether each location has appropriate stock levels. This information can help identify whether a location is low or high on stock, and show where you can move stock around where required.

For supply chain managers, the report provides information about where you store each item. With this information, you can make informed decisions about shipping and ensure that items are delivered on time and at the lowest cost.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The *Inventory by Location* report includes the following KPIs:

- [**Inventory (Quantity)**](inventory-powerbi-kpis.md#inventory-quantity)

[!INCLUDE[click-on-a-kpi-link](includes/click-on-a-kpi-link.md)] 

[!INCLUDE[powerbi-tip-track-kpis](includes/powerbi-tip-track-kpis.md)] 


## Data used in the report

The report uses data from the following tables in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]:

- Item
- Item Ledger Entries
- Location

## Try the report

# Business Central and OneDrive integration

OneDrive for work or school (formerly known as OneDrive for Business) is a cloud storage service that is included in Microsoft 365. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] makes it easy to store, manage, and share files with other people through OneDrive. When a file is in your OneDrive you enjoy the rich collaborative experiences from the online versions of Microsoft products, such as Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. For example, you can share a Word document, and then you and your colleagues can edit it together in real-time. OneDrive also lets you open other types of files, such as PDFs. 

## Get started with OneDrive features

If you're using [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, we've already created the connection between [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online and OneDrive, so it's easy to get started. The only requirement is that users have opened OneDrive at least one time. With [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, an administrator has to configure the connection before you can get started. Learn more at [Managing OneDrive Integration with Business Central](admin-onedrive-integration.md).

<!-- We've created the connection between [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online and OneDrive, so it's easy to get started. The only requirement is that users have opened OneDrive at least one time. -->

### Open and share in OneDrive

On most pages where files are available, such as the Report Inbox or files that are attached to records, you'll find an **Open in OneDrive** and **Share** actions.

:::image type="content" source="media/onedrive-overview-report-inbox-w-outline.png" alt-text="The Open in OneDrive and Share actions for reports":::


:::image type="content" source="media/one-drive-attachments-w-outline.png" alt-text="The Open in OneDrive and Share actions for attachments":::

|Select...|To...|See more info...|
|---------|-----|----------------|
|Open in OneDrive|Copy the file to a Business Central folder in your OneDrive and open the file.|[Open in OneDrive](across-share-onedrive.md#open-in-onedrive) |
|Share|Copy the file to your OneDrive and share it with other people.|[Share in OneDrive](across-share-onedrive.md#share) |

### Save Excel workbooks and report files in OneDrive

With OneDrive integration set up, a couple other familiar features will automatically use OneDrive for saving files instead of saving files on your device:

- The **Open in Excel** and **Edit in Excel** actions on list pages will automatically copy the Excel file to OneDrive, then open it in Excel Online. For more information, see [Viewing and Editing in Excel](across-work-with-excel.md).
- Sending a report to an Excel or Word file will automatically copy the file to OneDrive, then open it in the Excel or Word online. For more information, see [Saving a report to a file](ui-work-report.md#save-a-report-to-a-file).

These features aren't turned on by default. But as an administrator, you can easily turn them on by using the **OneDrive Setup** assisted setup guide.

<!--
When you use the **Open in OneDrive** action for the first time, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] does the following in your OneDrive:

1. Creates a folder named [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. 
2. In the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] folder, it creates another folder with the same name as the company you're working in. If you work in more than one company, it will create a folder for the company you're working in when you use the **Open in OneDrive** action. 
3. Puts a copy of the file you selected in the folder, and then opens the file. The next time you use the action, it only copies and opens the file. 

The folder and its content are private until you decide to share them with others. For example, you might decide to share content with one or more of your coworkers, or even people outside of your organization. For more information, see [Share OneDrive files and folders](https://support.microsoft.com/office/share-onedrive-files-and-folders-9fcc2f7d-de0c-4cec-93b0-a82024800c07) in the content for OneDrive.
-->

> [!NOTE]
> You can also connect your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises to OneDrive. However, there are a few things to do to make it work. For more information, see [Configuring Business Central On-Premises](admin-onedrive-integration-onpremises.md).

# The Company Hub for Business Central Extension

This application provides a dashboard with summary data for each company that the user has access to across all [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, such as the many clients of an accountant. The home page displays financial KPIs as well as a direct link to the individual environments and companies so that users can.

The dashboard is a highly specialized Role Center for a better overview of your work.

When you first install the extension, a sample company helps you get started. You can delete the sample company at any time.

## Installing the extension

When you install the extension in your [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you will be asked if you want to use it now. If you do, then you must sign out and sign in again, because the extension replaces your current Role Center and adds permissions to your user profile.

# Tell Me FAQ

This article answers questions that our advanced users often ask about the Tell me what you want to do feature.

## Are all actions from my current page discoverable in Tell Me?

No. Actions in parts, such as the Sales Lines part or FactBoxes, aren't displayed in Tell Me.

## Can I search for a specific record?

Yes. For example, if you want to quickly find a sales order, enter it's identifier, and then choose the **Search company data** action. If you only know the customer's name, enter that. Tell Me arranges results by type, so you could find the order under the Sales Orders category.

## Are the results in Tell Me filtered by permissions?

If the user doesn't have AccessByPermissions, then actions aren't displayed. However, pages and reports appear in the results but require that the user has permission to access them. A message displays if the user doesn't have permission to view the object.

## Does Tell Me display content from my customizations or installed third-party extensions?

Actions, pages, and reports that originate from extensions are picked up by Tell Me. For technical information about how to make custom pages and reports discoverable, see [Adding Pages and Reports to Search](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-al-menusuite-functionality).

## What makes this different from what was previously known as Page Search?

Page Search has evolved into Tell Me to help you get work done quickly. Page Search could only help you navigate to pages or reports. At a technical level, Tell Me is no longer based on the legacy MenuSuite concept.

## I use on-premises [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Does that include Tell Me?

You can use Tell Me in the on-premises Web Client to find actions, pages, and reports, but not apps and consulting services on AppSource.

## Is Tell Me available for all form factors?

Yes. It was introduced on phones and tablets in Business Central 2023 release wave 2. In 2023 release wave 2, it must be enabled in [Feature Management](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/feature-management) using the **Feature: Search for pages and data in the mobile app** switch. In 2024 rlease wave 1 and later, it's always enabled.

<!-- removed in v20 because of Help pane
### Are the documentation results available in any language?
The help articles display in the language you have specified in **My Settings**, if help is available in that language.
-->

## Does Tell Me give me help on how to use pages, reports, and other things?

No, but you can easily get this information from the Help pane. Just select the **Search Help** action in the **Tell me what you want to do** page or select <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>F1</kbd> on your keyboard. To learn more about the Help pane, go to [Help pane](product-help-and-support.md#help-pane).

### Why don't I see a bookmark icon for my search results?

The bookmark icon isn't displayed in the Tell Me window when personalization is disabled for a user role.

# Change basic settings

Use the **My Settings** page to manage basic settings for your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The changes you make only affect your workspace, not the workspaces of other users.  

[!INCLUDE [about-ui-learn](includes/about-ui-learn.md)]

## <a name="role-center"></a>Role

The role determines the home page, a starting screen that is designed for the needs of a specific role in an organization. Depending on your role, the home page, or Role Center, gives you an overview of the business, your department, or your personal tasks. It also helps you go to your daily tasks and find work that's assigned to you.

* At the top of your home page, you can switch between customers, vendors, items, and other important lists of information. Similarly, actions allow you to initiate tasks, such as creating a new sales invoice, directly from the home page.

* In the center, you find the **Activities** area, which shows current data and can be selected to view more detailed information. Key performance indicators (KPIs) can be set up to display a selected chart for a visual representation of, for example, cash flow or income and expenses. You can also build up a list of favorite customers on the home page for business accounts that you do business with often or need to pay special attention to.

### Change the role

The default role is **Business Manager**, but you can select another role to use a role center that fits your needs better.  

1. In the top right corner, choose the **Settings** icon ![Settings.](media/ui-experience/settings_icon_small.png "Settings icon for role center"), and then choose the **My Settings** action.
2. On the **My Settings** page, in the **Role** field, select the role that you want to use by default. For example, select **Accountant**.
3. Choose **OK**.

## <a name="company"></a>Company

A company functions as a container for data in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. There can be multiple companies in a database, but only one can be selected at a time. The default company is called CRONUS and contains demonstration data only.

The **Company** field shows the company you're currently working in, and you can use it to switch to another company. The company name is always displayed at the upper-left corner and works as an action that you can choose to go back to the Role Center.

> [!TIP]
> You can also change the company by using the company switcher (Crtl+O). For more information about about this feature and other ways to change company or environment, see [Switching to Another Company or Environment](ui-organization-switch.md).

The default company is called CRONUS and contains demonstration data only. You can create a new company with custom data. For more information, see [Creating New Companies](about-new-company.md).

<!--
### To change the company name

The company name is always displayed at the top left corner and works as an action that you can choose to go back to the Role Center. You can change this name on the **Company Information** page.

1. Choose the ![Sprocket icon to open the Settings menu.](media/ui-experience/settings_icon_small.png) icon, and then choose the **Company Information** action.
2. In the **Name** field, enter the new company name.
3. Leave the page. The system restarts and displays the new company in the top-left corner.

### <a name="badge"></a>To display a company badge for quick access to company information

You can add a customized badge in the top-right corner, which you can choose to quickly view company name and tenant information in a pop-up box. The company badge is also useful when [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is embedded in another application, like Microsoft Teams or in some other web application. In these cases, because the [!INCLUDE[web_client](includes/web_client.md)] displays less surrounding contextual information, the company badge serves as the only way to determine which company or environment a record belongs to.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Company Information**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Company Badge** FastTab, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)].

> [!NOTE]
> If a company badge is defined, then you cannot change the company name as described in [To change the company name](ui-change-basic-settings.md#to-change-the-company-name)-->

## <a name="work-date"></a>Work date

The most commonly used work date is today's date. You might have to temporarily change the work date to be able to perform tasks, such as completing transactions for a date that isn't today.

> [!TIP]  
> In all date fields, type **t** to quickly enter today's date, and type **w** to quickly enter the work date, which is the value in the **Work Date** field on the **My Settings** page.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> After you change the work date, if you sign out or switch to another company, the work data reverts to the default work date. So the next time you sign in or switch back to the original company, you may have to set the work date again.

### Work date indication

The work date is critical on pages that can be edited. Whenever the work date isn't set to today's date on an editable page, then two types of indicators appear on the page:

* A reminder appears at the top of the page that tells you what the work date is set to. The reminder provides a direct link to the work date setting on the **My Settings** page so you change the date if you want. From the reminder, you can also choose to dismiss the reminder for the rest of your session. Unless you change the work date to "today," the reminder will appear the next time you sign in.

* If you dismiss the reminder, the work date appears in the title of the page.  

If the work date isn't set to the current day (today), then on all pages where you can edit data, the current work date appears in the upper-left corner.

## <a name="region"></a> Region

The **Region** setting determines how dates, times, numbers, and currencies are shown or formatted. It also determines what character is used as the decimal separator when using a numeric keyboard to enter data. Learn more at [Entering Data](ui-enter-data.md#decimal).

## <a name="language"></a> Language

Changes the display language. This field appears only when there's more than one language to choose from.

When you sign up for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], your administrator or your browser settings determine the initial language. The language that you set is used on all devices that you sign in from, such as a phone or tablet.

You can install more languages for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] from AppSource. While all supported display languages are shown in the list, the administrator must install the relevant language app to the tenant before users can switch to the new language in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

> [!NOTE]
> On the **Allowed Languages** page, administrators can modify the list of languages that shows when people select their language and region. Administrators can show only the languages for which they know a language app is installed. Keeping the list of languages short and accurate makes it easier for people to choose a supported language. To learn more about allowed languages, go to [Specify the languages that are available in your Business Central environment](admin-allowed-languages.md).

## Time zone

Defines the time zone where you're located. When you first sign into [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the time zone is set based on your company's address. Change it if it doesn't fit your physical location.  

## Notifications

Choose the **Change when I receive notifications** link to manage the notifications that you get about certain events or status changes. For example, such as when you're about to invoice a customer who has an overdue balance, or the available inventory is lower than the quantity you're about to sell. Learn more at [Managing Notifications](ui-smart-notifications.md).

# Combine receipts on a single invoice

If you want to invoice more than one purchase receipt at a time, you can select multiple receipt lines on the purchase invoice.  

Before you can create a combined purchase receipt, more than one receipt from the same vendor in the same currency must be posted. In other words, you must have filled in two or more purchase orders and posted them as received, but not invoiced.  

When purchase receipts are combined on an invoice and posted, then a posted purchase invoice is created for the invoiced lines. The **Quantity Invoiced** field on the originating purchase order, or blanket purchase order, is updated based on the invoiced quantity. However, this original purchase document isn't deleted, even if it has been fully received and invoiced, and you must therefore delete the purchase document.  

> [!NOTE]
> The resulting purchase invoice cannot later be corrected or canceled. If you want to modify a purchase invoice that is created in this way, you must use purchase credit memos. For more information, see [Correct or Cancel Unpaid Purchase Invoices](purchasing-how-correct-cancel-unpaid-purchase-invoices.md).

## To combine receipts

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Invoices**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action. For more information, see [Record Purchases](purchasing-how-record-purchases.md).  
3. On the **Lines** FastTab, choose the **Get Receipt Lines** action.  
4. Select multiple receipt lines that you want to include in the invoice.  

    If an incorrect receipt line was selected or you want to start over, you can just delete the lines on the purchase invoice and then use the **Get Receipt Lines** function again.  
5. To post the invoice, choose the **Post** action.  

## To remove open purchase orders after combined receipt posting

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Delete Invoiced Purchase Orders**, and select the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)].
3. Choose the **OK** button.  

Alternatively, delete the individual orders manually.

Repeat steps 1 through 3 for any other affected documents, such as blanket purchase orders.

# Project Realization (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Project Realization** report shows how billing is performing against the costs.

The report compares the billable (invoiced price) value to the actual (total price) value, and highlights how much of each project was invoiced.

:::image type="content" source="media/projects/project-realization.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Project Realization Power BI Report" lightbox="media/projects/project-realization.png":::

## Use the report

Leadership and project managers use the report to identify which projects they need to invoice. CFOs also use this report.

CFOs can check which projects have low realization, and send invoices accordingly to ensure you meet monthly invoicing goals and have healthy turnover.

Project managers use this report to identify projects with completed work that isn't invoiced.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The *Project Realization* report includes the following KPIs:

- [**Actual (Total Price)**](projects-powerbi-kpis.md#actual-total-price)
- [**Billable (Invoiced Price)**](projects-powerbi-kpis.md#billable-invoiced-price)
- [**Realization %**](projects-powerbi-kpis.md#realization-)
- [**Realization Variance**](projects-powerbi-kpis.md#realization-variance)

# Analyzing sustainability entries with financial reports

The *financial reports* feature gives you insights into the financial data shown on your chart of accounts (COA). You can set up financial reports to analyze figures in general ledger (G/L) accounts, and compare general ledger entries with budget entries. But you can also analyze statistical and sustainability data with the same feature, and even combine all three types of data.  

## Prerequisites for financial reporting  

Setting up financial reports requires an understanding of the structure of the data you want to analyze. There are some key concepts that you likely need to pay attention to before you design your financial reports:

1. Related to the chart of accounts:

   1. Map G/L posting accounts to G/L account categories.
   2. Design how you use dimensions.
   3. Set up G/L budgets.  

2. Related to sustainability:

   1. Set up your sustainability accounts.
   2. Set up your carbon fees and CO2e in the **Emission Fees**.
   3. Design how you use dimensions.  

3. Related to the statistical accounts:

   1. Set up your statistical accounts.
   2. Design how you use dimensions.  

> [!NOTE]
> Financial reports doesn't work directly with CO2, CH4, or N2O emissions. Instead, it uses the CO2 equivalent model and that means you must first configure **CO2e** (carbon-dioxide equivalent) on the **Emission Fees** page.  

> [!NOTE]
> More details about using financial reports with financial data and chart of accounts can be found at [Prepare financial reporting with financial data and account categories](bi-how-work-account-schedule.md).

## Create a new financial report  

To quickly create your own financial reports, start by copying an existing one, as described in step 3 here:

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Financial Reports**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Financial Reports** page, choose the **New** action to create a new financial report name.  
3. Fill in the report short name in **Name** field (you can't change the name later) and enter a **Description**.  
4. Choose a row definition and a column definition.
5. Choose the **Edit Report Definition** action to access more properties on the financial report.  
6. On the **Options** FastTab, you can edit the report description, change the row and column definitions, and define how to show dates. Dates can be a Day/Week/Month/Quarter/Year hierarchy, or use accounting periods. To learn more, go to [Comparing accounting periods using period formulas](bi-column-definitions.md#comparing-accounting-periods-using-period-formulas).
7. On the **Dimensions** FastTab, you can define dimension filters for the report.  
8. You can preview the report in the area below the **Dimensions** FastTab.

If you want to analyze your sustainability or statistical data, you can achieve this by setting up the **Row Definition**.  

To create or edit a row definition, follow these steps:

1. On the **Financial Reports** page, select the relevant financial report, and then choose the **Edit Row Definition** action.
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  

> [!NOTE]
> The **Row No.** field shows the first 10 characters of an identifier, such as an account number. If you add elements with identifiers that start with the same 10 characters, you'll have duplicates in the **Row No.** field. If needed, you can manually edit the identifiers after you insert the elements. The full identifiers are displayed in the **Totaling** field.

> [!NOTE]
> You can combine all **Totaling Types**, that is, Posting accounts, Sust. Accounts, and Statistical Account.

> [!NOTE]
> Row definitions aren't versioned. When you change a row definition, the old version is replaced and your changes will be saved to the database.

### Analyzing sustainability data  

1. Enter the **Row No.** to identify your row and add **Description** as a text that will appear on the financial report line.
2. In the **Totaling Type** column, choose the **Sust. Accounts** option.
3. In the **Totaling** field, choose one or more sustainability accounts using all applicable filters.
4. In the **Amount Type** choose one of the options:
   1. Choose **CO2e** if you want to report CO2 equivalent value from the **CO2e Emission** field in the **Sustainability Ledger Entries**.
   2. Choose **Carbon Fee** if you want to report financial equivalent (carbon fee) from the **Carbon Fee** field on the **Sustainability Ledger Entries**.

5. If you choose **Formula** as a **Totaling Type**, you can use mathematical formulas in the **Totaling** column.  

### Analyzing statistical data

1. Enter the **Row No.** to identify your row and add **Description** as a text that will appear on the financial report line.
2. In the **Totaling Type** column, choose the **Statistical Accounts** option.
3. In the **Totaling** field, choose one or more sustainability accounts using all applicable filters.
4. If you choose **Formula** as a **Totaling Type**, you can use mathematical formulas in the **Totaling** column.

# Set up posting groups

Posting groups map entities to general ledger accounts. Examples of entities are customers, vendors, items, resources, and sales and purchase documents. Posting groups save time and help avoid mistakes when you post transactions. The transaction values go to the accounts specified in the posting group for that particular entity. The only requirement is that you have a chart of accounts. For more information, see [Set Up the Chart of Accounts](finance-setup-chart-accounts.md).  

Posting groups are covered under three umbrellas:  

* General

  Define who you sell to and buy from, and what you sell and what you buy. You can also combine groups to specify things like the income statement accounts to post to, or use groups to filter reports.  
* Specific

  Use sales documents, for example, instead of posting directly to the general ledger. When you create entries in the customer ledger, corresponding entries are made in the general ledger.  
* Tax

  Define the tax percentages and calculation types that apply to who you sell to and buy from, and what you sell and what you buy.

The following sections describe the posting groups under each umbrella.  

## General posting groups

The following table describes the general posting groups.

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| General Business Posting Groups |Assign this group to customers and vendors to specify who you sell to, and who you buy from. Set up these posting groups on the **Gen. Business Posting Groups** page. When you do, think about how many groups you need to break down sales and purchases. For example, group customers and vendors by geographical area, or by the type of business. |
| General Product Posting Groups |Assign this group to items and resources to specify what you sell, and what you buy. Set up these posting groups on the **Gen. Product Posting Groups** page. When you do, consider the number of groups you need to break down sales by product (items and resources) and purchases by items. For example, divide these groups by raw materials, retail, resources, capacity, and so on. |
| General Posting Setups |Combine business and product posting groups and choose the accounts to post to. For each combination of business and product posting groups, you can assign a set of general ledger accounts. For example, you can post the sale of the same item to different general ledger accounts because customers are assigned to different business posting groups. Set these configurations up on the **General Posting Setup** page. |

## Specific posting groups

The following table describes the posting groups that are specific to types of data.

|Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Customer Posting Groups |Define the accounts to use when you post accounts receivable transactions. If you use inventory with receivables, the accounts that the sales order lines post to are determined by the general business posting group assigned to your customer, and the general product posting group assigned to the inventory item. See *General Business Posting Groups* and *General Product Posting Groups* in the [General posting groups](#general-posting-groups) section. Set up these posting groups on the **Customer Posting Groups** page. |
| Vendor Posting Groups |Define where to post transactions for payables accounts, service charge accounts, and payment discount accounts. This is similar to customer posting groups. Set up these posting groups on the **Vendor Posting Groups** page. |
| Inventory Posting Groups |Define inventory posting groups that you then assign to the relevant item accounts on the **Inventory Posting Setup** page. This way, when you post entries concerning an item, the system posts to the G/L account that is set up for the combination of inventory posting group and location that is linked to the item. Inventory posting groups also provide a good way to organize your inventory, so you can separate items by their posting group when you generate reports. Set up these posting groups on the **Inventory Posting Groups** page. |
| Bank Account Posting Groups |Define the general ledger accounts that bank account entries are posted to. For example, this can simplify the processes of tracing transactions and reconciling bank accounts. Set up these posting groups on the **Bank Account Posting Groups** page. We recommend that these G/L accounts have the **Direct Posting** field set to *No*. |
| Fixed Assets Posting Groups |Define accounts for different types of expenses and costs, such as acquisition costs, accumulated depreciation amounts, acquisition costs on disposal, accumulated depreciation on disposal, gains on disposal, losses on disposal, maintenance expenses, and depreciation expenses. Set up these posting groups on the **FA Posting Groups** page. |

### Allow substitute customer or vendor posting groups on documents

You can let people choose other customer and vendor posting groups than the default groups when they're working with sales or purchase documents and journals.

To allow changes to customer posting groups, choose **Allow Multiple Posting Groups** on the **Sales & Receivable Setup** and **Service Mgt. Setup** pages, and the **Purchase & Payables Setup** page for vendor posting group changes.

On the **Customer Posting Groups** or **Vendor Posting Groups** pages, you can specify the posting groups to allow as substitutes by choosing **Substitutions**. Substitute posting groups can replace the default customer or vendor posting groups specified for a customer or vendor.

After you set this up, you can choose from the allowed substitute posting groups and change the customer or vendor posting group when posting sales or purchase documents and journals. The substitute customer or vendor posting groups are copied to posted documents and journals, and payable or receivable G/L entries are posted to the G/L accounts specified for the substitutes.

When applying, for example, an invoice and payment that are posted with different customer or vendor posting groups (different G/L accounts), [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] transfers the amounts between the G/L accounts to balance them.

## Tax posting groups

The following table describes the tax-related posting groups.

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Tax Business Posting Groups |Determine how to calculate and post sales tax for customers and vendors. Set up these posting groups on the **Tax Business Posting Groups** page. When you do, think about how many groups you need. For example, it might depend on factors like local legislation, and whether you trade both domestically and internationally. |
| Tax Product Posting Groups |Indicate the tax calculations needed for the types of items or resources you buy or sell. |
| Tax Posting Setup |Combine tax business posting groups and tax product posting groups. When you fill in a general journal line, purchase line, or sales line, we look at the combination to identify the accounts to use. |

If your country/region uses value-added tax (VAT), see [Set Up Calculations and Posting Methods for Value-Added Tax](finance-setup-vat.md).  

## Example of linking posting groups

Here's a scenario.  

These posting groups are chosen on the customer card:  

* General business posting group
* Customer posting group  

These posting groups are chosen on the item card:  

* General product posting group  
* Inventory posting group  

When you create a sales document, the sales header uses the customer card information, and the sales lines use the item card information.  

* The revenue posting (income statement) is determined by the combination of the general business posting group and the general product posting group.  
* The accounts receivable posting (balance sheet) is determined by the customer posting group.  
* The inventory posting (balance sheet) is determined by the inventory posting group.  
* The cost of goods sold posting (income statement) is determined by the combination of general business posting group and general product posting group.  

Your setup determines when posting happens. For example, the timing is affected by when you do periodic activities, such as posting inventory cost or adjusting cost item entries.

## Copy posting setup lines

The more product and business posting groups you have, the more lines you'll have on the **General Posting Setup** page. While there might be many different combinations of business and product posting groups, different combinations might still post to the same general ledger accounts. To limit the amount of manual entry, copy the general ledger accounts from an existing line on the **General Posting Setup** page.

## Set up posting groups on the go

To get users started faster, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can show notifications of missing G/L accounts in various posting group setups. To get these notifications, make sure that the **G/L Account is missing in posting group or setup** notification is selected in the **My Notifications** page, which you can access from the **Change when I receive notifications** field in the **My Settings** page.  

This way, when you work on a document that uses a posting group or a setup that is missing a required general ledger account, you get a notification. Choose the link in the notification to open a page where you can make the relevant changes, provided you have permission to do so.  

> [!NOTE]
> In order to take you directly to the posting group or setup that is missing a general ledger account, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will create a placeholder posting group or setup. Posting groups and setups are a way for the accountant to control how entries are posted to the general ledger, so such the just-in-time creation of posting groups and setups might not be allowed in your organization.  
>
> In that case, disable the *G/L Account is missing in posting group or setup* notification, and then work with your accountant to make the relevant changes to the posting group, setup, or your document. This is an important step, because after documents are posted, you can't delete incorrectly used posting groups or setups because general ledger entries are created for them.

Use the **Blocked** field in the **General Posting Setup** page to prevent users from mistakenly using a setup that is no longer relevant for new postings. 

## Access all fields and accounts when you set up a posting group  

Posting groups can be complex to set up. Because some types of accounts aren't frequently used, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't show them as columns on the lines. Also, to make it a bit easier to choose the right accounts, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] filters the accounts that you can choose in field lookups. 

If you want to access all accounts on the lines and in the field lookups, there are a couple of settings that can help:

* To show all accounts as columns on the lines, turn on the **Show All Accounts** toggle.
* On individual lines, to access all accounts in the field lookups, choose the **View All Accounts on Lookup** checkbox.

> [!NOTE]
> The **Show All Accounts** toggle might not seem to work on the **General Posting Setup** page. That's because [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] always shows all accounts as columns on the lines on that page.

## Troubleshooting posting group errors

Posting groups are one of the more advanced concepts to set up in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. If they aren't set up correctly, errors can occur when posting documents or journal lines. For example, these errors are typically caused by a mistake in how general ledger accounts are assigned, or how posting groups are combined.

When something is wrong, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will display the **Error Messages** page. The **Error Messages** page can make it easier to identify and resolve the issue. The page offers a description of the error that points out the posting group setup that needs attention. For example, the message might read "Sales Prepayment account is missing a General Posting Setup." There's also a link to open the page that's the source of the issue, so you can quickly resolve it.  

> [!NOTE]
> The error handling described above is not available on item, resource, employee, and fixed asset journals, or for G/L accounts added in local versions of posting groups.

## Audit changes to posting groups

You can use the Change Log feature to capture changes users make to your posting group setup. [!INCLUDE [include-audit-what-who-when](includes/include-audit-what-who-when.md)]

The following table lists the table for posting group and their IDs.

| Table | Table ID |
| ----- | -------- |
| Gen. Product Posting Group | 251 |
| Customer Posting Group | 92 |
| Inventory Posting Group | 94 |
| FA Posting Group | 5606 |
| Vendor Posting Group | 93 |

# The QuickBooks Online Data Migration Extension

This extension is included in the **Data Migration** assisted setup guide to help you migrate important business data from QuickBooks Online to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For example, this is useful when your business is growing, and you've decided to upgrade your business management app by starting to use [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## What data can I import from QuickBooks Online?

You can import the following data from QuickBooks Online to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]:  

* Customers
* Vendors
* Items
* Chart of accounts
* Beginning balance transaction in the general ledger
* On-hand quantities for inventory items
* Open documents for customers and vendors, such as invoices, credit memos, and payments

We migrate only full amounts on sales and purchase documents. We do not update partially paid amounts. For example, if a customer has paid 300 of a total of 500 dollars on a sales invoice, we migrate the full 500. If you have received partial payments, you must update these manually, either before or after you migrate data. We recommend that you apply outstanding transactions before you migrate, just to make things easier afterward.

> [!NOTE]  
> We do not migrate purchase orders or sales orders.

## Before you start

An important part of the migration process is to specify the accounts to migrate transactions to. It's a good idea to plan this mapping before you migrate data. For example, the accounts where you post transactions for:  

* The sale of items or services to customers.
* The purchase of items or services from vendors.  
* Adjustments in the general ledger.  

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] requires that general ledger accounts have account numbers assigned to them. Make sure that account numbers are assigned to your accounts in QuickBooks Online.

If transactions in QuickBooks Online have tax amounts, you must set up a tax account for your tax jurisdictions in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] before you can post transactions.

## How do I start using the extension?

Getting started is easy. All you need to do is run the **Data Migration** assisted setup guide. Here's how:

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Assisted Setup**, and then choose **Migrate business data**.
2. Follow the instructions on each step in the assisted setup guide.

## What do I do after I migrate data?

After you migrate data, transactions have the status **Unposted**, so you can review them and make adjustments. To review the transactions, go to the page where you would normally find them. For example, to review unposted sales invoices, go to the **Sales Invoices** page. To review payment journals, go to the **Payment Journals** page.  

There are a few things in particular that you should do:

* If the transactions in QuickBooks Online had markup or discount amounts, you must manually add the amounts to the related transactions in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] before you post them.
* If you are using value added tax (VAT), you may need to add a business posting group and a product posting group to the posting setup so that you can post VAT amounts.
* Verify the beginning balances for accounts in the general ledger. QuickBooks Online does not store the current balance for all accounts, so you might need to correct beginning balances.

# Design Details: Central Concepts of the Planning System

The planning functions are contained in a batch project that first selects the relevant items and period to plan for. Then, according to each item's low-level code (BOM position), the batch job calls a code unit that calculates a supply plan. The code unit balances supply-demand sets and suggests actions for the user to take. The suggested actions appear as lines in the planning worksheet or the requisition worksheet.  

![Contents of the Planning Worksheets page.](media/design_details_central_concepts_of_the_planning_system_planning_worksheets.png "Contents of the Planning Worksheets page")  

The planner of a company, such as a purchaser or a production planner, is presumed to be the user of the planning system. The planning system assists the user by performing the extensive but rather straightforward calculations of a plan. The user can then concentrate on solving the more difficult problems, such as when things differ from normal.  

The planning system is driven by anticipated and actual customer demand, such as forecast and sales orders. Planning calculations suggest actions you can take regarding supply from vendors, assembly or production, or transfers from other warehouses. An example of a suggested action could be to create new supply orders, such as purchase or production orders. If supply orders already exist, the suggested actions could be to increase or expedite orders to meet changes in demand.  

Another goal of the planning system is to ensure that the inventory does not grow unnecessarily. If demand decreases, the planning system will suggest that the user postpones, decreases quantity, or cancels existing supply orders.  

A code unit contains the planning logic and the following functions:

* MRP and MPS
* Calculate Net Change Plan
* Calculate Regenerative Plan

However, the supply plan calculation involves different sub-systems.  

The planning system doesn't include dedicated logic for capacity leveling or fine scheduling. Those types of scheduling work are done separately. The lack of direct integration between the two areas also means that substantial capacity or schedule changes will require you to rerun planning.  

## Planning parameters

The planning parameters that you set for an item or a group of items control which actions the planning system will suggest in various situations. Define planning parameters for each item to control when, how much, and how to replenish.  

You can also define planning parameters for any combination of item, variant, and location by setting up a stock-keeping unit (SKU) for each combination, and then specifying individual parameters. Learn more at [Design Details: Handling Reordering Policies](design-details-handling-reordering-policies.md) and [Design Details: Planning Parameters](design-details-planning-parameters.md).  

## Planning starting date

The planning system helps you avoid having open orders in the past and suggested actions that aren't possible. Planning treats all dates before the starting date as a frozen zone. The following rule applies to the frozen zone:  

* All supply and demand before the starting date of the planning period is considered part of inventory or shipped. In other words, it assumes that the plan for the past runs according to the given plan. Learn more at [Process orders before the planning start date](design-details-balancing-demand-and-supply.md#process-orders-before-the-planning-start-date).  

## Dynamic order tracking (pegging)

Dynamic order tracking and its simultaneous creation of action messages in the planning worksheet isn't a part of the supply planning system. When a demand or supply is created or changed, dynamic order tracking links the demand and the quantities to cover it in real time.  

For example, if you enter or change a sales order, dynamic order tracking instantly searches for supply to cover the demand. The supply could be from inventory or from an expected supply order (such as a purchase order or a production order). When it finds a supply source, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] links the demand and supply. You access the link on view-only pages from the document lines. When supply can't be found, the dynamic order tracking system creates action messages in the planning worksheet with supply plan suggestions.  

Dynamic order tracking helps you assess whether to accept supply order suggestions. From the supply side, it shows the demand that created the supply. From the demand side, it identifies the supply that should cover the demand.  

:::image type="content" source="media/nav_app_supply_planning_1_dynamic_order_tracking.png" alt-text="Example of dynamic order tracking.":::

Learn more at [Design Details: Reservation, Order Tracking, and Action Messaging](design-details-reservation-order-tracking-and-action-messaging.md).  

In companies with a low item flow and less advanced product structures, it might be enough to use dynamic order tracking for supply planning. However, in busier environments, the planning system should be used to ensure a properly balanced supply plan.  

### Dynamic order tracking versus the planning system

It might be hard to differentiate between the planning system and dynamic order tracking. Both features display output in the planning worksheet by suggesting actions that the planner should take. However, the way this output is produced differs.  

The planning system deals with the entire supply and demand pattern of an item. It considers all levels of the BOM hierarchy along the timeline. Dynamic order tracking only addresses the situation of the order that activated it. When balancing demand and supply, the planning system creates links in a user-activated batch mode. Dynamic order tracking creates the links automatically when you enter a demand or a supply. For example, when you create a sales or purchase order.  

Dynamic order tracking links demand and supply on a first-come-first-served basis when you enter data. This basis can lead to disorder in priorities. For example, a sales order entered first with a due date next month might be linked to the supply in inventory. The next sales order due tomorrow may cause an action message to create a new purchase order to cover it. The following image shows this scenario.  

:::image type="content" source="media/nav_app_supply_planning_1_dynamic_order_tracking_graph.png" alt-text="Example of order tracking in supply planning 1.":::

The planning system deals with demand and supply for items in a prioritized order. The order is prioritized according to due dates and order types. That is, on a first-needed-first-served basis. It deletes all order tracking links that were created dynamically and re-establishes them according to due date priority. When the planning system has run, it has solved all imbalances between demand and supply, as illustrated below for the same data.

:::image type="content" source="media/nav_app_supply_planning_1_planning_graph.png" alt-text="Example of order tracking in supply planning 2.":::  

After you run planning, the Action Message Entry table doesn't contain any action messages. Those messages are replaced by the actions suggested in the planning worksheet. Learn more at [Order Tracking Links during Planning](design-details-balancing-demand-and-supply.md#serial-and-lot-numbers-are-loaded-by-specification-level).  

## Sequence and priority in planning

The sequence of the calculations in your plan is important for getting the project done in a reasonable amount of time. The prioritization of requirements and resources also plays an important role in getting the best results.  

The planning system is demand-driven. High-level items should be planned before low-level items because they might generate demand for lower-level items. For example, plan retail locations before distribution centers because the retail location might include demand from the distribution center. On a detailed balancing level, if a released supply order can cover a sales order the system shouldn't create a new supply order. A supply with a specific lot number shouldn't be allocated to cover a generic demand if another demand requires this specific lot.  

### Item priority / low-level code

In a manufacturing environment, the demand for a finished, sellable item will result in derived demand for components that comprise the finished item. The bill-of-material structure controls the component structure and can cover several levels of semi-finished items. Planning an item at one level will cause derived demand for components at the next level. This hierarchy will eventually result in derived demand for purchased items. The planning system plans for items in order of their ranking in the total BOM hierarchy. The system starts with finished sellable items at the top level and continues down the product structure to the lower-level items (according to the low-level code).  

The following image shows the sequence in which [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] suggests supply orders at the top level. It assumes the suggestions were accepted and shows lower-level items as well.

:::image type="content" source="media/nav_app_supply_planning_1_bom_planning.png" alt-text="Planning for bills of material.":::

To learn more about manufacturing considerations, go to [Load inventory profiles](design-details-balancing-demand-and-supply.md#load-inventory-profiles).  

#### Optimizing performance for low-level calculations

Low-level code calculations can affect system performance. To reduce the effect, you can turn off the **Dynamic low-level code calculation** toggle on the **Manufacturing Setup** page. When you do, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] suggests that you create a recurrent job queue entry to update low-level codes daily. You can ensure that the job will run outside working hours by specifying a start time in the **Earliest Start Date/Time** field.

You can also speed up low-level code calculations by turning on the **Optimize low-level code calculation** toggle on the **Manufacturing Setup** page.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you choose to optimize performance, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will use new calculation methods to determine low-level codes. If you have an extension that relies on the events used by the old calculations, the extension might stop working.

### Locations / transfer-level priority

Companies with more than one location might need to plan for each location individually. For example, an item's safety stock level and its reordering policy might differ from one location to another. You must specify the planning parameters per item and location.  

You can use SKUs to specify individual planning parameters. An SKU can be regarded as an item at a specific location. If you haven't defined a SKU for that location, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will use the parameters set on the item card. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates a plan for active locations only, where there's demand or supply for a given item.  

Any item can be handled at any location, but [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] has a strict approach to the concept of locations. For example, a sales order for an item at one location can't be fulfilled by stock from another location. The quantity on stock must first be transferred to the location specified on the sales order.

:::image type="content" source="media/nav_app_supply_planning_1_sku_planning.png" alt-text="Planning for stock-keeping units.":::

Learn more at [Design Details: Transfers in Planning](design-details-transfers-in-planning.md).  

### Order priority

Within a given SKU, the requested or available date represents the highest priority; the demand of today should be dealt with before the demand of the coming days. But apart from this kind of priority, the different demand and supply types are sorted according to business importance to decide which demand should be satisfied first. On the supply side, the order priority determines the source of supply to apply first. Learn more at [Prioritize orders](design-details-balancing-demand-and-supply.md#prioritize-orders).  

## Demand forecasts and blanket orders

Forecasts and blanket orders both represent anticipated demand. The blanket order, which covers a customer's intended purchases over a specific period of time, acts to lessen the uncertainty of the overall forecast. The blanket order is a customer-specific forecast on top of the unspecified forecast, as illustrated in the following image.  

:::image type="content" source="media/nav_app_supply_planning_1_forecast_and_blanket.png" alt-text="Planning with forecasts.":::

Learn more at [Forecast Demand is Reduced by Sales Orders](design-details-balancing-demand-and-supply.md#forecast-demand-is-reduced-by-sales-orders).  

## Planning assignment

All items should be replanned for when the demand or supply pattern has changed since the last time a plan was calculated. For example, if you enter a new sales order or change an existing one, recalculate the plan. Other reasons for replanning include a change in forecast or safety stock quantity. Changing a bill-of-material by adding or removing a component would most likely also indicate a change, but for the component item only.  

The planning system monitors such events and assigns the appropriate items for planning.  

For multiple locations, the assignment happens at the item level per location combination. If a sales order has been created at only one location, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] assigns the item at that location for planning.  

The reason for selecting items for planning is a matter of system performance. If an item's demand-supply pattern hasn't changed, the planning system won't suggest any actions to take. Without the planning assignment, the system would have to perform the calculations for all items to find out what to plan for. To learn more about the reasons to assign items for planning, go to [Design Details: Planning Assignment Table](design-details-planning-assignment-table.md).  

The following are the planning options that are available:  

* **Calculate Regenerative Plan** calculates all selected items, whether it's necessary or not.  
* **Calculate Net Change Plan** calculates only the items that have had a change in their demand and supply pattern and, therefore, have been assigned for planning.  

Some people believe that net change planning should be performed on the fly, for example, when sales orders are entered. However, planning on the fly could be confusing because dynamic order tracking and action messaging are also calculated on the fly. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers real-time available-to-promise control. It provides pop–up warnings when you enter sales orders and the current supply plan can't fulfill the demand.  

The planning system only plans for the items that you've prepared with appropriate planning parameters. Otherwise, it assumes that you'll plan the items manually or semi-automatically by using the Order Planning feature. To learn more about the automatic planning procedures, go to [Design Details: Balancing Demand and Supply](design-details-balancing-demand-and-supply.md).  

## Item dimensions

Demand and supply can carry variant codes and location codes that must be respected when the planning system balances demand and supply.  

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] treats variant and location codes as item dimensions on a sales order line, inventory ledger entry, and so on. Accordingly, it calculates a plan for each combination of variant and location as if the combination were a separate item number.  

Instead of calculating theoretical combinations of variant and location, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates only the combinations that actually exist in the database. To learn more about how the planning system deals with location codes on demand, go to [Design Details: Demand at Blank Location](design-details-balancing-demand-and-supply.md).  

## Item attributes

Items often have general attributes, such as an item number, variant code, location code, and type of order. However, each demand and supply event can have other specifications, such as serial or lot numbers. The planning system plans these attributes in certain ways depending on their level of specification.  

An order-to-order link between demand and supply is another type of attribute that affects the planning system. Learn more at [Order-to-order links](#order-to-order-links).

### Specific attributes

Some demand attributes are specific and a supply must match them exactly.

* Serial or lot numbers that require specific application (These attributes are required if you turn on the **SN Specific Tracking** or **Lot Specific Tracking** toggle on the **Item Tracking Code Card** page for the item tracking code that is used by the item.)  
* Links to supply orders created manually or automatically for a specific demand (order-to-order links).  

The planning system applies the following rules to these attributes:  

* Demand with specific attributes can only be fulfilled by supply with matching attributes.  
* Supply with specific attributes can also satisfy demand that doesn't specifically require those attributes.  

If inventory or projected supplies can't meet a demand for specific attributes, the planning system suggests a new supply order without regarding planning parameters.  

### Non-specific attributes

Serial or lot-numbered items without a specific item tracking setup might have non-specific serial or lot numbers. These types of numbers can be applied to any serial or lot number. The planning system has more freedom to match, for example, a serialized demand with a serialized supply, typically in inventory.  

Demand-supply with serial or lot numbers, specific or non-specific, are high priority and are exempt from the frozen zone. They'll be part of planning even if they're due before the planning starting date. Learn more at [Serial and lot numbers are loaded by specification level](design-details-balancing-demand-and-supply.md#serial-and-lot-numbers-are-loaded-by-specification-level).

To learn more about how the planning system balances attributes, go to [Serial and lot numbers and order-to-order links are exempt from the previous period](design-details-balancing-demand-and-supply.md#serial-and-lot-numbers-and-order-to-order-links-are-exempt-from-the-previous-period).  

## Order-to-order links

Order-to-order means that you purchase, assemble, or produce an item for a specific demand. There are several reasons to choose this policy:

* The demand is infrequent.
* The lead-time is insignificant.
* The required attributes vary.  

Another case that uses order-to-order links is when an assembly order is linked to a sales order in an assemble-to-order scenario.  

Order-to-order links are applied between demand and supply in four ways:  

* When the planned item uses the **Order** reordering policy  
* When you use the make-to-order manufacturing policy to create multi-level or project-type production orders (producing components on the same production order)  
* When you create production orders for sales orders with the sales order planning feature  
* When you assemble an item to a sales order (**Assembly Policy** is set to **Assemble-to-Order**)  

The planning system suggests that you only order the required quantity. The purchase, production, or assembly order continues to match the demand. For example, if a sales order is changed in time or quantity, the planning system suggests that you change the supply order accordingly.  

When order-to-order links exist, the planning system doesn't involve linked supply or inventory in the balancing procedure. Planners can decide whether to use the linked supply or a new demand. In the latter case, they can delete the supply order or manually reserve the linked supply.  

Reservations and order tracking links break if a situation becomes impossible. For example, when moving the demand to a date that's earlier than the supply. Order-to-order links adapt to changes in the demand or supply and never break.  

## Reservations

The planning system doesn't include reserved quantities in calculations. For example, if a quantity for a sales order is fully or partially reserved, you can't use the quantity to cover other demand.

The planning system does include reserved quantities in the projected inventory profile. It must consider all quantities to determine when the reorder point has passed and how many to reorder to reach the maximum inventory level. Unnecessary reservations can increase the risk that inventory levels run low because the planning logic doesn't detect reserved quantities.  

The following image shows how reservations can hinder planning.

## Warnings

The first column in the planning worksheet is for the warning fields. A warning icon displays when you create a planning line for an unusual situation.  

Supply on planning lines with warnings typically won't be modified according to planning parameters. Instead, the planning system suggests a supply to cover the exact quantity of the demand. However, the system can be set up to respect planning parameters for planning lines with certain warnings. The warning information is shown on the **Untracked Planning Elements** page, which also shows order tracking links to non-order network entities. There are three types of warnings:  

* Emergency  
* Exception  
* Attention  

:::image type="content" source="media/nav_app_supply_planning_1_warnings.png" alt-text="Warnings in the planning worksheet.":::

### Emergency

The emergency warning displays in two situations:  

* When the inventory is negative on the planning starting date  
* When back-dated supply or demand events exist  

If an item's inventory is negative on the planning starting date, the planning system suggests an emergency supply for the negative quantity to arrive on the planning starting date. The warning text states the starting date and the quantity of the emergency order. Learn more at [Handling Projected Negative Inventory](design-details-handling-reordering-policies.md#handling-projected-negative-inventory).  

Document lines with due dates before the planning starting date are consolidated into an emergency supply order. The order is planned to arrive on the planning starting date.  

### Exception

The exception warning is displayed if the projected available inventory drops below the safety stock quantity. The planning system will suggest a supply order to meet the demand on its due date. The warning text states the item's safety stock quantity and the date on which it is violated.  

Violating the safety stock level is an exception. It shouldn't happen if the reorder point is set correctly. Learn more at [The Role of the Reorder Point](design-details-handling-reordering-policies.md#the-role-of-the-reorder-point).  

Exception order proposals help ensure that the projected available inventory is never lower than the safety stock level. The proposed quantity covers the safety stock, without considering planning parameters. However, in some scenarios, order modifiers will be considered.  

> [!NOTE]  
> The planning system may have consumed the safety stock intentionally and will then replenish it straight away. Learn more at [Consume safety stock](design-details-balancing-demand-and-supply.md#consume-safety-stock).

### Attention

The attention warning is displayed in three situations:  

* The planning starting date is earlier than the work date.  
* The planning line suggests changing a released purchase or production order.  
* The projected inventory exceeds the overflow level on the due date. Learn more at [Stay below the overflow level](design-details-handling-reordering-policies.md#stay-below-the-overflow-level).  

> [!NOTE]  
> In planning lines with warnings, the **Accept Action Message** field is not selected because the planner is expected to investigate the lines before carrying out the plan.  

## Error logs

On the **Calculate Plan** request page, you can select the **Stop and Show First Error** field to have the planning run stop when it encounters the first error. A message is displayed with information about the error. If an error exists, the planning worksheet will show only the planning lines that were successfully made before the error happened.  

If the field isn't selected, the **Calculate Plan** batch job will continue until it has completed. Errors won't interrupt the batch job. If there are errors, a message states how many items were affected. The **Planning Error Log** page provides more details about the error and links to the affected documents or setups.  

:::image type="content" source="media/nav_app_supply_planning_1_error_log.png" alt-text="Error messages in the planning worksheet.":::

## Planning flexibility

It isn't always practical to plan an existing supply order. For example, when production has started or you hire extra people on a specific day to do the project. To indicate whether the planning system can change an order, all supply order lines have a **Planning Flexibility** field with two options: **Unlimited** or **None**. If the field is set to **None**, the planning system won't try to change the supply order line.  

You can manually choose an option in the field, however, in some cases it'll be set automatically by [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The fact that you can manually set planning flexibility is important because it makes it easy to adapt the use of the feature to different workflows and business cases. To learn more about how this field is used, go to [Design Details: Transfers in Planning](design-details-transfers-in-planning.md).  

## Order planning

The basic supply planning tool represented by the **Order Planning** page is designed for manual decision making. It doesn't consider any planning parameters and is therefore not discussed further in this article. Learn more at [Plan for New Demand Order by Order](production-how-to-plan-for-new-demand.md).  

> [!NOTE]  
> We recommend that you don't use order planning if your company already uses the planning or requisition worksheets. Supply orders created through the **Order Planning** page may be changed or deleted during the automated planning runs. These changes happen because the automated planning run uses planning parameters that you might not have considered when you manually made the plan in the Order Planning page.  

## Finite loading

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides a rough-cut schedule to plan reasonable use of resources. It doesn't automatically create and maintain detailed schedules based on priorities or optimization rules.  

The intended use of the capacity-constrained resource feature is as follows:

* To avoid overloading resources
* To ensure that capacity isn't left unallocated if it could decrease the turn-around time of a production order

When planning with capacity-constrained resources, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] ensures that resources aren't loaded above their capacity (critical load). It assigns each operation to the nearest available time slot. If the time slot isn't large enough to complete the operation, it splits the operation into two or more parts in the nearest available time slots.  

> [!NOTE]  
> In case of operation splitting, the set-up time is only assigned one time because it's assumed that some manual adjustment is done to optimize the schedule.  

You can add dampener time to resources to minimize operation splitting. This time lets [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] schedule the load on the last possible day by slightly exceeding the critical load percent.

# Set Up Service Offerings
When you set up service management, you must decide what services to offer customers and the schedule for those services. A service is a type of work performed by one or more resources and provided to a customer. For example, a service could be a type of computer repair. A service item is the equipment or item that needs servicing, for example, the computer that needs repair, installed at a specific customer. You can set up services as part of a group of related repair or maintenance items.

# Defining and allocating costs

Cost allocations move costs and revenues between cost types, cost centers, and cost objects. You can define as many allocations as you need. Each allocation consists of:  

- An allocation source.  
- One or more allocation targets.  

The allocation source establishes which costs must be allocated, and the allocation targets determine where the costs must be allocated. For example, an allocation source can be the costs for the Electricity and Heating cost type. You allocate all electricity and heating costs to three cost centers: Workshop, Production, and Sales. These cost centers are your allocation targets.  

For each allocation source, you define an allocation level, a validity period, and a variant as grouping identifier. You can use a batch job to set filters to select allocation definitions and then run cost allocations automatically.  

For each allocation target, you define an allocation base. The allocation base can be either static or dynamic.  

- Static allocation bases are based on a definite value, such as square footage or an established allocation ratio, such as 5:2:4.  
- Dynamic allocation bases depend on changeable values, such as the number of employees in a cost center or sales revenue of a cost object throughout a certain time period.  

The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the articles that describe them.

## Set up allocation source and targets

Each allocation consists of an allocation source and one or more allocation targets. The allocation source defines which costs will be allocated. The allocation targets determine where the costs will be allocated.  

### To set up cost allocations

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Cost Allocation**, and then chose the related link.  
2. On the **Cost Allocation** page, choose the **Edit** action.  
3. Enter an ID for the allocation source in the **ID** field.  
4. Define a level as a number between 1 and 99 in the **Level** field. The allocation posting will follow the order of the levels.  
5. Enter a cost type to define which cost types will be allocated in the **Cost Type Range** field. If all costs for a cost type are allocated, no range is defined.  
6. Enter a cost center together with costs to be allocated in the **Cost Center Code** field.  
7. Enter a cost object together with costs to be allocated in the **Cost Object Code** field. Most often, this field stays empty, because cost objects are rarely allocated to other cost objects.  
8. Enter a cost type in the **Credit to Cost Type** field. The costs that are allocated will be credited to the source cost type. The credit posting will be posted to the cost type given here.  
9. On the **Lines** FastTab, define the allocation targets. On the first line, enter a cost type in the **Target Cost Type** field. It defines which cost type the allocation is debited to.  
10. On the first line, enter the first allocation target in the **Target Cost Center** field or **Target Cost Object** the field. These two fields define which cost center or cost object the allocation is debited to. You can only fill in one of these fields, but not both.  
11. Repeat the same steps on the second line to set up additional allocation targets.  
12. After you have set up the allocation target and sources, choose the **Calculate Allocation Key** action to calculate the total share values.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Select the **Blocked** check box to deactivate the allocation setup.

## To set filters for dynamic allocation bases

The dynamic allocation method is based on changeable values. For example, the number of employees in a cost center or the items sold of a cost object in a specific time period. There are nine pre-defined allocation bases and twelve dynamic date ranges. You set different filters based on the allocation base.  

### Set filters

The following table shows which filters are possible for different allocation bases and which values are valid in the **No. Filter** and **Group Filter** fields. Select <kbd>F1</kbd> in the **Date Filter Code** field to read detailed descriptions.  

|**Base**|**No. Filter**|**Date Filter Code**|**Cost Center Filter**|**Cost Object Filter**|**Group Filter**|  
|--------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|  
|G/L Entries|G/L Account|Yes|Yes|Yes|N/A|  
|G/L Budget Entries|G/L Account|Yes|Yes|Yes|G/L Budget Name|  
|Cost Type Entries|Cost Type|Yes|Yes|Yes|N/A|  
|Cost Budget Entries|Cost Type|Yes|Yes|Yes|Budget Name|  
|No of Employees|N/A|Yes|Yes|Yes|N/A|  
|Items Sold (Qty)|Item No.|Yes|Yes|Yes|Inventory Posting Group|  
|Items Purchased (Qty)|Item No.|Yes|Yes|Yes|Inventory Posting Group|  
|Items Sold (Amount)|Item No.|Yes|Yes|Yes|Inventory Posting Group|  
|Items Purchased (Amount)|Item No.|Yes|Yes|Yes|Inventory Posting Group|

## Scenario 1: Defining static allocations based on allocation ratio

Static allocation method is based on a definite value, such as square meters used, or an established allocation ratio such as 5:2:4.  

This article describes how to define three new allocation target cost objects for the allocation source PROD cost center using the established allocation ratio 5:2:4. The three target cost objects are ACCESSO, PAINT, and FITTINGS.  

> [!NOTE]  
> The example uses the demo data in the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

### To define the allocation source PROD cost center on the General FastTab  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Cost Allocation**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Cost Allocation** page, choose the **New** action.  
3. In the **ID** field, select <kbd>Enter</kbd> or enter an ID.  
4. In the **Level** field, enter **1**.  
5. In the **Valid From** and **Valid To** fields, enter appropriate dates.  
6. In the **Cost Center Code** field, enter **PROD**.  
7. In the **Credit to Cost Type** field, enter the cost type **9903**.  

### To define the allocation target cost objects on the Lines FastTab  

1. On the first line, in the **Target Cost Type** field, enter **9903**.  
2. On the first line, in the **Target Cost Object** field, select **ACCESSO**.  
3. On the first line, in the **Allocation Target Type** field, select **All Costs** to define how all accrued costs are allocated.  
4. On the first line, in the **Base** field, select **Static** to use the static allocation method.  
5. On the first line, in the **Share** field, enter the allocation ratio **5**.  
6. On the second line, in the **Target Cost Type** field, enter **9903**.  
7. On the second line, in the **Target Cost Object** field, select **PAINT**.  
8. On the second line, in the **Allocation Target Type** field, select **All Costs** to define how all accrued costs are allocated.  
9. On the second line, in the **Base** field, select **Static** to use the static allocation method.  
10. On the second line, in the **Share** field, enter the allocation ratio **2**.  
11. On the third line, in the **Target Cost Type** field, enter **9903**.  
12. On the third line, in the **Target Cost Object** field, select **FITTINGS**.  
13. On the third line, in the **Allocation Target Type** field, select **All Costs** to define how all accrued costs are allocated.  
14. On the third line, in the **Base** field, select **Static** to use the static allocation method.  
15. On the third line, in the **Share** field, enter the allocation ratio **4**.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically calculates the **Percent** field using a percentage rate that is dependent on all three allocation ratios that are entered in the **Share** field for all three lines.

## Scenario 2: Defining dynamic allocations based on Items sold

This topic shows an example of how to define allocations by using the dynamic allocation method. In the example, you change the dynamic allocation of the costs for the SALES cost center to support the new cost object IT EQUIPMENT. IT EQUIPMENT packages have item numbers in the range from 8904-W to 8924-W. You use the previous year’s sales figures to calculate the share. The allocation is posted to the helping cost type 9903.  

> [!NOTE]  
> The example uses the demo data in the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

### To define dynamic allocations based on items sold in the previous year  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Cost Allocation**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Cost Allocation** page, choose the **New** action.  
3. In the **ID** field, select <kbd>Enter</kbd> or enter an ID.  
4. In the **Level** field, enter **1**.  
5. In the **Valid From** and **Valid To** fields, enter appropriate dates.  
6. In the **Cost Center Code** field, enter **SALES**.  
7. In the **Credit to Cost Type** field, enter the cost type **9903**.  
8. In the **Target Cost Type** field, enter the cost type **9903**.  
9. In the **Target Cost Object** field, choose **New** to create a new cost object IT EQUIPMENT and fill in fields as necessary. Select **IT EQUIPMENT**. Leave the **Target Cost Center** field blank.  
10. In the **Allocation Target Type** field, select **All Costs** to define how all accumulated costs are allocated.  
11. In the **Base** field, select the allocation base **Items Sold (Amount)**.  
12. In the **No. Filter** field, enter **8904-W..8924-W**.  
13. In the **Date Filter Code** field, enter **Last Year**.  
14. Choose the **Calculate Allocation Key** action to calculate the share.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses the previous years’ sales figures to calculate a share of 1596.50 LCY with 100 percent for the IT EQUIPMENT packages. This means that all of the items sold last year will be allocated to the cost object IT EQUIPMENT.

# Set up stock keeping units

Use stock keeping units (SKUs) to record information about items for a specific location or a variant. They let you add different information about an item for a specific location, for example:

* A warehouse or distribution center
* Variants, such as different shelf numbers and different replenishment information, for the same item  

## To set up a SKU  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Stock keeping Units**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. Fill in the fields as necessary. The following fields are required: **Item No.**, **Location Code**, and/or **Variant Code**. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  

After you set up the first SKU for an item, the **Stockkeeping Unit Exists** checkbox on the **Item** card is selected.  

To create several SKUs for an item, use the **Create Stockkeeping Unit** batch job. To learn more about batch jobs, go to [Use Job Queues to Schedule Tasks](admin-job-queues-schedule-tasks.md).  

> [!NOTE]  
> The information on the **Stockkeeping Unit** card has priority over the **Item** card.

> [!Warning]
> If the SKU is supplied through production, the **Standard Cost** field isn't used when invoicing and adjusting the actual cost of the produced item. Instead, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses the value in the **Standard Cost** field on the item card, and variances are calculated against the cost shares of that item.<br><br>
> Although you can assign production BOMs and routings to SKUs, the unit cost roll-up and the related calculation of cost shares aren't available on SKUs. To learn more about standard costs, go to [About Calculating Standard Cost](finance-about-calculating-standard-cost.md)

# Setup Best Practices: Supply Planning
Supply planning is a critical business area. When set up and used correctly, supply planning helps a company avoid stock out and reduce both ordering costs and inventory costs.  

 It is not possible to prescribe one optimal setup of all planning fields as this varies from company to company because of business variables, such as market situation and business strategy. However, there are best practices for selecting options in items cards and global setup fields to help get the company started with timely and cost-effective inventory flows.  

 The following topics provide best-practice information about how to set up selected planning fields that are key to inventory and supply planning.

# Suggest lines on sales documents with Copilot (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]

This article explains how to create sales documents faster by letting Copilot suggest the items to add to lines on sales documents for your customers.

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/production-ready-preview-dynamics365.md)]

## Sales line suggestions

Sales line suggestion can assist with creating lines on sales documents such as sales quotes, orders, and invoices based on structured input or natural language. The feature isn't a general-purpose chat, but a highly specific and integrated experience that you can use on sales documents. The feature offers two distinct skills that help you find data about individual products or entire documents.

- Find products

  Information that describes products is stored in multiple places in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For example, item numbers and descriptions are stored in the **Item** table, multiple barcodes are stored in the **Item Reference** table, and product properties are stored in the **Item Attributes** table. While you might prompt for *Red bicycle*, the actual product might be *Crimson tourer*, where *Bicycle* is a product category and *red* is an attribute.

- Find documents by reference

  People often repeat a previous order, or at least use it as a starting point. But it might be tricky to find the right order in a stack of orders. You might remember some of the order's ID, which can be a company-assigned number or a reference number received from a customer. Being able to use prompts such as *Need last invoice from April* should help you find an order faster.

## Supported languages

[!INCLUDE[copilot-language-support-en-only](includes/copilot-language-support-en-only.md)]

## Prerequisites

- Your administrator activates the **Sales Line Suggestions** capability on the **Copilot & agents capabilities** page. Learn more at [Configure Copilot and agent capabilities](enable-ai.md).

## Examples of prompts

Suggest sales lines with Copilot can handle a wide variety of prompt input. This section offers examples of prompts for various scenarios we tested.

### Sample inquiry to repeat a document

Prompt: *Need all the products from invoice 103031*

### During a phone call, you quickly type a list of required products and quantities, but aren't always exact and sometimes use internal product names

Prompt: *2 Red Kids Biicycle*

The prompt works, even with multiple typos.

### A user copies an inquiry from an inbound communication and pastes it onto the Sales Lines Suggestions page

Prompt: *Hello, I'm interested in buying some accessories for my XXXX Laptop, such as a wireless mouse, a keyboard cover, and a laptop bag. I wonder if you have any recommendations or suggestions for these items. Do you have any special offers or discounts for loyal customers like me? Kind regards, M*

Note that XXXX Laptop isn't included in search.

## Options for matching keywords in prompts

When you search for an item using a FullText index, we extract both primary and extra keywords. For example, we break down the search term "Red Coffee Table" into primary keywords "Coffee" and "Table," and some synonyms and other keywords, such as "Red."

When you enter your prompt in the **Suggest Sales Lines** window, the **Matching** field offers the following options for matching criteria:

- [Permissive](#permissive-matching-criteria) means that all keywords are optional. This option typically generates the most suggestions.
- [Balanced](#balanced-matching-criteria) is a blend of required and optional keywords. This option typically generates fewer suggestions.
- [Precise](#precise-matching-criteria) means that all keywords are required. This option typically generates the fewest suggestions.

The following sections provide examples of how matching works. The examples are based on a prompt for "Red Coffee Table" and you have the following fictitious items:

- Red Coffee Table
- Blue Coffee Table
- Green Coffee Table
- Red Side Table
- Dining Table

### Permissive matching criteria

The primary keywords "Coffee" and "Table" are optional. The extra keyword "Red" is optional. This search returns items such as:

- Red Coffee Table
- Blue Coffee Table
- Green Coffee Table
- Red Side Table
- Dining Table

### Balanced matching criteria

The primary keywords "Coffee" and "Table" are required. The extra keyword "Red" is optional. This search returns items such as:

- Red Coffee Table
- Blue Coffee Table
- Green Coffee Table

### Precise matching criteria

The primary keywords "Coffee" and "Table" are required. The extra keyword "Red" is required. This search returns items such as:

This process describes how to suggest lines on a sales order. The steps are the same for sales quotes and invoices.

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Order**, and then choose the related link.
1. Open a sales order or create a new one.
1. On the **Lines** FastTab, choose **Suggest sales lines**.
1. In the **Suggested sales lines** window, enter your prompt or select one from the prompt guides.

## Review, save, discard, or regenerate suggestions

After Copilot suggests the items to add to lines, review its suggestions and decide whether they're what you want:

- To discard a single proposed line, select it in the list, and then choose the **Delete Line** action.
- To discard all proposed lines and close the Copilot window, choose the Discard button (trash can) next to the **Keep it** button.
- To transfer the lines shown in the Copilot window, choose **Keep it**. 

There's a **Reliability** field that displays **High (80+)**, **Medium (60-80)**, and **Low (60-)** scores and points you to lines that need attention.

This step confirms that you want to transfer the lines to a sales document. You can delete or edit the transferred lines there as well, or delete the whole document.

# Sales Decomposition (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2025w1](includes/applies-to-2025w1.md)]

The **Sales Decomposition** report provides a detailed analysis of sales metrics, breaking them down into their key contributing components. This report can help you understands what's driving changes in sales performance, and why.

:::image type="content" source="media/powerbi/sales/sales-decomposition.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Sales Decomposition report" lightbox="media/powerbi/sales/sales-decomposition.png":::

## Use the report

Leadership and management teams use the report to identify trends, break down sales metrics into their key contributing components, and make informed adjustments to strategies.

As the CEO of a furniture company, the report enables you to assess high-level sales trends and identify key drivers behind performance changes. For example, you notice that sales of office desks drive significant growth in a certain region. The decomposition tree reveals that 30% of this growth is attributed to new customers acquired in the past quarter. Based on this insight, you decide to invest in expanding marketing campaigns to attract buyers in other regions.

As the regional sales manager, the report helps you monitor contributions at individual locations and optimize regional sales strategies. For example, you spot that a location has seen a 15% drop in sales, primarily due to a decline in sales of classic desks. In response, you assign a dedicated salesperson to the region to focus on re-engaging client and offer special discounts.

## Key performance indicators

The report includes the following key performance indicators (KPIs) and measures:

- [Sales Amount](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#sales-amount)
- [Sales Quantity](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#sales-quantity)

[!INCLUDE[click-on-a-kpi-link](includes/click-on-a-kpi-link.md)]

[!INCLUDE[powerbi-tip-track-kpis](includes/powerbi-tip-track-kpis.md)]

## Data used in the report

The report uses data from the following tables in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]:

- Items
- Locations
- Value Entries
- Sales Lines
- Item Categories
- Salespersons/Purchasers

# Revalue inventory
If you want to appreciate or depreciate an item or a specific item ledger entry, you must use the revaluation journal.

## To revalue inventory
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Revaluation Journal**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **Calculate Inventory Value** action.
3. On the **Calculate Inventory Value** page, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
4. Choose the **OK** button.
5. On each line on the **Item Revaluation Journals** page, in the **Unit Cost (Revalued)** field, enter the new unit cost. Alternatively, enter the new total amount in the **Inventory Value (Revalued)** field.

    The relevant fields are automatically updated. The **Amount** field shows the actual change in inventory value for the selected item ledger entry. It calculates the difference between the **Inventory Value (Calculated)** field and the **Inventory Value (Revalued)** field.
6. When you have completed all lines in the revaluation journal, choose the **Post** action.

New value entries are now created to reflect the revaluations that you have posted. You can see the new values on the respective item cards.

# Review amounts in general ledger accounts

You might have general ledger accounts that you frequently keep an eye on. Or you might want to speed up the review process at the end of the month. For help with keeping track of what you've done, and to speed up reviews, use the **Review Entries** action on the **Chart of Accounts** or the **G/L Account Card** page for each account. 

## Set up accounts for reviews

On the **G/L Account Card** page for each account, specify how to allow reviews in the **Review Policy** field.

|Review Policy  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|None     | You can't mark entries for the account as reviewed. For example, use this option for accounts such as payables, receivables, and bank accounts where there are other ways to review their amounts.        |
|Allow Review     | You don't have to include entries in a review, and the amounts of the debit and credit entries don't have to balance. You remove a review, for example, if you've made a mistake.        |
|Allow Review and Match Balance     | The total amounts of the debit and credit entries in the review must match. The **Debit** and **Credit** fields show those amounts, and the **Balance** field shows the total. This setting also lets you remove a review. When you remove a review from one or more entries, the debit and credit entries must still balance.        |

## Mark entries as reviewed

Choose the entries you've reviewed, and then use the **Set selected as reviewed** action. Each time you mark one or more entries as reviewed the entries are given the same number in the **Reviewed Identifier** column. The review identifier is a handy way to keep track of the entries that were reviewed at the same time. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] also records the user who did the review, and when they did it.

If you mark entries as reviewed, but regret doing so, use the **Set selected as not reviewed** action.

* If the Review allowed policy is assigned to the account, the action resets the reviewed identifier to 0 and removes the person and date and time of the review. 
* If the Review allowed and match balance policy is assigned, the credit and debit must still balance. For example, if one of the entries in a review is a mistake, you can choose another entry with the correct value. The replacement entry doesn't have to have the same reviewed identifier.

> [!TIP]
> A fast way to choose multiple entries is to hold down Ctrl or Shift while you choose the entries. *Ctrl* lets you selects specific entries, and *Shift* selects all entries between the first and last entries you select.

## Review accounts that have old entries

You might have entries from past periods that you've already reviewed or just don't need a review. You just want to start reviewing entries from, for example, the beginning of the year or accounting period. You can leave the entries as is. However, if you want to analyze data in Excel or by using Analysis Mode, mark the entries as reviewed. To learn more about analyzing entries, go to [Analyze entries](#analyze-entries). To mark the entries as reviewed, add a filter on the Filter pane to display only those entries, and then choose the **Mark selected entries as reviewed** action.

## Filter entries

To get a clearer picture, there are several ways to filter entries on the **Review G/L Entries** page.

* Use the **Show Reviewed Entries** and **Hide Reviewed Entries** actions to show only the entries you have or haven't reviewed. To clear the filters, use the **Show all entries** action.
* Use the Filter pane. For example, you might filter by account number or, if you have older entries and want to mark them all as reviewed, by a posting date.

## Analyze entries

There are a couple of ways to analyze the general ledger entries you've reviewed.

* Turn on Analysis Mode, for example, to group entries according to their reviewed identifier. To learn more about Analysis Mode, go to [Analyze List Page Data Using Analysis Mode](analysis-mode.md).
* Export the entries to Excel.

# EU third-party purchase transactions

European Union (EU) third-party trade occurs when you receive a purchase invoice from a customer in one EU country/region, and the products are sent to a different EU country/region without entering the country of residence. The transaction amount can be identified and reported separately to comply with some EU countries'/regions' value-added tax (VAT) reporting and VAT Information Exchange System (VIES) requirements. Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central enables purchase transactions to be set up as EU third-party trade. Posted EU third-party transactions can be filtered in VAT statements and excluded from the amount in the **Sales to Customer** column of the **VAT-VIES Declaration Tax Auth** report.

Even if the feature is preinstalled as an extension, it isn't activated by default. Follow these steps to activate the feature.

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, go to the **Feature Management** workspace, and then select the related link.
2. In the list, find and select **Feature update: Replace the existing EU 3-Party Purchase functionality with the new EU 3-Party Trade Purchase extension**.
3. In the **Enabled for** column, select **All users**.

> [!NOTE]
> If you use the German or Italian localization, you won't be able to enable this app because it's not compatible with certain VAT features in those localizations.  

## Enable EU third-party trade functionality for a purchase

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Setup**, and then select the related link.
2. On the **VAT Setup** page, mark the **Enable EU 3-Party Purchase** field.

## Use EU third-party trade functionality

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Invoices** (or another purchase document), and then select the related link.
2. Select an existing purchase invoice, or select **New** to create a new one.
3. On the **Invoice Details** FastTab, select the **EU 3-Party Trade** checkbox.
4. Select **OK**.

## Include or exclude EU third-party trade records on the VAT statement

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Statements**, and then select the related link.
2. On the **VAT Statement** page, select one of the following options to show EU third-party trade records by using the **EU 3-Party Trade Filter** field.

    | Option | Description |
    |--------|-------------|
    | All | Show all records, regardless of whether the **EU 3-Party Trade** field in documents was marked. |
    | EU3 | Show only records where the **EU 3-Party Trade** field in documents was marked. |
    | Non-EU3 | Show only records where the **EU 3-Party Trade** field in documents wasn't marked. |

# Use the AMC banking 365 fundamentals extension

The AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals extension makes it easier, and more accurate, to send data to your banks. The extension connects [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with the AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central service, which can convert bank data from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] into formats that are required by over 600 banks around the world. For example, this makes it easier to transfer payments and credits to vendors by entering the payments in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], and then uploading them to your bank. The formats can also smooth out bank reconciliation processes. For more information, see [AMC Banking for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central](https://www.amcbanking.com/bc-fundamentals/).

> [!NOTE]
> AMC Banking has built additional extensions that work with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. This topic describes only the Fundamental extension.

> [!NOTE]
> In the generic version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], a global provider of services to convert bank data to any file format that your bank requires is set up and connected. In North American versions, the same service can be used to send payment files as electronic funds transfer (EFT), for example the commonly used Automated Clearing House (ACH) network, however with a slightly different process.

## Use our demonstration account

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] comes with a demonstration account that lets you try out the AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals extension. We provide default settings for connecting to AMC Banking, specifying the bank accounts to get data from in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], plus a few data exchange definitions. You can view the connection settings on the **AMC Banking Setup** page. For bank accounts, the extension applies values in the **Bank Name**, **Credit Transfer Msg. Nos.**, **Bank Statement Import Format**, and **Payment Export Format** fields on bank account cards.

We provide the settings, but to try out the extension you must run the assisted setup guide to apply them. To run the guide, on the **AMC Banking Setup** page, choose the **Assisted Setup** action.

> [!NOTE]
> There are some limitations on the demo account. For example, when you convert payments, the amount in the converted file will not match the actual amount. Instead, the amount will always be five units of the currency that you use for payments.  

## Setting up the extension

Getting started with the extension involves just a few easy steps, and an assisted setup guide will make the connection and turn on the extension. The guide helps you things like install the data exchange definitions for bank statement export/import setups and initiate the number series used for credit transfer messages.  

### To set up the required permission sets

Before people can use this extension, your administrator must copy the following permission sets, edit them, and then assign the new permission sets to users instead of original:

* **D365 Basic**
* **D365 Team Member**
* **D365 Read**
* **IntelligentCloudBC**

For more information, see [To copy a permission set](ui-define-granular-permissions.md#copy-a-permission-set).

For each new permission set, grant only the **Read** permission for the **AMC Banking Setup table (20101)**. For more information, see [To create or modify permissions manually](ui-define-granular-permissions.md#create-a-permission-set).

### To connect the extension to AMC Banking

3. On the **AMC Banking Setup** page, choose the **Assisted Setup** action.
4. Complete the steps in the assisted setup guide.

### To connect bank accounts to the extension

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Bank Accounts**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the card for the bank account that you want to connect to the service.
3. In the **Name** field, choose the format that your bank requires.  

   The formats are filtered to show only those that are relevant for the country/region that is specified for the bank account.
4. In the **Credit Transfer Msg. Nos.** field, choose the number series to use for messages that accompany payments.
5. In the **Bank Statement Import Format** and **Payment Export Format** fields, choose the data exchange definitions that your bank requires.

## Use the extension

Using this extension is just a matter of exporting data on the **Payment Journals** page, and then uploading it to your bank's web service. For more information, see [Making Payments with Bank Data Conversion or SEPA Credit Transfer](finance-make-payments-with-bank-data-conversion-service-or-sepa-credit-transfer.md).

> [!NOTE]
> You must fill in the **SWIFT Code** and **IBAN** fields for each bank account.

### To export data and submit it to your bank

> [!CAUTION]  
> When you export data by using the AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals extension, some of your business data will be exposed to the provider of the service. The service provider, AMC Consult A/S, is responsible for the privacy of this data. For more information, see [AMC Privacy Policy](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=510158).

# Create Reports with XBRL

> [!NOTE]
> We're in the process of removing the features for XBRL reporting from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Learn more at [Changes in 2022 release wave 1](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/upgrade/deprecated-features-w1).

XBRL (e**X**tensible **B**usiness **R**eporting **L**anguage) is a language, based on eXtensible Markup Language (XML), for tagging financial data, which enables businesses to efficiently and accurately process and share their data. The XBRL initiative enables global financial reporting by numerous enterprise resource planning (ERP) software companies and international accounting organizations. The goal of the initiative is to provide a standard for uniform reporting of financial information for banks, investors, and government authorities. Such business reporting can include:  

* Financial statements  
* Financial information  
* Non-financial information  
* Regulatory filings, such as annual and quarterly financial statements  

> [!NOTE]
> You can import general ledger-related schemas and create XBRL instance documents by mapping general ledger (G/L) data from the chart of accounts to elements in taxonomies designed for financial reports, such as balance sheets, income statements, and so on.
>
> The XBRL capabilities in Business Central support taxonomies for specification 2.1. However, taxonomies may contain unsupported elements such as formula linkbases or iXBRL (inline XBRL), or have other structural differences. We recommend you validate the XBRL capability before using it for reporting.
>
> Full support for taxonomies may require third-party XBRL tagging and tools. The XBRL International organization has a list of tools and services; depending on the XBRL reporting requirements for a given taxonomy, you may want to explore those resources. Learn more at [Getting Started for Business](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2153466) and [Tools and Services](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2153356).

## eXtensible Business Reporting Language

The XBRL taxonomies are maintained by www.xbrl.org. You can download taxonomies and read more detailed information on the XBRL website.  

Let's say someone wants financial information from you. They provide you with a taxonomy (an XML document) containing one or more schemas, each with one or more lines to fill out. The lines correspond to the individual financial facts required by the sender. You import this taxonomy, then fill out the schema(s) by entering the account(s) that corresponds with each line and which calculation is desired, such as net change or balance at date. In some cases you can enter a constant instead, for example, the number of employees. You are now ready to send the instance document (an XML document) to the requester. The idea is that this might be a recurring event, so unless changes have been made to the taxonomy, you just export new instance documents for new periods on request.

## XBRL comprises the following components

The XBRL **Specification** explains what XBRL is and how to build XBRL instance documents and taxonomies. The XBRL specification explains XBRL in technical terms and is intended for a technical audience.  

The XBRL **Schema** are the core low-level components of XBRL. The schema is the physical XSD (also called an XML schema definition) file that expresses how XBRL instance documents and taxonomies are to be built.

The XBRL **Linkbases** are the physical XML files that contain information about the elements defined in the XBRL Schema, such as labels in one or more languages, how they relate to each other, how to sum up elements, and so on.  

An XBRL **Taxonomy** is a "vocabulary" or "dictionary" created by a group, compliant with the XBRL specification, that enables the exchange of business information.  

An XBRL **Instance document** is a business report, such as a financial statement prepared to the XBRL specification. The meaning of the values in the instance document is explained by the taxonomy. In fact, an instance document is somewhat useless unless you know the taxonomy for which it is prepared.  

## Layered taxonomies

A taxonomy can consist of a base taxonomy, for example US GAAP (United States generally accepted accounting principles) or IAS (international accounting standards), and then have one or more extensions. To reflect this, a taxonomy refers to one or more schemas, each of which are separate taxonomies themselves. When the additional taxonomies are loaded into the database, the new elements are simply added to the end of the existing elements.  

## Linkbases

In XBRL Spec. 2, the taxonomy is described in several XML files. The primary XML file is the taxonomy schema file itself (.xsd file) which only contains an unordered list of elements or facts to be reported. In addition to this, there are usually some linkbase files (.xml). The linkbase files contain data that is complementary to the raw taxonomy (.xsd file). There are six types of linkbases files of which four have relevance for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. These are:

* Label linkbase: This linkbase contains labels or names for the elements. The file may contain labels in different languages which are identified with an XML property called 'lang'. The XML language identifier usually contains a two-letter abbreviation, and although it should be easy to guess what the abbreviation means, there is no connection to Microsoft Windows language code or the language codes defined in the demo data. Therefore, when you look up the languages for a specific taxonomy, you see all the labels for the first element in the taxonomy, meaning you can see an example of each language. A taxonomy can have several label linkbases attached to it as long as those linkbases contain different languages.  
* Presentation linkbase: This linkbase contains information about the structure of the elements or, more precisely, how the issuer of the taxonomy suggests the application presents the taxonomy to you. The linkbase contains a series of links that each connect two elements in a parent-child relationship. When applying all these links, the elements can be shown in a hierarchical way. Note that the presentation linkbase deals with just that: the presentation of elements to you.
* Calculation linkbase: This linkbase contains information about how the elements roll up. The structure is quite similar to the presentation linkbase, except that each link, or 'arc' as they are called, has a weight property. The weight can be either 1 or –1, indicating whether the element should be added to or subtracted from its parent. Note that the rollups do not necessarily align with the visual presentation.  
* Reference linkbase: This linkbase is an xml file containing supplementary information about the data required by the taxonomy issuer.

## Set up XBRL lines

After you import or update the taxonomy, the lines of the schemas must filled out with all information required to satisfy the particular financial reporting requirements. This information includes basic company information, the actual financial statements, notes to the financial statements, supplemental schedules, and so on.  

You set up XBRL lines by mapping the data in the taxonomy to the data in your general ledger.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **XBRL Taxonomies**, then choose the related link.  
2. On the **XBRL Taxonomies** page, select a taxonomy from the list.  
3. Choose the **Lines** action.  
4. Select a line and fill in the fields.  
5. To read detailed information about what to fill in, choose the **Information** action.  
6. To set up mapping the G/L accounts in the chart of accounts to the XBRL lines, choose the **G/L Map Lines** action.  
7. To add notes to the financial statement, choose the **Notes** action.  

   > [!TIP]
   > To exclude lines from the exported data, choose **NOT APPLICABLE** as the source type.

   > [!NOTE]  
   > You can only export data that corresponds to the selection in the **Source Type** field. This includes descriptions and notes.  

   > [!NOTE]  
   > Taxonomies might contain elements that [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't support. If an element is not supported, the **Source Type** field will display **Not Applicable** and the **Description** field will show an error message, such as **Unexpected type: "specific type not recognized"**. If you must export the element, choose a matching source type. Typically, this is a constant or a description. Doing this enables you to enter and export data, however, such elements might have validation rules that cannot be checked before exporting.

## Import an XBRL taxonomy

The first step in working with the XBRL functionality is to import a taxonomy into your company database. A taxonomy consists of one or more schemas and some linkbases. After you have completed the import of both schemas and linkbases and have applied the linkbases to the schema, you can set up the lines and map the general ledger accounts in the chart of accounts to the appropriate taxonomy lines.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **XBRL Taxonomies**, then choose the related link.  
2. On the **XBRL Taxonomies** page, create a new line and enter the name and description of the taxonomy.  
3. Choose the **Schemas** action, then insert the description of the schema.  
4. To import the schema, on the **XBRL Schemas** page, choose the **Import** action, then do one of the following steps to upload the file:

   [!INCLUDE[file-upload](includes/file-upload.md)]
5. To import the linkbase, on the **XBRL Schemas** page, choose the **Linkbases** action, then do one of the following steps to upload the file:

   [!INCLUDE[file-upload](includes/file-upload.md)] 
6. You can now choose to apply the linkbase to the schema. Repeat until you have imported all linkbases.  
7. Choose the **Apply to Taxonomy** action to apply the linkbase to the schema.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Instead of individually applying the linkbases after the import, you can wait until you have imported all linkbases and then apply them at the same time. To do this, choose **NO** when you are prompted to apply the newly imported linkbase to the schema. Then select the lines with the linkbases that you want to apply.  

## Update an XBRL taxonomy

When a taxonomy changes you need to update the current taxonomy accordingly. The reason for the update can be an altered schema, an altered linkbase, or a new linkbase. After updating the taxonomy, you only need to map the lines for the changed or new lines.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **XBRL Taxonomies**, then choose the related link.  
2. On the **XBRL Taxonomies** page, choose the **Schemas** action.  
3. To update a schema, select the schema you want to update, then choose the **Import** action.  
4. To update or add a new linkbase, choose the **Linkbases** action.  
5. Select the relevant linkbase or select <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>N</kbd> for a new line, select the type of linkbase, then insert a description.  
6. To import the linkbase, choose the **Import** action.  
7. Choose **Yes** to apply the linkbase to the schema.

# Set up general inventory information

You specify your general inventory setup on the **Inventory Setup** page.

## To set up general inventory information

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Inventory Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Inventory Setup** page, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

### To set up inventory valuation and costing

To record inventory costs correctly, you must set up various fields and pages before you make transactions that include item. Typically, businesses choose a specific costing method and apply that to inventory items, for example, to help them track the value of items on stock.  

|**Field**|**Details**|  
|------------|-------------|
|**Automatic Cost Posting**|Ensure that the cost is automatically posted to the general ledger whenever an inventory transaction is posted. The field is turned on by default to ensure that inventory values are always correct in the general ledger. Alternatively, you can manually post costs at regular intervals with the **Post Inventory Cost to G/L** batch job. You can also turn off automatic cost posting. A notification displays from which you can start an assisted setup guide to help you schedule tasks for the job queue. To learn more, go to [Reconcile Inventory Costs with the General Ledger](finance-how-to-post-inventory-costs-to-the-general-ledger.md).|
|**Automatic Cost Adjustment**| Specifies if item value entries are automatically adjusted when an item transaction is posted. The field is set to **Always** by default to ensure that inventory values are always correct, which in turn keeps your sales and profit statistics up to date. Cost adjustment forwards cost changes from inbound entries, such as purchases or production output, to the related outbound entries, such as sales or transfers. The adjustment is helpful for new [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] customers and small businesses with relatively low inventory transaction levels. However, as a business grows and inventory levels increase, adjustments can slow down system performance. To minimize reduced performance during posting, select a time option to define how far back in time from the work date an inbound transaction can occur to potentially trigger adjustment of related outbound value entries. Alternatively, you can manually adjust costs at regular intervals with the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job. You can also set the **Automatic Cost Adjustment** field to **Never**. A notification displays from which you can start an assisted setup guide to help you schedule tasks for the job queue. To learn more, go to [Adjust Item Costs](inventory-how-adjust-item-costs.md).|
|**Expected Cost Posting to G/L**|Ensure that you post expected costs to the general ledger. The interim G/L accounts show an estimate of the amounts due and the cost of the traded items before you invoice them. To learn more, go to [Design Details: Expected Cost Posting](design-details-expected-cost-posting.md) and [Reconcile Inventory Costs with the General Ledger](finance-how-to-post-inventory-costs-to-the-general-ledger.md).|
|**Average Cost Calc. Type**|Define if the average cost is to be calculated per item only or per item for each stockkeeping unit and for each variant of the item. To learn more, go to [Design details: average cost](design-details-average-cost.md).|
|**Average Cost Period**|Select the period of time you would like application to use for calculating the weighted average cost of items that use the average costing method. To learn more, go to [Design details: average cost](design-details-average-cost.md).|
|**Default Costing Method**|Select the default costing method that determines whether an actual or a budgeted value is capitalized and used in the cost calculation. You can select a different costing method for a specific item either by selecting item template where costing method is defined or by manually selecting a different value on the **Item Card** page. To learn more, go to [Design details: costing methods](design-details-costing-methods.md).|

To learn more about costing in general, go to [Managing Inventory Costs](finance-manage-inventory-costs.md).  

If you want to include warehouse handling times in the order promising calculation on purchase lines, you can set it up as a default for inventory on the **Inventory Setup** page, and for your location. To learn more, go to [Calculate Order Promising Dates](sales-how-to-calculate-order-promising-dates.md).  

## Allow workers to post transactions at the same time

To allow people to post inventory transactions at the same time, you can enable the **Enable multiple users to post item ledger entries and value entries at the same time** feature on the **Feature Management** page. By default, the feature isn’t enabled.

> [!NOTE]
> Similar features are available for project, resource, and warehouse entries. To learn more, go to:
>
> * [Allow multiple people to post project transactions at the same time](projects-how-setup-jobs.md#allow-multiple-people-to-post-project-transactions-at-the-same-time)
> * [Allow multiple people to post resource transactions at the same time](projects-how-setup-resources.md#allow-multiple-people-to-post-resource-transactions-at-the-same-time)
> * [Design details: Creating warehouse entries](design-details-warehouse-entries.md)

If you enable the feature, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] assigns entry numbers for each table from `SequenceNumbers` in the database, which allows more people to post transactions at the same time. The result can be that sometimes inventory entries from two or more transactions are interleaved. For example, an item register might contain any or all of the entry tables, as shown in the following image.

:::image type="content" source="media/interleaved inventory tables.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the item register with several entry tables." lightbox="media/interleaved inventory tables.png":::

If you don’t enable the feature, when someone posts an inventory transaction the tables are locked and other users can’t post inventory transactions. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] finds the last entry in each table and assigns a number that’s one higher. This numbering ensures that entries that belong to the same register are consecutive, but prevents other people from posting at the same time.

> [!NOTE]
> You might not want to enable the feature if you have a feature or extension that:
>
> - Relies on consecutive entry numbers.
> - Requires that tables are locked throughout the posting process.

# Sustainability value chain in sales

When you sell items, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] updates the **CO2e per Unit** field from the **Item** card for each sales line that contains emission values. It uses the average calculation method to calculate the value.  

When you post all sales documents, the posted documents keep the **CO2e per Unit** and **Total CO2e** values for each line.

The result of posting shows as a new sustainability value entry for each line that has **Sale** as its **Item Ledger Entry Type**.

> [!NOTE]
> The **CO2e per Unit** and **Total CO2e** values aren't used in default report layouts. However, if you want to show these details when you print reports, you can create a new document report to show this data.

# Design details: Inventory valuation
Inventory valuation is the determination of the cost that is assigned to an inventory item, as expressed by the following equation.  

Ending inventory = beginning inventory + net purchases – cost of goods sold  

The calculation of inventory valuation uses the **Cost Amount (Actual)** field of the value entries for the item. The entries are classified according to the entry type that corresponds to the cost components, direct cost, indirect cost, variance, revaluation, and rounding. For more information, see [Design Details: Cost Components](design-details-cost-components.md).  

Entries are applied against each other, either by the fixed application or according to the general cost-flow assumption defined by the costing method. One entry of inventory decrease can be applied to more than one increase entry with different posting dates and possibly different acquisition costs. For more information, see [Design Details: Item Application](design-details-item-application.md). Therefore, calculation of the inventory value for a given date is based on summing up positive and negative value entries.  

## Inventory valuation report  
To calculate the inventory value in the **Inventory Valuation** report, the report begins by calculating the value of the item’s inventory at a given starting date. It then adds the value of inventory increases and subtracts the value of inventory decreases up to a given ending date. The end result is the inventory value on the ending date. The report calculates these values by summing the values in the **Cost Amount (Actual)** field in the value entries, using the posting dates as filters.  

The printed report always shows actual amounts, that is, the cost of entries that have been posted as invoiced. Also, the report prints the expected cost of entries that are posted as received or shipped, if you select the Include Expected Cost field on the Options FastTab.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  Values in the **Inventory Valuation** report is reconciled with the Inventory account in the general ledger, meaning the value entries in question have been posted to the general ledger.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  Amounts in the **Value** columns of the report are based on the posting date of transactions for an item.  

## Inventory valuation - WIP report  
A manufacturing company needs to determine the value of three types of inventory:  

* Raw Materials inventory  
* WIP inventory  
* Finished Goods inventory  

The value of WIP inventory is determined by the following equation:  

* Ending WIP inventory = Beginning WIP inventory + manufacturing costs – cost of goods manufactured  

As for purchased inventory, the value entries provide the basis of the inventory valuation. The calculation is made using the values in the **Cost Amount (Actual)** field of the item and capacity value entries associated with a production order.  

The purpose of WIP inventory valuation is to determine the value of the items whose manufacturing hasn't yet been completed on a given date. Therefore the WIP inventory value is based on the value entries related to the consumption and capacity ledger entries. Consumption ledger entries must be invoiced at the date of the valuation. Therefore, the **Inventory Valuation – WIP** report shows the costs representing the WIP inventory value in two categories: consumption and capacity.

# Use job queues to schedule tasks

Use the **Job Queue Entries** page to schedule and run specific reports and codeunits. You can set jobs to run one time, or on a recurring basis. For example, you might want to run the **Salesperson * Sales Statistics** report weekly to track sales by salesperson each week, or run the **Delegate Approval Requests** codeunit daily to prevent documents from piling up.

The **Job Queue Entries** page lists all existing jobs. If you add a job queue entry that runs on a schedule, you must provide some information. For example:

* The type of object to run, such as a report or codeunit. You must have permission to run the report or codeunit.
* The name and object ID of the object.
* Parameters to specify the behavior of the job queue entry. For example, you can add a parameter to only send posted sales orders.
* The schedule for when, and how often, the job queue entry runs.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> If you're assigned the SUPER permissions set that comes with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you have permission to run all objects included in your license. If you have the Delegated Admin role, you can create and schedule job queue entries, but only administrators and licensed users can run them.

After a job finishes successfully, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] removes it from the list of job queue entries, unless it's a recurring job. For recurring jobs, the **Earliest Start Time** field is adjusted to show the next time that the job will run.

## Examples of what you can schedule using job queue entries

### Schedule reports

You can schedule a report or batch job to run at a specific date and time. Scheduled reports and batch jobs are entered in the job queue and processed at the scheduled time, similar to other jobs. You choose the **Schedule** option after you choose the **Send to** action, and then you enter information such as printer, time, date, and recurrence.  

To learn more about scheduling, go to [Scheduling a Report to Run](ui-work-report.md#ScheduleReport)

### Schedule synchronization between [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)]

If you integrate [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)], the job queue lets you schedule when to synchronize data. Depending on the direction and rules you define, the job queue entry can create records in one app to match records in the other. A good example is when you register a contact in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)], the job queue entry can set up that contact for you in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. To learn more about scheduling, go to [Scheduling a Synchronization between Business Central and Dynamics 365 Sales](admin-scheduled-synchronization-using-the-synchronization-job-queue-entries.md).

### Schedule when to post sales and purchase orders

You can use job queue entries to schedule business processes to run in the background. For example, background tasks are useful when multiple users post sales orders at the same time, but only one order can be processed at a time. To learn more about background posting, go to [To set up background posting with job queues](ui-batch-posting.md#to-set-up-background-posting-with-job-queues).

## Important for scheduling recurring jobs

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Recurring job queues can affect performance, so you shouldn't run them too frequently. When you set up how often to run a recurring job, try to set the largest time interval you can. For example, if you're about to set a recurrence of five minutes, consider whether it can be 15 minutes, or even once per hour instead. When planning for recurring job queues, consider which areas of the application the job will affect. Is it an area where many users work and will be impacted by heavy activity? Consider the length of a single job run and the business motivations for running jobs with a given cadence.

## The earliest start date

The value in the **Earliest Start Date/Time** field on the **Job Queue Entry Card** page shows the next time the job will run. There are several factors that can affect whether a job queue entry actually runs at that time.

The most common factors are the number of job queue entries in an environment, and the overall number of scheduled tasks. To protect performance levels, there are operational limits. If you have many entries and, for example, one of them fails or takes longer than expected, the next job might not start at the expected time. If you have codeunits that are generating 100,000 or more scheduled tasks, you should investigate whether you actually need all of those tasks. You can access the list of all scheduled tasks on the **Scheduled Tasks** page.

To learn more about monitoring the status of job queue entries, go to [To view status for any job](#to-view-status-for-any-job). To learn more about operational limits, go to [Asynchronous task limits](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/operational-limits-online#Task).

## Monitor status or errors in the job queue

Data that the job queue generates is stored, so that you can troubleshoot errors.  

For each job queue entry, you can view and change the status. When you create a job queue entry, its status is set to **On Hold**. You can set the status to **Ready** and back to **On Hold**, for example. Otherwise, status information is updated automatically.

The following table describes the values of the **Status** field.

| Status | Description |
|--|--|
| Ready | The job queue entry is ready to be run. |
| In Process | The job queue entry is in process. This field updates while the job queue is running. |
| On Hold | The default status of the job queue entry when you create it. Choose the **Set Status to Ready** action to change the status to **Ready**. Choose the **Set On Hold** action to revert the status to **On Hold**. To learn more, go to [About On Hold](#about-on-hold).|
| On Hold Due to Inactivity | Used primarily for job queue entries that schedule synchronization between [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and another application, such as [!INCLUDE [cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)]. To learn more about this status, go to [About inactivity timeouts](/dynamics365/business-central/admin-scheduled-synchronization-using-the-synchronization-job-queue-entries#about-inactivity-timeouts). |
|Waiting | Only relevant for job queue entries that are assigned a category code. Indicates that the job is scheduled, but the underlying scheduled task isn't active. After the job queue entry that's currently running and is in the same category finishes, the status of the next job in the category with the status Waiting becomes Ready. |
| Error | Something went wrong. Choose **Show Error** to show the error message. |
| Finished | The job queue entry is complete. |

### About On Hold

Setting a job queue entry to **On Hold** doesn't affect a job that's already running. After a job starts, it continues to run until completion, regardless of any subsequent changes made to the job queue entry, such as putting it on hold.<br><br>The **On Hold** status is typically used to prevent a job from automatically starting when it reaches its scheduled start time. It allows you to temporarily pause a job before it begins processing. <br><br>If you need to stop or cancel a running job, you can manually intervene in the process. For example, you can stop the corresponding session or process.

### To view status for any job

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Job Queue Entries**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Job Queue Entries** page, select a job queue entry, and then choose the **Log Entries** action.  

> [!TIP]
> For in-depth analysis based on telemetry, you can use Application Insights in Microsoft Azure to review the status of job queue entries. To learn more about telemetry, go to [Monitoring and Analyzing Telemetry](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/telemetry-overview) and [Analyzing Job Queue Lifecycle Trace Telemetry](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/telemetry-job-queue-lifecycle-trace).

## View scheduled tasks

The **Scheduled Tasks** page in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] shows which tasks are ready to run in the job queue. The page also shows information about the company that each task is set up to run in. However, only tasks that are marked as belonging to the current environment can run.  

For example, all scheduled tasks stop if the company is in an environment that's a copy of another environment. Use the **Scheduled Tasks** page to set tasks as ready to run in the job queue.  

> [!NOTE]
> Internal administrators and licensed users can schedule tasks to run. Delegated administrators can set up and schedule tasks to run, but only licensed users can run them.

## The My Job Queue part

The **My Job Queue** part on your home page shows the job queues entries that you started but aren't finished. By default the part isn't displayed, but you can add it to your home page. To learn more about personalization, go to [Personalize Your Workspace](ui-personalization-user.md).  

The part shows the following information:

* Which documents with your ID in the **User ID** field are being processed or are queued, including documents that are posting in the background.
* Whether there was an error when posting a document or in the job queue entry.

The My Job Queue part also lets you cancel a document posting.

> [!TIP]
> Another useful feature is the **Job Queue Tasks** cue on your home page. The cue makes it easy to monitor job queue entries based on their status. To learn more, go to [The Job Queue Tasks cue](#the-job-queue-tasks-cue).

### To view an error from the My Job Queue part

1. On an entry with the status **Error**, choose the **Show Error** action.
2. Review the error message and fix the problem.

## The Job Queue Tasks cue

The **Job Queue Tasks** cue on your home page makes it easy to keep an eye on your job queue entries. The cue shows tiles for three statuses:

* Tasks Failed: These tasks need attention. Tasks display in this tile after they exceed the maximum number of attempts to run that you specified for the job queue entry. To learn more, go to [Handle job queue entry issues](#handle-job-queue-entry-issues).
* Tasks in Process: These tasks are running.
* Tasks in Queue: These tasks are waiting their turn.

You can configure the **Job Queue Tasks** cue to use color indicators, so it's easy to know when job queue entries need attention. To learn more about color indicators for cues, go to [Set Up a Colored Indicator on Cues for the Company or Individual Users](admin-how-set-up-colored-indicator-on-cues.md).

## Handle job queue entry issues

Job queue entries stop running when there's an error. For example, this can be a problem when an entry connects to an external service, such as a bank feed. If the service is temporarily not available and the job queue entry can't connect, the entry will show an error and stop running. You'll have to manually restart the job queue entry. However, the **Maximum No. of Attempts** and **Rerun Delay (sec.)** fields can help you avoid this situation. The **Maximum No. of Attempts** field lets you specify how many times the job queue entry can fail before it stops trying to run. The **Rerun Delay (sec.)** field lets you specify the amount of time, in seconds, between attempts. The combination of these two fields might keep the job queue entry running until the external service becomes available.

If a job queue entry shows an error, your first option to resolve the issue is to restart the job queue entry. You can set the status of the job queue entry to **On Hold** and then to **Ready**, or just restart it.

If a restart doesn't help, the issue might be in the code. You can find the owner (also called the *publisher*) of the code in the AL stack trace in the Job Queue log. If the error comes from an app/extension, contact your Microsoft partner. If the error comes from a Microsoft application, open a support request with Microsoft.

If you contact your Microsoft partner or Microsoft for support, provide the following information:

* The ID of the job queue entry runs where the error occurred
* The timestamp of when the error occurred
* Your timezone

> [!TIP]
> Depending on whether your [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is earlier or later than version 22.1, gather the information in the following ways:
>
> * For earlier versions, provide a screenshot of the **Job Queue Log Entries** page.
> * For later versions, use the **Copy details** action on the Job Queue Log Entries page to copy the information (job queue ID, timestamp, and your timezone).

### Get notified when a job queue entry fails

If something goes wrong and a job queue entry fails, or isn't scheduled for some reason, you might want to be notified so you can react quickly. You can set up notifications to alert you, your job queue administrator, or both. The notification lets you:

* Restart the job queue entry, which is typically the first thing to try.
* Go directly to details about the failure.

To set up notifications for job queue entry failures, start the **Set Up Job Queue Notifications** assisted setup guide from the **Assisted Setup** page. Use the guide to enter the following settings:

* Who to notify about a failure. You can notify the person who started the job queue entry, or job queue entry administrators, or both.
* How you want to be notified. You can turn on in-product notifications that show at the top of your home page.

   :::image type="content" source="media/in product notification example.png" alt-text="Shows a notification at the top of a home page.":::

   Or, use [external business events](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/business-events-overview#query-business-central-catalog-of-business-events-in-dataverse) to start a Power Automate flow. You can specify when, how, and who to notify for the flow. Your Power Automate flow must subscribe to the **Job queue task failed** event. To make it easier to create a flow that uses external business events, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides the [Notify in Outlook when Job Queue in Business Central fails](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2288541) Power Platform template. An assisted setup guide helps you get set up in just a few steps. To learn more about Power Automate flows, go to [Use Power Automate flows in Business Central](/dynamics365/business-central/across-how-use-financials-data-source-flow).
* When you want to be notified. You can choose to be notified immediately, or specify thresholds to be notified only after a number of job queue entries fail.

After you set up notifications, you can always turn them on or off. On the **My Notifications** page, for the **Job Queue Failed Notification**, select or clear the **Enabled** checkbox.

## Monitor the job queue with telemetry

Administrators can use [Azure Application Insights](/azure/azure-monitor/app/app-insights-overview) to gather and analyze telemetry that helps identify problems. To learn more about telemetry, go to [Monitoring and Analyzing Telemetry](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/telemetry-overview) and [Analyzing Job Queue Lifecycle Trace Telemetry](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/telemetry-job-queue-lifecycle-trace).

Telemetry lets administrators set up alerts on job queue issues that send a text message, email, or a message in Teams if something isn't right. To learn more about these alerts, go to [Alert on Telemetry](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/telemetry-alert).

# Design Details: Revaluation

You can revalue the inventory based on the valuation base that most accurately reflects the inventory value. You can also backdate a revaluation to correctly update the cost of goods sold (COGS) for items you've already sold. Items that use the Standard costing method and aren't completely invoiced can also be revalued.  

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the following flexibility is supported regarding revaluation:  

- The revaluable quantity can be calculated for any date, also back in time.  
- For items using Standard costing method, expected cost entries are included in revaluation.  
- Inventory decreases affected by revaluation are detected.  

## Calculate the revaluable quantity

The quantity you can revalue is the remaining inventory that's available on a given date. The quantity is the total of completely invoiced item ledger entries that you post on or before the revaluation date.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  Items using the Standard costing method are treated differently when calculating the revaluable quantity per item, location, and variant. The quantities and values of item ledger entries that are not completely invoiced are included in the revaluable quantity.  

After a revaluation has been posted, you can post an inventory increase or decrease with a posting date that comes before the revaluation posting date. However, this quantity will not be affected by the revaluation. To balance the inventory, only the original revaluable quantity is considered.  

Because you can revaluate on any date, you must have conventions for when you consider an item as part of inventory. For example, when the item is on inventory and when the item is work in process (WIP).  

### Example  

The following example illustrates when a WIP item transitions to become part of inventory. The example is based on the production of a chain with 150 links.  

![WIP inventory and revaluation.](media/design_details_inventory_costing_10_revaluation_wip.png "WIP inventory and revaluation")  

**1Q**: The user posts the purchased links as received. The following table shows the resulting item ledger entry.  

|Posting Date|Item|Entry Type|Quantity|Entry No.|  
|------------------|----------|----------------|--------------|---------------|  
|01-01-20|LINK|Purchase|150|1|  

> [!NOTE]  
>  Now an item using the Standard costing method is available for revaluation.  

**1V**: The user posts the purchased links as invoiced and the links become part of inventory, from a financial point of view. The following table shows the resulting value entries.  

|Posting Date|Entry Type|Valuation Date|Cost Amount (Actual)|Item Ledger Entry No.|Entry No.|  
|------------------|----------------|--------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------|---------------|  
|01-15-20|Direct Cost|01-01-20|150.00|1|1|  

 **2Q + 2V**: The user posts the purchased links as consumed for the production of the iron chain. From a financial point of view, the links become part of WIP inventory.  The following table shows the resulting item ledger entry.  

|Posting Date|Item|Entry Type|Quantity|Entry No.|  
|------------------|----------|----------------|--------------|---------------|  
|02-01-20|LINK|Consumption|-150|1|  

The following table shows the resulting value entry.  

|Posting Date|Entry Type|Valuation Date|Cost Amount (Actual)|Item Ledger Entry No.|Entry No.|  
|------------------|----------------|--------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------|---------------|  
|02-01-20|Direct Cost|02-01-20|-150.00|2|2|  

The valuation date is set to the date of the consumption posting (02-01-20), as a regular inventory decrease.  

**3Q**: The user posts the chain as output and finishes the production order. The following table shows the resulting item ledger entry.  

|Posting Date|Item|Entry Type|Quantity|Entry No.|  
|------------------|----------|----------------|--------------|---------------|  
|02-15-20|CHAIN|Output|1|3|  

**3V**: The user runs the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job, which posts the chain as invoiced to indicate that all material consumption has been completely invoiced. From a financial point of view, the links are no longer part of WIP inventory when the output is completely invoiced and adjusted. The following table shows the resulting value entries.  

|Posting Date|Entry Type|Valuation Date|Cost Amount (Actual)|Item Ledger Entry No.|Entry No.|  
|------------------|----------------|--------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------|---------------|  
|01-15-20|Direct Cost|01-01-20|150.00|2|2|  
|02-01-20|Direct Cost|02-01-20|-150.00|2|2|  
|02-15-20|Direct Cost|02-15-20|150.00|3|3|  

## Expected cost in revaluation

The quantity you can revalue is the sum of the quantity for completely invoiced item ledger entries that you posted on or before the revaluation date. When some items are received or shipped but not invoiced, you can't calculate their inventory value. Items that use the Standard costing method are not limited in this way.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  Another type of expected cost that can be revalued is WIP inventory, within certain rules. For more information, see [WIP Inventory Revaluation](design-details-revaluation.md#wip-inventory-revaluation).  

When you calculate the revaluable quantity for items that use the Standard costing method, the calculation includes item ledger entries that aren't completely invoiced. These entries are revalued when you post the revaluation. When you invoice the revalued entry, you create the following value entries:  

- The usual invoiced value entry with an entry type of **Direct Cost**. The cost amount on this entry is the direct cost from the source line.  
- A value entry with an entry type of **Variance**. This entry records the difference between the invoiced cost and the revalued standard cost.  
- A value entry with an entry type of **Revaluation**. This entry records the reversal of the revaluation of the expected cost.

### Example  

The following example is based on the production of the chain in the previous example. This example illustrates how the three types of entries are created, based on the following scenario:  

1.  You post the purchased links as received with a unit cost of LCY 2.00.  
2.  You post a revaluation of the links with a new unit cost of LCY 3.00, updating the standard cost to LCY 3.00.  
3.  You post the original purchase of the chain links as invoiced, which creates the following value entries:  

    1.  An invoiced value entry with an entry type of **Direct Cost**.  
    2.  A value entry with an entry type of **Revaluation** to record the reversal of the revaluation of the expected cost.  
    3.  A value entry with an entry type of Variance, recording the difference between the invoiced cost and the revalued standard cost.  

The following table shows the results.  

|Step|Posting Date|Entry Type|Valuation Date|Cost Amount (Expected)|Cost Amount (Actual)|Item Ledger Entry No.|Entry No.|  
|----------|------------------|----------------|--------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------|---------------|  
|1.|01-15-20|Direct Cost|01-15-20|300.00|0.00|1|1|  
|2.|01-20-20|Revaluation|01-20-20|150.00|0.00|1|2|  
|3.a.|01-15-20|Direct Cost|01-15-20|-300.00|0.00|1|3|  
|3.b.|01-15-20|Revaluation|01-20-20|-150.00|0.00|1|4|  
|3.c.|01-15-20|Variance|01-15-20|0.00|450.00|1|5|  

## Determine whether revaluation affects an inventory decrease  

Use the date of the posting or the revaluation to determine whether an inventory decrease is affected by a revaluation.  

The following table shows the criteria that's used for an item that doesn't use the Average costing method.  

|Scenario|Entry No.|Timing|Affected by revaluation|  
|--------------|---------------|------------|-----------------------------|  
|A|Earlier than revaluation entry number|Earlier than revaluation posting date|No|  
|B|Earlier than revaluation entry no.|Equal to revaluation posting date|No|  
|C|Earlier than revaluation entry no.|Later than revaluation posting date|Yes|  
|D|Later than revaluation entry no.|Earlier than revaluation posting date|Yes|  
|E|Later than revaluation entry no.|Equal to revaluation posting date|Yes|  
|F|Later than revaluation entry no.|Later than revaluation posting date|Yes|  

### Example  

The following example illustrates revaluation of an item that uses the FIFO costing method. The example is based on the following scenario:  

1.  On 01-01-20, you post a purchase of 6 units.  
2.  On 02-01-20, you post a sale of 1 unit.  
3.  On 03-01-20, you post a sale of 1 unit.  
4.  On 04-01-20, you post a sale of 1 unit.  
5.  On 03-01-20, you calculate the inventory value for the item, and post a revaluation of the item’s unit cost from LCY 10.00 to LCY 8.00.  
6.  On 02-01-20, you post a sale of 1 unit.  
7.  On 03-01-20, you post a sale of 1 unit.  
8.  On 04-01-20, you post a sale of 1 unit.  
9. You run the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job.  

The following table shows the resulting value entries.  

|Scenario|Posting Date|Entry Type|Valuation Date|Valued Quantity|Cost Amount (Actual)|Item Ledger Entry No.|Entry No.|  
|--------------|------------------|----------------|--------------------|---------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------|---------------|  
||01-01-20|Purchase|01-01-20|6|60.00|1|1|  
||03-01-20|Revaluation|03-01-20|4|-8.00|1|5|  
|A|02-01-20|Sale|02-01-20|-1|-10.00|2|2|  
|B|03-01-20|Sale|03-01-20|-1|-10.00|3|3|  
|C|04-01-20|Sale|04-01-20|-1|-10.00|4|4|  
||04-01-20|Sale|04-01-20|-1|2.00|4|9|  
|D|02-01-20|Sale|03-01-20|-1|-10.00|5|6|  
||02-01-20|Sale|03-01-20|-1|2.00|5|10|  
|E|03-01-20|Sale|03-01-20|-1|-10.00|6|7|  
||03-01-20|Sale|03-01-20|-1|2.00|6|11|  
|F|04-01-20|Sale|04-01-20|-1|-10.00|7|8|  
||04-01-20|Sale|04-01-20|-1|2.00|7|12|  

## WIP inventory revaluation  

Revaluating WIP inventory implies that you revalue components that are registered as WIP inventory.  

It's important to have conventions that control when an item is WIP inventory from a financial point of view. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the following conventions exist:  

- A purchased component becomes part of the raw material inventory when you post a purchase as invoiced.  
- A purchased/sub-assembled component becomes part of the WIP inventory when you post its consumption with a production order.  
- A purchased/sub-assembled component remains part of the WIP inventory until you invoice a production order (manufactured item).  

The way the valuation date for the value entry of consumption is set follows the same rules as for non-WIP inventory. To learn more, go to [Determine whether revaluation affects an inventory decrease](#determine-whether-revaluation-affects-an-inventory-decrease).  

You can revalue WIP inventory under the following conditions:

- The revaluation date is before the posting dates of the corresponding item ledger entries of type Consumption.
- You haven't invoiced the production order.  

> [!CAUTION]  
> The **Inventory Valuation - WIP** report shows the value of posted production order entries, and might be a little confusing for revalued WIP items.  

## Revaluate items with the Average costing method

You can only revaluate items that use the Average costing method if **Calculate Per** is *Item*.

You can only do revaluation at the end of the period selected in the **Average Cost Period** field on the **Inventory Setup** page.

Revaluation won't affect negative transactions in the current month, which is why fully applied inbound entries aren't included either.

### Example

This example shows what happens when you calculate the inventory value on the **Item Revaluation Journal** page. On the **Inventory Setup** page, **Item** is chosen in the **Average Cost Calc. Type** field, and **Month** is chosen in the **Average Cost Period** field.

The following table shows item ledger entries for the sample average-cost item, ITEM1.

|Posting Date|Item Ledger Entry Type|Quantity|Cost Amount (Actual)|Entry No.|
|----|----|----|----|----|
25-04-23|Purchase|5|5.00|1
26-04-23|Purchase|3|3.00|2
27-04-23|Sale|-5|-5.00|3
28-04-23|Sale|-1|-1.00|4
13-05-23|Purchase|2|20.00|5
17-06-23|Sale|-6|-22.00|6

The following table shows the result of running the **Calculate Inventory Value** report with different posing dates.

|Posting Date|Quantity|Comment|
|---|---|-------------|
30-04-23|2|Includes only the remaining quantity from entry 2. Entry 1 is completely applied before the posting date, and entry 5 is after posting date.
31-05-23|4|Includes the remaining quantities from entries 2 and 13.
30-06-23|0|No remaining quantity at posting date.

The result of the following entries will be 0, regardless of the posting date.

|Posting Date|Item Ledger Entry Type|Quantity|Cost Amount (Actual)|Entry No.|
|----|----|----|----|----|
13-05-23|Purchase|5|5.00|1
26-04-23|Sale|-5|5.00|2

# Responsible AI FAQ for Autofill (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]

These frequently asked questions (FAQ) describe the AI impact of Copilot’s Autofill feature in Business Central.

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-note-d365.md)]

<!--[!INCLUDE [preview-note](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/production-ready-preview-dynamics365.md)]-->

## What is Autofill?

Manually entering data can be time-consuming and error-prone, both for casual users of Business Central and expert users who are tasked with entering records throughout their workday.  

Microsoft Copilot is an AI-powered assistant that sparks creativity, boosts productivity, and eliminates tedious tasks. Copilot uses AI to suggest and fill out field values automatically on your page, instead of typing or looking up things across screens. You can choose to keep or discard the suggestions. 

## What are the capabilities of Autofill?

When you ask Copilot to autofill fields on a page in Business Central, it suggests values for all fields within a field group (FastTab). These suggestions aren't always AI-generated. Copilot uses various mechanisms described in the following table to provide suggestions for each field, indicating the most appropriate mechanism.

Regardless of whether the suggested value is AI-generated, Copilot always uses AI to determine the appropriate mechanism for a field.

|Mechanism|Description|
|-|-|
|Most Frequently Used |The value most frequently assigned to records in your company. The suggested value isn't computed using AI and comes directly from your Business Central data. |
|Most Recently Used |For fields that reference another table, the most recently used reference, or most recently viewed record for that table. The suggested value isn't computed using AI and comes directly from your Business Central data. |
|Lookup selection |For fields that reference another table and have a short list of possible choices, AI is used to intelligently select from the possible values.|
|AI-generated |AI is used to intelligently generate the suggested value. |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Copilot runs under your user context. It only has access to data that you already have access to. Your assigned permissions and all other security and compliance controls also apply when you use Copilot.

## What is the intended use of Autofill? 

Autofill is an assistive feature intended to help people enter data into Business Central. It isn't designed to run autonomously and enter data on behalf of others. Since the suggestions aren't automatically saved to Business Central, you must review and accept each field for it to be saved. 

When you choose to keep a suggestion, you're saving the change to Business Central as if you entered that value yourself without the assistance of Copilot.

When you leave the page or record, any suggestions that you didn't choose to keep are automatically discarded. 

Suggested values are displayed directly within the field editing experience, making it easy for you to review each suggestion and choose to keep, discard, or replace the suggestion. 

## How was Autofill evaluated? What metrics are used to measure performance? 

This feature is built in accordance with Microsoft's Responsible AI Standard. Learn more about responsible AI from Microsoft in [Empowering responsible AI practices](https://aka.ms/RAI).

The feature underwent extensive AI testing using Business Central's demonstration data and other fictitious business data. Testing covered various fields and pages from Business Central. Copilot’s output was evaluated for accuracy of suggested values, selection of the appropriate mechanism to suggest a value, grounding of suggested values in database data, and other metrics.

To ensure customer safety and data protection, this feature underwent rigorous testing to detect and deflect harmful content, jailbreaks, and other risks.

## How does Microsoft monitor the quality of generated content? 

Microsoft has various automated systems in place to ensure that output from Copilot is of the highest quality. Automated systems also detect abuse, and ensure safety for our customers and their data by filtering harmful content. 

Microsoft might disable the Copilot features for selected customers if abuse of the functionality is detected. 

Users have the opportunity to provide feedback to every Copilot response and report inaccurate or inappropriate content to help Microsoft improve this feature. If you encounter inappropriate content, report it to Microsoft by using this feedback form: [Report abuse](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2249810). We analyze user feedback on the feature and use it to help us improve responses.

You provide feedback by using the **like** (thumbs up) or **dislike** (thumbs down) icon in the information about an individual suggestion or for all suggestions in the group of fields.

## What are the AI limitations of Autofill? How can users minimize the impact of the limitations when using the system?

- **General AI limitations**
  AI systems are valuable tools but they're nondeterministic. The content they generate might not be accurate. It's important to use your judgment to review and verify responses before making decisions that could affect stakeholders like customers and partners. 

- **Geographic and language availability**

  [!INCLUDE [copilot-geo-and-language-availability-en-only](includes/copilot-geo-and-language-availability-en-only.md)]

- **Certain industry, product, and subject limitations**

  Organizations that operate in some business domains, such as medical, drugs, legal, and weapons, might experience lower quality or limited output from Copilot due to the sensitive nature of that domain.

## What data does Autofill collect and how is it used?

Business Central collects the minimum data required for Microsoft to offer the service. 

- Microsoft collects anonymized information about decisions made by Copilot and your choice to keep or discard a suggestion. It doesn't collect suggested field values or other company data used by Copilot to provide suggestions.
- Microsoft doesn't use your business data to train the foundational models for the benefit of others. Learn more in [Dynamics 365 terms for Azure OpenAI-powered features](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2236010).

# (Obsolete) Create and modify custom report layouts

[!INCLUDE[legacy-custom-layouts](includes/legacy-custom-layouts.md)]

By default, reports have a built-in layout. The report layout can be either an RDLC (report definition language client side) report layout, a Microsoft Word report layout, or both. And while you can't modify built-in layouts, you can create custom layouts. A report can have multiple custom report layouts.

> [!NOTE]  
> In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the term "report" also covers externally facing documents, such as sales invoices and order confirmations you send to customers as PDF files.

To create a custom layout, either copy an existing custom layout or add a new custom layout. Custom layouts are often based on a built-in layout. When you add a new custom layout, you can choose to add either an RDLC or a Word report layout type, or both. The new custom layout is based on the built-in layout for the report, if one is available. If there's no built-in layout for the report type, a new blank layout is created. You modify and design this blank layout from scratch. Learn more about RDLC, Word, built-in, and custom layouts in [Manage Report Layouts](ui-manage-report-layouts.md).  

> [!TIP]
> Use financial reports to get insight into the financial data stored in your chart of accounts. Learn more at [Prepare Financial Reporting with Financial Data and Account Categories](bi-how-work-account-schedule.md).

After you define your custom report layouts, you can select them on the customer card and vendor card pages. The layouts are then used when you create documents for the customer or vendor. Learn more at [Define Document Layouts for Customers and Vendors](ui-define-customer-vendor-document-layouts.md).

You can also use custom report layouts to add content to email messages. Report layouts can save time and help ensure consistency by reusing the same content when you communicate with your customers. To use custom report layouts with email, the file type for the layout must be Word. You can't use the RDLC file type. Learn more in [Set Up Reusable Email Texts and Layouts](admin-how-setup-email.md#set-up-reusable-email-texts-and-layouts).

## Create a custom layout

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Report Layout Selection**, and then choose the related link.

    The **Report Layout Selection** page lists all the reports available in the company specified in the **Company Name** field at the top of the page.
1. In the **Company Name** field, choose the company you want to create the report layout for.
1. Select the row for the report you want to create the layout for, and then choose the **Custom Layouts** action.  

   The **Custom Report Layouts** page appears and lists all the custom layouts available for the selected report.
1. If you want to create a copy of an existing custom layout, select the existing custom layout in the list, then choose the **Copy** action.  

   The copy of the custom layout appears on the **Custom Report Layouts** page and has the words *Copy of* in the **Description** field.
1. If you want to add a new custom layout based on a built-in layout, follow these steps:  
   1. Choose the **New** action. The **Insert Built-in Layout for a Report** page appears with the **ID** and **Name** fields automatically filled in.
   1. Turn on the **Insert Word Layout** toggle to add a custom Word report layout type OR turn on the **Insert RDLC Layout** toggle to add a custom RDLC report layout type.
   1. Choose the **OK** button.  

    The new custom layout now appears on the **Custom Report Layouts** page. If a new layout is based on a built-in layout, then the words **Copy of a Built-in Layout** appear in the **Description** field. If there was no built-in layout for the report, then the new layout has the words **New Layout** in the **Description** field, which means that custom layout is blank.
1. By default, the **Company Name** field is blank and the custom layout is available for reports by all companies. To make the custom layout available to a specific company only, choose **Edit**, then set the **Company Name** field to the company you want.

The custom layout is created and you can modify it as you like.

> [!TIP]
> You can export the report results to a Microsoft Excel file to view the full dataset, including all columns, but without the layout. The Excel file can help you validate the report returns the expected data or diagnose problems. Learn more at [Analyzing Report Data with Excel](report-analyze-excel.md).

## <a name="ModifyCustomLayout"></a>Modifying a custom layout

To modify a custom report layout, you must first export the report layout as a file to a location on your computer or network. Then, open the exported document and make the changes. When you're finished making the changes, you import the report layout.

### Modify a custom layout

1. Export a custom layout from the **Custom Report Layouts** page. If that page isn't already open, search for and open the **Report Layout Selection** page, select the report that has the layout you want to modify, then choose the **Custom Layouts** action.  
1. On the **Custom Report Layouts** page, select the layout you want to modify, choose the **Export Layout** action, then choose **Save** or **Save As** to save the report layout document to a location on your computer or network.  
1. Open the report layout document you saved and make changes.

   If you're changing a Word layout, open the layout document in Word. Learn more about editing Word reports at [Work with Word Layouts](ui-how-add-fields-word-report-layout.md)<!--the next section [Making Changes to the Report Layout](ui-how-create-custom-report-layout.md#MakeChangesToLayout)-->.

   RDLC report layouts are more advanced than Word report layouts. Learn more about modifying an RDLC report layout at [Designing RDLC Report Layouts](/dynamics-nav/Designing-RDLC-Report-Layouts).

   Remember to save your changes when you're done.

1. Return to the **Custom Report Layouts** page, select the report layout you exported and modified, then choose the **Import Layout** action.  
1. In the **Import** dialog box, select **Choose** to find and select the modified report layout document, then choose **Open**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Remember to import the report layout document that you modified. Otherwise, the new report layout isn't available.

<!--
##  <a name="MakeChangesToLayout"></a> Create and modify custom report layouts

To make general formatting and layout changes, such as changing text font, adding and modifying a table, or removing a data field, just use the basic editing features of Word like you do with any Word document.

If you're designing a Word report layout from scratch or adding new data fields, then start by adding a table that includes rows and columns that will eventually hold the data fields.

> [!TIP]  
> Show the table gridlines so that you see the boundaries of table cells. Remember to hide the gridlines when you're done editing. To show or hide table gridlines, select the table, and then under **Layout** on the **Table** tab, choose **View Gridlines**.

### Embedding fonts in Word layouts for consistency

To ensure that reports always display and print with the intended fonts, wherever users open or print the reports, you can embed the fonts in the Word document. However, embedding fonts can significantly increase the size of the Word files. Learn more about embedding fonts in Word at [Embed fonts in Word, PowerPoint, or Excel](https://support.office.com/article/Embed-fonts-in-Word-PowerPoint-or-Excel-cb3982aa-ea76-4323-b008-86670f222dbc).

###  <a name="RemoveField"></a> Removing label and data fields in Word layouts

 Label and data fields of a report are contained in content controls in Word. The following figure illustrates a content control when it's selected in the Word document.  

 ![Content control for field in Word report layout.](media/nav_wordreportlayouts_contentcontrol.png "NAV_WordReportLayouts_ContentControl")  

 The name of the label or data field name displays in the content control. In the example, the field name is CompanyAddr1.  

### To remove a label or data field  

1. Right-click the field you want to delete, then choose **Remove Content Control**.  

     The content control is removed, but the field name remains as text.  

2. Delete the remaining text as needed.  

### Adding data fields

Adding data fields from a report dataset is more advanced and requires some knowledge of the report dataset. Learn more about adding fields for data, labels, and images at [Add Fields to a Word Report Layout](ui-how-add-fields-word-report-layout.md).  -->

# Power BI Projects app

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

## Project Analytics for the leadership team

To fit this category, you might have a role such as:

- Chief Operations Officer
- Chief Finance Officer

### Example scenario: view project costing performance

CFOs want to ensure that you aren't overspending on specific projects from a high-level. By analyzing the [Project Performance to Budget](projects-powerbi-project-performance-to-budget.md), you can quickly see how each project is performing against its budget. Alternatively, you can also use the [Project Profitability](projects-powerbi-project-profitability.md) report to view key information on profit statics per project.

## Project analytics for project managers

To fit this category, you might have a role such as Project Manager.

### Example scenario: tracking project completion and sales

Project managers want to know how each project is performing and get high-level information about them. The [Project Overview](projects-powerbi-project-overview.md) report can help you compare key information across all projects. Additionally, you can also see how your sales are going by using either the [Project Invoiced Sales by Type](projects-powerbi-project-invoiced-sales-by-type.md) or [Project Invoiced Sales by Customer](projects-powerbi-project-invoiced-sales-by-customer.md) reports.

# Design Details: Item Tracking in the Warehouse
Serial number and lot number handling is primarily a warehouse task and therefore all inbound and outbound warehouse documents have standard functionality for assigning and selecting item tracking numbers.  

However, because the reservation system is based on item ledger entries, warehouse activity documents that register only warehouse entries are not fully supported. Because reservations and item tracking numbers can be handled only at the location level, not at the bin and zone level, the **Item Tracking Lines** page cannot be opened from warehouse activity documents. The same applies to the **Reservation** page.  

After a serial or lot number has been added to an item at a warehouse location, it can be moved and reclassified freely within the warehouse by using an independent item tracking structure that is unrelated to the reservation system. **Serial No.** and **Lot No.** fields are accessed directly on warehouse document lines. When the serial or lot number later partakes in outbound posting, it is synchronized with the reservation system as a part of ordinary bin adjustment. For more information, see [Design Details: Integration with Inventory](design-details-integration-with-inventory.md).  

However, the reservation system does take warehouse activities into consideration when it calculates availability. For example, items that are allocated to picks, or registered as picked, cannot be reserved. For more information, see [Design Details: Warehouse Availability](design-details-availability-in-the-warehouse.md).

# Walkthrough conducting a sales campaign

A campaign is any kind of activity that involves several contacts. An important part of setting up a campaign involves selecting the target audience for your campaign. For this purpose, in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you create a segment, or a group of contacts using filters.  

 You use these features in Sales & Marketing to carefully plan your marketing activities and to manage your interactions with contacts and customers. You can create campaigns and set up segments of your contacts for mailings and other types of interactions with your contacts and prospective customers.  

 The Campaign and Segment features with their automated processes enable you to plan, organize, and keep track of your marketing activities. This increases the chances of winning new customers and retaining existing customers.  

## About this walkthrough

 This walkthrough demonstrates the process for following up on a trade show and targeting potential customers (contacts) in a follow-up campaign.  

 The walkthrough introduces the campaign and segment management feature in the Sales & Marketing department. This walkthrough illustrates the following tasks:  

- Preparing the data.
- Setting up a campaign.  
- Selecting the target audience.  
- Mining data.  
- Sending letters to contacts.  
- Registering campaign responses.  

## Roles

 This walkthrough demonstrates tasks that are performed by the following user roles:  

- Marketing Manager or Sales Manager  
- Marketing Staffer  

## Prerequisites

 Before you can perform the tasks in the walkthrough, you must install the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

## Story

 The marketing manager in the Sales department of CRONUS is responsible for planning campaigns and for executing them. The marketing manager also makes decisions about which trade shows to participate in and evaluates campaign progress.  

 The marketing staffer in the Marketing department handles producing, distributing, and placing marketing material.  

 The company has launched a new product called the Rome Guest Chair. The product was recently promoted at a trade show, Office Futurus. Many customers expressed great interest in the product, and as part of a promotional effort, customers who bought Rome Guest Chair during a campaign period were offered a special campaign price.  

 One of the marketing staffer’s tasks after the trade show is to enter all the potential customers as contacts.  

 The marketing manager sets up a campaign, creates a segment that contains all the new contacts and then mines the contact data to select the target audience for the campaign.  

 The staffer helps send out thank you letters to all the contacts who left their cards with the staff at the stand, and finally, the manager records all the responses they receive from the prospective customers.  

## Setting up a campaign

 As soon as the staffer has entered the business cards received at the trade show, the marketing manager sets up a campaign card to manage the activities involved in the campaign.  

### To set up a campaign  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Campaigns**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action to create a new campaign. On the campaign card, select <kbd>Enter</kbd> to have a campaign number automatically inserted.  
3. In the **Description** field, enter a description for the campaign, for example, **Office Futurus trade show**.  
4. Choose the **Status Code** field, and select the status code "1-PLAN". 
5. Fill in the **Starting Date** and **Ending Date** fields of the campaign as appropriate.  

## Selecting the target audience

 The marketing manager creates a segment to select the contacts that they want to interact with.  
 
 When you create a segment, you can use various criteria to select the contacts that must be targets for the segment. For example, you can select contact persons who work at a customer site or a prospective customer site who are responsible for purchases at their company. You use filters to add contacts according to the criteria that best fit your purposes. For example, you can choose to filter by the job responsibility of the contact person or the business relation or industry of the contact company. For this walkthrough, we'll choose the **Job Responsibility** filter to select contacts.

### To create a segment with the relevant contacts  

1. Choose the **Navigate** action, and then choose **Segments**.  
2. Choose the **New** action to create a new segment. On the segment card, select **Enter** to have a segment number automatically inserted.  
3. On the **General** FastTab, in the **Description** field, enter, for example, *Visitors at the Office Futurus trade show*.
4. Choose the **Add Contacts** action to open the **Add Contacts** filter.  
5. Scroll down to the **Contact Job Responsibility** FastTab, select the **Purchase** filter as the **Job Responsibility Code** and choose the **OK** button.  

The **Segment** page now contains a list of contacts based on the filter you entered. On the **General** FastTab, in the **No. of Lines** field, you can see at a glance the number of contacts that meet these criteria.  

> [!NOTE]  
> You can save your segmentation criteria to be reused at a later stage.

### To save your segmentation criteria

1. On the **Segment** page, choose **Actions**.
2. Choose **Functions**, then **Segment**, and then choose the **Save Criteria** action.  
3. On the **Save Segment Criteria** page, enter a code for the segment. In the **Description** field, enter a description of the segment criteria.
4. Choose the **OK** button.  

## Mining the data

 The marketing manager takes a closer look at the segmented list of contacts and realizes that the list is much too large. The manager decides to reduce the list based on actual, prospective customers to focus on the correct target group. This process of refining and reducing the data is also referred to as data mining.  

### To remove contacts from the segment  

1. On the **Segment** page, choose **Actions**.
2. In the menu bar below, choose **Functions**, choose **Contacts**, and the choose **Reduce Contacts**.  

  This opens the **Remove Contacts – Reduce** dialog.  
4. On the **Contact Business Relation** FastTab, select the **CUST** filter as the **Business Relation Code**, and choose the **OK** button.

 The **Segment** page now contains a reduced list of contacts, and in the **No. of Lines** field, you can see the number of contacts that now meet these new criteria.  

 > [!NOTE]  
 > If you have to reverse this removal of a group of contacts, you can do this using the **Go Back** function. In other words, you can undo your last segmentation.  

### To bring back the removed contacts

1. On the **Segment** page, choose the **Segment** action.
2. Choose the **Go Back** action.

The contacts that you removed are added back to the list of contacts.

## Linking a segment to a campaign

The marketing manager decides that the reduced list is the final list of contacts that they want to be part of the campaign. They therefore link this segment to the campaign FUTURUS trade show.  

### To link a segment to the campaign  

1. On the **Segment** page, on the **Campaign** FastTab, choose the **Campaign No.** field to select the campaign that you want the segment to be attached to, for example, **CP0001**.
2. Select **Yes**.  
3. Since this segment is the target of the campaign, select the **Campaign Target** check box and choose **Yes**.  

## Sending letters and email messages to contacts

 The marketing staffer helps the marketing manager send out correspondence to the prospective customers, in which they thank them for visiting the trade show.

### To use a segment to send a letter to a contact  

> [!NOTE]  
> In this procedure you have to attach a Word document. You can add attachments in any language.

> [!NOTE]  
> If needed click on the **Edit Pencil** icon to open the page in edit mode.

1. Open the **Segment** card for the **Visitors at the FUTURUS trade show**.  
2. On the **Interaction** FastTab, in the **Interaction Template Code** field, select the Business Letter template code **BUS** and select **Yes**.
3. Choose the **Language Code (Default)** field to open the **Segment Interaction Languages** page. Select a **Language Code** and then choose the **OK** button.
4. Make sure that the **Correspondence Type (Default)** is set to **Hard Copy**.
5. In the **Attachment** field, select the **Ellipsis** box. This opens the Import Attachment dialog.
    1. Select the **Choose** button to choose your file.
    1. Find the file and select the **Open** button to attach it.
6. In the **Subject (Default)** field, enter the following example text: **Thank you for visiting the trade show**. Select the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key to leave the field, and select the **Yes** button.
7. Slide the **Send Word Docs as Attmt** to on and select the **Yes** button.
8. Choose the action **Log**. In the Log Segment pop-up window enable:
 **Create Follow-up Segment**
9. Choose the **OK** button to start the **Log Segment batch job**.  

The attachments are sent. When the process is done, choose the **OK** button for the message that states that the segment has been logged.  

 The letters are automatically printed and the segment is logged. Because the segment has been logged, it's no longer in the list of segments but is moved to the list of logged segments. To see that list, Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Logged Segments**, and then choose the related link.  

After the segment is logged, each letter that is sent is recorded as an interaction, which you can view in the log.  

Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Interaction Log Entries**, and then choose the related link. There's an entry for each sent letter.  

### To send an email message to a contact  

1. On the **Interaction** FastTab, in the **Interaction Template Code** field, select the Business Letter template, code **BUS**.  
2. In the **Subject (Default)** field, enter the following example text: **Thank you for visiting the trade show**.  
3. In the **Correspondence Type** field, choose **E-Mail**.  
4. Specify language settings, and attach a Word document, as in the previous procedure.  
5. Choose the **Log** action. The **Log Segment** page opens.  
6. Select the **Send Attachments** check box to have the attachments sent by email.  
7. Select the **Create Follow-up Segment** check box.  
8. Choose the **OK** button.  

 The letters are automatically sent by email, and the segment is logged. Because the segment has been logged, it's no longer in the list of segments but is saved in the list of logged segments. To see that list, Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Logged Segments**, and then choose the related link.  

## Register campaign responses

 During the next couple of weeks, the prospective customers respond to the letter. The marketing manager wants to keep track of the responses and records these interactions.  

 For this purpose, set up a segment for the contacts who have responded to the letter.  

### To register campaign responses  

1. On the **Segment** page, on the **Interaction** FastTab, choose the **Interaction Template Code** field.  

 There's no interaction template for recording responses to campaigns. Therefore, create a new template.  

2. On the **Interaction Templates** dropdown, choose the **New** action.  
3. In the **Code** field, enter **RESP**, and in the **Description** field, enter **Campaign Responses**.  
4. Choose the **OK** button.
5. Choose **Yes** to confirm that you want to apply this interaction template code to all segment lines.
6. On the **Campaign** FastTab, select the **Campaign Response** field. Choose **Yes** to confirm the message *You have modified Campaign Response*.  
7. On the **Segment** page, choose the **Log** action.  
8. On the **Log Segment** page, clear the **Send Attachments** check box. Then choose the **OK** button to confirm the message that the segment has been logged.

# Import Multiple Item Pictures
You can import multiple item pictures in one go. Simply name your picture files with names corresponding to your item numbers, compress them to a zip file, and then use the Import Item Pictures page to manage which item pictures to import.

All common file formats are supported.

## To name picture files by the item names and prepare the ZIP file
1. At the location where your item pictures are stored, name each files according to the number of the related item. For example:

    |Item No.|File Name|
    |-|-|
    |1000|1000.bmp|
    |1001|1001.bmp|
    |1002|1002.bmp|

2. Collect all the files in a ZIP file. For example, in Windows Explorer, select the files, and then choose **Send to**, **Compressed (zipped) folder**.     

## To import item pictures
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Inventory Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **Import Item Pictures** action.
3. In the **Select a ZIP file** field, select the relevant ZIP folder, and then choose the **Open** button.

    A line for each item and picture is created on the **Import Item Pictures** page.

    > [!NOTE]
    > For item cards that already have a picture, the **Picture Already Exists** check box is selected. If you do not want any existing pictures to be replaced, deselect the **Replace Pictures** check box. If you do not want individual existing pictures to be replaced, delete the lines in question.

3. Choose the **Import Pictures** action.

The **Import Status** field is updated to show if the picture import was skipped or completed.

# Set up the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-finance-app-name](includes/power-bi-finance-app-name.md)]

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

This article explains how to set up the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-finance-app-name](includes/power-bi-finance-app-name.md)] in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

For the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-finance-app-name](includes/power-bi-finance-app-name.md)] to show correct KPIs and reports, do two things in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]:

1. Set up G/L account categories for your chart of accounts.
1. Map G/L account categories to corresponding categories used in the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/powerbi-name.md)] Finance semantic model.

## Prerequisites

Before you configure the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-finance-app-name](includes/power-bi-finance-app-name.md)] for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you must:

1. Have a connector (AL) app that contains APIs, setup pages, and embed pages. Connectors are preinstalled with [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].
1. Install the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] template app that contains a [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] semantic model and [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports for finance.
1. Run the **Connect to Power BI** assisted setup guide.

To learn more, go to [Install Power BI apps for Business Central](across-powerbi-install-business-central-apps.md).

## Configure date filtering for the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-finance-app-name](includes/power-bi-finance-app-name.md)] semantic model

This section describes how to configure date filtering for the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-finance-app-name](includes/power-bi-finance-app-name.md)]. You can configure the app to load data based on the **Start Date** and **End Date**. This filter helps improve performance in your [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] environment and reduce [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] load times by only loading the data you intend to analyze.

> [!NOTE]
> Configuring date filtering for the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-finance-app-name](includes/power-bi-finance-app-name.md)] is optional, and is designed to help manage large datasets.

The **Start Date** and **End Date** filter can apply to the following tables:

- G/L Entries (related to the Income Statement)
- G/L Budget Entries
- Customer Ledger Entries
- Vendor Ledger Entries

### Set up date filtering

1. Search and open the **[Power BI Connector Setup](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com?page=36951)** page.
1. Expand the **Finance Report** section.
1. Fill in the **Start Date** and **End Date** fields under **Income Statement & G/L Budget Entry Filters**.

Repeat steps 2-3 for the date setup under **Customer Ledger Entry Filters** and **Vendor Ledger Entry Filters**.

The following fields are available on the **Finance Report** FastTab:

|No.| Data Area | Field Name | Description |
|---| ---       | ---        | ---         |
|1  | Income Statement and G/L Budgets   | Start Date      | Specifies the starting date to apply to a range of income statement G/L entries and G/L budget entries.   |
|2  | Income Statement and G/L Budgets   | End Date        | Specifies the end date to apply to a range of income statement G/L entries and G/L budget entries.        |
|3  | Customer Ledger Entries            | Start Date      | Specifies the starting date to apply to a range of customer ledger entries.                               |  
|4  | Customer Ledger Entries            | End Date        | Specifies the end date to apply to a range of customer ledger entries.                                    |
|5  | Vendor Ledger Entries            | Start Date      | Specifies the starting date to apply to a range of vendor ledger entries.                                 |
|6  | Vendor Ledger Entries            | End Date        | Specifies the end date to apply to a range of vendor ledger entries.                                      |

## Set up G/L account categories for your chart of accounts

G/L account categories are groups of general ledger accounts. The categories are required for using the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/powerbi-name.md)] Finance app.

For each posting account in your chart of accounts, you must specify an **Account Category** and **Account Subcategory**. You don't need to set up the totaling accounts.

To learn more about how to work with G/L account categories, go to [G/L account categories](./finance-general-ledger.md#account-categories).

## Map G/L account categories to corresponding categories used in the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/powerbi-name.md)] Finance semantic model

The [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/powerbi-name.md)] Finance app has default mappings for G/L account categories in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to corresponding values in the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/powerbi-name.md)] Finance semantic model. This mapping enables the finance KPIs and reports to show correct values.

The following sections show the default mappings. You can change the default values of the **Business Central Category** columns to your choice of G/L account categories by choosing the **Power BI Account Categories** action on the **Power BI Connector Setup** setup page or directly on the **Power BI Account Categories** page.

### Level 1 Categories

Level 1 categories are the top-level categories without indentation.

| Power BI Account Category                 | Business Central Category |
| ---                                       | ---                       |
| Assets (Level 1 Category)                 | Assets                    |
| Liabilities (Level 1 Category)            | Liabilities               |
| Equity (Level 1 Category)                 | Equity                    |
| Revenue (Level 1 Category)                | Income                    |
| Cost of Goods Sold (Level 1 Category)     | Cost of Goods Sold        |
| Expense (Level 1 Category)                | Expense                   |

### Level 2 Categories

Level 2 categories are the second-level categories with indentation.

| Power BI Account Category	| Business Central Category     |
|---                    |---                              |
| Current Assets (Level 2 Category) | Current Assets   |
| Current Liabilities (Level 2 Category)  | Current Liabilities   |
| Shareholder's Equity (Level 2 Category) | Common Stock          |
| Interest Expense (Level 2 Category)     | Interest Expense      |
| Tax Expense (Level 2 Category)          | Tax Expense            |
| Extraordinary Expense (Level 2 Category) | Extraordinary Expense |
| FX Losses Expense (Level 2 Category)     | FX Losses Expense  |
| Depreciation and Amortization (Level 2 Category) 	| Depreciation and Amortization     |
| Interest Revenue (Level 2 Category)  | Interest Income        |
| FX Gains Revenue (Level 2 Category)  | FX Gains Income         |
| Extraordinary Revenue (Level 2 Category) | Extraordinary Income   |
| Fixed Assets (Level 2 Category)          | Fixed Assets           |
| Payroll Liabilities (Level 2 Category)   | Payroll Liabilities     |
| Long-term Liabilities (Level 2 Category)  | Long Term Liabilities   |

### Level 3 Categories

Level 3 categories are the subcategories of Level 2 with indentation.

| Power BI Account Category                 | Business Central Category |
| ---                                       | ---                       |
| Inventory (Level 3 Category)              | Inventory                 |
| Accounts Payable (Level 3 Category)       | Accounts Payable          |
| Accounts Receivable (Level 3 Category)    | Accounts Receivable       |
| Purchases (Level 3 Category)              | Purchases                 |
| Purchase Prepayments (Level 3 Category)   | Prepaid Expenses          |
| Liquid Assets (Level 3 Category)          | Cash                      |

## Troubleshooting

If you experience issues with the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-finance-app-name](includes/power-bi-finance-app-name.md)], the information in the following sections might help you get unblocked.

### Getting the "Column Entry No. in Table G/L Entries contains a duplicate value" error?

When you refresh data from your [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] environment into the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-finance-app-name](includes/power-bi-finance-app-name.md)], a refresh error might happen with the following error message:

```
Something went wrong
There was an error when processing the data in the dataset.
Please try again later or contact support. If you contact support, please provide these details.

Data source error: Column '<oii>Entry No.</oii>' in Table '<oii>G/L Entries</oii>' contains a duplicate value
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you get this error, you're affected by a bug in the semantic model for the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-finance-app-name](includes/power-bi-finance-app-name.md)].

This error indicates that there are duplicate G/L entries in the Finance fact table in the semantic model. The error displays when we attempt to combine the three sub-queries (Balance Sheet G/L Entries, Income Statement G/L Entries, and Close Income Statement G/L Entries) into the single G/L Entries Fact table.

The current Balance Sheet G/L Entries query has a hard-coded filter transformation. This filter assumes that the source code for closing entries is CLSINCOME. This leads the model to allow closing entries to exist in both the Balance Sheet query and the Closing Entries query, resulting in duplicate entries.

### Getting the "Column ‘G/L Account No.’ in Table ‘G/L Account’ contains a duplicate value" error?

When you refresh data from your [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] environment into the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-finance-app-name](includes/power-bi-finance-app-name.md)], a refresh error might happen due to how your **Begin-Total** and **End-Total** accounts are configured in your **Chart of Accounts**.

If you receive this error, review the totaling accounts.

```
Something went wrong
There was an error when processing the data in the dataset.
Please try again later or contact support. If you contact support, please provide these details.

Data source error: Column 'G/L Account No.' in Table 'G/L Account' contains a duplicate value 'X' and this is not allowed for columns on the one side of a many-to-one relationship or for columns that are used as the primary key of a table.
```

**Why did this happen?**

This error can happen because the Finance Connector app relies on the totaling accounts for hierarchy and indentation purposes.

Your totaling for an **End-Total** account must exactly reference both the **Begin-Total** and **End-Total** accounts. You can only use one **Begin-Total** account in one **End-Total** account.

**Fix the totaling on your G/L Accounts**

The following example shows how to set up the totaling accounts.

1. A **Begin-Total** account of **1300 (Vehicles)** and the **End-Total** account of **1390 (Vehicles, Total)**.
2. The totaling defined for the **End-Total** is **1300..1390**. Any other combination for your totaling account (such as 1300..1340, 1310..1390, or 1310..1340, etc.) can cause the error.
3. One **Begin-Total** account can only be used in one **End-Total** account. If you use a **Begin-Total** account in two or more **End-Total** accounts, the [!INCLUDE [power-bi-finance-app-name](includes/power-bi-finance-app-name.md)] can't match it to an **End-Total** account.

# The WorldPay Payments Standard extension

> [!CAUTION]
> The WorldPay Payments Standard extension will be deprecated. The code is marked as obsolete starting in 2023 release wave 2. The app will be active for the next three major releases and then it will be removed.

The WorldPay Payments Standard extension lets you offer customers a convenient alternative to making payments through bank transfers or credit cards. Not only that, payments made through payment services will typically land in your bank account more quickly.

If you enable the extension, when you send a sales invoice by email the document includes a link to the payment service in the email body and in the attached PDF document. A customer can choose the link, and then use the payment service to make the payment.

Enabling payment service extensions is free in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], however, you'll need to contact the payment service to get an account. For more information, see [Enable Customer Payment Through Payment Services](sales-how-enable-payment-service-extensions.md).

# Run and print reports in Business Central

Reports help you collect and display data based on specific criteria. It organizes and presents the information in an easy-to-read format you can print or save as a file. There are many reports you can access throughout the application. The reports typically provide information related to the context of the page you're on. For example, the **Customer** page includes reports for the top 10 customers, sales statistics, and more.

> [!NOTE]
> Batch jobs and XMLports do more or less the same as reports, but are used more to process or export data. For example, the **Create Reminders** batch job creates reminder documents to send to customers with overdue payments. This article refers mainly to "reports", but similar information applies to batch jobs and XMLports.

## Get started

You can find reports in the **Reports** menu on selected pages, lists, and cards. You can also use the search ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do.") to find reports by name. For an overview of built-in reports, you can use in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], sorted by categories, go to [Report overview](reports-available-reports.md).

When you choose a report, a request page titled after the report's name where you set various options and filters that determine what data is included is available. The following sections explain how to use the request page to build, preview, and print a report.

## <a name="SavedSettings"></a>Use default values&mdash;predefined settings

Most report request pages include the **Use default values from** field. With this field, you can select predefined settings for the report, which automatically set options and filters. Select an entry from the dropdown list to view the options and filters on the report request page change accordingly.

The entry called **Last used options and filters** is always available. This entry sets the report to use the options and filters you used the last time you ran the report.

The **Use default values from** field provides a fast and reliable way to consistently generate reports with the correct data. After you select an entry, you can change any of the options and filters before you preview or print the report. The changes you make aren't saved to the predefined settings entry you select, but they're saved to the **Last used options and filters** entry.

> [!NOTE]
> The predefined settings are typically set up and managed by an administrator. Learn more in [Manage Saved Settings for Reports and Batch Jobs](reports-saving-reusing-settings.md).

## Specify the data to include in a report

Use the fields under **Options** and **Filters** to change or limit the information you want in the report. You can set filters in a report in more or less the same way as you set filters on lists. Learn more in the [Filtering](ui-enter-criteria-filters.md#filtering) section.

> [!CAUTION]
> The **Filter** FastTab on a report request page provides a generic filtering capability for reports. These filters are optional.
>
> Some reports ignore any such filters, which means no matter what filter is set in the **Filter** FastTab, the output of the report is the same. It's not possible to provide a list of which fields are ignored in which reports, so you need to experiment with the filters when using them.
>
> **Example**: When you use the **Create Reminders** batch job, a filter for the **Customer Ledger Entries** field of **Last Issued Reminder Level** is ignored because filters are fixed for that batch job.

## Preview a report

By previewing a report, you can review what the report looks like before you print it. The preview isn't based on the printer selected in the **Printer** field on the request page. The browser controls how the preview is displayed. After previewing, you can then go back to the request page and make changes to options and filters as you need.

The preview choices on the **Report Request** page depend on the report. So, for some reports, you can select **Preview**, while for others, the choice is **Preview & Close**. Both choices open a preview of the report. The difference is that **Preview** keeps the request page open, so you can go back to it, make changes, preview again, or print. In contrast, with **Preview & Close** the request page closes, and you have to open the report again to make changes or print.

> [!NOTE]
> If you're using Business Central 2020 release wave 1 or earlier, the only choice is **Preview**, which closes the request page on preview, as described for **Preview & Close**.

### Work with the preview

In the preview, use the menu bar on the report preview to:

- Move through pages
- Zoom in and out
- Resize to fit the page
- Select text
  
  You can copy text from a report, then paste it somewhere else, such as a page in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] or Microsoft Word. Using a mouse, for example, select the left mouse button and hold where you want to start. Slide the mouse to select one or more words, sentences, or paragraphs. Then select the right mouse button and select **Copy**. You can now paste the selected text where you want it.

- Pan the document
  
  You can move the visible area of the report in any direction to view other areas of the report. Panning is helpful when you zoom in to review details. Using your mouse, for example, select and hold the left mouse button anywhere in the report preview, and then move your mouse to select a section of the report.

- Download to a PDF file on your computer or network.
- Print

## Save a report to a file

You can save a report to a PDF document, Microsoft Word document, Microsoft Excel workbook, or XML document by choosing **Send to**, then making your selection. A file is downloaded to your computer.

If your organization configured OneDrive for system features, instead of being downloaded, Excel workbooks and Word documents are opened in your browser using either Excel or Word for the web.

> [!TIP]
> The **Microsoft Excel Document (data only)** and **XML Document** options are mostly for advanced purposes. You'd typically use these options to do detailed data analysis. Learn more at [Analyzing report data with Excel and XML](report-analyze-excel.md).
>
> You can also use **Microsoft Excel Document (data only)** to create new Excel layouts for a given report. Learn more at [Working with Microsoft Excel layouts](ui-excel-report-layouts.md).  

## <a name="ScheduleReport"></a> Schedule a report to run later or periodically

You can schedule a single or recurring report to run at a specific date and time. Scheduled reports are entered in the job queue and processed at the scheduled time, similar to other jobs. Select the **Schedule** option after selecting **Send to**, then enter information, such as the printer, and time and date. The report is added to the job queue and runs at the specified time. When the report is processed, the item is removed from the job queue. Learn more at [Use job queues to schedule tasks](admin-job-queues-schedule-tasks.md).  

When you schedule a report to run, you can specify, for example, that it must run every Thursday by setting the **Next Run Date Formula** field to *D4*. Learn more in the [Use date formulas](ui-enter-date-ranges.md#use-date-formulas) section.  

You can save the report to a file (such as Excel, Word, or PDF), print it, or only generate the report. If you save the report to a file, then the processed report is sent to the **Report Inbox** page on your Role Center for you to view it. Learn more at [Share and export reports with the report inbox](ui-work-report-inbox.md).

### Manage scheduled recurring reports

Batch jobs generate scheduled reports managed on the **Job Queue Entries** page. You can view each report's status and other information on the page, pause/resume the report batch job, and generate the report on demand.

From the **Job Queue Entries** page, you can also change some report parameters, such as the output file type, recurrence, run date, and starting and ending times. Before you edit an existing scheduled report, however, it's necessary to put the report job queue on hold:

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do.") icon, enter **Job Queue Entries**, then select the related link.  
2. On the **Job Queue Entries** page, select the desired report.
3. Select the **Set On Hold** action.
4. Open and edit the scheduled report by selecting its status (*On Hold*).

After you edit the report options, repeat the first two steps and then select the **Set Status to Ready** action to resume generating the report.

Learn more about job queue management at [Use job queues to schedule tasks](admin-job-queues-schedule-tasks.md).  

## <a name="PrintReport"></a>Print a report

To print a report, select **Print** on the report request page or on the menu bar of the **Preview** page.

When a report uses an Excel layout, you don't have the **Printer** field or **Print** or **Preview** buttons. Instead, there's a **Download** option. To print, select **Download**, then open the downloaded file in Excel and print from there.

### <a name="Printer"></a>Printer

The **Printer** field on the request page shows the name of printer the report is sent to. To change a printer, just select the printer from the list.

> [!NOTE]
> The **(Handled by the browser)** option indicates there's no designated printer for the report. In this case, the browser handles the printout and displays the standard printing steps, where you can choose a local printer connected to your computer. The **(Handled by the browser)** option isn't available in the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] mobile app or app for Microsoft Teams.

> [!TIP]
> The printer selected for you by default is set up on the **Printer Selections** page. Learn more about how you can change the default printer in the [Set up default printers](ui-specify-printer-selection-reports.md#default) section.

### Print reports in Thai

Specifically for the Thai version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the **Print** button can't print reports correctly because of limitations in the service that generates the printable PDF file. Instead, you can open the report in Word and then save the report as a printable PDF.  

Or, you can ask your administrator to create a Word report layout for your most used reports. Learn more at [Report and document layouts overview](ui-manage-report-layouts.md).  

## Switch the report layout

A report layout controls how the content is arranged, the organization of the content and the style of the report. There are a few ways to change the layout:

- When you're setting up to run a report, view the current layout in the **Report Layout** field on the request page. To temporarily switch to a different layout, select the **Report Layout** field, then select from a list of available layouts for the report.
- To change the default layout used by a report, go to either the **Report Layouts** or **Report Layout Selection** pages.

Learn more at [Set the layout used by a report](ui-set-report-layout.md). Or, if you want to customize your own report layout, go to [Get started creating report layouts](ui-get-started-layouts.md).

## Change language and format of numbers, dates, and times

By default, the language of text and format of numbers, dates, and times in a report are based on your working language and region settings, which are defined on the **My Settings** page. You can, however, change the language and format region on a case-by-case basis when you preview, print, or send a report. On the request page, set the **Language** and **Format Region** options to your preference. You can also specify the language and region format to use by default for customers and vendors on their card pages.

Depending on where you specified the language and format settings, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] determines the settings to use in the following order:

1. The settings you specify when you generate a report.
2. The settings specified on the document, which come from the customer or vendor's settings.
3. The settings specified on the Report AL object.
4. The settings defined in My Settings.

For more information about the **My Settings** page, go to [Change basic settings](ui-change-basic-settings.md).

## Advanced options

The fields under the **Advanced** FastTab set limitations on the generated report to control printer resources. You typically don't need to change these settings, unless you're working with a large report. If a report exceeds these limitations when you try to preview or print, a message appears indicating which limitations are exceeded. You can then change the settings to suit your report. Each field, however, has a maximum value you should be aware of:

|Field|Maximum value|
|-----|-------------|
|Maximum rendering time|12:00:00|
|Maximum rows|1000000|
|Maximum documents|500|

> [!NOTE]
> The maximum values might be different for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, and an administrator can change them. Learn more in the [Reports settings](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/configure-server-instance#Reports) section. For an overview of report limitations in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, go to [Operational limits](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/operational-limits-online).

## Get help for a report

Get help using a report in two ways: teaching tips and help pane.

### Teaching tip for a report

Many reports in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] have a teaching tip to increase your chance of success with the report. The title and description of these teaching tips try to answer the following hypothetical questions:

- What is this report about?
- What can I do with this report?

With teaching tips, the report creator helps you understand the logic relevant to the report, allowing you to start your reporting task immediately without being blocked. After you dismiss a teaching tip, you can select or hover over the report title on the request page to reopen the teaching tip.

Learn more in [In-product tips](product-help-and-support.md#in-product-tips)

### Help pane for a report

When the report request page is open, select the **Help** question mark in the top-right corner of the role center to open the help pane. Here, you find the teaching tip text (if defined on the report). You also find relevant links to documentation articles that explain related topics in more depth.

Learn more in [Help pane](product-help-and-support.md#help-pane)

# Managing receivables

A regular step in any financial rhythm is to reconcile bank accounts. To close sales invoices and purchase credit memos as paid, you apply incoming payments to customer or vendor ledger entries.

While most customers in B2B environments pay some time after delivery, leaving the posted sales invoices open for the Accounts Receivable department to close (apply) when payment is received, some sales invoices can be paid immediately, for example with PayPal. Such invoices are immediately applied as paid when they're posted and, therefore, don't appear as payments to be processes in AR. For more information, see, for example, [Invoice Sales](sales-how-invoice-sales.md).  

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], one of the fastest ways to register payments is with the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page by importing a bank statement file or feed. The payments are applied to open customer or vendor ledger entries based on data matches between payment text and entry information. You can review and change the matches before you post the journal, and close bank account ledger entries for ledger entries when you post the journal. The bank account is reconciled when all payments are applied.

Other pages exist where you can either apply payments or reconcile bank accounts:

* The **Bank Account Reconciliations** page, where you reconcile bank accounts by matching imported bank statement lines with your system bank account ledger entries. Here, you can also reconcile check payments. For more information, see [Reconcile Bank Accounts](bank-how-reconcile-bank-accounts-separately.md). Here, you can't apply payments.
* The **Payment Registration** page, where you can manually apply payments received as cash, check, or bank transaction against a generated list of unpaid sales documents. This functionality is available only for sales documents. Here, you can't apply outgoing payments, and you can't reconcile bank accounts.
* The **Cash Receipt Journal** page, where you manually post receipts to the relevant general ledger, customer, or other account by entering a payment line. You can either apply the receipt or refund to one or more open entries before you post the cash receipt journal, or from the customer ledger entries. Here, you can't reconcile bank accounts.

The **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page uses automatic matching logic that you can set up on the **Payment Application Rules** page. For more information, see [Set Up Rules for Automatic Application of Payments](receivables-how-set-up-payment-application-rules.md).  

Other aspects of managing receivables include to collect outstanding balances, including finance charges and reminders, and to set bank accounts up to allow customers' payments to be withdrawn from their account automatically.

# Assemble to project

Assemble to project helps you improve inventory management by assembling to order only when it's required.

When you choose an assemble-to-order item on a project planning line, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates an assembly order. The assembly order is based on the project planning line, and its lines are based on the item's assembly bill of materials (BOM). To learn more about assembly BOMs, go to [Work with Assembly BOMs](assembly-how-work-assembly-boms.md). The quantity of components on the assembly BOM is multiplied by the order quantity. The **Assemble-to-Order Lines** page shows details about the linked assembly order lines. The details can help you customize the assembly item. As in sales, you can't directly post linked assembly orders. To learn more about assembly orders, go to [Selling Inventory Items in Assemble-to-Order Flows](assembly-how-to-sell-inventory-items-in-assemble-to-order-flows.md).

Assembly orders are reserved for projects, and [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] synchronizes item tracking between project planning lines and assembly order.

## Integrate with warehouse management

Assemble to project integrates with warehouse management features to make assembly and shipping easier. The process also helps ensure that the flow from project assembly to delivery runs smoothly in internal warehouse processes. To learn more about internal warehouse flows for projects, go to [Flows for Production, Assembly, and Jobs](design-details-internal-warehouse-flows.md#flows-to-and-from-assembly-in-a-basic-warehouse-configuration).

The following table describes the warehouse configurations that assemble to order supports.

|Configuration  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|**No warehouse handling**|Use a project journal to post full or partial usage. The output and consumption of components post automatically for the assembly order.         |
|**Inventory pick**|Use an inventory pick to post full or partial usage. The output and consumption of components post automatically for the assembly order.          |
|**Warehouse pick**|Create and register warehouse picks for components, and then use a project journal to post usage. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] verifies whether the consumed assembly components were picked. The output and consumption of components post automatically for the assembly order.         |

## Known limitations

This section describes known limitations for assemble to project.

* The **Quantity to Assemble to Order** field isn't available for projects that are closed.
* For warehouse pick scenarios, the **Quantity to Assemble to Order** can be either zero or equal to the quantity. You can't mix assemble to order and assemble to stock on a project planning line. You must create separate project planning lines.
* Assemble to order doesn't affect billable parts of a project. An assembly is included on sales invoices, but not its components. You can't edit the **Quantity to Assemble to Order** field for billable lines.
* Order planning and the planning worksheet aren't affected because the project is the input for planning. The planning engine considers the assembly as demand.
* You can't enter a negative quantity in the **Quantity to Assemble to Order** field.
* You can't undo an assembly.

# Depreciate or amortize fixed assets

Depreciation is used to allocate the cost of fixed assets, such as machinery and equipment, over their depreciable life. For each fixed asset, you must define how to depreciate it.  

 There are two ways to post depreciation:  

* Automatically, by running the **Calculate Depreciation** batch job.  
* Manually, by using the fixed asset G/L journal.  

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can calculate daily depreciation, which allows you to calculate depreciation for any period. You can therefore analyze current operating results on, for example, a monthly, quarterly, or annual basis. The calculation uses a standard year of 360 days and a standard month of 30 days. For more information, see [Depreciation Methods](fa-depreciation-methods.md).  

If several departments use a fixed asset, periodic depreciation can be automatically allocated to these departments according to a user-defined allocation table.  

You can cancel incorrect depreciation entries by using the **Cancel FA Ledger Entries** batch job. Afterward, you can post the correct amount by running the **Calculate Depreciation** batch job again. The errors you correct are posted as fixed asset error ledger entries.  

Indexation is used to adjust values for general price-level changes. You can use the **Index Fixed Assets** batch job to recalculate the depreciation amounts.  

## To calculate depreciation automatically

Once a month, or whenever you choose, you can run the **Calculate Depreciation** batch job. The batch job ignores fixed assets that were sold, are blocked or inactive, or use the manual depreciation method.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Calculate Depreciation**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  
3. Choose the **OK** button.  

    The batch job calculates the depreciation and creates lines in the fixed asset G/L journal.

4. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **FA G/L Journals**, and then choose the related link.  

    On the **Fixed Asset G/L Journal** page, in the **No. of Depreciation Days** field, you can see how many days of depreciation were calculated.  
5. Choose the **Post** action.  

> [!NOTE]
> Known limitation: If you set the **Use Force No. of Days** field to Yes, and the **Force No. of Days** field is set to a value where **Posting Date** minus **Number of Days** results in a date in the previous calendar year, the system will not let you post the depreciation.
> You can avoid it by reducing the **Force No. of Days** field to no more than than the calculated days until posting date using 30days/month OR set the flag **Fiscal Year 365 Days** in the Depreciation Book.
> We recommend the first option as you may not want to change the use of 30days/months for depreciation. For more information, see [Fiscal Year 365 Days Field Depreciation](fa-how-setup-depreciation.md#fiscal-year-365-days-field-depreciation).


## To post depreciation manually from the fixed asset G/L journal

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Fixed Asset G/L Journal**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Create an initial journal line and fill in the fields as necessary.  
3. In the **FA Posting Type** field, select **Depreciation**.  
4. Choose the **Insert FA Bal. Account** action. A second journal line is created for the balancing account that is set up for depreciation posting. For more information, see [To set up fixed asset posting groups](fa-how-setup-general.md#to-set-up-fixed-asset-posting-groups).
5. Choose the **Post** action to post the journal.  

The **Book Value** field on the **Fixed Asset Card** page is updated accordingly.

If you set up fixed asset allocation keys to allocate amounts to different departments or projects, the amounts are allocated during posting. For more information, see [Set Up General Fixed Assets Information](fa-how-setup-general.md).  

## To manage the ending book value

In the **Ending Book Value** field on the **FA Depreciation Books** page, you can specify the book value that you want your fixed asset to have in the current depreciation book after you fully depreciate it. You can enter the value manually, or you can fill in the **Default Ending Book Value** field on the related **Depreciation Book** page. The value automatically fills in the field.

> [!NOTE]
> If the last depreciation means that the **Book Value** field on the **Fixed Asset Card** page is zero, the last depreciation is automatically reduced by this amount.<br /><br />
> If the value in the **Book Value** field is greater than zero after the last depreciation,  for example because of a rounding problem or because a salvage value exists, the value in the **Ending Book Value** field on the **FA Depreciation Books** page is ignored. For more information, see [To post the salvage value together with the acquisition cost](fa-how-acquire.md#to-post-the-salvage-value-together-with-the-acquisition-cost).

## To calculate allocations for a Fixed Asset


1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **FA Posting Groups**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose **Related**, **Posting Group**, **Allocations** and then select **Depreciation**.
3. Fill in the G/L accounts and the corresponding allocation percentages for each posting group and then close the page.
4. Next, choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Fixed Asset G/L Journals**, and then choose the related link.
5. Enter the Fixed Asset and the corresponding FA Posting Group and Depreciation book will determine the allocation lines.
6. Choose the **Post** action to post the journal.

> [!NOTE]  
> If a fixed asset is used by several departments, you can select the dimension on the Fixed Asset G/L Journal line.

## Use duplication lists to prepare to post to multiple depreciation books

When you fill in journal lines to post to a depreciation book, you can duplicate the lines in a separate journal so you can post to a different depreciation book. For more information, see To [post entries to different depreciation books](fa-how-depreciate-amortize.md#to-post-entries-to-different-depreciation-books).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Depreciation Books**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the depreciation book, and then select the **Part of Duplication List** check box.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>   If you have selected the **Use Duplication List** field, do not use number series on the journal. The reason is that the number series for the fixed asset G/L journal does not the number series for the fixed asset journal.  

## To post entries to different depreciation books

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Fixed Asset G/L Journal**, and then choose the related link.  
2. In the journal that you want to post depreciation with, select the **Use Duplication List** check box.  
3. Fill in the remaining fields as necessary.  
4. Choose the **Post** action.  
5. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **FA Journals**, and then choose the related link.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > The **Fixed Asset Journal** page contains new lines for different depreciation books according to the duplication list.  
6. Review or edit the lines, and then choose the **Post** action.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > Another way to duplicate an entry in a separate book is to enter a depreciation book code in the **Duplicate in Depreciation Book** field when you fill in a journal line.  

You can copy entries from one depreciation book to another by using the **Copy Depreciation Book** batch job. The batch job creates journal lines in the journal batch that you specified on the **FA Journal Setup** page for the depreciation book that you want to copy to. To learn more, go to [To copy fixed asset ledger entries between depreciation books](#to-copy-fixed-asset-ledger-entries-between-depreciation-books).  

## To copy fixed asset ledger entries between depreciation books

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Depreciation Books**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the relevant depreciation book card, and then choose the **Copy Depreciation Book** action.  
3. On the **Copy Depreciation Book** page, fill in the fields as necessary.  
4. Choose the **OK** button.  

The copied lines are created in either the fixed asset G/L journal or the fixed asset journal, depending on whether the depreciation book that you're copying has integration to the general ledger.

# Accessibility and Keyboard Shortcuts

This article provides information about the features that make [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] readily available to people with disabilities. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports the following accessibility features:  

- Keyboard shortcuts. See [Keyboard Shortcuts](keyboard-shortcuts.md).
- Touch and pen gestures on tablets and phones. See [Touch and Pen Gestures](touch-gestures.md).
- Navigation  
- Headings  
- Alternative text for images and links  
- Support for common assistive technologies 
- Zoom in or out on any page
- Tooltips on elements in the user interface

[!INCLUDE [about-ui-learn](includes/about-ui-learn.md)]

## <a name="Navigation"></a> Navigation
  
You can use different combinations of the Tab, Shift, and arrow keys of your keyboard to move between elements on a page. Elements include actions, fields and columns, parts, and other controls. In general, select <kbd>Tab</kbd> or <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd> to move to the next or previous element.

When you focus on an area that contains actions, like the navigation bar on the top of role center or action bar on other pages, use the arrows keys to move through the different actions and groups. Select <kbd>Enter</kbd> on a group to open its underlying actions, and then continue using the arrows keys. Select <kbd>Tab</kbd> or <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd> to move out of the action area.

By using the tab order, you can also switch between the main browser page and dialog boxes that request confirmation, for example, or the sign-in page.  

## <a name="Headings"></a> Headings in Content

The HTML source for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] content uses tags to help users of assistive technology to understand the structure and content of the page. For example, on list pages, the columns are defined in TH tags and the column headings are set with TITLE attribute inside the tag. Captions for elements, such as FastTabs, FactBoxes, and fields are included in heading tags (H1, H2, H3, and H4).  

## <a name="Images"></a> Image and Links

A descriptive text for images is set with the ALT attribute inside the IMG tag. A descriptive text for hyperlinks is set with the title attribute inside the A tag.  

## <a name="AssistiveTech"></a> Assistive Technologies

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports various assistive technologies, such as high contrast, screen readers, and voice recognition software. Some assistive technologies may not work well with certain elements in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] pages.  

## <a name="zoom"></a> Zoom

Most browsers use standard keyboard shortcuts to zoom in and out on the current page. These keyboard shortcuts aren't specific to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], but they work when you use [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in a browser. For a list of supported keyboard shortcuts, see [Keyboard Shortcuts for Zooming In and Out](keyboard-shortcuts.md#zoomshortcuts).

## Tooltips

Tooltips are available on most elements in the user interface, like page fields and columns, actions, cues tiles, and charts. A tooltip provides extra text that explains an element to help you better understand its purpose. 

Tooltips are accessed in different ways, depending on the client (web or mobile) and the device that you're working with. Use the following table as a guide. Some tooltips can be read by screen-readers. In this case, you access the tooltips as described in the table, then use the screen reader to navigate to the tooltip as you would with any other element.

#### Accessing tooltips

|Element|Mouse action for web client|Keyboard shortcut for web client|Touch gesture on tablet/phone for mobile app|Screen reader support|
|-------|-----------------|------------|--------------------------|---------------------|
|Page fields and column headings|Hover over or click the field caption or column heading|Move focus to the field or column heading, and select <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Up Arrow</kbd> keys|Tap the field caption |yes|
|Charts elements, like a bar, line, pie slice|Hover over the element|Move focus to element, for example, by using arrow keys|Tap and hold the element|yes|

# Work Center Load (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Work Center Load** report measures the load and the allocated capacity of each work center. Use this report to ensure that work centers aren't overloaded.

:::image type="content" source="media/manufacturing/work-center-load-v26.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Work Center Load Power BI Report" lightbox="media/manufacturing/work-center-load-v26.png":::

## Use the report

The report is meant for manufacturing managers and supervisors.

Manufacturing managers use this report to ensure that loads on work centers don't exceed their available capacity. By analyzing the load percentage and allocated time, you can identify overloaded work centers and take steps to reduce the workload. For example, you might adjust the production schedule or allocate more resources to a particular work center. Additionally, by monitoring the work center load, you can ensure room for contingencies in cases where a work center is loaded to 100%.

Production supervisors use this report to analyze the load percentage and allocated time for work center loads and report them to the manufacturing manager. This information helps ensure that the workload is distributed evenly across all work centers so production runs smoothly.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The *Work Center Load* report includes the following KPIs and measures:

- [Work Center Capacity Total](manufacturing-powerbi-kpis.md#work-center-capacity-total)
- [Work Center Capacity Effective](manufacturing-powerbi-kpis.md#work-center-capacity-effective)
- [Work Center Allocated Time](manufacturing-powerbi-kpis.md#work-center-allocated-time)
- [Work Center Load](manufacturing-powerbi-kpis.md#work-center-load)
- [Work Center Availability After Orders](manufacturing-powerbi-kpis.md#work-center-availability-after-orders)

[!INCLUDE[click-on-a-kpi-link](includes/click-on-a-kpi-link.md)]

[!INCLUDE[powerbi-tip-track-kpis](includes/powerbi-tip-track-kpis.md)]

## Data used in the report

The report uses data from the following tables in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]:

- Calendar Entry
- Prod Order Capacity Need
- Production Order
- Work Center

# Intelligent insights and cloud migration (on-premises only)

If you're using [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, you have full access to scenarios that are based on the intelligent cloud. For example, key performance indicators (KPIs) that are based on machine learning, or when you view your data in Power BI.  

However, if you use [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, you don't have access to the same insights. If you want to benefit from online scenarios, you must migrate to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online. For more information, see [Migrating On-Premises Data to Business Central Online](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/migrate-data) in the administration content for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

## Viewing Insights in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Online

For an on-premises environment for which data was migrated to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, the **Intelligent Cloud Insights** page in the online environment shows four key points of interest for most businesses:

- Cash availability
- Sales profitability
- Net income
- Inventory value

Next to the KPI charts, you get insights into potential areas of concern, including overdue payments. Choose each insight to explore the data.  

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Intelligent cloud insights.](media/across-intelligent-cloud/intelligentcloudApril19.png "Shows the Intelligent Cloud Insights page in Business Central online")

# <a name="default"></a>Specify a default printer  

After printers have been set up in Business Central, you can then specify which printer you want to use by default for all companies in the environment. There are a couple of ways to specify printers to be used by default for reports and other print jobs. A default printer is useful if you work with different reports that require different printers because of their placement or their output capabilities.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The only printers that you can specify as default are **Microsoft Print to PDF** and cloud printers that have already been set up for use in Business Central, like Email printers and Universal Print printers. Cloud printers are typically set up by an admin. For more information, see [Printer Setup and Management](admin-printer-setup-overview.md).

## Set a printer as a default printer for all print jobs

Through the **Printer Management** page you set up a printer as a default printer for all print jobs. You can specify the printer as default for you only or for all users.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Printer Management**, then select the related link.

    > [!TIP]
    > You can also open the **Printer Management** page from the **Printer Selections** page by choosing **Printer Management**.  
2. On the **Printer Management** page, select a printer from the list, choose **Manage**, then choose **Set as my default printer** or **Set as default printer for all users**.

> [!NOTE]
> Setting a default printer from the **Printer Management** adds an entry in the **Printer Selections**.

## Set a default printer for specific reports

The **Printer Selections** page lets you specify the printer a report use by default. Default printers are set on a user-account basis. You can set a default printer for just yourself, another user, or all users.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Printer Selections**, then select the related link. Alternatively, select a printer on the **Printer Management** page, then choose the **Printer Selections** action.
2. Choose the **New** action to add a printer selection for a specific report.
3. Fill in the fields as necessary.

The specified report is now set up to print to the selected printer by default.

> [!NOTE]
> When you print the report in question, you can select a different using the **Print** field on the report request page.

> [!NOTE]
> If you don't set a report up for a specific printer on the **Printer Selections** page, then it's printed to the default printer, as defined on the **Printer Management** page.

You or the administrator can also use the **Printer Selections** page to define other variations of printing for users and reports. The following table describes the combination of values to specify different printing setups for a report.

|To                                                 |Set the following values                                             |
|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
|Print a report to a specific printer for all users |Specify values in the **Report ID** and **Printer Name** fields and leave the **User ID** field blank.|
|Print all reports to a specific printer for a specific user|Specify values in the **User ID** and **Printer Name** fields and leave the **Report ID** field blank. This entry does the same as the **Set as my default printer** action on the **Print Management** page.|
|Set the default printer for all reports for all users|Specify a value in the **Printer Name** field and leave the **User ID** and **Report ID** fields blank. This entry does the same as the **Set as default printer for all users** action on the **Print Management** page.|
|Print a specific report to the user's default printer|Specify a value in the **Report ID** field and leave the **Printer Name** and **User ID** fields blank.|
|Print a specific report to a specific printer for a specific user|Specify values in all three fields.|

> [!NOTE]
> More specific printer selections take precedence over more general printer selections. For example, a printer selection that has values in the **User ID**, **Report ID**, and **Printer Name** fields takes precedence over a printer selection that has blank entries in the **User ID** or **Report ID** fields.

## Choosing the printer when running a report

Instead of using the default printer when running a report, you can override this setting from the request page. Simply choose the printer you want to use for this report generation in the **Printer** dropdown menu.

## Sizing print jobs

Cloud printing is designed for documents of a reasonable size. Most cloud services, including PrintNode and HP ePrint, have a limit of 10 MB per job. If you need to print larger reports, you may have to split them in multiple printouts.

# Design Details: Change the Costing Method for Items

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you cannot change a costing method for an item after you have included the item in a transaction. For example, after you have bought or sold the item. If an incorrect costing method was assigned to the item or items, you might not discover the issue until you do your financial reporting.

This topic describes how to resolve this situation. The recommended approach is to replace the item that has the incorrect costing method with a new item, and use an assembly order to transfer the inventory from the old item to the new.

> [!NOTE]
> Using assembly orders allows the costs to still flow although there are outstanding purchase invoices or shipping charges to post. Additionally, it allows you to undo the conversion and get the quantities of the original items back, if needed.

> [!TIP]
> To become familiar with the process, we recommend that you start the conversion process with a single item or a small set of items.

## About Costing Methods

Costing methods control cost calculations when goods are purchased, received in inventory, and sold. Costing methods affect the timing of amounts recorded in COGS that affect gross profit. It is this flow that calculates COGS. The cost of goods sold (COGS) and revenue are used to determine gross profit, as follows:

*gross profit* = *revenue - COGS*

When you set up inventory items, you must assign a costing method. The method can vary from business to business, and from item to item, so it's important to choose the right one. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports the following costing methods:

* Average
* FIFO
* LIFO
* Standard
* Specific

For more information, see [Design Details: Costing Methods](design-details-costing-methods.md).

## Use Assembly Orders to Change Costing Method Assignments

This section describes the following steps for changing the costing method assigned to an item:

1. Define a default costing method.
2. Identify the items that to change the costing method for and renumber them.
3. Create new items with the old numbering scheme and copy the master data in a batch.
4. Manually copy related master data from the existing item to the new item.
5. Determine the inventory quantity to convert from the original item to the new item.
6. Transfer the inventory to the new item.
7. Handle inventory quantities that are allocated to demand.
8. Block the original item from further use.  

### Define a default costing method

To help avoid future mistakes you can specify a default costing method for new items. Whenever someone creates a new item, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will suggest the default costing method. You specify the default method in the **Default Costing Method** field on the **Inventory Setup** page. 

### Identify the items to change the costing method for and renumber them

You may want to give your new items the same numbers as those they are replacing. To do that, change the numbers of the existing items. For example, if the existing item number is "P1000," you might change it to "X-P1000." This is a manual change that you must make for each item.

### Create new items with the old numbering scheme and copy the master data in a batch

Create the new items using the current number scheme. With the exception of the **Costing Method** field, the new items should contain the same master data as the existing items. To transfer the master data for the item, and related data from other features, use the **Copy Item** action on the **Item Card** page. For more information, see [Copy Existing Items to Create New Items](inventory-how-copy-items.md).

After you create the new items and transfer the master data, assign the correct costing method.

### Manually copy related master data from the original item to the new item

To make the new items fully useful you must manually copy some master data from other areas, as described in the following table.

|Area  |What to copy  |How to copy it  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|Inventory |Stock-keeping units (SKUs) |Check whether a SKU is specified for the original item. If planning parameters have been entered for each SKU card, then you must manually create the SKU for the new item. If the parameters are not specified, you can use the **Create Stockkeeping Unit** batch job from the **Item Card** page to create the data.|
| |Item substitutions |Check whether any item substitutions are defined for the original item. If there are, transfer that data to the new item. To view substitute items, use the **Substitutions** action on the **Item Card** page. |
| |Analysis reports |Review the Item Analysis, Sales Analysis, and Purchase Analysis reports. For those that reference the original items you can either create a new analysis report with a reference to the new item (keeping the original analysis report to use as history) or adjust the reports so that they reference the new item. |
| |Standard journals |Check whether standard journals reference the original item and transfer that data to the new item when necessary. This information is found on the standard journals, which are available on the item journal.  |
|Sales |Sales prepayment percentage | Check whether any sales prepayment percentages are defined for the original item and transfer that data to the new item. To view prepayment percentages, on the **Item Card** page, choose **Sales**, and then **Prepayment Percentages**.|
|Purchase |Purchase prepayment percentage |Check whether any purchase prepayment percentages are defined for the original item and transfer that data to the new item. To view prepayment percentages, on the **Item Card** page, choose **Purchases**, and then **Prepayment Percentages**. |
|Warehouse |Bin contents |Review the bin content defined for the original item. If columns such as Min. Qty., Max. Qty., Default, and Dedicated have been individually entered then you must manually create bin content for the new item. If they are not, no action is required. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will maintain the records when you register warehouse documents and journals.|
|Job |Job Prices |Check whether project prices are defined for the original item and transfer that data to the new item. This information is available on the **Project Card** page in the **Project Details – No. of Prices** part on the **FactBox pane**. |
|Service |Service resource skill |Check whether service resource skills are defined for the original item and transfer that data to the new item. To view resource skills, use the **Resource Skills** action on the **Item Card** page.  |
| |Service item components |Check whether components are defined for the original service item and transfer that data to the new item. To view service item components, on the **Item Card** page use the **Service Item** action to open the list of related service items, and then choose the **Components** action.  |
|Production |Production BOMs |Check whether any production BOMs contain the original item and replace it with the new item. To replace the original item, on the **Production BOMs** page, choose the **Exchange Production BOM Item** action. |
|Assembly |Assembly BOMs |Check whether any assembly BOMs contain the original item and manually replace it with the new item. |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If the new costing method is Standard you should enter a value in the **Standard Cost** field on the **Item Card** page. You can use the **Standard Cost Worksheet** page to set the cost shares accordingly. For more information, see [Update Standard Costs](finance-how-to-update-standard-costs.md).

### Determine the inventory quantity to convert from the original item to the new item

> [!NOTE]
> This step does not consider quantities that are included in unshipped orders. For more information, see [Handle inventory quantities that are allocated to demand](design-details-changing-costing-methods.md#handle-inventory-quantities-that-are-allocated-to-demand). 

Use a physical inventory journal to produce a list of the quantities in inventory. Depending on the warehouse location setup, use one of the following:

* Physical Invt. Journals
* Whse. Phys. Invt. Journals

Both journals can calculate the inventory quantity of the item, including the location, variant, bin, and storage location. For more information, see [Count, Adjust, and Reclassify Inventory Using Journals](inventory-how-count-adjust-reclassify.md).

### Transfer the inventory to the new item

Create and post assembly orders to transfer the cost and inventory quantity from the original item to the new item. Assembly orders can convert one item to another while preserving the costs. This helps ensure that the net totals for the inventory account and COGS are not affected (except when the new costing method is Standard, in which case costs may be distributed to variance accounts). For more information, see [Assembly Management](assembly-assemble-items.md).

When creating assembly orders, use the information from the Physical Invt. journal or Whse. Phys. Invt. journal. The following tables describe the information in the reports to enter in the header and lines on the assembly order.

#### Header

|Field  |Value to enter  |
|---------|---------|
|Item No. |The number of the new item. |
|Quantity |The quantity in physical inventory journal.<br> **NOTE:** The quantities calculated by the physical inventory journals does not include the quantities that are on orders that have not yet shipped.  |
|Variant Code |The same as in physical inventory journal.  |
|Location Code |The same as in physical inventory journal. |
|Unit of Measure Code |The same as in physical inventory journal. |
|Bin Code |The same as in physical inventory journal. |

#### Lines

|Field  |Value to enter  |
|---------|---------|
|Type |Item |
|No. |The number of the original item. |
|Quantity per |1 |
|Variant Code |The same as in physical inventory journal. |
|Location Code |The same as in physical inventory journal. |
|Unit of Measure Code |The same as in physical inventory journal. |

> [!NOTE]
> An assembly order can handle only one SKU of an item at a time. You must create an assembly order for each combination of SKU that has a quantity in inventory.

> [!NOTE]
> For a warehouse location, you might have to create picks before you can post the assembly order. To investigate that, review the setup for picking on the **Location Card** page. For more information, see [Set Up Items and Locations for Directed Put-away and Pick](warehouse-how-to-set-up-items-for-directed-put-away-and-pick.md).

### Handle inventory quantities that are allocated to demand

Ideally, the inventory for the original item should go to zero after you transfer the inventory quantities. However, there can be outstanding orders, worksheets, and journals (see the table below) that still require a quantity of the original item. The quantity could also be blocked by a reservation or item tracking.

**Example**
There are 1000 pcs. in inventory, and 20 pcs. are reserved for a sales order that has not yet shipped. In that case, you might decide to keep the 20 pcs. in the old item so that you can fulfill the outstanding order.

> [!NOTE]
> There are functional areas that can affect the quantity, as listed in the table below, so it can be tricky to find the correct amount. To be safe, using the example above, you can choose to keep 100 pcs. and transfer the remaining 900 pcs. instead. Another way to do it would be to process the documents and journals so that only a manageable few remain. Yet another alternative is to transfer the entire quantity to the new item and then transfer some of it back to the original item using the assembly order.

The following table lists functional areas where there might be outstanding quantities.

|Area  |Where to look for outstanding quantities  |
|---------|---------|
|Sales |Sales documents, including orders, return orders, invoices, quotes, blanket orders, and credit memos |
|Inventory |Item journals, reservations, item tracking, and standard cost worksheet |
|Purchase |Purchase documents, including orders, return orders, invoices, quotes, blanket orders, and credit memos |
|Planning |Requisition worksheet, planning worksheet, and order planning |
|Warehouse |Transfer orders, warehouse shipments, warehouse journals, and warehouse picks, put-aways, and movements, internal picks and put-aways, and bin creation worksheets |
|Assembly |Assembly documents, including orders, return orders, and blanket orders |
|Jobs |project planning lines and project journal lines |
|Service |Service documents and service contracts |
|Production |Production orders (planned, firm planned, and released) |

### Block the original item from further use

When the inventory for the original item is zero, you can block the item to prevent it fom being used in new transactions. To block the item, on the **Item Card** page, turn on the **Blocked** toggle. For more information, see [Block Items from Sales or Purchasing](inventory-how-block-items.md).

## Summary

Changing the costing method on items that have been used in transactions is a process, and not a standard action in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. You can use the steps described in this topic as a template for the process.

The process can be time consuming because there are several manual steps. However, taking the time to complete it will minimize the impact of mistakes on your general ledger.

We recommend the following:

1. Assess the feasibility of the process by taking one, or maybe a few, representative items through the entire process.
2. Consider contacting an experienced partner who can help you with the process.

# Report VAT to tax authorities

This article describes the reports in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] that you can use to submit information about value-added tax (VAT) amounts for sales and purchases to tax authorities in your region. Depending on the specific country/region, the reports might include specific information, or there might be additional reports that you must submit. Check the articles for your country/region in the [Local Functionality](about-localization.md) section.  

You can use the following built-in reports:

* The **EC Sales List** report  

    The European Community (EC) Sales List report lists the value added tax (VAT) amounts that you have collected for sales to VAT-registered customers in the European Union (EU) countries/regioins.  
* The **VAT Return** report  

    The VAT Return report includes VAT for sales and purchases to customers and from vendors in all countries/regions that use VAT.  

In both cases (as in other VAT-related reports), VAT is calculated based on the VAT posting setup and the VAT posting groups that you have set up. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] shows VAT entries always based on their **VAT Date** as a primary reporting date.  

> [!NOTE]
> All VAT related reports now run using the **VAT Date** to filter relevant records. Even if you set up **VAT Date Usage** as **Do not use VAT Date functionallity** [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will hide all instances of the **VAT Date** across the application. However, the **VAT Date** is still used in all reportings and is auto-populated with the **Posting Date**.

If you want to view a complete history of VAT entries, every posting that involves VAT creates an entry on the **VAT Entries** page. These entries are used to calculate your VAT settlement amount, such as your payment and refund, for a specific period. To view VAT entries, choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Entries**, and then choose the related link.

> [!NOTE]
> Each [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] environment is meant to handle regulatory reporting in one single country/region. For example, the Dutch version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] handles VAT reporting in The Netherlands but not in other countries/regions. Similarly, the United States version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] handles 1099 reporting in the United States and does not support claiming VAT reporting in other countries/regions, unless brought by an extension delivered by our partner ecosystem or a customer-specific code modification.

## <a name="ecsaleslist"></a>About the EC Sales List report

In the European Union (EU) and in the UK, all companies that sell goods and services to VAT-registered customers, including customers in other European Union (EU) countries/regions, must submit an electronic version of the European Community (EC) Sales List report to their customs and tax authorities. The **EC Sales List** report works only for countries/regions in the EU.

The report includes one line for each type of transaction with the customer, and displays the total amount for each type of transactions. There are three types of transactions that the report can include:  

* B2B Goods  
* B2B Services  
* B2B Triangulated Goods  

*B2B* goods and services specify whether you sold a good or a service, and are controlled by the **EU Service** setting in the VAT posting setup. *B2B Triangulated Goods* indicate whether you engaged in trade with a 3rd party, and are controlled by the **EU 3-Party Trade** setting on sales documents, such as sales orders, invoices, credit memos, and so on.  

After the tax authority reviews your report, they'll send an email to the contact person for your company. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the contact person is specified on the **Company Information** page. Before you submit the report, make sure that a contact person is chosen.  

### Submit an EC sales list report

[!INCLUDE [finance-ecsaleslist](includes/finance-ecsaleslist.md)]

## <a name="vatreturn"></a>About the VAT Return report

Use this report to submit VAT for sales and purchase documents, such as purchase and sales orders, invoices, and credit memos. The information in the report is in the same format as on the declaration form from the customs and tax authorities.  

For the VAT return, you can specify the entries to include:

* Submit open transactions only, or open and closed. For example, this is useful when you prepare your final annual VAT return.
* Submit only entries from the specified periods, or also include entries from previous periods. This is useful for updating a VAT return that you have already submitted, for example, if a vendor sends you a late invoice.    

## To connect to your tax authority's web service
[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides service connections to tax authority websites. For example, if you are in the UK, you can enable the **GovTalk** service connection to submit the EC Sales List and VAT Return reports electronically. If you want to submit the report manually, for example by entering your data on the tax authority's website, this isn't required.   

To report VAT to a tax authority electronically, you need to connect [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to the tax authority's web service. This requires that you set up an account with your tax authority. When you have an account, you can enable a service connection that we provide in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 2.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Connections**, and then choose appropriate link.
2. Fill in the required fields. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > It is a good idea to test your connection. To do this, choose the **Test Mode** check box, then prepare and submit your VAT report as described in the [To prepare and submit a VAT report](#to-prepare-and-submit-a-vat-report) section. While in Test Mode, the service tests whether the tax authority can receive your report, and the status of the report will indicate whether the test submission was successful. It is important to remember that this is not an actual submission. To submit the report for real, you must clear the **Test Mode** check box, and then repeat the submission process.

## To set up VAT reports in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]

[!INCLUDE [vat-report-setup](includes/vat-report-setup.md)]

### To set up VAT return periods

Optionally, if your business isn't located in the UK, use the **VAT Returns Periods** page to set up scheduled VAT returns. If your business is located in the UK, see [Making Tax Digital in the United Kingdom](LocalFunctionality/UnitedKingdom/making-tax-digital-submit-vat-return.md).  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Return Periods**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **VAT Return Periods** page, fill in the fields to set up the first period. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)].  
3. Repeat step 2 for any additional periods that you want to add.  

Now, when the time has come to submit a VAT report for a VAT return period, choose the period in  the **VAT Return Periods** page, and then choose the **Create VAR Return** action. Then, in the **VAT Return** card, choose the **Suggest Lines** action as described in step 3 in the following procedure.  

## To prepare and submit a VAT report

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 3.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **EC Sales List** or **VAT Returns**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose **New**, and then fill in the required fields. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
3. To generate the content of the report, choose the **Suggest Lines** action.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  For the EC Sales List report, you can review the transactions included in the report lines before you submit the report. To do that, choose the line, and then choose the **Show VAT Entries** action.  

4. To validate and prepare the report for submission, choose the **Release** action.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] validates whether the report is set up correctly. If the validation fails, the errors display under **Errors and Warnings** so that you know what to fix. Typically, if the message is about a missing setting in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can click the message to open the page that contains the information to correct.  
5. To submit the report, choose the **Submit** action.  

After you submit the report, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] monitors the service and keeps a record of your communications. The **Status** field indicates where the report is in the process. For example, when the authorities process your report, the status of the report changes to **Succeeded**. If the tax authority found mistakes in the report you submitted, the status of the report will be **Failed**. You can view the errors under **Errors and Warnings**, correct them, and then submit the report again. To view a list of all your EC Sales List reports, go to the **EC Sales List Reports** page.  

### VAT return statuses

VAT returns can have different statuses, as described in the following table.

| Status | Description |
|------------|-------------------------|
| Open | When you create a new VAT return. You can run the **Suggest Lines** action. If you need to correct values, you can run the **Suggest Lines** action again. You can't submit a VAT return that has this status. |
| Released | Status will be changed when you use the **Release** action. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will show the **Errors and Warnings** FastTab. You can't make changes or use the **Suggest Lines** action. To make changes, you must reopen the VAT return. |
| Rejected | If your submission wasn't successful (for example, if authentication failed), the status will change to **Rejected**. You can't reopen a VAT Return that has this status. |
| Submitted | The VAT return is submitted using the **Submit** action, or it's marked as submitted by using the **Mark as Submitted** action. |
| Accepted | The VAT return has this status if the report is marked as accepted by using the **Mark as Accepted** action. If the **VAT Return** report is marked as **Accepted**, you can run the **Calculate and Post VAT Settlement** action. |

## Viewing communications with your tax authority

In some countries/regions, you exchange messages with the tax authority when you submit reports. You can view the first and the last message you sent or received by choosing the **Download Submission Message** and **Download Response Message** actions.  

## Submitting VAT reports manually
If you use another method to submit the report, for example by exporting the XML and uploading it to a tax authority website, afterward you can choose **Mark as Submitted** to close the reporting period. When you mark the report as released, it becomes non-editable. If you must change the report after you mark it as released, you must reopen it.

## VAT settlement
Periodically, you must remit the net VAT to the tax authorities. If you need to settle VAT frequently, you can run the **Calc. and Post VAT Settlement** batch job to close the open VAT entries and transfer purchase and sales VAT amounts to the VAT settlement account.

When you transfer VAT amounts to the settlement account, the purchase VAT account is credited, and the sales VAT account is debited with the amounts calculated for the specified period. The net amount is credited or debited, if the purchase VAT amount is larger, to the VAT settlement account. You can post the settlement immediately or print a test report first.  

> [!Note]
> When you use the **Calc. and Post VAT Settlement** batch job, if you do not specify a **VAT Bus. Posting Group** and a **VAT Prod. Posting group**, entries with all business posting groups and product posting group codes are included.

## Configuring your own VAT reports

You can use the **EC Sales List** report out-of-the-box. However, you can also create your own reports, if you have a development license so that you can create codeunits. If you need assistance, contact a Microsoft Partner.  

The following table describes the codeunits that you must create for your report.  

| Codeunit | What it must do |
|----|-----|
|Suggest Lines| Fetch information from the **VAT Entries** table, and display it in lines on the VAT report.|
|Content | Control the format of the report. For example, whether it's XML or JSON. The format to use depends on the requirements of your tax authority's web service. |
|Submission | Control how, and when, you submit the report based on the requirements of your tax authority. |
|Response Handler | Handle the return from the tax authority. For example, it might send an email message to your company's contact person. |
|Cancel | Send a cancellation of a VAT report that was submitted earlier to your tax authority. |  

> [!Note]
> When you create codeunits for the report, pay attention to the value in the **VAT Report Version** field. This field must reflect the version of the report that is, or was, required by the tax authority. For example, you might enter **2021** in the field to indicate that the report conforms to the requirements that were in place that year. To find the current version, contact your tax authority.

# About calculating standard cost

Many manufacturing companies select a valuation base of standard cost. This choice also applies to companies that do light manufacturing, such as assembly and kitting. A standard cost system determines inventory unit cost based on some reasonable historical or expected cost. Studies of past and estimated future cost data can provide the basis for standard costs. These costs are frozen until a decision is made to change them. The actual cost to produce a product can differ from the estimated standard costs. For management control, the actual cost is compared to the standard cost for a specific item and differences, or *variances*, are identified and analyzed.  

Standard costs can be maintained for items that are replenished through purchase, assembly, and production. For each replenishment method, standard costs can consist of the following elements.  

|Replenishment System|Standard Cost Elements|  
|--------------------------|----------------------------|  
|**Purchase**|Direct material cost and overhead material cost if it's required.|  
|**Assembly**|Direct material cost, direct or fixed labor cost, and overhead cost.|  
|**Prod. Order**|Direct material cost, labor cost, subcontractor cost, and overhead cost.|  

## Set up standard costs

Because the standard cost of a produced or assembled item can consist of multiple cost elements, including material, capacity (labor) and direct and overhead subcontractor costs, standard costs must be established for each of these elements.  

The accounting task for an item-processing company using standard costing is to:  

- Estimate a standard cost of the finished item and set it up on the item card.  
- Record and allocate the actual cost of the key cost elements and to account for variances.  

To determine the direct cost of a finished item, all component costs must be totaled. An assembled or produced item can include subassemblies, which also consist of multiple components.  

The following key cost elements make up the total direct cost of a finished processed item:  

- Material costs.  
- Capacity cost.  
- Subcontracting costs for produced items only.  

### Material costs

Material costs are costs that are associated with subassemblies and purchased raw material. Material unit cost can consist of direct and indirect cost elements.  

- Direct material cost represents an invoiced amount for purchased raw materials or the processing cost of a subassembly.  
- Indirect material cost, or *overhead*, can represent elements such as inventory carrying costs for the finished item after it's produced.  

The setup of the material cost for purchased items that affect direct and indirect cost depends on the costing method that you have selected for the specified item. You set up cost information for either costing method on the item card. For more information, see [Register New Items](inventory-how-register-new-items.md).

The cost of scrap (production only) is another factor to consider when you calculate the total material cost. When a certain amount of raw material is scrapped when you assemble or produce an item, it generally causes an increase in the quantity of components that are required to produce this item. This increases the material cost of the components that are consumed when producing a parent item. You set up scrap cost for materials on either the production BOM or routing.  

The material cost of a produced item can be represented in two ways that correspond to the following cost calculation bases.  

|Cost Calculation Basis|Material Cost Calculation|  
|----------------------------|-------------------------------|  
|Single level|Produced item is equal to the total cost of all purchased or subassembled items on that item's production BOM.|  
|Rolled-up level or multilevel|Produced item is the sum of the material cost for all subassemblies on that item's BOM and the cost of all purchased items on that item's production BOM.|  

### Capacity costs

Capacity costs are the costs that are associated with internal labor and machine costs. You must set up these costs for each resource (in assembly management) and work or machine center on the routing (in production). As with materials, you can identify both direct and indirect elements of capacity cost. For example, the direct cost for a work center can be the established shop rate to perform a specific function. The indirect cost for a work center can represent some general factory expenses, such as lighting, heating, and so on. As with material costs, you can express capacity overhead as an indirect cost percentage or a fixed overhead rate.  

The setup of the capacity costs of assembled items consists of the following elements:  

- Direct and indirect unit cost of the resource.  
- Fixed or direct resource usage type.  

The setup of the capacity costs of produced items consists of the following elements:  

- Direct and indirect unit cost of the machine or work center.  
- Time and lot size setup.  

To calculate standard capacity cost, you have to establish the standard time rates that are required to perform operations on machine and work centers. The total time to complete an operation typically consists of setup, run time, and wait and move time.  

You set up the rates for each time type for each machine or work center on an individual routing.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  While run time rates apply for each item unit that is produced, the setup time rates apply for each lot. Therefore, you must prorate the routing setup time for each operation over the lot size. You specify the lot size in the corresponding field on the **Replenishment** FastTab of the **Item Card** page.  

To specify setup time on the routing for planning but not include this expense in the standard cost calculation, clear the **Cost Incl. Setup** field on the **Manufacturing Setup** page.  

On a single-level basis, this is the labor cost that is required to produce the finished production item and is specified on the production item's routing. On a multi-level basis, this is the capacity cost that is specified for each individually produced item that is included in the parent item's BOM.  

### Subcontractor costs

Subcontractor costs are the costs that are associated with services that are provided by a company's outside vendors or subcontractors. Similar to material and capacity, subcontractor costs can consist of both direct and overhead amounts. Direct subcontractor cost represents the actual charge for each unit of services that is provided. For example, overhead subcontractor cost can represent freight and handling costs that the company incurs with a subcontracted order.  

Because subcontracting is an outsourced capacity, you set up the cost of both direct and indirect subcontracting services on the work center card that represents the subcontracting operation.  

## Populate standard cost

You can set standard cost manually or you can calculate the item's standard cost from the **Item card** page. Choose the **Production** group, then choose the **Calc. Production Std Cost** action to update cost of production items or choose the **Assembly** group, then choose the **Calc. Assembly Std. Cost** action to update cost of assembly item. The actions will consolidate and roll up the component and capacity costs to calculate the total assembly or manufacturing cost of the items. 

To calculate the unit cost of an assembly or production BOM, the parent item and its component items must use the Standard costing method. Any resources in the BOM are rolled up if they have a unit cost that is defined on the item, resource. workcenter card. Not cost defined on stockkeeping unit (SKU). 

If you have open entries, after implementing the changes to **Standard Cost** field on the item card, remember to perform inventory revaluation. For more information, see [Revalue Inventory](inventory-how-revalue-inventory.md).

## Updating standard costs with Standard Cost Worksheet

The **Standard Cost Worksheet** is intended as a tool for purchasers, production or assembly managers, and internal controllers when they have to review and update standard costs.

Use the **Standard Cost Worksheet** page to do the following:

- Prepare the changes in advance of the date when they have to take effect.
- Simulate the effect on the cost of the manufactured or assembled item if the standard cost for consumption, production capacity usage, or assembly resource usage is changed.
- Execute the changes at a given date and let them take effect immediately.

[!INCLUDE [edit-in-excel](includes/edit-in-excel.md)]

Purchasers use the [**Suggest Item Standard Cost**](#suggest-item-standard-cost) batch job to update and work with the costs of purchased items in one worksheet. When the result is satisfactory, the worksheet is given to the internal controller.

Production or assembly managers use the [**Suggest Work/Mach Ctr Std Cost**](#suggest-workmach-ctr-std-cost) batch job to update and work with the production capacity costs and assembly resource costs of processed items in another worksheet. This worksheet is also given to the internal controller.

Internal controllers use the [**Copy Standard Cost Worksheet**](#copy-standard-cost-worksheet) batch job to consolidate the worksheets into one worksheet. Use the [**Roll Up Standard Cost**](#roll-up-standard-cost) batch job to make a roll-up of the costs from the purchaser and the production or assembly manager. The roll-up determines the standard costs of manufactured and assembled items. Controllers can preview cost changes before and after the roll-up to identify unacceptable deviations. When the updates are acceptable, the controller implements the changes to take effect on a given date.

Use the [**Implement Standard Cost Change**](#implement-standard-cost-change) batch job to implement the standard cost changes, which updates the standard costs on the item cards of the items that are included in the worksheet. It also creates revaluation journal lines so that you can update the items in stock with the new standard cost.

### To update standard costs

1. Run the **Adjust Cost-Item Entries** batch job. To start the batch job, choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Adjust Cost-Item Entries**, and then choose the related link. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)] Review the results and make changes as necessary.  
2. Run the **Post Inventory Cost to G/L** batch job. To start the batch job, choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Post Inventory Cost to G/L**, and then choose the related link. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)] Review the results and make changes as necessary.  
3. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Standard Cost Worksheet**, and then use one or more of the following actions:
    1. Run the **Suggest Item Standard Cost** batch job.  
    2. Review the results and make changes as necessary.  
    3. Run the **Suggest Capacity Standard Cost** batch job.  
    4. Review the results and make changes as necessary.
    5. Run the **Roll Up Standard Cost** batch job.
    6. Review the results and make changes as necessary.
    7. Run the **Implement Standard Cost Changes** batch job.  
4. Review and post the **Revaluation Journal** page, which has been populated with entries from the previous steps in this process.  

### Suggest Item Standard Cost

Creates suggestions for changing the costs and cost shares of standard costs on item cards. When the batch job has completed, you can see the result in the **Standard Cost Worksheet** page.

> [!NOTE]  
> This batch job is intended for purchased items only. If you want to update an item with a production BOM or assembly BOM, then you must first fill in the worksheet with all the components and then run the **Roll Up Standard Cost** batch job.

This batch job only creates suggestions. It doesn't implement the suggested changes. If you're satisfied with the suggestions and want to implement them,  then select **Implement Standard Cost Changes** in the **Standard Cost Worksheet** page.

#### Options

**Standard Cost**: Enter the adjustment factor you want to use to update the standard cost. You can also select a rounding method for the new standard cost. You have to fill in the field using a decimal for the percentage increase, for example 1.1.

**Indirect Cost %**: Enter the adjustment factor you want to use to update the indirect cost %. You can also select a rounding method for the new indirect cost %. You have to fill in the field using a decimal for the percentage increase, for example 1.1.

**Overhead Rate**: Enter the adjustment factor you want to use to update the overhead rate. You can also select a rounding method for the new overhead rate. You have to fill in the field using a decimal for the percentage increase, for example 1.1.

### Suggest Work/Mach Ctr Std Cost

Creates suggestions for changing the costs and cost shares of standard costs on work center, machine center, or resource cards. When the batch job has completed, you can see the result in the **Standard Cost Worksheet** page.

This batch job only creates suggestions. It doesn't implement the suggested changes. If you're satisfied with the suggestions and want to implement them,  then select **Implement Standard Cost Changes** in the **Standard Cost Worksheet** page.

When you have run the batch job and want to see the impact on your production or assembly departments, then you run the **Roll Up Standard Cost** batch job to update standard costs on work centers, machine centers, assembly resources, production BOMs, and assembly BOMs.

#### Options
**Standard Cost**: Enter the adjustment factor you want to use to update the standard cost. You can also select a rounding method for the new standard cost. You have to fill in the field using a decimal for the percentage increase, for example 1.1.

**Overhead Rate**: Enter the adjustment factor you want to use to update the overhead rate. You can also select a rounding method for the new overhead rate. You have to fill in the field using a decimal for the percentage increase, for example 1.1.

### Copy Standard Cost Worksheet

Copies standard cost worksheets from several sources into the **Standard Cost Worksheet** page.

You can only copy one worksheet at a time. The lines from the copied worksheets will be placed below each other in the consolidated worksheet. Item lines are listed first, then work/machine center lines are listed, and resource lines are listed last.

### Roll up standard cost

Rolls up the standard costs of assembled and manufactured items. These are influenced by the change in standard costs of components suggested by the **Suggest Item Standard Cost** batch job. In addition, they're influenced by the change in standard cost of production capacity and assembly resources suggested by the **Suggest Work/Mach Ctr Std Cost** batch job.

Once you have run either or both of these batch jobs and you do the roll-up, then all changes to the standard costs in the worksheet are introduced in the associated production or assembly BOMs, and the costs are applied at each BOM level.

> [!NOTE] 
> This function only rolls up the standard cost on the item cards, not on the SKU cards.

This batch job only creates suggestions. It doesn't implement the suggested changes. If you're satisfied with the suggestions and want to implement them, then you can use the **Implement Standard Cost Change** batch job. 

#### Options

**Calculation Date**: Enter the date that applies to the production BOM version you want to do the roll-up for.
 
### Implement standard cost change

Updates the changes in the standard cost in the **Item** table with the ones in the **Standard Cost Worksheet** page. The standard cost change suggestions can be created with the **Suggest Item Standard Cost** and/or the **Suggest Work/Mach Ctr Std Cost** batch job, and they can also be modified. The contents of all the fields in the standard cost change suggestions are transferred. When you implement suggestions of changes to standard costs, you can see them on the item card and/or on the work/machine center cards. A revaluation journal is also created for you to update the value of existing stock.

#### Options

**Posting Date**: Enter the date that the revaluation should take place.

**Document No.**: Enter the number of the revaluation journal lines. If there's a number series set up on the item journal batch name, the document number follows the ledger entries made by the posting of the revaluation journal. Otherwise, you can manually enter a number.

**Item Journal Template**: Enter the name of the revaluation journal template.

**Item Journal Batch Name**: Enter the name of the actual revaluation journal

Select **OK** to start the batch job. If you don't want to run the batch job now, select **Cancel** to close the window.

Review and post the **Revaluation Journal** page, which has been populated with entries from the previous steps in this process.

# Troubleshoot connectivity for Business Central

> **APPLIES TO:** [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Online
>
> This feature is currently in preview. The functionality and documentation may change in later releases. If you would like to contribute to the documentation based on your own findings, please select ![Edit article in GitHub.](media/github-edit-pencil.png) **Edit**, and propose changes. Then we'll take a look!

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Online includes the **Troubleshooting Connectivity** page that you can use to identify problems with your connection to the online service. There are several things that affect connectivity to Business Central, like the firewall settings of your network or domain name service configuration. The page lets you run a list of checks that diagnose common Business Central connectivity issues. You can use the information to try to fix the problems yourself, or pass it on to your support representative.

> [!NOTE]
> The **Troubleshooting Connectivity** page doesn't test network performance or reliability, like the speed of your connection. It only verifies connectivity to different resources.

## Start the connectivity check 

1. Open an Internet browser.
2. In the address, enter the URL that you use to open Business Central and add `/connectivity` at the end. 

    For example, if you use `https://businesscentral.dynamics.com`, then enter:

    ```http
    https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/connectivity
    ```

    Or, if the URL includes the tenant ID, like `https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/aaaabbbb-0000-cccc-1111-dddd2222eeee`, then you'd enter:

    ```http
    https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/aaaabbbb-0000-cccc-1111-dddd2222eeee/connectivity
    ```
 
3. On the **Troubleshooting Connectivity** page, choose **Start check**.

    A series of checks is run, and the result of each check is shown:

    - ![Connectivity check succeeded.](media/connectivity-check.png) indicates the check succeeded.
    - ![Connectivity check failed.](media/connectivity-failed.png) indicates the check failed. Review the message below the check for more details.
    - ![Connectivity check was not run.](media/connectivity-blocked.png) indicates the check wasn't run, typically because of a failure of a previous check. Review the message below the check for more details.

4. To run the check again, choose **Restart check**.

The following sections explain the checks that are run, and provide some tips for fixing any problems.

## Basic internet connectivity

# Set up Intrastat reporting

All companies in the European Union (EU) must report their trade with other EU countries/regions. Companies must report the movement of goods to the statistics authorities in their country/region every month, and the report must be delivered to the tax authorities. Intrastat is the system that's used to collect trade statistics about goods within these countries/regions. Use the Intrastat report to complete periodic Intrastat reporting by collecting, recording, and reporting the trade of goods according to local legislation.

Intrastat reporting is based on basic EU regulations that apply to all countries/regions. However, there are differences within the individual countries/regions. Each country/region has its rules about what and how to report.

> [!NOTE]  
> Intrastat information doesn't apply to the movement of services between countries/regions, but only goods (Items and Fixed Assets). If the local government requires registering the movement of services between countries/regions, it can be done using the **Service Declaration** feature.
>
> This features is available as an app at [AppSource](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2081646). ATo use this feature, you must first install it on the **Extension Management** page. Learn more about this functionality [here](finance-how-setup-use-service-declaration.md).  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This article describes the new Intrastat experience available in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] starting in the 2022 release wave 2, which includes extended features. If you haven't upgraded your solution, read the previous version's Intrastat setup and usage article at [Set Up and Report Intrastat](finance-how-setup-report-intrastat-v20.md).

## Assisted setup

To use assisted setup for the Intrastat, follow these steps:  

1. Select the :::image type="icon" source="media/ui-search/search_small.png" border="false"::: icon, enter **Assisted Setup**, and then select the related link. 
2. On the **Assisted Setup** page, select the line for **Set up Intrastat reporting** in the **Report on financial health** group.  
3. Follow the instructions for the basic setup for Intrastat. To read more about the Intrastat setup, see the [Intrastat configuration](#intrastat-configuration) section later in this article.
4. After the setup is completed, select **Finish** to start to use the new Intrastat experience.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You can install the Intrastat Reporting Core app on any base app country version, regardless of whether it's in the EU. However, this feature is intended for regulatory reporting in EU countries. Microsoft provides full regulatory and localization support only in EU countries. If you're in an EU country where Microsoft doesn't provide localization support, you must find partner-based localization support. You might have to install a country/region-specific Intrastat app in addition to the core extension to meet local requirements. The country-specific apps can only be installed on base apps because they're intended for localization purposes. Intrastat Core has one core app and country-specific local apps.  

## Intrastat configuration

Before you can use Intrastat reports, there are several configurations that must be set up.  

### Intrastat reporting setup

Use the **Intrastat Reporting Setup** page to enable and set the default behavior for Intrastat reporting. You can specify whether you need to report Intrastat from shipments (dispatches), receipts (arrivals), or both, depending on thresholds set by your local authorities. You can also set default transaction types for the regular and return documents that are used for transaction reporting.

Follow the steps to set up Intrastat reporting.

   | **Zip File(-s)** | Specifies whether the report files should be added to the zip file. |
   | **Data Exch. Def. Code – Receipt** | Specifies the data exchange definition code to generate the Intrastat file for received goods. This field is available only if the **Split Receipts/Shipments Files** field is set to **Yes**. |
   | **Data Exch. Def. Code – Shipment** | Specifies the data exchange definition code to generate the Intrastat file for shipped goods. This field is available only if the **Split Receipts/Shipments Files** field is set to **Yes**. |

6. On the **Numbering** FastTab, enter a value in the **Intrastat Nos** field.

### Set up a reporting file

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Data Exchange Definitions**, and then select the related link.
2. Select **New**, and then, on the **General** FastTab, enter information about the data exchange definition, data file type, column separator, related codeunits, XMLport, and other fields as needed.
3. On the **Line Definitions** FastTab, enter a value in the **Line Type** field to describe the formatting of lines in the data file and where you need to define the number of columns for this line.
4. On the **Column Definitions** FastTab, fill in the line for each planned column. 
5. On the **Line Definitions** FastTab, select **Field Mapping**.
6. On the **Field Mapping** page, create a new entry.
7. On the **General** FastTab, select the **Table ID** value (for **Intrastat Report Line**, choose **4812**), and enter the following field information:

   1. Specify the **Field ID** value for each of the columns.
   2. Specify the **Transformation Rule** value for each column as needed. The value specifies the rule that transforms imported text to a supported value before it can be mapped to a specified field in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. When you choose a value in this field, the exact value is entered in the **Transformation Rule** field in the **Data Exch. Field Mapping Buf.** table. (Conversely, when an exact value is entered in the **Transformation Rule** field in the **Data Exch. Field Mapping Buf.** table, a value is chosen in this field.)

9. If you need to group entries based on some columns, on the **Field Grouping** FastTab, select the fields that you want to use for grouping.

> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE[prod_long](includes/prod_long.md)] comes with the preconfigured data exchange definition for Intrastat for all localized countries/regions. To learn more about how to create a new data exchange definition, see [Set Up Data Exchange Definitions](across-how-to-set-up-data-exchange-definitions.md).

### Set mandatory fields with the Intrastat report checklist

In some countries/regions, the authorities require that Intrastat reports include, for example, the shipment method for purchases or other values when sales are over a certain threshold.

To set mandatory fields or values on the **Intrastat Report** page, follow the steps.

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Intrastat Report Setup**, and then select the related link.
2. Select **Intrastat Report Checklist**.
3. Follow the steps to add the necessary lines for checking:
   1. Set the **Field No.** field to a field that must be checked for a nonempty value.
   2. Enter a value in the **Filter Expression** field if needed, based on the following rules:

        1. When you open the **Filter Page**, select the filter that you need to use for checking.
        2. Select a value related to the selected filter.
        3. If you must fill more filters for the chosen field, repeat the previous two steps to add another filter.
        4. When you finish entering the filters for the chosen field, select **OK**.

   3. Select the **Reversed Filter Expression** checkbox to specify that the check for fields is run only on those lines that don't match the filter expression. If the line isn't filtered, this field is ignored.

> [!NOTE]
> When you open the **Filter Page** from the **Filter Expression** line, you can use all standard filter expressions related to the specific field you want to filter.
>
> Be careful when you set up validation rules, because they can differ between countries/regions.

## Use custom codeunits in Intrastat reporting

If you want to change how Intrastat works, and the default configuration isn't enough, you can customize the system by extending the standard features. If you need to further change the Intrastat behavior, you can develop your own codeunits. When you create codeunits, you need to make extra changes to use them. To configure [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to use your own objects, follow these steps.

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Reports Configuration**, and then select the related link.
2. On the **VAT Reports Configuration** page, add a new line.
3. In the **VAT Report Type** field, select **Intrastat Report**.
4. In the **VAT Report Version** field, specify the version of the report.
5. Add your codeunits for the following options:
   1. In the **Suggest Lines Codeunit ID** field, specify the new codeunit for suggesting lines in the Intrastat report lines.
   2. In the **Content Codeunit ID** field, specify the new codeunit for exporting data as a file using a Data Exchange Definition.
   3. In the **Validate Codeunit ID** field, specify the new codeunits for validating results inside Intrastat report lines.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This line must be empty if you use the standard codeunits. You should only create a line and configure it if you have developed custom codeunits.

## Other Intrastat configurations

Customer and vendor cards include the **Intrastat Partner Type** field, which has the same option values as the **Partner Type** field: 

- (blank)
- Company
- Person

The **Intrastat Partner Type** field replaced the **Partner Type** field in Intrastat reporting. The **Partner Type** field is used in the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) to define the SEPA Direct Debit Scheme (Core or B2B). The **Intrastat Partner Type** field is used for Intrastat reporting only. Therefore, you can specify different values for the two fields if necessary.

If the **Intrastat Partner Type** field is left blank, the value from the **Partner Type** field is used for Intrastat reporting.

In addition to **Intrastat Report Setup**, **Data Exchange Definitions**, and **Intrastat Report Checklist**, the following settings must also be configured.

| Page | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| **Countries/Regions** | On the **Countries/Regions** page, add **EU Country/Region Code** and **Intrastat Code** information to specify a code for the country/region that you're trading with. This information is used in Intrastat reporting. |
| **Tariff Numbers** | In many countries/regions, the customs and tax authorities establish eight-digit codes for various items. To enable item entries to contain the necessary information when the program imports them to the Intrastat journal line, enter the item code on the **Tariff Numbers** page. Find the codes for the items that your company deals with, and enter them on the **Tariff Numbers** page. |
| **Transport Methods** | There are seven, one-digit codes for Intrastat transport methods: **1** for sea, **2** for rail, **3** for road, **4** for air, **5** for the post, **7** for fixed installations, and **9** for own propulsion (for example, transporting a car by driving it). [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't require these specific codes. However, we recommend that the descriptions provide a similar meaning. |
| **Transaction Types** | Countries and regions have different codes for types of Intrastat transactions. For example, for ordinary purchases and sales, exchange of returned goods, and exchange of non-returned goods. Set up all the codes that apply to your country/region. These codes are then used on the **Foreign Trade** FastTab on sales and purchase documents and when you process returns. |
| **Transaction Specifications** | Set up codes to supplement the transaction type descriptions. |
  
> [!NOTE]
> Starting in January 2022, Intrastat requires different transaction nature codes for dispatches to private individuals or non-VAT registered businesses and VAT-registered businesses. To comply with this requirement, we recommend that you review or add new transaction nature codes on the **Transaction Types** page, according to the requirements in your country. You should also check and update the **Intrastat Partner Type** field to *Person* for a private individual or non-VAT registered business customers on the relevant **Customer** page. If you're unsure about the correct Intrastat partner type or transaction type to use, we recommend that you ask an expert in your country or region.

|   Field   |   Description   |
| --------- | --------------- |
| **Net Weight** | Weight is one of the basic configurations  that are related to Intrastat reporting, because the total weight is mandatory for reporting. To be ready for this requirement, enter a value in the **Net Weight** field on the item or fixed asset card. |
| **Country of Origin Code** | Use the two-letter ISO Alpha Codes on the item or fixed asset card for the country/region where the good was obtained or produced. If the good was produced in more than one country/region, the country/region of origin is the last country/region where it was processed. |
| **VAT identification number of the partner operator in the Member State of import** | This number is the VAT-ID of the partner operator in the member state of import. The VAT-ID is also used in the exchange of intra-EU-export data among the member states and allows the member states to allocate the received data to the importing company in their own country/region. Reporting units must report on the VAT-ID of the company that declared the intra-Union acquisition of goods in the member state of import. |

Optionally, you can also set up:

- **Commodity codes**: Customs and tax authorities have numerical codes that classify items and services. You can specify these codes on items.
- **Areas**: Supplementary information about countries and regions.
- **Entry/exit points**: Specify the locations where you ship or receive items to or from other countries/regions. An airport is an example of an entry or exit point. You enter entry or exit points on sales and purchase documents on the **Foreign Trade** FastTab. This information is copied from the item entries when you create the Intrastat journal.
- **Supplementary unit of measure**: The quantity of goods for Intrastat reporting can be either net weight (in kilograms) or a supplementary unit. If supplementary units are required, you must configure them for items and fixed assets.

### Set up transport methods

### Intrastat report

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Intrastat Report Setup**, and then select the related link. 
2. In the **Intrastat Report Setup** in the **Default Country Code for Item Tracking** field, choose the **Purchase Headers** option.  

### Item  

You must enable item tracking for these items, either serial numbers, lots, or both. To enable item tracking for the item, follow these steps.

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Item**, and then select the related link.
2. Choose the item that you want to configure.

4. When you make a selection, you can see how the item tracking codes are configured.
5. Select the code you want, and select **OK**.

### Use the item in purchase documents

After you select an item that has item tracking enabled on the purchase line, follow these steps.  

1. On the **Lines** FastTab, choose **Line**, and run the **Item Tracking Lines** action.
2. On the **Item Tracking Lines** page after adding **Serial No.** or **Lot No.**, and entering value in **Quantity (Base)** field, choose one of the following options:  
   1. The **Lot No. Information Card** action if you're using lots.   
   2. The **Serial No. Information Card** action if you're using serial numbers.  
3. You can choose **New** (**+**) to create new lot or serial numbers on the **Lot No. Information Card** or **Serial No. Information Card** pages. 
4. The **Country/Region Code** is populated with the **Country/Region Code** from the purchase document. You can change it if you want.
5. Close the page.
6. Repeat this process for each line on the **Item Tracking Lines** page where you configured item tracking.
7. Close the **Item Tracking Lines** page.

When you work with sales invoices, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically collects the **Country/Region Code** for any lot or serial number you choose. You can always check the code using the **Item Tracking Lines** action from the sales lines.  

These **Country/Region Codes** are automatically populated in the **Country/Region of Origin Code** field in the **Intrastat Report Lines**.  

## Enter country/region Intrastat settings

Intrastat requirements are similar in all member states of the EU, though there are important exceptions. In theory, the rules should be uniformly applied in all member states. However, there are differences in implementations, because some member states provide guidelines about how to apply the principles in specific situations (for example, commercial samples and returns of goods). These guidelines can produce different results for various situations. Therefore, the information that countries/regions must enter can differ, as can the file format that they must use for reporting.

> [!NOTE]
> If you don't fill in the **Lot No. Information Card** or **Serial No. Information Card** pages for a lot or serial number, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] won't use the **Country/Region Code** from the purchase document. Instead, the information comes from the **Item** card.  

### Austria

Intrastat reporting in Austria requires two different files for receipts and shipments. To verify that your setup is correct, follow the steps.

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Intrastat Report Setup**, and then select the related link.  
2. On the **Reporting** FastTab, check whether **Split Receipts/Shipments Files** is selected. If it is, two separate **Data Exch. Def. Code** values are configured.
3. Verify that the **Zip File(-s)** field is selected, to ensure that report files are added to the zip file.

The process of working with Intrastat reports is the same as the global feature.

# Create interactions on contacts and segments

You can create interactions to track the communications you have with a single contact, or with multiple contacts in your segments. To make it easy to create interactions, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides the **Create Interaction** assisted setup guide. The guide helps you capture the important details about the interaction.

Before you create interactions though, you must set up interaction templates. To learn more about interaction templates, go to [Set Up Interaction Templates](marketing-interactions.md).

## To create an interaction with a contact

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Contacts**, **Salesperson**, or **Interaction Log Entry**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **Create Interaction** action.
3. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

> [!NOTE]  
> If you need to stop before you've finished the interaction, you can choose **Cancel** and then specify whether you want to save your settings so you can continue later. To learn more about postponed interactions, go to [To finish setting up a postponed interaction](#to-finish-setting-up-a-postponed-interaction).

## To create an interaction on a segment

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Segments**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **Create Interaction** action.
3. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

> [!TIP]
> After you assign an interaction to a segment, there are several other actions you can take on the **Segment** page:
>
> * Personalize the interaction for each particular contact within the segment, for example, by selecting another interaction template on the lines.  
>* Log the segment and interactions by choosing the **Log** action to open the **Log Segment** page.
> * Create a new segment containing the same contacts by choosing the **Create Follow-up Segment** checkbox. This setting requires that a number series is specified for segments on the **Marketing Setup** page.

An interaction is recorded for each contact within the segment in the **Interaction Log Entry** table, and the segment is logged. Logged segments are available on the **Logged Segment** page.

## To finish setting up a postponed interaction

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Postponed Interactions**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the interaction you want to finish, and then choose the **Resume** action.

# Sustainability value chain in production

The requirement for enabling the sustainability value chain in manufacturing processes is to enable the **Enable Value Chain tracking**, **Item Emissions**, and **Work/Machine Center Emissions** fields on the **Sustainability Setup** page.  

To do so, follow these steps:

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sustainability Setup**, and then select the related link.
2. Check whether the basic setup already exists. If it doesn't, follow [these instructions](finance-sustainability-setup.md) to set it up.  
3. On the **Procurement** FastTab, fill in the following fields:
   1. **Enable Value Chain tracking** to enable sustainability value entry posting through value chain operations and the visibility of these fields on operational documents and journals.
   2. **Item Emissions** to enable a default sustainability account and emissions on the **Item Card** page.  
   3. **Work/Machine Center Emissions** to enable default sustainability accounts and emissions on the **Work Center** and **Machine Center** pages.  
4. Close the page.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Because the sustainability value chain works only with the carbon equivalent (CO2e), before you start, configure the **Carbon Equivalent Factors** on the **Emission Fees** page. To learn more, go to [Emission fees](value-chain-howto-setup.md#emission-fees).  

## Working with a production BOM

To learn more about how to work with the **Production BOM**, go to [How to create a production BOM](production-how-to-create-production-boms.md). This article only covers the effect of CO2e emissions on production BOMs.  

If you set up default emissions for items you plan to use on production BOM lines, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically fills in the **CO2e per Unit** field for each line when you create a new production BOM. However, if you created a production BOM before you configured emissions for items, or if you updated the emission values for items, you can run the **Calculate CO2e** action. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] updates all **CO2e per Unit** values using the latest emission details from the items. You can even run the **Calculate CO2e** action from the **Production BOMs** page to update all production BOMs with the latest emissions.

## Working with routings

To learn more about how to work with routes, go to [How to create a route with production operations](production-how-to-create-routings.md). This article only explains the effect of CO2e emissions on routes.

If you set up default emissions for work or machine centers you plan to use in the **Routing** lines, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically fills in the **CO2e per Unit** field for each line when you create a new routing. However, if you created a routing before you configured emissions for work or machine centers, or if you updated the emission values for them, you can run the **Calculate CO2e** action. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] updates all **CO2e per Unit** values using the latest emission details from the work or machine centers.

## Working with production orders  

To learn more about how to work with production orders, go to [About production orders](production-about-production-orders.md) and [How to create production orders](production-how-to-create-production-orders.md). However, the connection of production orders with the sustainability value chain is:

- Tracking the emissions for items and work or machine centers consumed during the production process.
- Transferring the total emission values to the produced items or finished goods.  

To use a production order in the sustainability value chain process, add CO2e (carbon equivalent) emissions in all posted entries through the journals you use in the production process. You can start the process using a **Released Production Order**. To use the sustainability value chain in production orders, all items (raw materials) and work or machine centers you want to use must have a **Sustainability Account No.** and emissions.  

To do so, follow these steps:

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Released production orders**, and then select the related link.
2. Create a new production order. To learn more about production orders, go to [How to create a production order](production-how-to-create-production-orders.md).
3. Run the **Refresh Production Order** action to calculate values for the line.  
4. After you refresh the order, the value in the **Total CO2e** field updates based on emissions in the production BOM and routing for the production items.

When you refresh the production order, values from the production BOM and routing transfer to the **Prod. Order Components** and **Prod. Order Routing** pages for the production order you're using. If you change the initial production BOM and routing, it doesn't affect the production order you refreshed previously.  

To check the emission values, run the **Routing** or **Components** actions from the production order lines.  

> [!NOTE]
> Although the **Total CO2e** emission amount displays for each line on the **Prod. Order Components** and **Prod. Order Routing** pages, there's a field called **CO2e per Unit**. Its value comes from the **Item**, **Work Center** or **Machine Center** pages, and is used for calculations. However, if you change the value in the **Total CO2e** field on the line, the **CO2e per Unit** recalculates based on the total emission and quantity for that line.  

### Posting transactions related to production order  

To post all transactions related to the production order and record the emissions, choose one of the following journals:  

- Production journals
- Consumption journals
- Output journals

#### Production journals  

Production journals combine the functions of the separate consumption journal and output journals into one journal. The combined journal is accessed directly from a released production order. To learn more, go to [How to register consumption and output for a released production order line](production-how-to-register-consumption-and-output.md). Related to emissions, be sure that all lines have a value in the **CO2e per Unit** field.

Every time you post the journal, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates sustainability value entries. You can access these entries from the **Release Production Order** page by running the **Sustainability Value Entries** action.  

#### Consumption journals

To learn more about consumption journals, go to [Batch post production consumption](production-how-to-post-consumption.md). It's important to know that all emissions are updated by posting these journals for all consumption transactions. When you post a journal, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates sustainability value entries with the **Consumption** option as the **Item Ledger Entry Type**.  

#### Output journals

To learn more about output journals, go to [Batch post output and run times](production-how-to-post-output-quantity.md). It's important to know that all emissions are updated by posting these journals for all output transactions based on the routings. When you post the journal, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates sustainability value entries with the **Output** option as the **Item Ledger Entry Type** for the finished good production. It also creates transactions for the work or machine centers you used related to the capacity ledger entry.  

### Finish a production order

When you finish a production order, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] updates the value of your produced item and the **CO2e per Unit** field on the **Item Card** page for it.

> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates the value in the **CO2e per Unit** field for the produced item by summing the total emissions from all consumed items and operations (work and machine centers), and then divide that by the total output quantity.

# Design your own financial reports

You can use financial reporting to create custom reports. For example, if you want more complex reports.

To create a new financial report, choose the **New** action. You can then give the report a name and add a description. Afterward, you can specify default settings for the report, such as:

* **Row Definition**
* **Column Definition**
* **Analysis Views**

## Copy an existing report

To copy an existing report, use the **Copy Financial Report** action. When you choose this option, you can rename the copied report. You can also copy and rename individual row definitions and column definitions.  

## Create your own row definition

To create your own row definition, choose **Edit Row Definition**. To explore existing row definitions, choose the **Name** field. Choose **New**, and give the row definition a name and description.

You now have a blank row definition that you can use to build your new report.  

> [!TIP]
> Take a moment to personalize your screen to show only the **Row No.**, **Description**, **Totaling Type**, **Totaling**, **Row Type**, and **Bold** columns. These columns are recommended as the minimum columns needed for a basic row definition. There are many columns available, which can be used as you become familiar with creating more advanced financial reports in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

When getting started with financial reporting, there are a few choices we recommended in fields. The following table describes the recommended choices.

|Field  |Option  |
|---------|---------|
|Row No.     |Alpha, numeric, or alphanumeric codes are used here to identify rows in formulas.         |
|Description  |Specifies the words to label each row of the report.         |
|Totaling Type    |The **Posting Accounts** and **Formulas** options are often used.         |
|Totaling     | Together with the **Totaling Type** of **Posting Accounts**, maps general ledger accounts to the report, either individually or in ranges.<br><br> Together with **Totaling Type** of the **Formula**, uses row references to the **Row No.** field to do basic addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division.          |
|Row Type     |**Net Change** is used for income statement reports.<br><br>**Balance at Date** is used for balance sheet reports.<br><br>**Beginning Balance** is used for cash flow statements.          |
|Bold     |  Simple formatting to apply to headers, subtotals, and other elements of the report that you want to emphasize.       |

## When to show the opposite sign in rows and columns

Use the **Show Opposite Sign** option to show the opposite sign in a credit balance account, such as revenue, for reports you present to people who aren't accountants.

> [!TIP]
> It's important to remember that you should use the **Show Opposite Sign** option on the posting account line for the account where the sign needs to be flipped. If you use the option on a formula such as gross margin, where both revenue and cost of goods sold are represented, the calculation will be incorrect. Pay extra attention when you use the setting in formulas.

## Create your own column definition

To create your own column definition, choose **Edit Column Definition**. To explore existing definitions, choose the **Name** field. Choose **New**, and give the new column definition a name and a description.

You now have a blank column definition that you can use to build your new report.  

> [!TIP]
> Take a moment to personalize your screen to show only the **Column No.**, **Column Header**, **Column Type**, **Ledger Entry Type**, **Budget Name**, **Formula**, and **Comparison Period Formula** columns. These columns are recommended as the minimum needed for a basic column definition. There are many columns available, which you can use as you become more familiar with creating advanced financial reports.

When getting started with financial reporting, there are a few field choices we recommended. The following table describes the recommendations.

|Field  |Option  |
|---------|---------|
|Column No.     |Alpha, numeric, or alphanumeric codes are used here to identify columns in formulas.         |
|Column Header     |Used to hold the words used to label each column of the report.         |
|Column Type     |The often used options are **Net Change**, **Balance at Date**, and **Formula**.<br><br>**Net Change** is used for income statement reports.<br><br>**Balance at Date** is used for balance sheet reports.<br><br>**Formula** uses row references to Column No. to do basic addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.          |
|Ledger Entry Type     |Entries are used for general ledger entries.<br><br>**Budget Entries** are used for budget entry comparisons.         |
|Budget Name     |When using budget entries, select the budget to use.         |
|Formula     | Formula uses row references to Column No. to do basic addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.        |
|Comparison Period Formula     | Holds various period-related formulas that determine the period for the report combined with the date filter.        |

## When to use a comparison period formula and comparison date formula in a column definition

There are two options for column definition comparisons for accounting periods:

* Comparison period formula
* Comparison date formula

Comparison period formula is often used for reports that show monthly, quarterly, or annual accounting periods. In most cases, financial reports use these increments of time.  

Comparison date formula is typically used for reports that show weekly or daily accounting periods. These increments of time are appropriate for operational reporting, such as daily sales or weekly invoicing.

### Column definitions that include budgets

Budgets can be included on any report when included on the column definition. By selecting a ledger entry type of **Budget Entries**, and entering the **Budget Name** for the selected budget, you can easily show comparisons of actual to budget in reports.

# Design Details: Integration with Inventory

Warehouse management and inventory features interact with one another in physical inventory and in inventory or warehouse adjustment.  

## Physical inventory  

The **Whse. Phys. Inventory Journal** page is used with the **Phys. Inventory Journal** page for all advanced warehouse locations. The inventory on bin level is calculated, and a printed list is provided for the warehouse employee. The list shows which items in which bins must be counted.  
  
The warehouse employee enters the counted quantity on the **Whse. Phys. Inventory Journal** page and then posts the journal.  
  
If the counted quantity is greater than the quantity on the journal line, a movement is posted for this difference from the default adjustment bin to the counted bin. This increases the quantity in the counted bin and decreases the quantity in the default adjustment bin.  
  
If the quantity counted is less than the quantity on the journal line, a movement for this difference is posted from the counted bin to the default adjustment bin. This decreases the quantity in the counted bin and increases the quantity in the default adjustment bin.  
  
In advanced warehouse configurations, the value in the **Quantity (Calculated)** field is retrieved from item ledger entries and the value in the **Quantity (Phys. Inventory)** field is retrieved from warehouse entries, excluding the adjustment bin content. The **Quantity** field specifies the difference between the first two fields, which should be equal to the contents of the adjustment bin.  
  
When you post the physical inventory journal, the inventory and the default adjustment bin are updated.  

[!INCLUDE [preview-posting-inventory](includes/preview-posting-inventory.md)]
  
## Warehouse adjustments to the item ledger  

You use the **Item Journal** page and the **Calculate Whse. Adjustment** function to adjust inventory on the item ledger in accordance with an adjustment that has been made to the item quantity in a warehouse bin. To create a link between the inventory and the warehouse, you must define a default adjustment bin per location.  
  
The default adjustment bin registers items in the warehouse when you post an increase for the inventory. However, if you post a decrease, the quantity on the default bin is also decreased. In both cases, item ledger entries and warehouse entries are created.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
> Inventory calculations don't include the adjustment bin.  
  
To adjust the bin content, use a warehouse item journal, where you can enter the item number, zone code, bin code, and quantity to adjust.  
  
If you enter a positive quantity and post the line, then the inventory stored in the bin increases, and the quantity of the default adjustment bin decreases correspondingly.

# Create special orders

You can create a special order for a specific catalog item to be shipped to a specific customer. Your vendor ships the item to your warehouse and you can then ship the item on to your customer either independently or together with other items on another order.  

Special orders imply that the purchase and sales order are linked to ensure that the specific catalog item is picked and delivered to the customer.  

Before you can use this feature, you must first set up the customer, vendor, and item cards necessary for the order.  

## To create a special order

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Order**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action. Create and fill in a  sales order for the item. For more information, see [Sell Products](sales-how-sell-products.md).
3.  On the **Lines** FastTab, fill in the sales line. In the **Purchasing Code** field, select a purchasing code that has the **Special Order** field selected.

    You must now create a purchase order from a requisition worksheet.  
4. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Requisition Worksheets**, and then choose the related link.  
5. Choose the **Special Order** action, and then choose the **Get Sales Orders** action.  
6.  On the **Get Sales Orders** page, show results where the **Document No.** is the sales order number. Choose the **OK** button. A requisition worksheet line is created for the item.  
7.  On the requisition worksheet line, in the **Action Message** field, select **New**.  
8.  On the **Requisition Worksheets** page, choose the **Carry Out Action Message** action. The **Carry Out Action Msg. - Req.** page opens. Choose the **OK** button.  

    A message appears telling you that the purchase orders have been created. Choose the **OK** button.  

A purchase order created as a special order for a sales order is respected by the planning system as it balances demand and supply. That is, the purchase order (supply) remains linked to the sales order (demand), even if that purchase order could supply another earlier demand. For more information, see [Design Details: Reordering Policies](design-details-reservation-order-tracking-and-action-messaging.md).  

> [!NOTE]  
>  You cannot use the special order functionality if the item is already reserved. Therefore, for items that are sold on special orders, make sure the **Reserve** field on the item card is not set to **Always**.

# Get the Business Central add-in for Excel

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes an add-in for Excel that lets users select the **Edit in Excel** action on certain pages to open the data in an Excel worksheet. This action is different than the **Open in Excel** action because it lets users make changes in Excel, then publish the changes back to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]

## Overview

### About the add-in

The add-in is called **Microsoft Dynamics Office Add-in** and it's available for installation from the [Office Store (AppSource)](https://appsource.microsoft.com/). With the add-in installed, the **Edit in Excel** action is available on most list and list part pages from the **Share** icon ![Share a page in another app.](media/share-icon.png). For more information about using the add-in, see [View and Edit in Excel From Business Central](across-work-with-excel.md).

> [!NOTE]
> The add-in works on Windows only.

### About deployment as an admin

With [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, there are a few deployment options for getting the add-in to users. One option is *individual acquisition*, where users install the add-in themselves. With this option, users must have access to downloading files from the Office Store. Another option is to set up *Centralized Deployment* in the Microsoft 365 admin center to automatically deploy the add-in to your entire organization, groups, or specific users. Centralized Deployment provides a way to get the add-in to users if your organization doesn't give users access to the Office Store.

For the user, the installation experience is different for the two deployment scenarios:

- With individual acquisition, the first time users choose the **Edit in Excel** action, the **New Office Add-in** pane opens in Excel. To install the add-in, the user chooses **Trust this add-in**, which in turn installs the add-in directly from the Office Store. Users then sign in to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] using their user name and password.

- With Centralized Deployment, the first time users choose the **Edit in Excel** action, the add-in is automatically installed in Excel from Centralized Deployment; not the Office Store. The only thing users have to do is sign in to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

With both these deployment options, the add-in is automatically configured to connect to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. A third deployment option is a manual installation of the add-in directly from Excel. With this option, users need to configure the add-in to connect to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

### <a name="switch"></a>Switching from individual acquisition to Centralized Deployment or the other way around

When you change from individual acquisition of the add-in to Centralized Deployment, or vice versa, it affects Excel files that users created before the transition. After the transition, users can still open any Excel worksheets previously created using the **Edit in Excel** action or created manually by configuring the Excel add-in. But they can't update the data in the file from Business Central or push updates to Business Central.

This situation happens because each Excel file gets assigned an "add-in" identifier. In the transition to or from Centralized Deployment, a different ID is assigned, so the earlier ID becomes blocked.

## Preparation (on-premises only)

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises requires that your environment is configured for the add-in. If not, the **Edit in Excel** action isn't available to users. Learn more in [Setting up the Business Central add-in for Excel in Business Central on-premises](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/configuring-excel-addin) in the Developer and IT Pro help.

## Deploy the add-in by using Centralized Deployment

Centralized Deployment is a feature in the Microsoft 365 admin center that you use to automatically install add-ins in users' Office apps, like Excel. To help you with Centralized Deployment, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes the **Excel Add-in Centralized Deployment** assisted setup.

### Before you begin

- Learn more about preventing users from downloading from the Office store at [Manage add-ins in the admin center](/microsoft-365/admin/manage/manage-addins-in-the-admin-center).
- Verify that Centralized Deployment works for your organization. Learn more at [Determine if Centralized Deployment of add-ins works for your organization](/microsoft-365/admin/manage/centralized-deployment-of-add-ins).
- Learn more about transitioning from individual acquisition at [Switching from individual acquisition to Centralized Deployment](#switch).

> [!NOTE]
> Enabling Centralized Deployment affects features that use the Excel add-in, such as the **Edit in Excel** action. It has no effect on other Excel-related features or permissions assigned to users in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

### Set up Centralized Deployment of the add-in

In this task, you work in both [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and the Microsoft 365 admin center.

1. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Excel Add-in Centralized Deployment**, and then choose the related link.
2. Read the information on the **Business Central Excel add-in setup** page and choose **Next**.
3. Sign in to the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2163967) and go to **Integrated Apps**<!--**Add-ins**-->.

    Complete the following steps to configure the add-in to deploy from the Office Store: 
    1. Choose **Get apps** to open Office Store (AppSource). <!--**Deploy Add-in** 5. In the **Deploy a new add-in**, select **Choose from the store**.-->
    2. Search for **Microsoft Dynamics Office Add-in**, then select **Get it now**. <!--On the **Select add-in** page, search for and select **Microsoft Dynamics Office Add-in** > **Add** > **Continue**.-->
    3. On the **Add Users** page, specify the users that you want to deploy the add-in for, then choose **Next**.<!--On the **Configure add-in**, specify the users that you want to deploy the add-in for.-->
    4. Review the **Accept permissions requests**, then choose **Next** > **Finish Deployment**.
    5. Wait for the green check mark next to **Deployed** appears for the add-in, then choose **Done**. <!--Select **Deploy** and wait til successful, then **Next** > **Continue**.-->

       The add-in appears on the **Add-ins** page. For more information about deploying add-ins in the Microsoft 365 admin center, see [Deploy add-ins in the admin center](/power-platform/admin/use-service-admin-role-manage-tenant?azure-portal=true).
4. Go back to **Excel Add-in Centralized Deployment** assisted setup in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], and choose **Next**.
5. Turn on **Use Centralized Deployment**, and choose **Finish**.

    If you don't turn on this switch, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] gets the add-in directly from the Office Store.

When finished, you can always change the deployment in the Microsoft 365 admin center, like assigning more users. For more information about deploying add-ins in the admin center, see [Deploy add-ins in the admin center](/power-platform/admin/use-service-admin-role-manage-tenant?azure-portal=true).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you have more than one environment, you must run the **Excel Add-in Centralized Deployment** assisted setup on each environment that you want to use Centralized Deployment. However, you don't have to configure the Centralized Deployment in Microsoft 365 again. The only thing you have to do is turn on the **Use Centralized Deployment** switch in the assisted setup. 

> [!NOTE]
> It can take up to 24 hours before the add-in deploys automatically in Excel for users.

## <a name="install"></a>Individual acquisition: Install the add-in manually for your own use

In most cases, when you open Excel from Business Central, the add-in is either installed automatically for you or you're prompted to install it. There might be cases, however, where you have to manually install the add-in.

1. Open Excel, then open any Excel workbook.
1. On the **Home** tab, select **Add-ins** > **More Add-ins**.
1. Go to **Admin managed** and look for **Microsoft Dynamics Office Add-In**. If you see it there, select it, and then choose **Add**. If you don't see it, go to **Store**, and then search for *Microsoft Dynamics Office add-In* and follow the instructions to add it.

When the add-in is installed, it shows up as a panel in Excel. Next, configure the connection.

### Configure the Business Central connection

If a user can't connect automatically, you can unblock them by asking them to follow these steps:

1. In the **Microsoft Dynamics** add-in pane in Excel, choose **Add server information**. If you don't see it, choose the ![More option button in Excel.](media/cogwheel.png) icon at the top to open the options dialog. 
2. For [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, set **Server URL** to `https://exceladdinprovider.smb.dynamics.com`. For [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, set it to the URL of the web client, like `https://myBCserver/240`.
3. Choose **OK**, and then confirm that the app reloads.
4. When prompted, sign in with your Business Central user name and password.
5. Optionally, choose the environment and company that you want to connect to.

The add-in is now connected to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], and you can edit data and publish the changes to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

## Prepare devices and network for the Excel add-in

Network services such as proxies or firewalls must allow routing between each client device on which the add-in is installed and many service endpoints. For a list of endpoints, go to [Preparing your network for the Excel add-In](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/configuring-network-for-addins).

## Troubleshooting

Sometimes, users run into problems with the Excel add-in. This section gives tips for how to unblock users in certain circumstances.

|Problem  |Solution or workaround  |Comments  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|The add-in doesn't start. <br><br>For example, the user gets the message "Add-in Warning: This add-in is no longer available" when trying to use the add-in. This particular problem can happen if Centralized Deployment is configured correctly, but the user wasn't assigned access.|Check whether the add-in is deployed centrally. Or, check whether the user is blocked from installing it locally. | The admin can configure Office so that users can't acquire add-ins. In that case, the admin must deploy the add-in centrally. For more information, see [Deploy add-ins in the admin center](/microsoft-365/admin/manage/manage-deployment-of-add-ins?view=o365-worldwide&preserve-view=true).|
|Data doesn't load into Excel.|Test the connection by opening another list in Excel from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Or, open the workbook in Excel in a browser.|If the user specified a company name that contains special characters, the add-in can't connect. |
|Data can't publish back to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].|Test the connection by opening the workbook in Excel in a browser. |Sometimes an extension can block the publishing job. If the page is extended or customized, remove the extensions, and then try again.|
|The dates are wrong.  |Excel might show times and dates in a different format than [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. This condition doesn't make them wrong, and the data in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't get messed up.|         |
|For some list pages, editing multiple lines in Excel consistently causes errors. This condition can occur if OData calls include FlowFields and fields outside of the repeater control.|On the **Web Services** page, select the **Exclude Non-Editable FlowFields** and **Exclude Fields Outside of the Repeater** checkboxes for the published page. Selecting these checkboxes excludes noneditable FlowFields and fields from the eTag calculation. |These checkboxes are hidden by default.

|Users can no longer sign in to the add-in.

| The add-in communicates using the API v2.0 for Dynamics 365 Business Central, and any limitations of this API are automatically inherited. An example limitation is if you try to edit a list and the underlying card uses a confirmation dialog in its AL logic, for example, as its validation logic. | Sometimes there's nothing to do because it's a design choice that the user must explicitly confirm the change. If the confirmation is negligible when using **Edit in Excel**, then you can wrap the confirmation dialog call in an if-conditional statement that checks whether the client type is different from ODataV4, for example, `if SESSION.CurrentClientType() <> ClientType::ODataV4 then`. | There might be other clients that you want to remove the confirmation dialog from, such as OData and SOAP. |

## Known limitations in business logic

|Page  |Limitation| Comments  |
|-------|---------|---------|
|Sales Orders|Error message: 'Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central Data Services attempted to issue a client callback to run page 301 Ship-to Address List as modal.' Client callbacks aren't supported on Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central Data Services. | The **Ship-to Code** on the **Sales Order** page is editable only with specific Ship-to options. Setting **Alternate Shipping Address** to **Ship-to** opens the **Ship-to Address List** modal dialog, which isn't compatible with Edit in Excel.|  
|Project Journal|Update of the **Unit Price** field doesn't trigger an update of the **Line Amount**. Instead, it updates **Line Discount**.| Using the web client, you can update fields in any order—price, amount, line discount. Other fields are updated automatically. To avoid cascade updates, the fields have advanced logic that relies on xRec, which behaves differently when called via APIs.|

## Known limitations in metadata generation

When using **Edit in Excel** in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], either by selecting the **Edit in Excel** action on a page or when the Excel add-in loads after opening an Excel workbook, you might encounter the following error: _Metadata was unable to be retrieved for entity \<entity name\> as it was not found_.

This error occurs when the page you're attempting to modify becomes too complex for **Edit in Excel** to process effectively. The primary cause is the installation of multiple extensions that add fields with identical field names to the same parent page, leading to conflicts. It's also possible for a single extension to block the metadata generation.

### Single extension blocking metadata creation

Consider the following scenario involving extension _A_, which includes the page extension _CustomerCardExtA_ and the page _WebViewerA_ where _PageType = CardPart_.

When metadata is generated for the _Customer Card_ page, the algorithm evaluates each individual field, including those fields added by extensions. However, if extension _A_ is installed, this process fails because _WebViewerA_ doesn't share the same source table as the _Customer Card_ page.

To resolve this issue, you should add a _Customer_ `SourceTable` property to the _WebViewerA_ page. An example of this modification can be observed in the code snippets containing _CustomerCardExtB_ and _WebViewerB_.

In some cases, you might need to embed the `CardPart` on multiple pages without referencing a specific source table. For such scenarios, we recommend creating a separate `CardPart` for each page where you also need to generate metadata and refactoring the shared logic into a codeunit.

```AL
pageextension 50120 CustomerCardExtA extends "Customer Card"
{
    layout
    {
        addlast(content)
        {
            part("Bing WebViewer"; "WebViewer")
            {
                ApplicationArea = All;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

```AL
page 50120 "WebViewerA"
{
    ApplicationArea = All;
    Caption = 'WebViewer', Locked = true;
    PageType = CardPart;

    layout
    {
        area(Content)
        {
            usercontrol(WebViewer; WebPageViewer)
            {
                #region ControlAddInReady
                trigger ControlAddInReady(callbackUrl: Text)
                begin
                    CurrPage.WebViewer.Navigate('https://www.bing.com')
                end;
                #endregion ControlAddInReady
            }
        }
    }
}
```

```AL
pageextension 50120 CustomerCardExtB extends "Customer Card"
{
    layout
    {
        addlast(content)
        {
            part("Bing WebViewer"; "WebViewer")
            {
                ApplicationArea = All;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

```AL
page 50120 "WebViewerB"
{
    ApplicationArea = All;
    Caption = 'WebViewer', Locked = true;
    PageType = CardPart;
    SourceTable = Customer;

    layout
    {
        area(Content)
        {
            usercontrol(WebViewer; WebPageViewer)
            {
                #region ControlAddInReady
                trigger ControlAddInReady(callbackUrl: Text)
                begin
                    CurrPage.WebViewer.Navigate('https://www.bing.com')
                end;
                #endregion ControlAddInReady
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Multiple extensions causing collisions

To resolve this issue, there are two potential solutions:

1. **Disable extensions**: To identify which extension is causing the conflict, you can disable extensions that affect the page one at a time. However, this approach might not be ideal if the extensions in question are necessary for your business processes.

2. **Modify extension code**: This solution involves analyzing the root cause of the issue and addressing it by modifying the code of the conflicting extensions.

To better understand this issue, consider the following example involving the **Customer Card** page (ID 21). When you are on the **Customer List** page (ID 22) and select **Edit in Excel**, a web service is generated in the background that exposes the fields from the **Customer Card** page. This web service includes all page fields defined on the **Customer Card** page, while table fields are only exposed if they correspond to a page field or are part of the primary key.

When an extension is installed that extends the **Customer Card** page, the fields added by the extension are also exposed in the web service. While extensions can't create page fields with the same names as those fields already existing on the **Customer Card** page, conflicts can still arise when multiple extensions add fields with identical names.

For example, suppose the following extension, referred to as _A_, is installed:

```AL
using Microsoft.Sales.Customer;

// Extension A
pageextension 50101 CustomerCardExtA extends "Customer Card"
{
    layout
    {
        addLast(General)
        {
            field("ShoeSize"; Rec.ShoeSize)
            {
                ApplicationArea = ALL;
                Caption = 'ShoeSize';
            }
        }
    }
}

tableextension 50101 CustomerTableExtension extends Customer
{
    fields
    {
        field(50100; ShoeSize; Integer) { }
    }
}
```

Now, consider that another extension, referred to as _B_, is installed, which also modifies the **Customer Card** page:

```AL
using Microsoft.Sales.Customer;

// Extension B
pageextension 50102 CustomerCardExtB extends "Customer Card"
{
    layout
    {
        addLast(General)
        {
            field("ShoeSize"; Rec.ShoeSizeField)
            {
                ApplicationArea = ALL;
                Caption = 'ShoeSize';
            }
        }
    }
}

tableextension 50102 CustomerTableExtension extends Customer
{
    fields
    {
        field(50105; ShoeSizeField; Integer) { }
    }
}
```

In this scenario, both extensions A and B add a page field named `ShoeSize` to the **Customer Card** page. This condition results in a conflict, which leads to a metadata generation failure for the **Customer Card** page.

To resolve this issue, you need access to the code of at least one of the extensions, and then to modify the conflicting page field names to avoid collisions.

## Deploy the Excel add-in for Business Central online

For [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, the administrator can deploy the add-in for all users. But users can also install the add-in themselves, provided they have permission to configure their Office experience.  

> [!TIP]
> In some organizations, administrators cannot deploy add-ins centrally. For more information, see [Determine if Centralized Deployment of add-ins works for your organization](/microsoft-365/admin/manage/centralized-deployment-of-add-ins?view=o365-worldwide&preserve-view=true).

### To deploy the Excel add-in for all users

1. As the administrator, sign in to the Microsoft commercial website and find the add-in at [https://appsource.microsoft.com/product/office/WA104379629](https://appsource.microsoft.com/product/office/WA104379629).
2. Choose the **Get it now** button.

    You'll be redirected to the Microsoft 365 admin center.
3. In the left panel, go to **Settings**, and then choose **Add-ins**.
4. In the **Configure add-in** pane, specify which users to grant access to the add-in.
5. Save your changes.


### To add the Excel add-in locally

1. Open Excel, and then open any Excel workbook.
2. On the **Insert** menu, choose **Office Add-ins**, and then choose **Admin managed** or **Store** as appropriate.
3. Search for *Dynamics Office Add-In*, and then install the add-in.

When the add-in is installed, it shows up as a panel in Excel. Next, you must configure the connection.

> [!TIP]
> If the workbook is not automatically saved to the user's OneDrive, then recommend them to save all workbooks that they export from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].When they open the workbook again, the connection is still available, so they do not have to configure the connection again.

> [!NOTE]
> In certain deployments, the administrator must configure network access to unblock the Excel add-in. For more information, see [Preparing Your Network for the Excel Add-In](configuring-network-for-addins.md).-->

# Define Retention Policies

This article describes how administrators can define retention policies to specify how often to delete outdated data in tables that contain log entries and archived records. For example, cleaning up log entries can make it easier to work with the more relevant data. Policies can delete data based on an expiration date, or you can add filters to include only certain expired data.

## Required setups and permissions

Before you can create retention policies, you must set up the tables to include and the periods of time to keep data.

|Setup  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|**Allowed Tables**     |We provide a list of tables that you can include in retention policies. If you want to add tables from an extension to a retention policy, a developer must add their tables to the list. To learn more, go to [Include your extension in a retention policy](admin-data-retention-policies.md#include-your-extension-in-a-retention-policy-requires-help-from-a-developer).          |
|**Retention Periods**     |Specify periods of time for which to keep data in the tables in a policy. The periods determine how often data is deleted.         |

Additionally, you must have the **SUPER** user permissions or the **Retention Policy Setup** permission set. Users who have the Retention Policy Setup permission set can define retention policies for tables. That's true, even if they don't have Read and Delete permissions for the tables. The job queue entry must run as a user with permissions to read and delete the data. Don't grant the Retention Policy Setup permission set to users who shouldn't be allowed to delete data.

> [!NOTE]
> If you're using [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, and you want to try out retention policies in the the Cronus demonstration database, there are a few things you need to do. The demonstration company doesn't contain tables that you can use with retention policies, so you need to add them. To do that, create a new, blank company in the demonstration database. In the new company, import the RapidStart configuration package for your country/region that corresponds to the standard NAV17.0.W1.ENU.STANDARD.rapidstart package. The setup data for retention policies will be available in the new company.

### Create retention periods

Retention periods can be as long or as short as you want. To create retention periods, on the **Retention Policies** page, use the **Retention Period** action. The periods you define are available for all policies.

> [!NOTE]
> For compliance reasons, we have defined a minimum retention period for some tables. If you set a retention period that's shorter than minimum required, a message displays the mandatory period.

### Set up a retention policy

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Retention Policies**, and choose the related link.
2. Select **New** to create a new retention policy. 
3. In the **Table ID** field, choose the table that you want to include in the policy.
4. In the **Retention Period** field, specify the length of time for which to keep the data in the table.
5. Optional: You can apply the policy to specific data in a table, rather than all records, by filtering the data for each line. The policy will apply only to the records that the filters return. To specify the filter criteria, turn off the **Apply to all records** toggle. The **Record Retention Policy** FastTab displays, where you can set filter criteria. To learn more about how filters work, go to [Filtering](ui-enter-criteria-filters.md#filtering).

   > [!NOTE]
   > Each line has its own retention period. If you specify different retention periods for the same data, the longest period is used. Also, some tables contain filters that you can't change or remove. To help you identify these filters, they appear in a lighter color font.

#### Video guidance

This video provides an example of how to set up a retention policy.

>[!VIDEO https://learn-video.azurefd.net/vod/player?id=511928c9-f956-45f6-8748-0c96f7ff0d33]

## Apply retention policies

You can use a job queue entry to apply retention policies to delete data automatically, or you can manually apply policies.

To apply a retention policy automatically, just create and enable a policy. When you enable a policy,, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates a job queue entry that applies the it according to its retention period. All retention policies will use the same job queue entry. By default, the job queue entry applies the policy every day at 0200. You can change the default, but if you do we recommend that it runs outside business hours. To learn more, go to [Use Job Queues to Schedule Tasks](admin-job-queues-schedule-tasks.md). 

You can manually apply a policy by using the **Apply Manually** action on the **Retention Policies** page. If you want to always apply a policy manually, turn on the **Manual** toggle. The job queue entry will disregard the policy when it runs.

## View retention policy log entries

You can view activity related to retention policies in the **Retention Policy Log** page. For example, entries are created when a policy is applied, or if errors occurred.

## Include your extension in a retention policy (requires help from a developer)

By default, retention policies cover only [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in the list we provide. You can remove default tables from the list, and you can add tables that you own. That is, you can't add a table that you did not create yourself. For example, you can't add other tables from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] or from an extension that you have purchased.

To add your tables to the list of allowed tables, a developer must add some code. For example, to the installer codeunit for the extension (a codeunit with the *install* subtype).

When a developer adds a table, they can specify mandatory and default filters. Mandatory filters can't be removed or modified later when you add tables to define a retention policy. The default filters are just suggestions.

The following are examples of how to add a table to the list of allowed tables with, and without, mandatory or default filters. For a more complex example, go to codeunit 3999 "Reten. Pol. Install - BaseApp".

```al
 trigger OnInstallAppPerCompany()
    var
        RetenPolAllowedTables: Codeunit "Reten. Pol. Allowed Tables";
    begin
        RetenPolAllowedTables.AddAllowedTable(Database::"Retention Policy Log Entry");
    end;
```

The following example includes a mandatory filter.

```al
 trigger OnInstallAppPerCompany()
    var
        ChangeLogEntry: Record "Change Log Entry";
        RetenPolAllowedTables: Codeunit "Reten. Pol. Allowed Tables";
        RetentionPeriod: Enum "Retention Period Enum";
        RecRef: RecordRef;
        TableFilters: JsonArray;
        Enabled: Boolean;
        Mandatory: Boolean;
    begin
        ChangeLogEntry.Reset();
        ChangeLogEntry.SetFilter("Field Log Entry Feature", '%1|%2', ChangeLogEntry."Field Log Entry Feature"::"Monitor Sensitive Fields", ChangeLogEntry."Field Log Entry Feature"::All);
        RecRef.GetTable(ChangeLogEntry);
        Enabled := true;
        Mandatory := true;
        RetenPolAllowedTables.AddTableFilterToJsonArray(TableFilters, RetentionPeriod::"28 Days", ChangeLogEntry.FieldNo(SystemCreatedAt), Enabled, Mandatory, RecRef);
        RetenPolAllowedTables.AddAllowedTable(Database::"Change Log Entry", ChangeLogEntry.FieldNo(SystemCreatedAt), TableFilters);
    end;
```

After a developer has added tables to the list, an administrator can include them in a retention policy.

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes in-product tours and teaching tips that can help you get started. In the current version, there are tours for the steps in the **Get started** list and some of the most commonly used pages in the demonstration company, such as the **Sales Invoice** card page.  

Teaching tips are short messages that inform, remind, or teach you about important and new capabilities that launch automatically when you open a page. For example, to see the teaching tip for the **Sales Invoice** card, choose the link in the top left corner of the page where it says *Sales Invoice*. This launches a callout with a short description of the page and what you can do there. If a tour exists for the page, a link invites you to take the tour. The *Learn more* link takes you to the product Help for the page.

## Role-specific home pages

Depending on your role, the home page provides an overview of the business. The navigation bar gives you easy access to customers, vendors, items, and so on. The **Activities** tiles show current data and provide easy access to the selected document.

The **Key Performance Indicators** can be set up to display a selected chart for a visual representation of, for example, cash flow or income and expenses. You can also build up a list of **Favorite Customers** on the home page for accounts that you do business with often or need to pay special attention to.

Use the arrows to collapse a part of the page and make more room to show specific data. At the top of the home page you'll find all of the actions that you can use in the current content. You can collapse this area too. To expand it again, select or tap in the collapsed area.

> [!TIP]  
> You can get back to the home page by selecting the company name in the upper left corner.

## Company information

Under **Company Settings**, you can view and edit setup information about the current company. Much of this information was prefilled if you completed the **Set Up Company** assisted setup when you signed up for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. If you want to change the company logo, contact information, bank settings, or tax information, you can do it from this page.  

## Adding users and permissions

[!INCLUDE [2023rw1-sec-group-short](includes/2023rw1-sec-group-short.md)]

You add users in Microsoft 365 admin center. For more information, see [Create Users According to Licenses](ui-how-users-permissions.md).

title: Set Up Bin Types
description: Assign types and basic flow activities to bins and, in doing so, define the way the bins are used for particular warehouse activities.

# Set Up Bin Types

You can direct the flow of items through bins that you have defined for particular warehouse activities. You give each bin its basic flow activities, and thereby define the way a bin is used, by assigning it a bin type.  

There are six types. You can operate your warehouse with all of the six possible bin types, or you can choose to operate with just the RECEIVE, PUTPICK, SHIP and QC bin types. These four bin types enable suggestions to be made that support the flow of items and allow you to record inventory discrepancies.  

## To set up the bin types you want to use

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Bin Types**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  On the **Bin Types** page, create a 10-character code for a bin type.  
3.  Select the activities that can be performed with each bin type.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  Bin types are only applicable if you are using directed put-away and pick for your location.  

The bin type determines only how a bin is used when processing the flow of items through the warehouse. You can always override the suggestions for any warehouse document, and you can move items in or out of any bin by performing a warehouse movement.  

The bin types that you can create are listed below.  

|Bin Type|Description|  
|------------------|---------------------------------------|  
|RECEIVE|Items registered as posted receipts but not yet put away.|  
|SHIP|Items picked for warehouse shipment lines but not yet posted as shipped.|  
|PUT AWAY|Typically, items to be stored in large units of measure but that you do not want to access for picking purposes. Because these bins are not used for picking, either for production orders or shipments, your use of a Put Away type bin might be limited, but this bin type could be useful if you have purchased a large quantity of items. Bins of this type should always have a low bin-ranking, so that when received items are put away, other higher-ranking PUTPICK bins fixed to the item are put away first. If you are using this type of bin, you must regularly perform bin replenishment so that the items stored in these bins are also available in PUTPICK or PICK type bins.|  
|PICK|Items to be used only for picking, for example, for items with an approaching expiration date that you have moved into this type of bin. You would place a high bin ranking on these bins so they are suggested for picking first.|  
|PUTPICK|Items in bins that are suggested for both the put-away and pick functions. Bins of this type probably have different bin rankings. You can set up your bulk storage bins as this type of bin with low bin rankings compared to your ordinary pick bins or forward picking area bins.|  
|QC|This bin is used for inventory adjustments if you specify this bin on the location card in the **Adjustment Bin Code** field. You can also set up bins of this type for defective items and items being inspected. You can move items to this type of bin if you want to make them inaccessible to the usual item flow.<br /><br /> **NOTE:** Unlike all other bin types, the **QC** bin type has none of the item handling check boxes selected by default. This indicates that any content you place in a QC bin is excluded from item flows.|

# Add and View Notes on Records
 You <!--OnPrem and your colleagues -->can add notes to records in the application. Many pages, particularly those that display a list of records, such as the **Sales Orders** page, include the **Notes** action or the **Notes** FactBox. <!--OnPrem Notes is where you can write notes about a record to yourself or others, and where you can view notes to you from others. For example, a note could be a general comment or processing instruction to your colleague, who can then respond to your note using their own **Notes**. Or, your colleague can add a note that gives you extra information about a sales order that is not covered by the information on the sales order. These notes and correspondences will follow the record as it is processed in the company.-->

# Enable picking items by FEFO

First-Expired-First-Out (FEFO) is a sorting method that ensures that items with the earliest expiration dates are picked first.  

 This functionality only works when the following criteria are met:

- The item must be assigned an item tracking code where the **SN Warehouse Tracking**, **Lot Warehouse Tracking**, or **Package Warehouse Tracking** fields are selected. The item must be posted to inventory with an expiration date.
- On the location, the **Pick According to FEFO** toggle must be turned on.

Depending on which document you plan to use, make some more settings:

- **Inventory Pick**. You can use picking by FEFO for locations with and without bins.
- **Warehouse Pick**. On the location, the **Bin Mandatory** toggles must be turned on.

When all the criteria are met, the serial/lot-numbered items to pick are sorted with the oldest first in all picks and movements.  

> [!NOTE]  
> If some serial or lot-numbered items have specific tracking defined in the source document, such as sales order, then those are respected first and under them, the remaining, non-specific, serial/lot numbers are listed according to FEFO.
<br /><br />
If two serial or lot-numbered items have the same expiration date, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] selects the item with the lowest serial or lot number.
<br /><br />
When picking serial or lot-numbered items in locations set up for directed put-away and pick, only quantities in bins of the type *Pick* are picked according to FEFO.  
<br /><br />
To enable movements according to FEFO, leave the **From Bin** field empty on the **Inventory Movement** or **Movement Worksheet** pages.  
<br /><br />
If the **Strict Expiration Posting** field is selected on the **Item Tracking Code Card**, only items that aren't expired are included in the pick, and the lines are sorted according to the FEFO principle.
<br /><br />
> If you posted the item to inventory without an expiration date, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] populates the serial or lot number as a warehouse pick, but not an inventory pick.

# Printer setup and management overview

[!INCLUDE[azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id](~/../shared-content/shared/azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id.md)]

Printing documents and reports from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is an important task for business users. You typically want to send print jobs directly to one of your organization's printers&mdash;no matter the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] client or app you're using. Because [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online is a cloud service, it can't directly reach local printers connected to users' devices, but you can connect it to cloud-enabled printers.

## What are your printer possibilities in Business Central

To support your print needs, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers the following features:

|Feature|Description|Web client| Mobile app|App for Teams|
|-------|-----------|----------|-----------|--------------|
|Universal Print|Universal Print is a printer management solution available as a cloud service from Microsoft. With this feature, you can set up your printers in Universal Print, then register them for use in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. This feature requires a Universal Print subscription and the **Universal Print Integration** extension.|![works online.](media/check.png)|![works online.](media/check.png)|![works online](media/check.png)|
|Email Print|This feature lets you set up email-enabled printers. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] then sends print jobs to a printer using the printer's email address. This feature requires email-enabled printers, and the **Send to Email Printer** extension.|![works online.](media/check.png)|![works online](media/check.png)|![works online](media/check.png)|
|Browser printing|The print features of your browser handle the print jobs. If a cloud printer isn't installed and set up, or if an installed printer fails, then printing defaults to the printing options for the browser. The **Printer** field on the report request page displays *(Handled by the browser)*.|![works online](media/check.png)|||

Most of the work for setting up printers can be done from the **Printer Management** page in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Although with Universal Print printers, you might also have to work in Microsoft 365 admin center or the Azure portal.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For Business Central on-premises, Universal Print and Email Print require that Microsoft Entra ID or NavUserPassword authentication is used.

## Custom printer extensions

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports other custom printer extensions that add even more print features. So if you have any custom printer extensions installed, your application might include print features not described in this article.

If you're an AL developer and want to learn about how to create printer extensions, go to [Developing Printer Extensions in Business Central](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-reports-printing).

# Analyze Data with Statistical Accounts

Use statistical accounts to supplement information in financial reports. Statistical accounts let you add metrics that are based on non-transactional data. You add the non-transactional data as number-based units, such as:

* Employee headcount
* Square footage
* The number of customers with overdue accounts

For example, you can measure revenue or costs based on the number of people in a department. The headcount for the department is the unit for the statistical account. The following image shows an example of a report that uses a statistical account to show revenue per employee.

:::image type="content" source="media/statistical account report example.png" alt-text="An example of a report that includes data from a statistical account.":::

In terms of how they work, statistical accounts are similar to posting accounts. They store transactions that you post using statistical account journals, so that you can use the transactions as data for financial reports. To learn more about financial reports, go to [Prepare Financial Reporting with Financial Data and Account Categories](bi-how-work-account-schedule.md). 

There are a couple of key differences between statistical accounts and posting accounts. Statistical accounts are separate entities, and aren't included in trial balance reports. Also, you don't need to balance debit and credit amounts when you use statistical account journals to post entries to a statistical account. You just post the amount.

## Set up a statistical account

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Statistical Accounts**, then choose the related link.
1. On the **General** FastTab, fill in the fields. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

## Post amounts to a statistical account

1. To post the amounts you want to track, on the **Statistical Accounts** page, choose the **Statistical Accounts Journal** action.
1. In the **Posting date** field, enter the last date of the posting period that you want to post amounts for.
1. Optional: If you want to track amounts for a specific document, in the **Document No.** field, enter the document's ID.
1. In the **Statistical Account No.** field, choose the statistical account that you'll post amounts to.
1. In the **Description** field, enter a brief description of what you're measuring.  
1. In the **Amount** field, enter the amount to post. 
1. Optional: If you'll want to include the statistical account in more advanced analyses, specify dimensions in the **Department Code** and **Customergroup Code** fields. To learn more about dimensions, go to [Analyze Data by Dimensions](bi-how-analyze-data-dimension.md).

## Verify statistical account amounts

On the **Statistical Accounts** page, use the **Statistical Accounts Balance** action to verify that the registered amounts are correct for each period.  

## Include the statistical account in a financial report

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Financial Reports**, then choose the related link.
1. Create a new financial report in one of the following ways:
    1. To start from scratch, choose **New**. To learn more about creating financial reports, go to [Create a new financial report](bi-how-work-account-schedule.md#create-a-new-financial-report).
    1. To use settings from a similar report you already have, choose the report to copy, and then choose the **Copy Financial Report** action. You can edit the settings you copy in your new report.
1. Add the statistical account:
    1. If you're starting from scratch, choose the **Edit Row Definition** action.
    1. To use a row definition from an existing report, choose the report to copy from, and then choose the **Copy Row Definition** action.
1. On the **Row Definition** page, in the **Row No.** field, define where the row will appear in the sequence of rows on the report.
1. In the **Description** field, enter text that indicates what you're measuring.
1. In the **Totaling Type** field, choose **Statistical Accounts**.
1. In the **Totaling** field, choose a statistical account.
1. In the **Row Type** field, choose whether to view the balance on the posting date or the beginning of the posting period, or to show the change to the amount during the period.
1. Fill in the remaining fields. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

# Create contacts

When you develop a business relationship with someone in another company, add them as a contact in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Then, add any information about them, or their company, that could be useful in future communications. You can create the following types of contacts on the **Contact Card** page:

* **Person** – Use this when you've had direct contact with someone and have their contact details.
* **Company** – Use this for a contact that is not an individual person but rather an entity such as a contractor or a bank.

The information that's relevant for each type of contact differs, so the available fields and actions are different. For example, you can only assign job responsibilities to a person, and an industry group to a company.

You can change the value of the **Type** field later. Alternatively, use the fields on the **Inheritance** FastTab on the **Marketing Setup** page to specify the data to share between a person and their company. Learn more at [Setting Up Contacts](marketing-setup-contacts.md).

When you convert a contact to a customer, vendor, or employee, for example, the contact person or contact company becomes the name of the customer. The record for the contact is kept, and you can link the contact and the customer so their data synchronizes going forward.

## To create a contact manually

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Contacts**, then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action.
3. In the **No.** field, enter a number for the contact.

   Alternatively, if you have a number series for contacts on the **Marketing Setup** page, you can select <kbd>Enter</kbd> to insert the next available contact number.
4. Fill in the remaining fields as required. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

## To create a contact from a customer, vendor, or bank account

If you have existing customers, vendors, and bank accounts you want to create contact cards for, you can use the **Create Contacts from** batch jobs. When you create a contact this way, the contact information is later synchronized with the related customer, vendor, or bank account information. Learn more at [Synchronizing Contacts with Customers, Vendors, Employees, and Bank Accounts](marketing-create-contact-companies.md#synchronizing-contacts-with-customers-vendors-employees-and-bank-accounts).

> [!NOTE]  
> Before you can create contacts based on existing data, you must specify a business relation code for customers, vendors, or bank accounts on the **Interactions** FastTab on the **Marketing Setup** page. Learn more at [Set up Contacts](marketing-setup-contacts.md).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter one of the following that matches the entity you want to create contacts from, then choose the related link.
   * **Create Contacts from Customers**
   * **Create Contacts from Vendors**
   * **Create Contacts from Bank Accounts**
2. On the request page that opens, in the **Customer**, **Vendor**, or **Bank Account** section, set filters if you want to create contacts from specific customers, vendors, or bank accounts.
3. Choose **OK** to start creating contacts.

The next contact numbers in the number series are assigned to the new contacts. The business relation code specified on the **Marketing Setup** page is assigned to the newly created contacts.

> [!TIP]  
> You can also do this the other way around, namely by creating a customer, vendor, employee, or bank account from a contact. Learn more in the [To create a customer, vendor, employee, or bank account from a contact](marketing-create-contact-companies.md#to-create-a-customer-vendor-employee-or-bank-account-from-a-contact) section.

## To create a customer, vendor, employee, or bank account from a contact

If you have a customer, vendor, employee, or bank account for the company you want to create a contact for, use the **Create as** action. When you create a contact this way, the contact information is later synchronized with the related customer, vendor, employee, or bank account information. Learn more at [Synchronizing Contacts with Customers, Vendors, and Bank Accounts](marketing-create-contact-companies.md#synchronizing-contacts-with-customers-vendors-employees-and-bank-accounts).

> [!NOTE]  
> Before you can create customers, vendors, employees, or bank accounts from contacts, you must specify a business relation code on the **Marketing Setup** page on the **Interactions** FastTab. Learn more at [Setting up Contacts](marketing-setup-contacts.md).
>
>Also, you must also have at least one template set up for each of them. For example, to create a customer from a contact, you must have a customer template.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Contacts**, then choose the related link.
2. Select the contact you want to create as a customer, vendor, employee, or bank account.
3. Choose the **Create as** action, then choose either **Customer**, **Vendor**, **Bank**, or **Employee**.
4. Choose **OK**.

The contact information is transferred from the contact card to a new customer, vendor, employee, or bank account card. You may want to add specific information to each of the cards, such as invoicing and payment details. For an example, see [Register New Customers](sales-how-register-new-customers.md).

## To link a contact to an existing customer, vendor, employee, or bank account

If you have a contact and either a customer, vendor, employee, or bank account for the same company, you can link the two entities to synchronize data.

1. Open the contact you want to link.
2. Choose the **Link with existing** action, then choose the **Customer**, **Vendor**, **Bank**, or **Employee** action.
3. On the page that opens, select the customer, vendor, employee, or bank account to link to.
4. In the **Current Master Fields** field, specify the fields to prioritize if there is conflicting information in fields common to both the existing contact and the customer, vendor, employee, or bank account. So, if the salesperson code differs between the contact and customer, you can choose to keep the one on the contact card by selecting **Contact**.
5. Choose **OK**.

## To remove a link between a contact and an existing customer, vendor, employee, or bank account

If you linked a contact with a customer, vendor, employee, or bank account that you didn't intend to, remove the link between the entities so the data no longer synchronizes.

1. Open the contact that has the wrong link.  
2. Choose the **Business Relations** action.  
3. On the page that opens, select the customer, vendor, employee, or bank account to remove the link from.  
4. Choose the **Delete** action.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Do not use the **Business Relations** window to change existing relations. Instead, remove the relation and use the **Link with existing** action. Learn more in the [To link a contact to an existing customer, vendor, employee, or bank account](marketing-create-contact-companies.md#to-link-a-contact-to-an-existing-customer-vendor-employee-or-bank-account) section.

## Synchronizing contacts with customers, vendors, employees, and bank accounts

If some of your contacts are also customers, vendors, employees, or bank accounts, you can synchronize them with data from the contact and gain the following benefits:

* You only have to update information in one place. So, if you modify the phone number on the contact, the phone number for the customer, vendor, employee, or bank account is automatically updated.
* If you have specified a number series for contacts, when you create a customer, vendor, employee, or bank account card, a contact is automatically created.
* You can create sales quotes and orders, and purchase quotes and orders, from the contact.
* You can record your interactions, such as printing orders, blanket orders, creating sales service orders, sending e-mails, and so on.
* If you delete a contact linked to a customer, vendor, employee, or bank account, only the contact is removed. The customer, vendor, employee, or bank account remains.
* Likewise, if you delete a customer, vendor, employee, or bank account that is linked to a contact, the contact remains.

> [!NOTE]  
> Certain details, such as invoicing and posting details, are not available for contacts. When you create contacts as customers, vendors, employees, or bank accounts, you may want to add that information manually.

There are three ways to enable data synchronization between contacts and customers, vendors, employees, or bank accounts:

* When you create contacts from customers, vendors, or bank accounts. Learn more in the [To create a contact from a customer, vendor, or bank account](marketing-create-contact-companies.md#to-create-a-contact-from-a-customer-vendor-or-bank-account) section.
* When you create customers, vendors, employees, or bank accounts from contacts. Learn more in the [To create a customer, vendor, employee, or bank account from a contact](marketing-create-contact-companies.md#to-create-a-customer-vendor-employee-or-bank-account-from-a-contact) section.
* When you link contacts to existing customers, vendors, employees, or bank accounts from the contact card. Learn more in the [To link a contact to an existing customer, vendor, employee, or bank account](marketing-create-contact-companies.md#to-link-a-contact-to-an-existing-customer-vendor-employee-or-bank-account) section.

## To view which customer, vendor, employee, or bank account a contact is related to

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Contacts**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the line for a contact, choose the **Related Information** action, and then choose the **Customer/Vendor/Bank Account/Employee** action.

# Design details: Item tracking and planning
Because they are stored in the reservation system, item tracking numbers are fully coordinated with order tracking records. This means that items with order tracking records can be assigned item tracking numbers. Conversely, items that have item tracking numbers can become order tracking records. For more information, see [Design Details: Item Tracking Design](design-details-item-tracking-design.md).

For more information about the integrated systems, see [Design Details: Reservations, Order Tracking, and Action Messaging](design-details-reservation-order-tracking-and-action-messaging.md).

Because order tracking is only concerned with specific item application, the coordination with item tracking numbers only applies to items that are set up to use specific item tracking. This is set by the **SN Specific Tracking** and **Lot Specific Tracking** fields on the item card, which specify the following:

- The item must carry a serial number or lot number when it is posted.
- The item must apply to the same serial number or lot number when it is posted outbound.

In alignment with standard supply/demand balancing principles, the planning system and the related order tracking feature only match supply and demand carrying item tracking numbers if the item in question uses specific item tracking. In all other cases, the planning and order tracking systems ignore item tracking numbers when they apply supply to meet demand or apply demand to supply. For more information, see [Design Details: Reservation, Order Tracking, and Action Messaging](design-details-reservation-order-tracking-and-action-messaging.md).

For example, when order tracking exists for a given item, it implies that records for the item are already in the **Reservation Entry** table, which is the core of the reservation system, before the item tracking numbers are defined. Therefore, the following coupling restrictions apply to the item tracking numbers to be order tracked:

- Demand with a serial number or lot number can only cover supply with the same serial number or lot number.
- Demand without a serial or lot number can cover any supply, with or without a serial or lot number.

Apart from their consequences on dynamic order tracking, the item tracking coupling restrictions do not affect the planning system significantly.

On the supply side, a serial or lot number is typically not entered until immediately before the order is posted, such as a purchase receipt into the warehouse. When entering a serial or lot number on the demand side, such as on a sales order, that serial or lot number is already in inventory. Accordingly, item tracking numbers are typically not an issue in supply planning.

For items that use specific item tracking, all demand carrying serial or lot numbers must be matched by corresponding supply. In most cases, it does not make sense to reorder a specific serial or lot number, so the planning of purchase or production supplies is probably not affected. However, when transferring items from one location to another, it is likely that the transfer is for a specific lot, so planning transfer supplies might be affected by the specific coupling restriction.

For more information, see [Design Details: Transfers in Planning](design-details-transfers-in-planning.md).

## Balancing demand and supply
If an item requires specific item tracking, then an order tracking link is made from all the item’s item tracking demand to any corresponding item tracking supply, with the sole limitation that supply should come before demand. If, under those circumstances, no item tracking supply can be found that corresponds to the item tracking-specific demand, then a new item tracking supply is created immediately and without considering order sizing, planning parameters, or rescheduling of existing supply of the same serial or lot number.

If item tracking numbers are assigned on the demand side or on the supply side without requiring specific item tracking, then an order track link is made from the demand to that supply, based on the most suitable timing and quantity, as in the usual balancing procedure. The specified item tracking number goes into the order tracking record in the same way that any specified item tracking quantity defines one end of the order tracking link. This means that the item tracking number that is entered is preserved while it is also part of the order tracking record.

If item tracking numbers are assigned on the supply side without requiring specific item tracking, then this supply is regarded as fixed by the planning system. No resizing or rescheduling is suggested for this supply, but the supply is taken into consideration when the planning system tries to meet the gross requirements.

For more information, see [Design Details: Balancing Demand and Supply](design-details-balancing-demand-and-supply.md).

# Use the same Microsoft 365 Account in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_long.md)] and Microsoft Invoicing
When you sign up for a trial with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can move to a 30-day evaluation phase, you can start a subscription, or you can stop using [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. In all cases, you may at some point have seen something called **Microsoft Invoicing** and clicked it. This was an app that was part of what is now Microsoft 365 Business Standard and was formerly known as Microsoft 365 Business Premium subscription, so not everyone will have seen that tile in their Microsoft 365 experience.  

Microsoft Invoicing is no longer available, but if you need to sign into Invoicing to retrieve your data, you might see a message that you cannot access Microsoft Invoicing because your account is used in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

You see a similar message if you install the mobile app for Invoicing.  

## Workaround
Invoicing and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] have a shared platform. That means that you are recognized as an existing user of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] when you click Invoicing in the Microsoft 365 admin center. The reason is that Invoicing cannot use the same company as [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

So you will have to sign in to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and rename your existing company, and then create a new company that you can then use in Invoicing. No data is moved or overwritten during this workaround.

### To rename your company
1. Sign in to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].
2. In the top right corner, choose the **Settings** icon ![Settings.](media/ui-experience/settings_icon_small.png "Settings icon for role center"), and then choose **My Settings**.
3. In the **Company** field, choose a different company.
4. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Companies**, and then choose the related link.  
5. On the **Companies** page, choose **Edit List**.  
6. Change the name of the *My Company* entry to something else.  

    Wait a number of minutes. We’ll be making a number of changes in the underlying database, and that takes a while.
7.	When the system is ready again, choose the **Create New Company** button.  
8.  In the dialog that appears, specify the name as *My Company*, and choose the **Production – Setup Data Only** option.  

This again takes a number of minutes. When the process completes, you will be able to access Invoicing as part of your Microsoft 365 Business Standard experience. but only to export data since the Invoicing app is deprecated.  

### What about my data?
When you rename the original My Company, the database tables that store your existing [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] data are renamed, but the data itself is not touched.  

If you use both Invoicing and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the data is stored in two different containers (the two companies). Nothing is shared, so you'll have to manage customers and items in both companies.

# Access Data in Teams without Business Central License

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] users are assigned a Dynamics 365 Business Central license that allows them to view, modify, and act on their business data within Teams. These users can collaborate on data by sharing records into chats or channels, or adding tabs that show records. However, there may be other employees across the organization who don't have a Business Central license but could benefit by being able to view data in Teams. For these users, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers limited access through their Microsoft 365 licenses only.  

As an administrator, you can configure environments to enable access with Microsoft 365 licenses. You can then choose exactly which tables and other objects this category of user will have access to. Once configured, employees who have a Microsoft 365 license, but no Business Central license, can view Business Central records that are shared with them in Microsoft Teams chat and channels.

To learn more about access with Microsoft 365 Licenses, go to [Business Central Access with Microsoft 365 Licenses](admin-access-with-m365-license.md) and [Access with Microsoft 365 Licenses FAQ](admin-access-with-m365-license-faq.md).

# Managing intercompany transactions

Businesses with more than one legal entity with separate accounting functions can benefit from intercompany transactions. For example, it's useful for businesses that have subsidiaries in multiple international markets or regions. Or, an organization might have several companies but lack the equivalent number of accounting and administrative teams. Intercompany transactions simplify and streamline business processes and transactions between companies in the intercompany partnership.

After you specify the customer and vendor relationships for intercompany transactions, partners enter information one time in sales and purchase documents. A corresponding document is created at the other partner involved in the transaction. Mapping the chart of accounts and dimensions helps ensure that information appears in the right places.  

There are four main benefits to the intercompany functionality:  

* Increased productivity as a result of time saved and simplified transactions  
* Minimized mistakes with one-time entry of information and system-wide, automated updates  
* Transparent audit trail and full visibility into business activities and transaction histories  
* Efficient transactions with affiliate and subsidiary companies  

## Streamline the flow of business activities  

Intercompany transactions let you distribute sales and purchasing documents and general journal entries to all of your satellite offices, sales offices, or subsidiary companies. Distributing transactions saves time and increases efficiency throughout the organization by reducing data entry. It cuts down on the need to send, receive, print, and archive sales and purchasing documents.  

You're in full control of all transaction documents. For example, you can reject a document sent to you and use the **Reverse Journal Postings** and **Undo Receipts/Shipments** actions to make corrections. Or, when making a purchase from a partner or subsidiary company, you can update the purchase order as long as the selling company hasn't shipped the goods.  

When you enter a transaction, you don't need to specify the accounts to use. You just choose the intercompany partner. The intercompany functionality creates general journal lines that balance the books of both companies involved in the transaction. In receivables and payables, you assign an intercompany partner code to any customer or vendor. From that moment on, all orders and invoices for transactions between these companies produce corresponding documents in the partner company. The result is correctly balanced accounts.  

Intercompany focuses on sales and purchase documents and general journal lines, and allows transactions between multiple [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] databases. For example:

* Different countries/regions
* Multiple currencies
* Different charts of accounts
* Different dimensions
* Different item numbers  

Intercompany transactions use several types of entries and documents:  

* General journal entries
* Purchase and sales orders
* Purchase and sales invoices
* Credit memos
* Return orders

When you set up intercompany transactions, you create a list of intercompany partners, an intercompany chart of accounts, and intercompany dimensions. Afterward, you can create transactions in intercompany general journals.

> [!NOTE]
> The general journal by itself doesn't include currencies. It converts all amounts to the local currency at the current exchange rate.

After you set up business partners as customers and vendors, and assign them intercompany partner codes, they can exchange intercompany purchase and sales documents, including items and item charges. 

> [!NOTE]
> Companies can't use intercompany to exchange all types of data. Purchase invoices are not submitted to business partners through intercompany processes. However, sales invoices that are submitted through intercompany processes will be created as purchase invoices in the receiving company.

Consolidating financial data might be relevant for intercompany processes. For more information, see [Consolidating Financial Data from Multiple Companies](finance-consolidated-company-reporting.md).

# FAQ for bank account reconciliation assist with Copilot

These frequently asked questions (FAQ) describe the AI impact of Microsoft Copilot assistance with bank account reconciliation in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## What is bank reconciliation assist?

Bank reconciliation is a common accounting task where organizations review their bank account statements to identify transactions that should be registered in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For example, this task is used to identify periodic bank fees or small employee expenses.

Bank reconciliation is typically a multi-step process. First, bank statements are imported into [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Next, transactions are matched with ledger entries. Finally, new ledger entries are posted to reflect any residual transactions that weren't previously known to your ledgers.

Copilot in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] reduces the manual effort by matching more transactions and suggesting general ledger (G/L) accounts that you can post to.

## What are the capabilities of bank reconciliation assist?

Copilot provides AI-powered assistance with two distinct tasks:

- Improved matching of transactions with ledger entries

    [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers automated rules that automatically match many bank transactions with ledger entries. However, these rules are inflexible and often result in many unmatched transactions, each of which requires manual inspection and comparison. Copilot uses AI technology to inspect those unmatched transactions and identify more matches, based on the dates, amounts, and descriptions. For example, if a customer paid multiple invoices in one lump sum, Copilot reconciles the single bank statement line with the multiple invoice ledger entries.

- Suggested G/L accounts

    For residual bank transactions that can't be matched to any ledger entries, Copilot uses AI technology to compare the transaction description with G/L account names and then suggest the most likely G/L account to post to. For example, if unmatched transactions have the narrative *Fuel Stop 24*, Copilot might suggest that you post them to the *Transportation* account.

Copilot doesn't connect to your bank to retrieve or send transactions. This task remains fully within your control. It's a prerequisite for using Copilot's assistance, regardless of whether the transactions are added to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] by using a digital bank connection, imported from a bank statement file, or manually entered.

## What is the intended use of bank reconciliation assist?

Bank account reconciliation assist is designed to improve the accuracy of ledgers by helping customers identify new transactions that they should account for in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. It isn't intended for fraud detection or to identify whether customers paid on time.

## How was bank reconciliation assist evaluated? What metrics are used to measure performance?

Bank account reconciliation assist was tested by using combinations of synthetic bank transaction data and similar G/L accounts and ledger entries that cover the typical variations and data limits for each field and in different languages. Test data represents both typical usage and usage by bad actors. Performance was measured in comparison to manual reconciliation of the same data.

## What are the limitations of bank reconciliation assist? How can users minimize the impact of these limitations when they use the system?

Bank account reconciliation assist performs best when G/L account names, ledger entry descriptions, and bank transaction descriptions are all in the same language. Mixed languages or mixed languages for transaction descriptions often result in fewer matches and suggestions.

Suggested ledger accounts performs best in one of the supported languages (see the next section for a list of languages). Users might experience fewer transaction matches and fewer suggested ledger accounts in other languages.

## In which geographies and languages is bank reconciliation assist available? 

[!INCLUDE[copilot-geo-and-language-availability](includes/copilot-geo-and-language-availability.md)]

## What is expected of system users when they operate bank account reconciliation assist?

### During bank account reconciliation

AI-powered matches and suggestions might sometimes be incorrect or incomplete. Users of bank account reconciliation assist must review the accuracy of the matches and suggestions that Copilot provides before they choose to keep them. Copilot's matches and suggestions aren't saved to the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] database until you select the **Keep it** button and close the Copilot window. You can edit and correct any matches or suggestions before you choose to keep them.

### After bank account reconciliation is completed

We recommend that users also verify accuracy and correct any discrepancies after they close the Copilot window. This process should include the following activities:

- Review the reconciliation test report.
- Ensure that your organization has the appropriate review and audit processes in place.
- Reopen any posted reconciliations by using the **Undo** function.
- Correct any erroneous ledger entries through reverse posting of entries.

## What is expected of administrators and system users when they operate bank account reconciliation assist?

System users, such as accountants, treasurers, or other people who work on business accounting, should always review the accuracy of matches and suggestions that Copilot provides before they choose to keep them. After reconciliation with Copilot, we recommend that these users review the reconciliation test report to verify accuracy and identify any discrepancies.

Administrators should ensure that the appropriate accounting users are granted access to this capability.

## Is Copilot the only means of completing bank account reconciliation?

No. Use of Copilot is optional. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers traditional, non-AI-powered means of importing bank statements, running predefined matching rules, and manually applying matches and posting to appropriate ledger accounts. Both the traditional approach and Copilot can be used simultaneously in an organization.

## How do I give feedback about AI-generated content?

Each time that Copilot provides matches or suggestions, you can provide feedback to Microsoft directly from the Copilot window by using the like (thumbs up) and dislike (thumbs down) controls. Your feedback remains anonymous, and we use this data to improve the quality of the service.

# Set up work centers and machine centers

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] distinguishes between three types of capacities that are arranged in a hierarchy where each level contains subordinate levels.  

The top level is the work center group. Work centers are assigned to work center groups. Every work center can only belong to one work center group.

You can assign various machine centers to work centers. A machine center can only belong to one work center.  

The planned capacity of a work center consists of the availability of the corresponding machine centers and the planned availability of the work center. The planned availability of the work center group is, therefore, the sum of all corresponding availabilities of the machine centers and work centers. Availability is stored in calendar entries.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before you set up work or machine centers, you must set up shop calendars. For more information, see [Create Shop Calendars](production-how-to-create-work-center-calendars.md).

## To set up a work center

The following steps describe how to set up a work center. The steps to set up a machine center calendar are similar, except for the **Routing Setup** FastTab.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Work Centers**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
4. In the **Work Center Group Code** field, select the higher-level resource grouping that the work center is organized under, if relevant. Choose the **New** action in the drop-down list.  
5. In the **Alternate Work Center** field, select the work center to use if this work center isn't available or when demand exceeds its capacity. The alternate work center is for information only, and isn't automatically included in planning processes.
6. Select the **Blocked** field if you want to prevent the work center from being used in any processing. This means that output can't be posted for an item that is produced at the work center. For more information, see [Post Production Output](production-how-to-post-output-quantity.md).
7. In the **Direct Unit Cost** field, enter the cost of producing one unit of measure at this work center, excluding any other cost elements. This cost is often referred to as the *direct labor rate*.  
8. In the **Indirect Cost %** field, enter the general operation costs of using the work center as a percentage of the direct unit cost. This percentage amount is added to the direct cost in the calculation of the unit cost.  
9. In the **Overhead Rate** field, enter any nonoperational costs, for example maintenance expenses, of the work center as an absolute amount.  

    The **Unit Cost** field contains the calculated unit cost of producing one unit of measure at this work center, including all cost elements, as follows:  

    Unit Cost = Direct Unit Cost + (Direct Unit Cost x Indirect Cost %) + Overhead Rate.  

10. In the **Unit Cost Calculation** field, define whether the unit cost calculation should be based on the amount of time used or the number of units produced.  
11. Select the **Specific Unit Cost** field if you want to define the work center's unit cost on the routing line where it's being used. This setting might be relevant for operations with capacity costs that are different than what you would normally process at that work center.  
12. In the **Flushing Method** field, select whether manually or automatically calculate and post output at this work center using one of the following methods.

    |Option|Description|
    |------|-----------|
    |**Manual**| Manually post time used, output, and scrap in the output journal or production journal.|
    |**Forward**|Automatically post output when you release the production order.|
    |**Backward**|Automatically post output when you finish the production order.|

    > [!NOTE]
    > If necessary, the flushing method selected here can be overridden for individual operations by changing the setting on routing lines

13. In the **Unit of Measure Code** field, enter the time unit in which this work center's cost calculation and capacity planning are made.
    To be able to constantly monitor consumption, you must first set up a method of measure. The units you enter are basic units. For example, the processing time is measured in hours and minutes.

    > [!NOTE]  
    > If you use Days, remember that one day is 24 hours, and not an eight hour work day.

14. In the **Capacity** field, define whether the work center has more than one machine or person working at the same time. If your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't include the Machine Center functionality, then the value in this field must be **1**.  
15. In the **Efficiency** field, enter the percentage of the expected standard output that this work center actually outputs. If you enter **100**, it means that the work center has an actual output that is the same as the standard output.  
16. Turn on the **Consolidated Calendar** toggle if you're also using machine centers. This setting ensures that calendar entries are rolled up from machine center calendars.  
17. In the **Shop Calendar Code** field, select a shop calendar. For more information, see [Create Shop Calendars](production-how-to-create-work-center-calendars.md).  
18. In the **Queue Time** field, specify a fixed time span that must pass before assigned work can begin at this work center. 

> [!NOTE]
> Use queue times to provide a buffer between the time that a component arrives at a machine or work center and when the operation actually starts. For example, a part is delivered to a machine center at 10:00 but it takes an hour to mount it on the machine so the operation does not start until 11.00. To account for that hour, the queue time would be one hour. The value of the **Queue Time** field on a machine or work center card plus the sum of the values in the **Setup Time**, **Run Time**, **Wait Time**, and **Move Time** fields on the item routing line combine to give the production lead time of the item. This helps provide accurate overall production times.  

## Considerations about capacity

The capacity and efficiency for work and machine centers affect more than just the available capacity. The values also affect the overall production time that consists of the setup time and run time, which are both defined on the routing line.  

When you allocate a routing line to a work or machine center, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates:

- How much capacity is needed.
- How long the operation takes to complete.  

### Run time

To calculate the run time, the system allocates the exact time that is defined in the **Run Time** field of the routing line. Efficiency and capacity don't affect the allocated time. For example, if the run time is defined as 2 hours, then the allocated time is 2 hours, regardless of values in the efficiency and capacity fields in the work center.  

> [!NOTE]
> The capacity that is used in the calculations is defined as the minimal value between the capacity that is defined in the work or machine center and the concurrent capacity that is defined for the routing line. If a work center has a capacity of 100, but the concurrent capacity for the routing line is 2, then *2* will be used in the calculations.

The *duration* of an operation, on the contrary, considers both efficiency and capacity. Duration is calculated as *Run Time / Efficiency / Capacity*. The following list shows a few examples of the calculation of duration for the same run time, which is defined as 2 hours for the routing line:

- Efficiency 80% means you need 2.5 hours instead of two hours  
- Efficiency 200% means you can complete the work in one hour. You can dig the hole twice as fast if you have an excavator that is twice the size of the smaller one  

    You can get the same result if you use two smaller excavators instead of a large one. Use *2* as the capacity and *100%* as the efficiency  

Fractional capacity is tricky. We'll discuss it later in this article. 

### Setup time

Time allocation for the setup time depends on the capacity and is calculated as *Setup Time * Capacity*. For example, if the capacity is set to *2*, your allocated setup time doubles because you must set up two machines for the operation.  

*Duration* of setup time depends on efficiency and is calculated as *Setup Time / Efficiency*. 

- Efficiency 80% means you need 2.5 hours instead of two hours to set up.  
- Efficiency 200% means you can complete setup in 1 hour instead of 2 hours defined in the routing line.  

The fractal capacity is used only in specific cases.

### Work center processing multiple orders simultaneously

Let's use a paint-spraying booth as an example. It has the same setup and run times for each processed lot. But each lot can contain multiple individual orders that are painted simultaneously.  

In this case, the setup time and the concurrent capacity manage the cost allocated to orders. We recommend that you don't use run time in routing lines.  

The allocated setup time for each individual order will be in reverse order of the number of orders (quantities) that are executed simultaneously. Here are some more examples of the calculation of setup time when that is defined as two hours for the routing line:

- If there are two orders, then the concurrent capacity in the routing line should be set to 0.5.

    As a result, the allocated capacity for each is one hour, but the duration for each order remains two hours.
- If there are two orders with a quantity of one and four, respectively, then the concurrent capacity for the routing line of the first order is 0.2, and 0.8 for the second.  

    As a result, the allocated capacity for the first order is 24 min and 96 for the second one. The duration for both orders remains two hours.  

In both cases, the total allocated time for all orders is two hours.


### Efficient resource can dedicate only part of their work date to productive work

> [!NOTE]
> This scenario is not recommended. We recommend that you use efficiency instead. 

One of your work centers represents an experienced worker who works with 100% efficiency on tasks. But they can only spend 50% of their working time on tasks because the rest of the time they solve administrative tasks. While this worker is capable to complete a two hour task in exactly two hours, in average you must wait another two hours while the person is dealing with other assignments.  

The allocated run time is two hours, and the duration is four hours.  

Don't use setup time for such scenarios because [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] only allocates 50% of the time. If the setup time is set to *2*, the allocated setup time is one hour, and the duration is two hours.

### Consolidated calendar

When **Consolidated calendar** field is selected, then the work center has no capacity of its own. Instead, its capacity is equal to the sum of the capacities of all the machine centers that are assigned to the work center.  

> [!NOTE]
> The efficiency of the machine center is converted to the capacity of the work center.

For example, if you have two machine centers with an efficiency of 80 and 70, respectively, the consolidated calendar entry has:

- An efficiency of 100
- A capacity of 1.5
- A total capacity of 12 hours (eight hour shift * 1.5 capacity).

> [!NOTE]
> Use the **Consolidated Calendar** field when you structure your routings to schedule production operations at the machine center level, not the work center level. When you consolidate the calendar, the **Work Center Load** page and reports become an overview of the aggregate load in all machine centers that are assigned to the work center.

### Example - Different machine centers assigned to a work center

It's important to plan which capacities make up the total capacity when you set up machine centers and work centers.

If different machine centers (such as 210 Packing table 1, 310 Painting Cabin...) are assigned to a work center, the consideration of the single capacities of the machine centers is significant because the failure of one machine center can interrupt the entire process. The machine groups can be entered according to their capacity but they aren't included in planning. If you turn off the **Consolidated Calendar** toggle, only the capacity of the work center is assigned in the planning. The machine center capacity is excluded.

If, however, you combine identical machine centers (such as 210 Packing table 1 and 220 Packing table 2) in a work center, you can consider the work center as a sum of the assigned machine centers. Therefore, the work center is listed with zero capacity. If you turn on the **Consolidated Calendar** toggle, the common capacity is assigned to the work center.

If you don't want the capacities of work centers to contribute to the total capacity, specify **0** in the **Efficiency** field.

## To set up a capacity constrained machine or work center

You must set up production resources that you regard as critical and mark them to accept a finite load instead of the default infinite load that other production resources accept. A capacity-constrained resource can be a work center or machine center that's a bottleneck and would like to establish a limited, finite load for.

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't support detailed shop floor control. It plans for a feasible utilization of resources by providing a rough-cut schedule, but doesn't automatically create and maintain detailed schedules based on priorities or optimization rules.

On the **Capacity Constrained Resources** page, you can create a setup to prevent resources from becoming overloaded. The setup can also ensure that capacity isn't left unallocated if it could increase the turn-around time of a production order. In the **Dampener (% of Total Capacity)** field, you can add dampener time to resources to minimize operation splitting. This setting enables the system to schedule load on the last possible day by slightly exceeding the critical load percent. Exceeding the load percent can reduce the number of operations that are split.

When you plan with capacity-constrained resources, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] ensures that resources aren't loaded above their capacity (critical load). It assigns each operation to the nearest available time slot. If the time slot isn't large enough to complete the entire operation, the operation is split into two or more parts in the nearest available time slots.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Capacity Constrained Resources**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action.
3. Fill in the fields as necessary.

> [!NOTE]
> Operations on work centers or machine centers that are set up as constrained resources are always planned serially. This planning means that if a constrained resource has multiple capacities, those capacities must be planned in sequence. You can't plan them in parallel like they would be if the work or machine center wasn't set up as a constrained resource. For a constrained resource, the **Capacity** field on the work center or machine center is greater than **1**.

> In case of operation splitting, the setup time is only assigned one time because it's assumed that some manual adjustment is done to optimize the schedule.

# Trace item-tracked items

You can see where an item-tracked item was used, including how and when it was received or produced, transferred, sold, consumed, or returned. You can also find all current instances of a specific serial or lot number in the database. You do this by using the Item Tracing and the [Find Entries](ui-find-entries.md) features.  

These features can be useful in quality control when you need to find out which customers received products with a particular lot number or when you need to find out which lot a defective component came from.  

 On the **Item Tracing** page, you can trace forwards and backwards in a sequence of posted inventory transactions for the serial or lot number.  

 On the **Find Entries** page, you can't see the sequence of transactions, but you can see all records of the serial or lot number, both posted entries and open records.  

 The two features can be used in combination by transferring a traced serial or lot number to the **Find Entries** page to finish a complete trace scenario. <!-- For more information, see [Walkthrough: Tracing Serial-Lot Numbers](walkthrough-tracing-serial-lot-numbers.md).   -->

## To trace item-tracked items  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Item Tracing**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  In the filter fields at the top of the page, enter the specific item numbers or a filter on the item numbers that you would like to trace.  
3.  In the **Show Components** field, select whether to also see where the components for the items came from. The following table describes the options.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**No**|Don't show components.|  
    |**Item-tracked Only**|Show only components that have lot or serial numbers.|  
    |**All**|Show all components.|  

4.  In the **Trace Method** field, select the method to use for tracing the item. The following table describes the options.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Usage->Origin**|Trace the item from where it was used to where it came from. For instance, if a manufactured item was sold to a customer, the **Item Tracing** page shows this with the sales shipment line first, which you can then expand to see from which production order it came.|  
    |**Origin->Usage**|Trace the item from where it came into inventory to where it was used. For instance, if a manufactured item was sold to a customer, the **Item Tracing** page shows this with the finished production order first, which you can then expand to see the sale shipment lines where the item was used.|  

5.  Choose the **Trace** action to run the trace.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  Only applied transactions are shown. If you have received the same lot on multiple transactions, the **Item Tracing** page may not show all transactions.   

> [!NOTE]  
>  If additional transaction history under an item tracing line has already been traced by another line above it, then the **Already Traced** check box is selected. To provide a simpler view, such underlying lines are not shown.  
>   
>  To find the item tracing lines where the transaction history has already been traced, choose the **Go to Already Traced** button. The item tracing line in question is selected, and all underlying lines are expanded.  

## To find item-tracked items with Find Entries  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Find Entries**, and then select the related link.  
2. Choose **Search for item references**.
3. In the **Serial No.** and **Lot No.** fields, enter the item tracking numbers that you want to trace.  
4. Choose the **Find** action to find all instances of the serial or lot number in the database.

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] integrates with Power BI through a connector using OData. The data source for Power BI reports is exposed as API pages and OData web services.

:::image type="content" source="./media/power-bi-architecture.svg" alt-text="Image alt text." lightbox="./media/power-bi-architecture.svg":::

Starting in February 2022, Power BI reports for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online are sourced from a secondary, read-only database replica. The database replica is part of the [read scale-out](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/database-read-scale-out-overview) capability in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online. This configuration frees up the main database for transactions, which enhances performance of the system. Connecting to the read-only database replica is an integral part of the Business Central online connector, and requires no extra setup on your part. All new reports will connect to the read-only database replica by default. Old reports will still use the main database. For more information, see [Business Central 2021 Release Wave 2 Plan](/dynamics365-release-plan/2021wave2/smb/dynamics365-business-central/use-secondary-read-only-database-power-bi-reporting).

## General Flow

The following diagram illustrates the basic workflow for users when connecting [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to Power BI.

![Power BI workflow  for integration with Business Central.](./media/power-bi-flow-v2.svg)

1. User signs up for a Power BI account.
2. User connects to Power BI from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].
3. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] verifies the license.
4. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] deploys default reports to the Power BI service. This step only happens for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online.
5. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] makes reports in Power BI available for selection in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Default reports are automatically displayed in Power BI parts.
6. User creates a report in Power BI Desktop.
7. User publishes the report to the Power BI service. The reports are then available for selection in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

# Print the picking list

You can print an inventory picking list directly from a sales order and other documents that initiate the shipment of items.

This report is typically used in companies without dedicated functionality for warehouse management, so that an inventory worker can view or print the picking list from the related sales document. In companies with higher volume or more complex processes, shipping and picking are planned and performed in dedicated warehouse documents. Learn more at [Outbound Warehouse Flow](design-details-outbound-warehouse-flow.md).

## To print a picking list from a sales order

The following procedure is based on a sales order. The steps are similar for all other documents that can be used to initiate shipment of items, such as a transfer order.

1. Choose the ![Search for Page or Report.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Sales Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the sales order that you want to pick items for.  
3. Choose the **Report** action, and then choose the **Picking List by Order** action.  
4. Choose the **Print** button to print the picking list or choose the **Preview** button to view it on the screen.

You can also save the picking list as a document, for example, to send to someone or to add as an attachment to the sales order. Learn more at [Manage Attachments, Links, and Notes on Cards and Documents](ui-how-add-link-to-record.md).

> [!NOTE]
> If you used the **Explode BOM** function on the sales order, then only the components of the related assembly item are shown in the report. Learn more at [Work with Bills of Material](inventory-how-work-BOMs.md).

## To print a single set of pick instructions for multiple sales documents

You can use filters to consolidate picking for several sales documents into a single set of pick instructions.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Orders**, and then choose the related link.
1. Choose the **Pick Instruction** action.
1. In the **Document Type** field, choose the type of document you're working with.
1. In the **No.** field, enter a filter to identify the documents. The following are examples of ways to filter.

   * To filter on a consecutive series of document numbers, enter the first and last document numbers separated by **..**. For example, **10000..10010**.
   * To filter on specific documents, enter each document number separated by a **|**. For example, **10000|10005|10010**.

To learn more about filter criteria and operators, go to [Enter filter criteria](ui-enter-criteria-filters.md#enter-filter-criteria).

# Walkthrough: Picking and Shipping in Basic Warehouse Configurations

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you pick and ship items using one of four methods, as described in the following table.

|Method|Outbound Process|Require Pick|Require Shipment|Complexity Level (Learn more at [Warehouse Management Overview](design-details-warehouse-management.md))|  
|------|----------------|-----|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
|A|Post the pick and shipment from the order line|||No dedicated warehouse activity.|  
|B|Post the pick and shipment from an inventory pick document|Turned on||Basic: Order-by-order.|  
|C|Post the pick and shipment from a warehouse shipment document||Turned on|Basic: Consolidated receive/ship posting for multiple orders.|  
|D|Post the pick from a warehouse pick document, and post the shipment from a warehouse shipment document|Turned on|Turned on|Advanced|  

Learn more at [Outbount Warehouse Flow](design-details-outbound-warehouse-flow.md).

The following walkthrough demonstrates method B in the previous table.  

## About This Walkthrough

In basic warehouse configurations where your location is set up to require pick processing but not ship processing, you use the **Inventory Pick** page to record and post pick and ship information for your outbound source documents. The outbound source document can be a sales order, purchase return order, outbound transfer order, or a production order with component need.  

This walkthrough demonstrates the following tasks:  

- Setting up SOUTH location for inventory picks.  
- Creating a sales order for customer 10000 for 30 Amsterdam Lamps.  
- Releasing the sales order for warehouse handling.  
- Creating an inventory pick based on a released source document.  
- Registering the warehouse movement from the warehouse and at the same time posting the sales shipment for the source sales order.  

## Roles

This walkthrough demonstrates tasks that are performed by the following user roles:  

- Warehouse Manager  
- Order Processor  
- Warehouse Worker  

<!-- ## Prerequisites

To complete this walkthrough, you will need:  

- For [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, a company based on the **Advanced Evaluation - Complete Sample Data** option in a sandbox environment. For [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, CRONUS installed.
 -->

## Story

Ellen, the warehouse manager at CRONUS, sets up SOUTH warehouse for basic pick handling where warehouse workers process outbound orders individually. Susan, the order processor, creates a sales order for 30 units of item 1928-S to be shipped to customer 10000 from the SOUTH Warehouse. John, the warehouse worker must make sure that the shipment is prepared and delivered to the customer. John manages all involved tasks on the **Inventory Pick** page, which automatically points to the bins where 1928-S is stored.

[!INCLUDE[set_up_location.md](includes/set_up_location.md)]

### Setting Up the Bin Codes

Once you have the location set up, you must add two bins.

#### To setup the bin codes

1. Select the **Bins** action.
2. Create two bins, with the codes *S-01-0001* and *S-01-0002*.

### Making Yourself a Warehouse Employee at Location SOUTH

In order to use this functionality, you must add yourself to the location as a warehouse worker. 

#### To make yourself a warehouse employee

  1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature first.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Warehouse Employees**, and then choose the related link.  
  2. Choose the **User ID** field, and select your own user account on the **Warehouse Employees** page.
  3. In the **Location Code** field, choose SOUTH.  
  4. Select the **Default** field, and then select the **Yes** button.  

### Making Item 1928-S Available

To make item 1928-S available at the SOUTH location follow these steps:  

  1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature second.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Item Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
  2. Open the default journal, and then create two item journal lines with the following information about the work date (January 23).  

        |Entry Type|Item Number|Location Code|Bin Code|Quantity|  
        |----------------|-----------------|-------------------|--------------|--------------|  
        |Positive Adjmt.|1928-S|SOUTH|S-01-0001|20|  
        |Positive Adjmt.|1928-S|SOUTH|S-01-0002|20|  

        By default, the **Bin Code** field on the sales lines are hidden, so you must display it. To do this you need to personalize the page. For more information, see [To start personalizing a page through the Personalizing banner](ui-personalization-user.md#start-personalizing-by-using-the-personalization-mode).

  3. Choose **Actions**, then **Posting**, and then choose **Post**.  
  4. Select the **Yes** button.  

## Creating the Sales Order

Sales orders are the most common type of outbound source document.  

### To create the sales order

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature third.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. Create a sales order for customer 10000 on the work date (January 23) with the following sales order line.  

    |Item|Location Code|Quantity|  
    |----|-------------|--------|  
    |1928-S|SOUTH|30|  

     Proceed to notify the warehouse that the sales order is ready for warehouse handling.  

4. Choose the **Release** action.  

    John proceeds to pick and ship the sold items.  

## Picking and Shipping Items

On the **Inventory Pick** page, you can manage all outbound warehouse activities for a specific source document, such as a sales order. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  

### To pick and ship items

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature fourth.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Inventory Picks**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  

    Make sure that the **No.** field on the **General** FastTab is filled in.
3. Select the **Source Document** field, and then select **Sales Order**.  
4. Select the **Source No.** field, select the line for the sale to customer 10000, and then choose the **OK** button.  

    Alternatively, choose the **Get Source Document** action, and then select the sales order.  
5. Choose the **Autofill Qty. to Handle** action.  

    Alternatively, in the **Qty. to Handle** field, enter 10 and 20 respectively on the two inventory pick lines.  
6. Choose the **Post** action, select **Ship**, and then choose the **OK** button.  

    The 30 Amsterdam Lamps are now registered as picked from bins S-01-0001 and S-01-0002, and a negative item ledger entry is created reflecting the posted sales shipment.

# Receive items with warehouse receipts

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you receive items and put them away using one of four methods, as described in the following table.

|Method|Inbound Process|Require Receipts|Require Put-aways|Complexity Level (Learn more at [Warehouse Management Overview](design-details-warehouse-management.md))|  
|------------|---------------------|--------------|----------------|------------|  
|A|Post receipt and put-away from the order line|||No dedicated warehouse activity.|  
|B|Post receipt and put-away from an inventory put-away document||Turned on|Basic: Order-by-order.|  
|C|Post receipt and put-away from a warehouse receipt document|Turned on||Basic: Consolidated receive/ship posting for multiple orders.|  
|D|Post receipt from a warehouse receipt document and post put-away from a warehouse put-away document|Turned on|Turned on|Advanced|  

To learn more about how to handle inbound items, go to [Inbound Warehouse Flow](design-details-inbound-warehouse-flow.md).

The following article refers to methods C and D in the previous table.

## Receive items with a warehouse receipt

When items arrive at a warehouse that processes warehouse receipts, get the lines of the document that triggered the receipt. If you use bins, you can either accept the default bin or specify the bin to put the items in. The latter might be required when you receive an item for the first time. Then, enter the quantities of the items you received and post the receipt.  

You can create warehouse receipt in one of two ways:

* In a push fashion, when work is done on an order-by-order basis. Choose the **Create Warehouse Receipt** action in the source document, such as a purchase order, sales return order, or transfer order to create a warehouse receipt for a source document.
* In a pull fashion, where you use the **Release** action in the source document, such as a purchase order, sales return order, or transfer order to release the document to the warehouse. A warehouse employee can create a **Warehouse Receipt** for one or more released source documents.

The following procedure describes how to create a warehouse receipt in a pull fashion.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Warehouse Receipts**, then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  

    Fill in the **Location Code** field on the **General** FastTab. When you retrieve source document lines, some of the information is copied to each line.

    For a location that requires bins, fill in the **Bin Code** field. Depending on your setup, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can add the bin code for you. Learn more at [Zone and bin codes](warehouse-how-receive-items.md#zone-and-bin-codes).  

3. You can get source document in two ways:

    1. Choose the **Get Source Documents** action. The **Source Documents - Inbound** page opens. Here you can select one or more source documents released to warehouse that requires receipt.
    2. Choose the **Use Filters to Get Src. Docs.** action. The **Filters to Get Source Docs. - Inbound** page opens. Here you can select Source Document Filter and run it. All released source document lines that meet the filter criteria are added on the **Warehouse Receipt** page. Learn more at [How to Use Filters to Get Source Documents](warehouse-how-receive-items.md#how-to-use-filters-to-get-source-documents).

4. Set the quantity to receive.

    The **Qty. to Receive** field contains the quantity outstanding for each line, but you can change the quantity as needed. 

    To set the value in the **Qty. to Receive** field on all lines to zero, choose the **Delete Qty. to Receive** action. For example, setting the quantities to zero is useful if you're using a barcode scanner to update the received quantities. To add the outstanding quantities from the source document again, choose the **Autofill Qty. to Receive** action.  

    On a warehouse receipt document where the received quantity is higher than ordered, enter the quantity received in the **Qty. to Receive** field. If the increase is within the tolerance specified by an assigned over-receipt code, the **Over-Receipt Quantity** field updates to show the quantity by which the value in the **Quantity** field is exceeded. If the increase is over the tolerance, the over-receipt isn't allowed.

5. Post the warehouse receipt. The quantity fields are updated on the source documents, and the items are added to inventory.  

    [!INCLUDE [preview-posting-shipment](includes/preview-posting-shipment.md)]

    > [!TIP]
    > If you use warehouse put-aways (method D in the table in the beginning of this article), the items are received. However, you can't pick them until they're put away. To learn more about putting away items, go to [Put Items Away with Warehouse Put-aways](warehouse-how-to-put-items-away-with-warehouse-put-aways.md).
    >
    > Otherwise, consider using the **Post and Print** action. The action posts the receipt and prints it as a put-away instruction that shows where to put the item.

    > [!NOTE]  
    > If your warehouse uses cross-docking, you can check whether you can cross-dock items without putting them away. To learn more about cross-docking, go to [Cross-Dock Items](warehouse-how-to-cross-dock-items.md).

## How to use filters to get source documents

From a warehouse receipt, you can use the **Filters to Get Source Docs.** page to retrieve the released source document lines that specify the items to receive.

1. In the warehouse receipt, choose the **Use Filters to Get Src. Docs.** action.
2. To set up a new filter, enter a descriptive code in the **Code** field, then choose the **Modify** action.

    The **Source Document Filter Card - Inbound** page appears.

3. Use the filters to define the type of source document lines to retrieve. For example, you can select types of source documents, such as purchase or transfer orders.
4. Choose **Run**.  

All released source document lines that meet the filter criteria are added on the **Warehouse Receipt** page on which you activated the filters.

You can make an unlimited number of filter combinations. Filters are saved on the **Filters to Get Source Docs.** page, and they're available the next time you need them. You can change the criteria at any time by choosing the **Modify** action.

## Zone and bin codes

To receive items with warehouse class codes other than the class code of the bin in the **Bin Code** field on the document header, clear the **Bin Code** field on the header before you retrieve source document lines for the items.  
<!-- TBD, table with comparison of various options-->

If bins are mandatory for a location, zone and bin codes are added to warehouse receipt documents as follows:

* For advanced configurations that use directed put-away and pick, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses the receipt bin code from the **Location Card** page for the location. If a receipt bin code isn't specified, no bin is specified. If the item and receipt bins don't match, the receipt bin code is blank.
* In other configurations, if a receipt bin code isn't specified, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses the bin code from the source document.

# Troubleshooting Self-Service Sign-Up
Signing up for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is easy and can be done very quickly. You can create a free account even if you are an existing organization. This article addresses issues that you may have during signup.

## What email address can I use with Business Central?
[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] requires that you use a work, or school, email address to sign up. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] does not support email addresses provided by consumer email services or telecommunication providers. This includes outlook.com, hotmail.com, gmail.com, and others.

If you try to sign up with a personal email address, you will get a message indicating to use a work or school email address.

## Troubleshooting
In many cases, registering for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can be achieved by following the sign-up process. However, there are several reasons why you may not be able to complete self-service signup. The table below summarizes some of the most common reasons you may not be able to complete signup and ways you can workaround these issues.

| Symptom/Error Message | Cause and Workaround |
| --------------------- | -------------------- |
| For Microsoft 365 email addresses that are not registered in a supported country, you receive a message like the following during signup:<br /><br />**That didn't work, we don't support your country or region yet.** |[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] currently only supports Microsoft 365 email accounts that are registered in a limited number of markets. For more information, see [Regional Availability](#regional-availability). |
| Personal email addresses such as nancy@gmail.com are not supported. You receive a message like the following during signup:<br /><br />**You entered a personal email address: Please enter your work email address so we can securely store your company's data.**<br> or <br> **That looks like a personal email address. Enter your work address so we can connect you with others in your company. And don’t worry. We won’t share your address with anyone.** |[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] does not support email addresses provided by consumer email services or telecommunications providers. To complete signup, try again using an email address assigned by your work or school. If you still cannot sign up and are willing to complete a more advanced setup process, you can register for a new Microsoft 365 trial subscription and use that email address to sign up. |
| .gov or .mil email addresses You receive a message like the following during signup:<br /><br />**[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] unavailable: [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is not available for users with .gov or .mil email addresses at this time. Use another work email address or check back later.** <br>or <br>**We can't finish signing you up. It looks like [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] isn't currently available for your work or school.** |[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] does not support .gov or .mil addresses at this time. |
| Self-service signup is not enabled. You receive a message like the following during signup:<br /><br />**We can't finish signing you up. Your IT department has turned off signup for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Contact them to complete signup.** <br>or <br> **That looks like a personal email address. Enter your work address so we can connect you with others in your company. And don’t worry. We won’t share your address with anyone.** |Your organization’s IT administrator has disabled self-service signup for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. To complete signup, contact your IT administrator and ask them to follow the instructions on [this page](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-business-central-manage-selfservice-signups) to allow existing users to sign up for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and to allow new users to join your existing tenant. You may also experience this problem if you signed up for Microsoft 365 through a partner. |
| Email address is not a Microsoft 365 ID. You receive a message like the following during signup:<br /><br />**We can't find you at contoso.com. Do you use a different ID at work or school? Try signing in with that, and if it doesn't work, contact your IT department.** |Your organization uses IDs to sign in to Microsoft 365 and other Microsoft services that are different than your email address. For example, your email address might be Nancy.Smith@contoso.com but your ID is nancys@contoso.com. To complete signup, use the ID that your organization has assigned to for signing in to Microsoft 365 or other Microsoft services. If you do not know what this is, contact your IT administrator. If you still cannot sign up and are able to complete a more advanced setup process, you can register for a new Microsoft 365 trial subscription and use that email address to sign up. |
| If your Microsoft 365 account is registered to a supported country, and you are signing up for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] while in a different country, you receive a message like the following during signup:<br /><br />**That didn't work, we don't support your country or region yet.**| Your organization's Microsoft 365 subscription is registered to a specific country in the Microsoft 365 administration portal.

# Handling inventory and manufacturing costs

Although much of the cost accounting functionality is expressed in underlying processes with no user interaction, such as entry application and automatic cost adjustment, many fields, pages, and reports are aimed at users who directly or indirectly manage the cost of items or operations.  

 Assigning item charges to purchase documents is an example of an indirect cost accounting task. Updating the unit cost of assembly or production BOM item is an example of a more direct cost accounting task.  

 The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the articles that describe them.   

|**To**|**See**|

# About the Data Exchange Framework

You can use the Data Exchange Framework to manage the exchange of business documents, bank files, currency exchange rates, and any other data files with your business partners or authorities.

As an administrator or Microsoft partner, you can use the framework in new integration features by setting up which data to exchange and how. For example, the format of files for exchange of data in bank files, electronic documents, currency exchange rates, and other with ERP systems vary depending on the provider of the data file or stream and on the country/region. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports various bank file formats and data service standards. To provide support for other electronic document formats, you use the data exchange framework.

 The following diagrams show the architecture of the data exchange framework.  

 ![Data Exchange Framework &#45; Import.](media/across-data-exchange/dataexchangeframework_import.png)  

 ![Data Exchange Framework &#45; Export.](media/across-data-exchange/dataexchangeframework_export.png)  

## Electronic documents

As an alternative to emailing business documents as file attachments, you can send and receive them electronically. An "electronic document" is a standard-compliant file representing a business document, such as an invoice from a vendor that you can receive and convert to a purchase invoice in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Trading partners exchange electronic documents through external document exchange services. By default, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports sending and receiving electronic invoices and credit memos in the PEPPOL format, which is supported by the largest providers of document exchange services. Currently, Avalara and Pagero exchange services are pre-configured and ready to be set up for your company (Microsoft will support more exchange services in near future). To provide support for other electronic document formats, you must check if they're already delivered in your localization to create new data exchange definitions.  

From PDF or image files representing incoming documents, you can have an external OCR service (Optical Character Recognition) create electronic documents that you can then convert to document records in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], like for electronic PEPPOL documents. For example, when you receive an invoice in PDF format from your vendor, you can send it to the OCR service from the **Incoming Documents** page. After a few seconds, you receive the file back as an electronic invoice that can be converted to a purchase invoice for the vendor. If you send the file to the OCR service by email, then a new incoming document record is automatically created when you receive the electronic document back.  

To send, for example, a sales invoice as an electronic PEPPOL document, read this [instruction](finance-how-use-edocuments.md). The data conversion and sending of the PEPPOL sales invoice are performed by dedicated codeunits and XMLports.  

To receive, for example, an invoice from a vendor as an electronic PEPPOL document, read the following [instruction](finance-how-use-edocuments-purchase.md). You can either set up the Job Queue feature to process such files regularly or you can start the process manually. For both sales and purchase processes, first, [you must set up](finance-how-setup-edocuments.md) various master data, such as services, company information, vendors, items, and units of measure. These are used to identify the business partners and items when you convert data in elements in the incoming document file to fields in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The receiving and data conversion of PEPPOL invoices are performed by the Data Exchange Framework.  

To receive, for example, an invoice as an electronic OCR document, you process it the same way as you would when receiving an electronic PEPPOL document. The receiving and conversion of electronic documents from OCR are performed by the Data Exchange Framework, represented by the **OCR – Invoice** data exchange definition.  

## Bank files

The formats of files for exchanging bank data with business management applications vary depending on the supplier of the file and the country or region. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports import and export of Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) bank files. Additionally, the AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals extension lets you connect to a AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals extension provided by an external provider, AMC Consult. For more information, see [Make Payments with the AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals extension or SEPA Credit Transfer](finance-make-payments-with-bank-data-conversion-service-or-sepa-credit-transfer.md). To provide support for other electronic document formats, you use the Data Exchange Framework.  

To export SEPA credit transfers, you choose **Export Payments to File** button on the **Payment Journal** page and then upload the file to process the payments in your bank. First you must set up various master data, such as bank account, vendors, and payment methods. The data conversion and export of SEPA bank data is performed by a dedicated codeunit and XMLport, represented by the **SEPA Credit Transfer** bank export/import setup. Alternatively, you can set up the AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals extension to perform the export, represented by the **AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals extension - Credit Transfer** data exchange definition.  

 To export SEPA direct debit instructions, you choose the **Export Direct Debit File** button on the **Direct Debit Collections** page and then send to your bank to automatically collect the involved customer payments. First you must set up bank accounts, customers, direct-debit mandates, and payment methods. The data conversion and export of SEPA bank data is performed by dedicated a codeunit and XMLport, represented by the **SEPA Direct Debit** bank export/import setup.  

 To import SEPA bank statements, you choose the Import Bank Statement button in the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** and **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** pages and then you proceed to apply each bank statement entry to payments or bank ledger entries, manually or automatically. First you must set up bank accounts. The import and data conversion of SEPA bank data is performed by the Data Exchange Framework, represented by the **SEPA CAMT** data exchange definition. Alternatively, you can set up the AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals extension to perform the import, represented by the **AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals extension – Bank Statement** data exchange definition.  

 In addition, the local versions of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] support various other file formats for importing and exporting bank data, payroll transactions, and other data. For more information, see the [Local Functionality](about-localization.md) landing page for your country/region in the Help.  

## Currency exchange rates

You can set up an external service to keep your for currency exchange rates up to date. The service that provides updated currency exchange rates is enabled by a data exchange definition. Accordingly, the **Exch. Rate Update Setup Card** page is a condensed view of the **Data Exchange Definition** page for the data exchange definition in question.  

For all exchanges of data in XML files, you can prepare the data exchange setup by loading the related XML schema file on the **XML Schema Viewer** page. Here you select the data elements that you want to exchange with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]  and then you either initialize a data exchange definition or generate an XMLport.

## Intrastat

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses the Data Exchange Framework for Intrastat reporting where you can easily create timestamped files in different formats for export. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] contains prepared formats for localized countries/regions and for default version. But you can change the out-of-box report or make your own.

# Create production BOMs

A production bill of material (BOM) holds master data that describes the components and subassemblies used in the production of an item. When you create a production order for an item, its production BOM governs the calculation of material requirements as represented on the **Prod. Order Components** page.

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] also supports assembly BOMs. Use assembly orders to make end items from components in a process that one or more basic resources, which aren't machine or work centers, can do. Or, a process that can complete without any resources. For example, an assembly process could be to pick two wine bottles and one coffee sack and then pack them as a gift item. To learn more, go to [Assembly BOMs or Production BOMs](inventory-how-work-boms.md#assembly-boms-or-production-boms).  

> [!TIP]
> The **Contoso Coffee Demo Data** app includes demonstration products for a variety of production BOM scenarios that can be used on a test environment, including during a trial. Learn how to set up the Contoso Coffee Data and find walkthroughs for different scenarios at [Introduction to Contoso Coffee Demo Data](contoso-coffee/contoso-coffee-intro.md).

Before you can set up a routing, the following setups must be in place:  

- Item cards are created for parent items that take part in manufacturing. To learn more, go to [Register New Items](inventory-how-register-new-items.md).
- Production resources are set up. To learn more, go to [Set Up Work Centers and Machine Centers](production-how-to-set-up-work-and-machine-centers.md).

## To create a production BOM

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Production BOMs**, then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
4. To edit the BOM, set the **Status** field to **New** or **Under Development**. To activate it, set the **Status** field to **Certified**.  

    Proceed to fill in the production BOM lines.
5. In the **Type** field, select whether the item on this BOM line is an ordinary item or a production BOM. If the item on the line is a production BOM, then it must already exist as a certified production BOM.  
6. In the **No.** field, look up and select the item or production BOM in question, or type it in the field.  

   > [!TIP]
   > If you need to add several items, you can use the **Select items** action to select and add them. You can also use the **Edit in Excel** action. You can make changes to records in Excel, and then update the data in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. To learn more about the Edit in Excel action, go to [Edit in Excel](across-work-with-excel.md#edit-in-excel).

7. In the **Quantity per** field, enter how many units of the item go into the parent item, for example, 4 wheels for 1 car.  
8. In the **Scrap %** field, you can enter a fixed percentage of components that are scrapped during production. When the components are ready to be consumed in a released production order, this percentage is added to the expected quantity in the **Consumption Quantity** field in a production journal. To learn more, go to [Register Consumption and Output](production-how-to-register-consumption-and-output.md).  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > This scrap percentage represents components that are scrapped during production when picking from inventory. The scrap percentage on routing lines represents scrapped output before it's put in inventory.  

9. In the **Routing Link Code** field, enter a code to connect the component to a specific operation. To learn more, go to [To create routing links](production-how-to-create-routings.md#to-create-routing-links).
10. To copy lines from an existing production BOM, choose the **Copy BOM** action to select existing lines.  
11. Certify the production BOM.  
12. You can now attach the new production BOM to the card of the parent item in question. To learn more, go to [Register New Items](inventory-how-register-new-items.md).  

> [!NOTE]  
> [!INCLUDE [bom-standard-cost](includes/bom-standard-cost.md)] To recalculate the item's standard cost from the item card, choose the **Production** action, then choose the **Calc. Production Std. Cost** action. You can also calculate and update the standard cost for one or many items on the **Standard Cost Worksheet** page. To learn more, go to [Update Standard Costs](finance-about-calculating-standard-cost.md#updating-standard-costs-with-standard-cost-worksheet).  

## To create a new version of a production BOM

For example, use new versions of production BOMs when an item is replaced, or when a customer requires a special version of a product. The version principle enables various versions of a production BOM to be managed. The structure of the production BOM version corresponds to the structure of the production BOM. The basic difference is in the time validity of the versions. The starting date defines the validity.  

The starting date indicates the start of the period in which this version is valid. For all other considerations, the starting date is a filter criterion for calculations and evaluations. The BOM version is valid until the next version becomes valid for its starting date. You can quickly go to the certified BOM or BOM version that's valid on the work date by choosing the **Prod. Active BOM Version** action.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Production BOMs**, then choose the related link.  
2. Select the production BOM to be copied, then choose the **Versions** action.  
3. Choose the **New** action.  
4. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
5. In the **Version Code** field, enter the unique identification of the version. Any combination of numbers and letters is permitted.  

    The newly created version is automatically assigned the status **New**.
6. When the BOM version is completed, setting the **Status** field to **Certified**.  

The time validity of the version is specified by the **Starting Date** field.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Select the **Item** option in the **Type** field to use an item from your item master data in the production BOM. If the item also has a production BOM, whereby the **Production BOM No.** field is filled in on the item card, this production BOM is also considered.  
>
> Select the **Production BOM** option if you want to use a phantom production BOM on the line.  
>
> Phantom production BOMs serve for structuring products. This production BOM type never leads to a finished product but is used exclusively for determining the dependent demand. Phantom production BOMs don't have their own item master data.

## Compare production BOM versions

Use the **Production BOM Version Comparison** page to access a list of all production BOM versions and items and the quantity used per item. You can use the matrix to compare different production BOM versions for the used items per version, including the original BOM as the first column. This page gives you an overview of all BOM versions and their respective quantities.

## Quantity calculation formula on production BOMs

The quantity is calculated taking into consideration different dimensions that are also entered on the production BOM lines. The dimensions refer to an order unit of the respective item. The length, width, depth, and weight can be entered as dimensions.  

The Calculation Formula, Length, Width, Depth, and Weight columns aren't displayed, because they're only used by some users. If you wish to use the calculation of the quantity, you must first display these columns.  

The calculation formula defines the relation of the individual components. The following options are available as a calculation formula:  

- **Empty** - No consideration of dimensions. (Quantity = Quantity per.)  
- **Length** - Quantity = Quantity per * Length  
- **Length x Width** - Quantity = Quantity per * Length x Width  
- **Length x Width x Depth** - Quantity = Quantity per x Length x Width x Depth  
- **Weight** - Quantity = Quantity per x Weight  
- **Fixed Quantity** - Quantity = Quantity per

> [!NOTE]
> The **Fixed Quantity** calculation formula ensures that the consumption of a component is the same, regardless of the scrap or output quantities. For production order components, when the **Calculation Formula** field is set to **Fixed Quantity**, the **Expected Quantity** field value is always equal to the **Quantity per** field. The scrap percentage that is defined on the same line is ignored. Fixed quantity is respected by the **Availability by BOM** report. The report will show the item as the bottleneck if the available quantity is less than the quantity in the **Quantity Per Parent** field. The **Able to Make Parent** and **Able to Make Top Item** fields are always blank, regardless of the available quantity. Fixed quantity is also included in calculations for standard costs. The lot size for the produced item impacts the cost that is allocated for one item.

### Example

A production BOM requires 70 metal parts with the dimensions length = 0.20 m and width = 0.15 m. Enter the values as follows: Calculation Formula = Length x Width, Length = 20, Width = 15, Quantity per = 70.

Quantity per x Length * Width, that is, Quantity = 70 x 0.20 m x 0.15 m = 2.1 m2, gives the quantity.

Use column definitions to specify the columns to include in a report. For example, you can design a report layout to compare net change and balance for the same period this year and last year. You can have up to 15 columns in a column definition. For example, multiple columns are useful for displaying budgets for 12 months with a column that shows the total.

## Create a new column definition

To create a new column definition, follow these steps:

1. On the **(Financial Report) Column Definitions** page, choose the **New** action.
1. Provide a unique name for the definition.
1. In the **Description** field, provide a descriptive name for the definition. This description provides context when you use the definition, but doesn't show on the report.
1. Provide an internal description for the definition.

## Edit the content of a column definition

To edit the content of a column definition, follow these steps.

> [!NOTE]
> Printed, previewed, and saved versions of a financial report display a maximum of five columns. In contrast, if a financial report is only meant for analysis on the **Financial Report** page, you can create as many columns as you want.

1. On the **(Financial Report) Column Definitions** page, select the definition, and then choose the **Edit Column Definition** action.
1. On the **Column Definition** page, create a row for each column of financial data that should show in the financial report. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
1. Choose **OK**.

> [!TIP]
> Open the **Financial Report** page from time to time to verify that the new column definition works as intended.

## Built-in column definitions

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides sample column definitions that can help you to quickly get started setting up finance reports that suit your needs.

<!-- update this when we release the new templates in 24.1
| Column definition code | Description | How to use this column definition | 
| ------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------ | 
| TBA 1 | TBA 1 | TBA 1 |
| TBA 2 | TBA 2 | TBA 2 |
| TBA 3 | TBA 3 | TBA 3 |
| TBA 4 | TBA 4 | TBA 4 |
-->

## Example: Create a column definition to calculate percentages

You might want to include a column in a financial report to calculate percentages of a total. For example, if you have rows that break down sales by dimension, you might want a column to indicate the percentage of total sales in each row.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 2.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Financial Reports**, then choose the related link.
1. On the **Financial Reports** page, select a financial report.  
1. Choose the **Edit Financial Report** action to set up a financial report row to calculate the total on which the percentages are based.  
1. Add a line immediately above the first row for which you want to display a percentage.  
1. Fill in the fields on the line as follows: 
    1. In the **Totaling Type** field, enter **Set Base for Percent**. 
    1. In the **Totaling** field, enter a formula for the total that the percentage is based on. For example, if row 11 contains the total sales, enter **11**.  
1. Choose the **Edit Column Definition** action to set up a column.  
1. Fill in the fields on the line as follows. 
    1. In the **Column Type** field, select **Formula**. 
    1. In the **Formula** field, enter a formula for the amount you want to calculate a percentage for, followed by the percentage sign (%). So, if column number N contains the net change, enter **N%**.  
1. Repeat steps 4 through 7 for each group of rows you want to break down by percentage.

## Comparing accounting periods using period formulas

Your financial report can compare the results of different accounting periods, such as the past month versus the same month last year. To do that, open the **Column Definition** page, and personalize it by adding the **Comparison Period Formula** field as a column. Learn more at [Personalize Your Workspace](ui-personalization-user.md). You can then set that field to a period formula.  

An accounting period doesn't need to match the calendar. However, each fiscal year must have the same number of accounting periods, although each period can be different in length.  

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses the period formula to calculate the duration of the comparison period in relation to the period represented by the date filter on the report. The comparison period is based on the period of the start date of the date filter. The following table shows the abbreviations for period specifications.

| Abbreviation | Description                                                                           |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| P            | Period.                                                                                |
| LP           | Last period of a fiscal year, half-year, or quarter.                                   |
| CP           | Current period of a fiscal year, half-year, or quarter. Use CP in formulas to set the period that starts or ends the formula. For example, FY\[1..CP\] denotes the time from the beginning of the current fiscal year to the current period.|
| FY           | Fiscal year. For example, FY\[1..3\] denotes the first quarter of the current fiscal year. |

Examples of formulas:

| Formula | Description |
|-----|-----|
| \<Blank\>       | Current period. |
| \-1P            | Previous period.            |
| \-1FY\[1..LP\]  | Entire previous fiscal year.                  |
| \-1FY           | Current period in previous fiscal year.       |
| \-1FY\[1..3\]   | First quarter of previous fiscal year.        |
| \-1FY\[1..CP\]  | From the beginning of the previous fiscal year to the current period in the previous fiscal year, including both periods. |
| \-1FY\[CP..LP\] | From the current period in previous fiscal year to the last period of the previous fiscal year, including both periods.   |

To calculate by regular time periods, enter a formula in the **Comparison Date Formula** field instead. For example, if the field is set to -1Y, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] compares to the same period one year earlier.

> [!NOTE]
> It isn't always obvious which periods you're comparing because you can set a date filter on a report that spans dates that are different than the accounting periods in your chart of accounts. So, if you create a financial report where you want to compare this period to the same period last year, set the **Comparison Date Formula** field to **-1FY**. Then, run the report on **February 28th** and set the date filter to **January and February**. As a result, the financial report compares January and February this year to January last year, which is the only completed accounting period of the two for last year.  

Learn more at [Work with Calendar Dates and Times](ui-enter-date-ranges.md).

## Find the reports that use a column definition

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/introduced_in_2025rw1.md)]

Before you change a column definition, it can be helpful to know which reports use it so that you understand the effect of your change. To find out which reports use a column definition, follow these steps:

1. On the **(Financial Report) Column Definitions** page, select the definition, and then choose the **Edit Column Definition** action.
1. To open a list of reports that use the definition, choose the **Where-Used** action.

## Best practices for working with column definitions

<!-- [!INCLUDE [report-best-practices-column-defs](includes/report-best-practices-column-defs2.md)] -->

## Import or export financial report column definitions

Starting with the 2024 release wave 1 (version 24.1), you can import and export financial report column definitions as RapidStart configuration packages. For example, configuration packages are useful for sharing information with other companies. The package is created in a .rapidstart file, which compresses the contents.

> [!NOTE]
> When you import financial report column definitions, they replace existing records with the same names. The configuration package for a report definition won't overwrite any existing row or column definitions that are used in the report definition.

To import or export financial report column definitions, follow these steps:

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 4.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Column Definitions**, and then choose the related link.
1. Choose the row definition, and then choose the **Import Column Definition** or **Export Column Definition** action, depending on what you want to do.

# FAQ for Sales Order Agent (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]

These frequently asked questions (FAQ) describe the AI impact of the Sales Order Agent feature in Business Central.

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/production-ready-preview-dynamics365.md)]
<!--[!INCLUDE [limited-public-preview](includes/limited-public-preview.md)]-->

## What is Sales Order Agent?

Sales Order Agent is an integrated AI agent that automates the task of handling requests for sales quotes and sales orders from customers. The agent can manage the entire sales order capturing process, from receiving a customer's order by email, locating the customer among the registered customers in Business Central, checking item availability, preparing a quote with the requested items, following up with the customer on any changes needed to finalize the quote, receiving quote approval, and converting it to a sales order.

Learn more in [Process sales quotes and orders with Sales Order Agent](sales-order-agent-process.md).

## What are the capabilities of Sales Order Agent?

The agent supports handling requests for sales quotes and sales orders from customers with the following capabilities:

- Agent configuration

  The agent is available directly within Business Central. You can configure and activate the agent to help your team or organization improve the sales process. For example, you can specify the users who can participate in the process of reviewing and approving the sales documents created by the agent. You can also specify the mailbox for receiving the customer requests and settings for searching your items and involving the users to review the agent's work.

  Learn more in [Set up Sales Order Agent](sales-order-agent-setup.md).

- Task execution and interaction

  The agent operates based on its instructions and user configuration. The instructions describe its purpose, tasks, and high-level considerations for how to perform the flow. These instructions are defined in the agent code and aren't visible to users. The agent uses AI to identify and carry out the steps needed to complete its task within the Business Central environment. Learn more in [Sales Order Agent overview](sales-order-agent.md).

  The agent is invoked by a built-in email dispatcher that runs as a scheduled task and monitors the company mailbox specified in the agent's configuration. The dispatcher hands over emails received from the customers to Sales Order Agent and sends results of the agent's work, such as prepared sales quote with requested items, in response.
  
- Access and permissions

  The agent runs as its own user in Business Central and is granted access only to the necessary parts of the product. It comes with a predefined permission set and UI role (profile) that limits the parts of the product and UI elements (such as pages, fields, and actions) it can access.

- Transparency and change control

  The agent seeks user intervention in specific situations, such as preparing outbound communications or providing business review and approval for key operations.

  Business Central maintains full transparency and provides control over changes made by the agent. The agent brings humans in the loop when their attention is required by issuing in-product notifications that are displayed on the role center. For example, a notification occurs before any outbound email communications to a customer, when the agent needs more details to get unblocked, or when approval is needed for important changes.  

  For each task performed by the agent, users get a detailed timeline that shows the key steps taken by the agent and human users, including the email conversation. Users can review this information and update the values and actions the agent suggested if needed. Business Central can also display the reasoning used by the agent and citations that led to a suggested value.

## What is the intended use of Sales Order Agent?

Sales Order Agent is intended to handle the end-to-end sales order capturing process. This process includes:

- Taking the customer’s order by email.
- Iterating on the details with the customer via email.
- Checking the availability of the items.
- Preparing the sales quote with the requested items.
- Sending the quote to the customer for approval.
- Converting the quote to a sales order upon receiving customer confirmation.

## How was Sales Order Agent evaluated? What metrics are used to measure performance?

We defined a set of categories and scenarios and created test cases for each as described in the following table. In total, we have a suite of 50 test cases.

|Category|Scenario|
|-|-|
|Quotes<br><br>Precise request for a quote with variations (delivery dates or not, terse/verbose request, complete or incomplete email signature) |<ul><li>Single/multi-turn with approval by customer. Up to three items.</li><li>Quote request for four or more items.</li><li>Request for quote by item reference. Up to three lines.</li><li>Quote sent but not approved by customer.</li><li>Quote request from unknown customer.</li><li>Quote request for unknown item.</li></ul>|
|Information<br><br>Requests for information about items followed by a quote request|<ul><li>Single and multi-turn with quote based on information.</li><li>Request for information about unknown items.</li></ul>|

## What are the limitations of Sales Order Agent? How can users minimize the impact of the Sales Order Agent limitations when using the system?

- Languages

  - [!INCLUDE[soa-language-support](includes/soa-language-support.md)]
  - Mixed language input might result in lower-quality output because the system relies on pure string similarity, and the semantic part of the matching might not work properly.

- Emailing

  - The agent reads inbound emails via a shared inbox on Microsoft Exchange. Learn more in [Set up email](admin-how-setup-email.md). Other ways to receive email aren't supported.
  - The agent only uses the email body to get the details of the request; it doesn't process files attached to emails.  
  - Large emails might exceed the number of tokens that can be processed in one request. This condition leads the agent to trigger a request for a human to investigate (similar to how a human is requested to approve whether the agent approves an email). 
  - Email messages generated by the agent might contain incorrect information. The agent is designed to ask a human to review and edit every outbound message if necessary.  

- Entities and data the agent can work with

  - The agent is designed to work with sales quotes and sales orders. It can't create or work with other sales documents (such as blank orders, invoices, or credit memos) or documents in other areas of the product (such as purchase or service orders).
  - The agent doesn't create new items, contacts, or customers. It only works with the entities that are already registered in Business Central. The agent is designed to ask a human user to provide additional information or perform the task manually, when it can't find this data in Business Central.
  - The agent doesn't post documents.
  - Based on more customer requests, the agent can make changes to the sales quotes, but not to the sales orders.
  - The agent is designed to work with sales lines of type "Item"; other sales line types, such as Resource, Charge (Item), Allocation Account, and Fixed Asset, aren't supported.
  - At this stage, the agent supports the creation of up to 15 item lines per sales document. Increasing the number of lines might result in lower-quality output.
  - How you name your products can affect agent output. For example, using cryptic abbreviations versus friendly names can reduce output quality.

- When adding items to a sales document, the use of the item's **Variant Code** isn't currently supported. It leaves the **Variant Code** field empty.

- Pricing and discount requests

   Business Central has an advanced price/discount calculation logic, often extended by ISV solutions. Therefore, the most reliable way to get the item price is to create a sales document—for example, a quote. For this reason, the agent is designed *not* to provide or update any pricing and discount information by email. Prices and default discounts are calculated by Business Central's own business logic and included with a sales quote document. Requests for changing discounts and pricing aren't accepted by the agent. Instead, they're surfaced to the users for applying them manually. 

- Other considerations

  - Delegated administrators can't activate the agent.  
  - It's only possible to configure and use one Sales Order Agent per Business Central company.
  - The agent uses the regional settings specified by its user account.
  - While the agent can recognize and interact with the custom fields and actions introduced by customizations and ISV solutions, which are added to the agent's profile and permissions, the results might vary in quality and should be thoroughly tested. Improving reliability of working with the custom elements might require adjustments to the agent's instructions, which is currently not supported. 
  
## What operational factors and settings allow for effective and responsible use of the feature?

- Access control and permissions

  Sales Order Agent can be granted access exclusively to specific parts of the product required to perform its designated tasks. The agent comes with predefined permissions and a user interface (UI) role, also known as a profile, that an administrator or configuring user can assign to the agent. This assignment restricts the agent's access to certain areas of the product. It defines the type of access (for example, whether the agent is only allowed to read specific data or also update or delete it) and determines which UI elements—such as pages, fields, actions, and FactBoxes—it can interact with.  

  We strongly encourage using the permission sets and the profile included with the Sales Order Agent, which can be assigned on the Agent card. This practice ensures that the agent only has access to the functionalities necessary for its role, enhancing both security and efficiency within the system.

  Learn more in [Set up Sales Order Agent](sales-order-agent-setup.md).

- Transparency and notifications

  Business Central users can maintain full transparency and control over the changes made by Sales Order Agent by using other experiences that enable them to:

  - Receive notifications on the role center that come from the agent when it requires help or when the process demands human review. For example, review is required for all inbound and outbound messages, approvals, adding missing data, and similar reasons.
  - Get a better understanding of the specific task context and history (“timeline” view), including key steps involved in it.
  - Get a detailed review of each entity created by the agent (for example, a sales quote or sales order that surfaces all changes and suggestions made by the agent within a specific task. This behavior allows humans to review and adjust changes, and then sign out on proceeding with the task.
  - Get an overview of the agent's key performance indicators (KPIs) that summarize the impact of the agent's work. For example, you can get an overview of the number of sales quotes or orders created by the agent and the total number of these orders.

    Make sure you attend to the notifications raised by the agent to review and approve its work.  
- All actions done by the agent, including creating and modifying records and calling actions, carry the agent's user ID. This user ID appears in the same places and in the same way as it does with other users, such as in list views, history, posted documents, notifications, and more.  
- Approval workflows can be used to add an extra layer of control to the tasks done by the agent, as they do with other users. You can set up approval workflows to make the agent create a request for approval for a specific change—for example, to mark the quote as released. The change isn't allowed until another user approves the request. Learn more in [Use Approval Workflows](across-how-use-approval-workflows.md).

## Is this capability extensible?

Currently, this capability isn't extensible by partners.

# Work with Service Contracts and Service Contract Quotes
You can create a service contract either manually or from a service contract quote. You can use a service contract quote as a forerunner of a service contract, in which your company makes an offer to the customer and obtains customer approval before you can convert it to a service contract. The procedures for creating either a service contract or service contract quote are similar.  

## To create a service contract or service contract quote  
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Contracts** or **Service Contract Quotes**,and then choose the related link.  
2. Create a new service contract or service contract quote.  
3. Fill in the **No.** field. A dialog box opens, asking whether you want to fill it with the common data from a contract template. If you want to create such a service contract or service contract quote, choose the **Yes** button. The **Service Contract Template List** page opens.  
4. Select the appropriate template, and then choose **OK** to use it to create the service contract or service contract quote.  
5. In the **Customer No.** field, choose the customer.  
6. If you do not want an annual amount difference to be distributed automatically, choose the **Allow Unbalanced Amounts** check box. The values in the **Annual Amount** and **Calcd. Annual Amount** fields are not automatically equalized. If you want application to do automatically distribute any annual amount difference that might occur from a change in the service contract, leave the **Allow Unbalanced Amounts** check box clear.  
7. Add contract lines to the service contract or service contract quote.  
8. Fill in the rest of the fields as necessary.  

## To convert a service contract quote to service contract  
When a customer has accepted a service contract quote, you convert it to a service contract. At the same time, you can create a service invoice for the starting period of the contract if the starting date of the contract is before the beginning of the next invoice period.

After you complete the following steps, a service contract is created with the status **Signed**. If a service invoice is created for the starting period of the contract, the invoiced amount is calculated in the following way, depending on whether the contract is detailed or not.  

For detailed contracts, the invoiced amount is calculated as follows:  

* Invoiced amount = sum of the invoiced amount for each contract line.  
* Invoiced amount for each contract line = ((quote value ÷ 12) × number of months in the starting period) + ((quote value ÷ number of days in the year) × number of days left in the starting period).  
* If the contract line expires before the starting period ends, the expiration date becomes the ending date of the starting period for the line.  

For contracts that are not detailed, the invoiced amount is calculated as follows:  

* Invoiced amount = (annual amount ÷ number of days in the year) × number of days in the starting period.  
* If the contract expires before the starting period ends, the expiration date becomes the ending date of the starting period.    

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Contract Quotes**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the service contract quote you want to convert to a service contract.  
3. Choose the **Make Contract** action.  
4. If the starting date of the contract is before the beginning of the next invoice period, you are asked if you want to create an invoice for the starting period of the contract. Choose **Yes**.  

 The service invoice is posted to the service account of the contract, even if the contract is prepaid.

## To create contract service credit memos
You can use a contract service credit memo when a customer cancels a prepaid service contract or removes a service item from a prepaid contract. You can also use it to correct an erroneous service invoice.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Credit Memos**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Create a new service credit memo.  
3. Fill in the **No.** field.  
4. In the **Customer No.** field, enter the number of the customer in the service contract.  

     The **Invoicing** FastTab shows information copied from the **Customer** card. If you want to post the credit memo to a different customer than the one specified on the **General** FastTab, enter the number of that customer in the **Bill-to Customer No.** field.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  You can compare the credit memo to the original posted document on the **Posted Service Invoices** page. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Posted Service Invoices**, and then choose the related link.  

5. Fill in the **Posting Date** and **Document Date** fields.  
6. On the credit memo lines, enter information about the items that have been returned or removed, or the allowance that will be sent. You can also use the **Get Prepaid Contract Entries** batch job.  

 To automatically create a credit memo when contract lines are removed from a service contract, on the **Service Contract** page, on the **Invoice Details** FastTab, select the **Automatic Credit Memos** check box.  

 To manually create a credit memo when contract lines are removed from a service contract, on the **Service Contract** page, choose the **Credit Memo** action.  

## Updating and evaluating contracts
Sometimes you have to change the terms of a contract after it has been created. In most cases, you open the relevant contract on the **Service Contract** page, and change it as necessary.  

You can change the status of the contract, initially set to **Locked**, add and remove contract lines, and cancel a contract. If you want to see how your business is doing as measured by gain and loss, you can do quick business analysis using the contract trendscape feature.

## To add a contract line to a service contract or contract quote  
When a customer purchases a new item and wants to include it in the existing service contract or contract quote, you can register the item as a service item and then add it as a new contract line to the contract or contract quote.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Contracts**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the relevant service contract or service contract quote that you want to add a new contract line for.  
3. Choose the **Open Contract** action to open the service contract or service contract quote for editing.  
4. On the **Invoice Details** FastTab, select the **Allow Unbalanced Amounts** field if you want to change the annual amount and distribute the annual amount difference manually on the contract lines. Otherwise, clear the check box in the **Allow Unbalanced Amounts** field. This will distribute the annual amount difference automatically on the contract lines after you change the annual amount.  
5. On the **Lines** FastTab, add a service item or item, or text description, on each contract line. Alternatively, you can add contract quote lines. Note that you can create multiple contracts per service item to have it included in different service contracts or contract quotes at the same time.  
6. Verify and correct the numbers in the **Line Discount %**, **Line Discount Amount**, **Response Time**, **Service Period**, and other fields as needed.

## To remove contract lines  
You may need to remove contract lines from the service contract as you remove corresponding service items from the service contract. Usually you remove a contract line that is expired or corresponds to the service item that has broken down.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Contracts**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the service contract from which you want to remove contract lines.  
3. Choose the **Open Contract** action to open the service contract for editing.  
4. Choose the contract line you want to remove. Fill in the **Contract Expiration Date** field with the date as of which you want to remove the line. For example, you could enter the date when the service item broke down.  
5. Choose the **Remove Contract Lines** action. The **Remove Lines from Contract** page opens.  
6. Fill in the default filters: **Contract No.**, **Service Item No.**, and **Contract Type**. If needed, you can apply more filters or change the existing ones.  
7. Fill in the fields on the **Options** FastTab, and then choose the **Delete Lines** action.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  If the contract is not detailed, you must update the value in the **Annual Amount** field on the **Invoice Details** FastTab on the **Service Contract** page, reflecting the loss of the service item from the contract.  
>   
>  If the contract is detailed and prepaid, and you have posted invoices for the contract, you can create a credit memo for the contract. Choose the **Create Credit Memo** action. This is unnecessary if the check box in the **Automatic Credit Memos** field on the **Invoice Details** FastTab is selected. In that case, a credit memo is created automatically when you remove a contract line.

## Service Line Cost and Value
On a service contract lines, the amounts in the **Line Cost** and **Line Value** are calculated as described in the following tables.

| Line Cost Options | Description|
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
|**Service item** | The cost is automatically retrieved from the **Default Contract Cost** field in the **Service Item** table and copied into the **Line Cost** field. The following formula is used to calculate the line cost:<br /><br /> Sales Unit Cost × Contract Value % ÷ 100|  
|**Item** | The cost is automatically retrieved from the **Unit Cost** field in the **Item** table and the **Contract Value %** field value in the **Service Mgt. Setup** table. The following formula is used to calculate the line cost:<br /><br /> Unit Cost × Contract Value % ÷ 100|  
|**Text description** | The value in the **Line Cost** field is set to zero.|

|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
|**Service item** | The price is automatically retrieved from the **Default Contract Value** field in the **Service Item** table and copied into the **Line Value** field.|  
|**Item** | Depending on the value in the **Contract Value Calc. Method** field in the **Service Mgt. Setup** table, the amount is retrieved from either the **Unit Price** or the **Unit Cost** field in the **Item** table. After that, this value is multiplied by the contents of the **Contract Value %** field in the **Service Mgt. Setup** table and divided by 100. This amount is copied into the **Line Value** field.<br /><br /> **NOTE:** If the **Contract Value Calc. Method** field is set to **None**, the contents of the **Line Value** field are not calculated.|  
|**Text description** | The contents of the **Line Value** field are set to zero.|  

## To add a contract discount to service contract quotes  
You can add contract discounts on services for contract quotes and service contracts. The discounts can be on spare parts in particular service item groups, on resource hours for resources in particular resource groups, and on particular service costs.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Contract Quotes**, and choose the related link.  
2. Choose the quote to add discounts for.  
3. Choose the **Service Discounts** action. The **Contract/Service Discounts** page opens.  
4. To create a new contract discount, choose the **New** action.  
5. Fill in the fields on the line as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)].  

> [!Tip]  
>  To add contract discounts directly to a service contract, perform similar steps from the **Service Contract** page.  

## To change the owner of a service contract  
You may need to change the owner of a service contract. If a service item in a service contract is registered in noncanceled multiple contracts owned by the same customer, then the owner of all service contracts that include this service item and of all other service items included in these contracts is updated automatically.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  In this case, only noncanceled contracts are considered. The status of the contract quotes is not taken into account.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  Service items and contracts can be related. Changing the owner of a service contract can affect these relationships.  
>   
>  For example, suppose service item No. 8 is included in contracts SC00003 and SC00015. Contract SC00015 also contains service item No. 15, which is also included in the contract SC00080. In this case, the owner for all three contracts and service items will be changed.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Contracts**, and then choose the related link. Open the relevant service contract whose owner you want to change.  
2. Choose the **Open Contract** action to open the contract for editing.  
3. Choose the **Change Customer** action. The **Change Customer in Contract** page opens.  
4. In the **Contract No.** and **Service Item No**. fields you can see the numbers of the contract and service item owned by the selected customer. If the customer owns more than one contract with more than one service item included, then the value of these fields will be **Multiple**. To see the list of related contracts or service items, select these field values.  
5. In the **New Customer No.** field, choose the new customer.  
6. In the **New Ship-to Code** field, choose the address.  
7. Choose the **OK** button to change the customer and ship-to code of the service contracts.  
8. Choose the **Lock Contract** action to lock the contract and to make sure that the changes will be part of the contracts.  

## To update a service contract price  
You can update the prices on service contracts by specifying a price update percentage.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Update Service Contract Prices**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the service contract.  
3. In the **Update to Date** field, enter a date. The batch job will update prices for contracts with next price update dates on or before this date.  
4. In the **Price Update %** field, enter the percentage that you want to update the prices by.  
5. In the **Action** field, select **Update Contract Prices**.  

## To post prepaid contract entries  
If you work with prepaid service contracts, you must regularly post prepaid contract entries, thereby transferring the prepaid payments from the prepaid contract accounts to the regular contract accounts.  

Before you can post prepaid contract entries, you must specify a number series in the **Prepaid Posting Document Nos.** field on the **Service Mgt. Setup** page.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Post Prepaid Contract Entries**, and then choose the related link.  
2. In the **Post until Date** field, enter a date. The batch job posts prepaid service ledger entries with posting dates up to this date.  
4. In the **Posting Date** field, enter the date you want to use as the posting date on the general journal line.  
5. In the **Action** field, choose **Post Prepaid Transactions**.  
6. Choose **OK** to post the entries.

## Changing the Service Contract Status
After the service contract is signed, the **Change Status** field value is automatically set to **Locked**. If you want to modify information in the service contract or service contract quote, first you have to change the status of the contract or contract quote from **Locked** to **Open**. Note that you cannot create service invoices for the service contract with the **Open** change status. After the contract or contract quote is modified, you have to change the status back to **Locked** to make it possible to create service invoices and ledger entries for the service contract, which includes the changes that you made to it.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  The **Change Status** field is not related to the **Release Status** field on the service order header, which governs the warehouse handling of service items.  

## To cancel a service contract  
You may need to cancel a service contract when the contract has expired or has been canceled by you or the customer.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  You cannot reopen a contract after it is canceled.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Contracts**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the relevant service contract to cancel.  
3. Choose the **Open Contract** action to open the service contract for editing.  
4. In the **Cancel Reason Code** field, choose the relevant reason code. To add more reason codes, choose the **Advanced** action.  

     If the check box in the **Use Contract Cancel Reason** field on the **Service Mgt. Setup** page is selected, you must specify a cancel reason code when canceling contracts.  

5. In the **Status** field, choose **Canceled**.  
6. If there are unposted invoices, credit memos, or opened prepaid entries for the contract, a confirmation message will appear. In the message box, choose **No** to return to the contract and post the documents, or **Yes** to continue the cancellation process.  

## Filing a service contract or contract quote  
You can file service contracts and contract quotes at any time to record and archive a copy of the contract or contract quote. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] files service contracts automatically when you convert contract quotes to service contracts or cancel service contracts. You can file a contract or quote yourself by choosing the **File Contract** action in the **Service Contracts** or **Service Contract Quotes** pages. If you want to view your archived contracts of quotes by searching for **Filed Contracts**.

# Inventory by Serial No. (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

If you track items by serial numbers, the **Inventory by Serial No.** report shows your total inventory per serial number. Use this report to track the performance of items on a serial by serial basis.

:::image type="content" source="media/inventory/inventory-by-serial-no.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Inventory by Serial No Power BI Report" lightbox="media/inventory/inventory-by-serial-no.png":::

## Use the report

Inventory management and warehousing staff use this report to track inventory per serial number.

Inventory managers use the report to optimize stock levels for each serial number. This information can help identify slow moving inventory, so you can take corrective action. It can also help you find serial numbers that are due to expire.

The report gives warehouse staff a clear picture of the quantities of each serial number, so you can manage inventory efficiently and avoid stock-outs.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The *Inventory by Serial No.* report includes the following KPIs:

- [**Quantity**](inventory-powerbi-kpis.md#quantity)
- [**Inventory (Quantity)**](inventory-powerbi-kpis.md#inventory-quantity)

[!INCLUDE[click-on-a-kpi-link](includes/click-on-a-kpi-link.md)] 

[!INCLUDE[powerbi-tip-track-kpis](includes/powerbi-tip-track-kpis.md)] 


## Data used in the report

The report uses data from the following tables in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]:

- Item
- Item Ledger Entries

# Set up projects, prices, and project posting groups

As a project manager, you can set up each of the projects that you manage in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Use the **Project Setup** page to define how you'll use project features.

For each project, specify various information:

* Prices for project items
* Project resources
* Project G/L accounts
* Project posting groups (required)

## To set general information for projects

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Project Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> The **Apply Usage Link by Default** toggle on the **Projects Setup** page indicates whether project ledger entries are linked to project planning lines by default. Turn on the toggle to apply this setting to all new projects. You can enable or disable project usage tracking for a specific project by turning the **Apply Usage Link** toggle on or off on the **Project Card** page. The **Apply Usage Link** toggle also activates warehouse handling, planning, assembly-to-order, item tracking, and reservation capabilities for project.

### To set up project usage tracking

When you're working on a project, you might want to know how your usage is tracking against your plan. To explore usage, you can create a link between your project planning lines and the actual usage. The link lets you track your costs and understand how much work remains. By default, the project planning line type is **Budget**, but using the line type **Both Budget and Billable** has similar effects.

After you set up usage tracking by turning on the **Apply Usage Link by Default** toggle, you can review information on the project planning line. For example, you can set the quantity of the resource, item, or general ledger account. You can also set the quantity to transfer to the project journal. The **Remaining Quantity** field on the project planning line shows what remains to transfer and post to the project journal.

>[!NOTE]
> If the **Apply Usage Link** is chosen on the project, and the **Line Type** field on the project journal line or purchase line is **Billable**, new project planning lines of the line type **Both Budget and Billable** are created when you post the project journal or purchase document.  
>
> For more information, see [Record Usage for Projects](projects-how-record-job-usage.md) and [Manage Project Supplies](projects-how-manage-project-supplies.md)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you don't specify a value in the **Line Type** field on the project journal line or purchase line, project planning lines aren't created when you post the project journal or purchase document.

### Invoice multiple customers for project tasks

When projects involve multiple customers, billing the right customers for the right tasks can be challenging. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] makes billing less complex by letting you specify the bill-to and sell-to customers on each project task line, so you can automatically generate invoices for the correct customers.  Use the **Default Task Billing Method** field to specify whether you're billing one customer, or multiple customers by default. You can change task billing method for a specific project by using the **Task Billing Method** field on the **Project Card** page. To learn more about invoicing multiple customers, go to [Invoice one or more customers for project tasks](projects-how-create-jobs.md#invoice-one-or-more-customers-for-project-tasks).

### Synchronize the cost of used items

The cost of an item (inventory value) that you purchase and later use in project might change during its lifetime. For example, because a freight cost is added to its purchase cost after you post the usage of the item.

In [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can manually or automatically adjust item costs. The adjustment is reflected in the value entries and general ledger. To learn more, go to [Managing Inventory Cost](finance-manage-inventory-costs.md)

In relation to projects, you also have options for how to reflect those adjustments.

To ensure that cost changes automatically adjust in a project each time the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job is run, turn on the **Automatic Update Project Item Cost** toggle.

If you keep it off, remember to run the **Update Job Project Cost** task manually or by using a job queue entry.

## To set up prices for resources, items, and general ledger accounts for projects

> [!NOTE]
> In 2020 release wave 2, we released new processes for setting up and managing prices and discounts. If you're a new customer, you're using the new experience. If you're an existing customer, whether you are using the new experience depends on whether your administrator has enabled the **New sales pricing experience** feature update in **Feature Management**. For more information, see [Enabling Upcoming Features Ahead of Time](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/feature-management).

You can set up prices for the items, resources, and general ledger accounts related to a project. 

#### [Current Experience](#tab/current-experience)

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Project**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the project, and then choose the **Resource**, **Item**, or **G/L Account** action.
3. On the **Project Resource Prices**, **Project Item Prices**, or **Project G/L Account Prices** pages, fill in the fields as necessary.

When you choose a resource, item, or general ledger account for a project, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses information in the optional fields on project planning lines and project journals. The following table explains how.

|Column1  |Column2  |
|---------|---------|
|**Project Items**|The **Project Task No.**, **Currency Code**, and **Line Discount %** fields. The value in the **Unit Price** field for the item will be used on the project planning lines and project journals when this item is entered. This price overrides the regular customer price (the "best price" mechanism) for items. To use the regular customer price, don't specify project item prices for the project.|
|**General Ledger Accounts**|The information in the **Project Task No.**, **Currency Code**, **Line Discount %**, **Unit Cost Factor**, and **Unit Cost** fields will be used on the project planning lines and project journals when this general ledger account is entered and added to a project. When you choose a general ledger account, project planning lines and project journals use the value in the **Unit Price** field for the general ledger project expense.|
|**Project Resources**|The **Project Task No.**, **Work Type**, **Currency Code**, **Line Discount %**, and **Unit Cost Factor** fields. The value in the **Unit Price** field for the resource is used on project planning lines and project journals when you enter a resource, or a resource assigned to the resource group. This price overrides prices specified on the **Resource Price/Resource Group Prices** page.|

#### [New Experience](#tab/new-experience)

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Projects**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the relevant project, and then choose the **Sales Price Lists** action.

## To set up project posting groups

One aspect of planning projects is deciding which posting accounts to use for project costing. To be able to post projects, you set up accounts for posting for each project posting group. A posting group represents a link between the project and how it should be treated in the general ledger. When you create a project, you specify a posting group, and by default, each task you create for the project is associated with that posting group. However, as you create tasks, you can override the default and select a posting group that is more appropriate.  

> [!NOTE]  
> You must set up accounts in the chart of accounts before you set up posting groups. For more information, see [Set Up or Change the Chart of Accounts](finance-setup-chart-accounts.md).  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Project Posting Groups**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action, and then fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

| Account field | Description | Used in WIP Type |
| --- | --- |  --- |
| **Code** |An identifier for the posting group. You can enter up to 10 characters, including spaces. | |
| **WIP Costs Account** |The WIP account for the calculated cost of the project WIP, which is a balance sheet capital asset account. | Applied Cost, Recognized Costs|
| **WIP Accrued Costs Account** |An account for the Cost Value or Cost of Sales method of WIP calculation. This account is for accrued expense liability on your balance sheet. When a WIP adjustment requires you to increase the usage costs that you post to your income statement, you post to this account. | Accrued Costs|
| **Project Costs Applied Account** |A balancing account to the WIP Costs Account, which is a contra for a negative expense account. Used when **WIP Posting Method Used** is set to *Project*. | Applied Costs, Recognized Costs|
| **Item Costs Applied Account** |Same as  **Project Costs Applied Account**, but used when **WIP Posting Method Used** is set to *Project Ledger Entry*.| |
| **Resource Costs Applied Account** |Same as  **Project Costs Applied Account**, but used when **WIP Posting Method Used** is set to *Project Ledger Entry*.| |
| **G/L Costs Applied Account** |Same as  **Project Costs Applied Account**, but used when **WIP Posting Method Used** is set to *Project Ledger Entry*.| |
| **Project Costs Adjustment Account** |The balancing account to the WIP Accrued Costs account, which is an expense account. | Accrued Costs|
| **G/L Expense Acc. (Budget)** |The sales account that will be used for general ledger expenses in project tasks with this posting group. If left empty, the general ledger account entered on the project planning line is used. | |
| **WIP Accrued Sales Account** |The WIP account for the calculated sales value of the WIP, which is an accrued revenue account for your balance sheet. When a WIP adjustment requires you to increase the recognized revenue, you post to this account. | Accrued Sales, Recognized Sales|
| **WIP Invoiced Sales Account** |The account for the invoiced sales value of the WIP that is not able to be recognized. It is a balance sheet Unearned Revenue account. | Recognized Sales, Applied Sales|
| **Project Sales Applied Account** |The balancing account to the WIP Invoiced Sales account, which is a contra income account. | Applied Sales, Recognized Sales|
| **Project Sales Adjustment Account** |The balancing account to the WIP Project Sales Account, which is an income account. | Accrued Sales|
| **Recognized Costs Account** |The expense account that contains the recognized costs for the project. It is a debit expense account ordinarily. | Recognized Costs|
| **Recognized Sales Account** |The income account that contains the recognized income for the project. It is a credit income account ordinarily. | Recognized Sales|

### Allow multiple people to post project transactions at the same time

To allow people to post transactions for projects at the same time, you can enable the **Enable multiple users to post job ledger entries at the same time** feature update on the **Feature Management** page. By default, the feature isn’t enabled.

> [!NOTE]
> Similar features are available for resource, inventory, and warehouse entries. To learn more, go to:
>
> * [Allow multiple people to post resource transactions at the same time](projects-how-setup-resources.md#allow-multiple-people-to-post-resource-transactions-at-the-same-time)
> * [Allow workers to post inventory transactions at the same time](inventory-how-setup-general.md#allow-workers-to-post-transactions-at-the-same-time)
> * [Design details: Creating warehouse entries](design-details-warehouse-entries.md)

If you enable the feature, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] assigns entry numbers for each table from `SequenceNumbers` in the database, which allows people to post transactions at the same time. The result can be that sometimes entries from two or more transactions are interleaved.

There's a similar feature for inventory transactions. An item register might contain any or all of the entry tables, as shown in the following image.

:::image type="content" source="media/interleaved inventory tables.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the item register with several entry tables." lightbox="media/interleaved inventory tables.png":::

If you don’t enable the feature, when someone posts a transaction the tables are locked and other users can’t post. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] finds the last entry in each table and assigns a number that’s one higher. This numbering ensures that entries that belong to the same register are consecutive, but prevents other people from posting at the same time.

> [!NOTE]
> You might not want to enable the feature if you have a feature or extension that:
>
> * Relies on consecutive entry numbers.
> * Requires that tables are locked throughout the posting process.

# Ad-hoc analysis of inventory data

This article explains how to use the **Data Analysis** feature to analyze inventory data directly from list pages and queries. You don't have to run a report or switch to another application, such as Excel. The feature provides an interactive and versatile way to calculate, summarize, and examine data. Instead of running reports using options and filters, you can add multiple tabs that represent different tasks or views on the data. Some examples are "expiring stock" or "top sellers," or any other view you can imagine. To learn more about how to use the **Data Analysis** feature, go to [Analyze list and query data with analysis mode](analysis-mode.md).

Use the following list pages for ad-hoc analysis of inventory processes:

- [Item Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=38&layout=analysis)

## Inventory ad-hoc analysis scenarios

Use the **Data Analysis** feature for quick fact checking and ad-hoc analysis:

- If you don't want to run a report.
- If a report for your specific need doesn't exist.
- If you want to quickly iterate to get a good overview on a part of your business.

The following sections provide examples of inventory scenarios in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

| Area | To... | Open this page in analysis mode | Using these fields |
| ---- | ----- | ------------------------------- |------------------- |
| [Inventory on-hand](#example-inventory-on-hand) | Get an overview of items that are available in your inventory. | [Item Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=38&layout=analysis) | **Item No.**, **Remaining Quantity** |
|[Example: track expiring or old stock](#example-track-expiring-or-old-stock) | Get an overview of items in your inventory that have been on stock for a long time and aren't selling well. | [Item Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=38&layout=analysis) | **Posting Date Year**, **Posting Date Month**, **Item No.**, **Posting Date**, **Entry type**, **Quantity**, and **Remaining Quantity**. |
| [Returned items by return reason](#example-returned-items-by-return-reason) | Get an overview of goods that customers return, categorized by the return reason. Use this for analysis for quality control. | [Item Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=38&layout=analysis) | **Return Reason Code**, **Posting Date Month**, **Quantity** , **Cost Amount**, **Posting Date**, **Document Type**, **Item No.**, and  **Document No.** . |
| Inventory throughput | Get an overview of purchases and sales in your inventory by month or quarter. | [Item Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=38&layout=analysis) | **Posting Date Year**, **Posting Date Month**, **Item No.**, **Quantity**, **Sales Amount**, **Cost Amount (Actual)**, and **Posting Date Month** |
| [Inventory movements] | Get an overview of how goods in your inventory move between locations. | [Item Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=38&layout=analysis) | **Location Code**, **Quantity**, **Posting Date**, **Item No.** |

## Example: inventory on-hand

To analyze items in your inventory that are in stock, follow these steps:

1. Open the [Item Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=38&layout=analysis) list, and choose :::image type="content" source="media/analysis-mode-icon.png" alt-text="Enter analysis mode."::: to turn on analysis mode.
1. Go to the **Columns** menu and remove all columns (select the box next to the **Search** field).
1. Drag the **Item No.** field to the **Row Groups** area. Drag the fields in that order.
1. Drag the field **Remaining Quantity** to the **Values** ares.
1. Set a **Not equal** filter to **0** on **Remaining Quantity**. If you don't allow negative stock levels, set a **Greater than** filter to **0**.
1. Optionally, add other fields to the analysis and maybe pivot on location or other fields.
1. Rename your analysis tab to **Inventory on Hand** or something that describes this analysis.

The following image shows the result of these steps.

   > [!TIP]
   > If you add the Posting Date field, you can also track movements over time.

## Data foundation for ad-hoc analysis on inventory

When you post a sales order, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] updates the customer's account, general ledger, and item ledger entries.

- For each sales order line, an item ledger entry is created in the **Item Ledger Entry** table (if the sales lines contain item numbers). In addition, sales orders are always recorded in the **Sales Shipment Header** and **Sales Invoice Header** tables. To learn more about posting sales, go to [Posting sales](ui-post-sales.md).

When you post a purchase document, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] updates the vendor's account, general ledger (G/L), item ledger entries, and resource ledger entries.

- For each purchase line, as applicable, entries are created in the **Item Ledger Entry** table (if the purchase line is of the Item type). In addition, purchase documents are always recorded in the **Purch. Recpt. Header** and **Purch. Inv. Header** tables. To learn more, go to [Posting purchases](purchasing-how-record-purchases.md#posting-purchases).

# Classifying data sensitivity fields

To classify the fields that hold sensitive or personal data, a Microsoft partner can set the ```DataClassification``` property on fields. This requires access to the database tables, either through the development environment or by running a Windows PowerShell script. For more information, see [Classifying Data](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-classifying-data).  

As a customer, you can add a second level of classification by specifying sensitivity levels for the data you store in standard and custom fields. Classifying data sensitivity helps ensure that you know where you keep personal data in your system, and makes it easier to respond to requests from data subjects. For example, if a contact or customer asks you to export their personal data. For more information, see [Responding to Requests About Personal Data](admin-responding-to-requests-about-personal-data.md).

> [!Important]  
> Microsoft is providing this Data Sensitivity Classification feature as a matter of convenience only. It's your responsibility to classify the data appropriately and comply with any laws and regulations that are applicable to you. Microsoft disclaims all responsibility towards any claims related to your classification of the data.  

The following table describes data sensitivity levels you can assign.

|Sensitivity|Description|
|----|----|
|Sensitive | Information about a data subject's racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious beliefs, involvement with trade unions, physical or mental health, sexuality, or details about criminal offenses. |
|Personal | Information that can be used to identify a data subject, either directly or in combination with other data or information.|
|Confidential | Business data that you use for accounting or other business purposes, and do not want to expose to other entities. For example, this might include ledger entries.|
|Normal | General data that does not belong to any other categories.|

## How do I classify my data?

Classifying the sensitivity of a large number of fields one-by-one would take a long time. To help speed up the process, we provide tools that you can use to bulk classify the sensitivity of fields, and then fine-tune classifications for specific fields. You can find tools on the Data Classification Worksheet page, which is available on the Administration of users, user groups, and permissions Role Center. You must be a system administrator to use the worksheet.
 
> [!Important]  
> When you open the Data Classification Worksheet page for the first time, it will be empty. You must run the Data Classification guide to generate the list of fields. To start the guide, choose the **Set Up Data Classifications** action.

For example, the Data Classification Worksheet page lets you do things like:  

* Use the Data Classification guide to export your fields to an Excel worksheet where you can bulk classify them. Using the Excel worksheet is particularly useful if you are collaborating with a Microsoft partner. After you update the worksheet, you can use the guide to import and apply the classifications. You can also use the guide to classify fields manually.  
* Choose a field and then filter the list to find similar fields that are likely to belong to the same classification as the field you based the search on.  
* Investigate a field by viewing its contents.  

> [!Tip]  
> We have defined sample sensitivity classifications for the tables and fields in the Cronus demonstration company. You can use those classifications as inspiration when you classify your own tables and fields.

# Closing the books
After you ensure that all your accounts are up-to-date, and you allocate costs and income, then you can close the books for a fiscal year or period.

You aren't required to close a year, but doing so will make working in the system easier for you because you'll be able to take advantage of the convenient filtering options provided. You also don't have to worry about losing details of transactions when you close because all details are retained, even after you close the year.

## Closing book process
The process for closing the book includes these main tasks:

1. Closing the accounting period.

    A fiscal year is defined as one or more open periods as defined on the **Accounting Periods** page. A typical fiscal year contains 12 periods of one month each, but you can also choose another method of defining a year.

    For more information, see [Close Accounting Periods](year-close-account-periods.md).
2. Registering prior-year entries.

    When you close a fiscal year, you must enter a number of administrative transactions (such as prepaid and accrued items). These transactions are called adjusting entries. There are no special rules for posting these entries, and they (like other entries) contain a check mark in the **Prior-Year Entry** field if they're posted on a date in a closed fiscal year. Even though a fiscal year has been closed, you can still post general ledger entries to it.
3. Transferring balances from the income statement accounts to the balance sheet.

    After a fiscal year has been closed and all prior-year entries have been posted, the income statement accounts must be closed and the net income for the year must be transferred to an account under owners' equity on the balance sheet. Use the Close Income Statement batch job for this purpose. The batch job processes all general ledger accounts of the type Income Statement and creates entries that reverse their balances. These entries are placed in a journal from which they can be posted. The batch job doesn't post them automatically, except when an additional reporting currency is used. When an additional reporting currency is used, the batch job posts directly to the general ledger.

    For more information, see [Close Income Statement](year-close-income-statement.md).
4. Posting the year-end closing entry along with the offsetting equity account entries.

    When the Close Income Statement batch job is finished, you post the entries generated by the job. If you didn't specify a retained earnings account in the batch job, then enter one line with a balancing entry that posts the net income to the correct general ledger account under owners' equity on the balance sheet. Finally, post the journal.

    For more information, see [Post Year-End Closing Entry](year-how-post-year-end-close-entry.md).

## What happens when you close

When you close at the end of the year, the system moves your earnings from calculated earnings to the Retained Earnings account. The system also marks the fiscal year as "closed," and marks all subsequent entries for the closed year as "prior year entries."

The system then generates a closing entry, but it doesn't post the entry automatically. You're given the opportunity to make the offsetting equity account entry or entries, which allows you to decide how to allocate your closing entry. For example, if your company has several divisions, you can let the system generate a single closing entry for all the divisions, and you can then make an offsetting entry for each division's equity account.

You can post in a previous fiscal year, even after the income statement accounts have been closed, if you run the Close Income Statement batch job again afterward.

# Use item references

If you buy or sell items that you and your vendor or customer use different terms for, then you can set up a reference between your terms for the items and the terms that the customer or vendor of that item uses. This way, the vendor's or customer's item description, unit of measure, or variant code is automatically inserted on the relevant documents when you fill in the **Item Reference No.** field.  

## To set up an item reference

1. Choose the :::image type="icon" source="media/ui-search/search_small.png" border="false"::: icon, enter **Items**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the card for an item for which you want to create a reference.
3. Choose the **Item References** action.

     If you can't find the **Item References** action, choose to view more options, and then find it under **Related** > **Item**.
  
4. On a new line on the **Item Reference Entries** page, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)].

The following procedure describes how you specify the item reference on a purchase order. Similar steps apply to sales documents and other purchase documents.  

## To enter a vendor's item description on a document

1. Choose the :::image type="icon" source="media/ui-search/search_small.png" border="false"::: icon, enter **Purchase Orders**, and then choose the related link.
2. Create a purchase order for the vendor that you set up an item reference for in the previous procedure.
3. Create a purchase line for the item that you set up an item reference for in the previous procedure.
4. In the item reference **No.** field, select the relevant item reference, and then choose the **OK** button.

The **Description** field on the line is overwritten with the vendor's item description, as set up on the item reference entry. If the item reference includes a variant code or a unit of measure, these values are also copied to the document.  

## Scan barcodes with the Business Central mobile app

[!INCLUDE [barcode-mobile-app](includes/barcode-mobile-app.md)]

The following table lists the pages that support barcode scanning of item references from the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] mobile app.

|Page  |Field value you can scan  |
|---------|---------|
|Item Reference     | Reference No.        |
|Item Journal Line     | Item Reference No.        |
|Phys. Invt. Order Line     |Item Reference No.         |

# Register new vendors

Vendors provide the products you sell. Each vendor you purchase from must be registered with a vendor card.

Before you register new vendors, you must set up various purchase codes to select from when you fill in vendor cards. After all the required master data is created, you can add unique characteristics for a vendor, such as prioritize the vendor for payment purposes or list items that the vendor and other vendors supply. Another group of setup tasks for vendors is to record your agreements concerning discounts, prices, and payment methods. Learn more at [Setting Up Purchasing](purchasing-setup-purchasing.md).

Vendor cards hold the information required to buy products from each vendor. Learn more at [Record Purchases](purchasing-how-record-purchases.md) and [Register New Items](inventory-how-register-new-items.md).

> [!Video https://learn-video.azurefd.net/vod/player?id=7188b662-bc49-45ef-8152-82898076b235]

## Adding new vendors

You can add new vendors manually, by filling out the **Vendor Card** page, or you can use templates that contain predefined information. For example, you can create templates for different types of vendor profiles. Using templates saves time when adding new vendors, and helps ensure the information is correct each time.

> [!NOTE]  
> If vendor templates exist for different vendor types, when you begin to create a new vendor card you'll see a page from which you can select the appropriate template. If only one vendor template exists, then new vendor cards always use that template.

After you create a template, you can use the **Apply Template** action to apply it to one or more selected vendors. To create a template, fill in the information you want to reuse on the **Vendor Card** page, then save it as a template. Learn more in the [To save the Vendor Card Page as a template](purchasing-how-register-new-vendors.md#to-save-the-vendor-card-as-a-template) section.

> [!TIP]
> It can be helpful to personalize the **Vendor Template** page when you create a template. For example if want to add a field that is not already displayed on the page. Learn more in the [Personalize your workspace](/dynamics365/business-central/ui-personalization-user#start-personalizing-by-using-the-personalization-mode) section.

You can also create a vendor from a contact. Learn more in the [Creating a customer, vendor, employee, or bank account from a contact](marketing-create-contact-companies.md#to-create-a-customer-vendor-employee-or-bank-account-from-a-contact) section.

Remit-to addresses are used when you print checks to pay your vendors, and vendors can have multiple remit-to addresses for payments. For example, a vendor might supply an item from a subsidiary company, but wants to receive payment at their headquarters. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] lets you set up multiple mailing addresses for each vendor, and you can choose the correct location to send payments to on an invoice-by-invoice basis.

You specify remit-to addresses on Vendor Card pages, and on the Shipping & Payments FastTab on purchase orders and invoices. When you create payment journal lines using the Pay Vendor or Create Payment actions on the Vendors list page or Vendor Card page, or the Apply Entries action on a payment journal, the remit-to code on the vendor ledger entry is assigned. You can overwrite this value.

### To create a new vendor

[!INCLUDE[create_new_vendor](includes/create_new_vendor.md)]

> [!TIP]  
> If you do not know the invoicing address to be used for every invoice from a vendor, do not fill in the **No.** field on the **General** FastTab. Instead, choose the pay-to vendor number after you have set up a purchase quote, order, or invoice header.

The vendor is now registered, and the vendor card is ready to use on purchase documents.

If you want to use this vendor card as a template when you create new vendor cards, you can save it as a vendor template. Learn more in the [To save the vendor card as a template](#to-save-the-vendor-card-as-a-template) section.

### Deleting and editing vendor information

You can edit the information on vendor cards at any time. However, if you have posted a transaction for a vendor, you cannot delete the card because the ledger entries may be needed for auditing. To delete vendor cards with ledger entries, contact your Microsoft partner to do so through code.

> [!TIP]
> You can change the International Bank Account Number (IBAN) on a vendor bank account without the change affecting your historical credit transfer register entries. Credit transfer register entries store the *Recipient IBAN* and the *Recipient Bank Account No.* specified in the **Vendor Bank Account** and **Recipient Name** fields from the **Vendor Card** page when the entries were created.

> [!TIP]
> You can add alternative addresses on vendor cards by choosing the **Order Addresses** action.

## To save the vendor card as a template

1. On the **Vendor Card** page, choose the **Save as Template** action. The **Vendor Template** page opens showing the vendor card as a template.
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
3. To reuse dimensions in templates, choose the **Dimensions** action. The **Dimension Templates** page opens showing any dimension codes set up for the vendor.
4. Edit or enter dimension codes to apply to new vendor cards created using the template.
5. When you have completed the new vendor template, choose **OK**.  
   The vendor template is added to the list of vendor templates, so you can use it to create new vendor cards.

# Reconcile bank accounts with Copilot

This article explains how bank account reconciliation assist can help you reconcile bank transactions with ledger entries in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central.

## About bank account reconciliation assist

Bank account reconciliation assist is a set of AI-powered features that help you reconcile bank accounts. It offers two distinct tasks through Copilot:

- Improved matching of transactions with ledger entries

    As you might already know, the **Match Automatically** button on the **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** page automatically matches most bank transactions with ledger entries. We refer to this operation as *automatch*. Although automatch works well, the algorithms that it uses can sometimes result in many unmatched transactions. Copilot uses AI technology to inspect those unmatched transactions and identify more matches, based on the dates, amounts, and descriptions. For example, if a customer paid multiple invoices in one lump sum that you have registered as individually paid invoices, Copilot reconciles the single bank statement line with the multiple bank ledger entries.

    [Learn more about this task](#reconcile-bank-accounts-with-copilot).

- Suggested general ledger (G/L) accounts

    For residual bank transactions that can't be matched to any ledger entries, Copilot compares the transaction description with G/L account names and then suggests the most likely G/L account to post to. For example, if unmatched transactions have the narrative *Fuel Stop 24*, Copilot might suggest that you post them to the *Transportation* account.

    [Learn more about this task](#post-unmatched-bank-transaction-amounts-to-suggested-gl-accounts).

## Supported languages

[!INCLUDE[copilot-language-support](includes/copilot-language-support.md)]

## Prerequisites

- The **Bank account reconciliation** capability is activated. An administrator must complete this task. Learn more in [Configure Copilot and agent capabilities](enable-ai.md).
- You're familiar with bank account reconciliation in Business Central. Learn more in [Reconcile Bank Accounts](bank-how-reconcile-bank-accounts-separately.md).

## Reconcile bank accounts with Copilot

<!-- Similar to the **Match Automatically** capability on the **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** page, Bank account reconciliation assist can also automatically matches transactions in banks statements with bank entries. The difference is that **Match Automatically** uses a native rules-based algorithm, while Bank account reconciliation assist is based AI technology though Copilot.

By using the **Reconcile with Copilot** action on **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** page, you can find even more matches.-->

Copilot in bank account reconciliation is intended to supplement the automatch operation. Therefore, when you use Copilot, the automatch operation runs first to make the initial matches. Then Copilot runs to try to match transactions that the automatch operation didn't handle.

You can use two approaches to reconcile bank accounts with Copilot:

- Use Copilot to start a new reconciliation on a bank account, directly from the **Bank Account Reconciliations** list.
- Use Copilot on a new or existing reconciliation on a **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** card.

# [From the Bank Account Reconciliation list](#tab/fromlist)

For this approach, you create and reconcile a new bank account reconciliation from scratch. This approach requires that you select the bank account. If the bank account isn't linked to an online account, you must also import the bank statement file.

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Bank Account Reconciliations**, and then select the related link.
1. Select ![Shows the copilot icon](media/copilot-icon.png) **Start a Copilot prompt action** > **Reconcile** to open the **Reconcile with Copilot** window.
1. Set the **Perform reconciliation for this bank account** field to the bank account that you want to reconcile.

    ![Screenshot that shows the Reconcile with Copilot window for reconciling from scratch.](media/reconcile-bank-accounts-new-copilot.svg)

1. If the selected bank account isn't linked to an online bank account, you must import the bank statement file. To import the file, either select the value in the **Use transaction data from** field or select the paper clip button next to the **Generate** button. Then use **Select the file to import** to import the bank statement file by either dragging it from your device or browsing your device.
1. To reconcile with Copilot, select **Generate**.

    Copilot starts to generate proposed matches. When it finishes, the **Reconcile with Copilot** window shows the results of the matching process.

1. Review the proposed matches as described in the next section.

# [From a Bank Acc. Reconciliation card](#tab/fromcard)

For this approach, you use Copilot either on a new bank account reconciliation that you manually create or by editing an existing reconciliation.

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Bank Account Reconciliations**, and then select the related link.
1. Follow one of these steps:

    - Select **New** to start a new reconciliation. Add the statement lines, either manually or by using **Suggest Lines** action to get a copy of the bank ledger entries as a starting point.
    - Select and open an existing reconciliation in the list.

1. On the **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** card, select ![Shows the Copilot icon](media/copilot-icon-rainbow.png) > **Reconcile with Copilot** in the upper-right corner.

    ![Screenshot that shows the Reconcile with Copilot button on a Bank Acc. Reconciliation card.](media/bank-reconciliation-copilot-card.png)

    Copilot starts to generate proposed matches. When it finishes, the **Reconcile with Copilot** window shows the results of the matching process.

1. Review the proposed matches as described in the next section.
---

### Review, save, or discard proposed matches

After you run Copilot, the **Reconcile with Copilot** window shows the detailed results, including any proposed matches. At this point, no match that Copilot proposed has been saved. Therefore, you have an opportunity to inspect the proposals and save or discard them as you want.

![Screenshot that shows proposed matches in the Reconcile with Copilot window.](media/bank-reconciliation-copilot-window.png)

The **Reconcile with Copilot** window is divided into two sections. The upper section provides some general details about the result. The lower section, **Match proposals**, lists the matches that Copilot proposed.

The following table describes the fields in the upper section.

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| Auto-matched | The number of bank statement lines that the automatch operation matched. Select the value to view the reconciliation card. |
| Copilot matched | The number of bank statement lines that Copilot proposed matches for. You can view details of the matches in the **Match proposals** section. |
| Statement Ending Balance | The ending balance that is shown on the bank statement that you're reconciling with. |
| Post if fully applied | Turn on this option to automatically post the bank account reconciliation when all lines (100 percent) are matched and you select **Keep it**. |

In the **Match proposals** section, review the proposed matches line by line. Then take the appropriate action:

- To discard a single proposed match, select it in the list, and then select **Delete Line**.
- To discard all proposed matches and close the **Reconcile with Copilot** window, select the ![Discard button.](media/copilot-delete-trash-can.png) **Discard it** button next to the **Keep it** button at the bottom of the window.
- To automatically post the fully matched reconciliation when you save it, turn on the **Post if fully applied** option.
- To save the matches that are currently shown in the **Reconcile with Copilot** window, select **Keep it**.

## Post unmatched bank transaction amounts to suggested G/L accounts

This section explains how to use Copilot to post unreconciled bank account statement line amounts (as specified in the **Difference** field) to a G/L account. This task can be done only from an existing reconciliation.

1. Go to the **Bank Account Reconciliations** list, and open the existing reconciliation that includes the unreconciled lines.

    This step gives you a clear view of any unreconciled bank statement lines that must be transferred to the G/L account.

1. In the **Bank statement lines** pane, identify the unmatched bank statement lines, and select one or more lines that you want to reconcile.

    Copilot focuses on the selected lines to post new payments to the G/L account.

1. Select ![Shows the Copilot icon](media/copilot-icon-rainbow.png) > **Post Difference to G/L Account** to start the process.

    ![Screenshot that shows the Post Difference to G/L Account button on the Bank Acc. Reconciliation card.](media/bank-reconciliation-transfer-gl-copilot-card.png)

    Copilot starts to generate proposals for posting new payments.

1. After Copilot finishes generating proposals, the **Copilot Proposals for Posting Differences to G/L Accounts** window appears.

    The **Match proposals** section of this window shows the proposals. The experience resembles the experience for reconciling with Copilot.

    ![Screenshot that shows Copilot Proposals for Posting Differences to G/L Accounts window.](media/bank-reconciliation-gl-transfer-proposed-matches-v2.png)

    To post the differences as regular journal entries, you must specify the general journal template and batch to use. This allows you to reverse the transaction if you need to later.

1. Review the proposals line by line to ensure the accuracy of the suggested payments for posting.

    - If you drill down on the proposal by selecting it in the list, you're taken to a list of accounts. From there, you can select another account. You can do this type of manual correction only when you use the **Post Difference to G/L Account** flow, not the matching flow.
    - If you select **Save** next to a proposal, you can add the mapping to the **Text-to-Account Mapping** page. Then, the next time that this text appears during matching, it's mapped to the proposed account.

1. Discard or save proposals.

    - To discard a specific proposal, select it in the list, and then select **Delete Line**. To discard all proposals and close Copilot, select the ![Discard button.](media/copilot-delete-trash-can.png) **Discard it** button next to the **Keep it** button at the bottom of the window.
    - If the proposals meet your requirements, and you want to save them, select **Keep it**.

         This step confirms the transfer of the currently selected proposals from the bank account ledger to the G/L account. It posts new payments to the proposed G/L accounts and applies corresponding lines to the resulting bank account ledger entries.

# Enable Automatic Breaking Bulk with Directed Put-away and Pick

For locations that use directed put-away and pick, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can break larger units of measure into smaller units of measure when it creates warehouse instructions for source documents, production orders, or internal picks and put-aways. To breakbulk can also mean gathering items in smaller units of measure to equal the quantity of a larger unit of measure on a source document or production order.

## Breakbulk in picks  

If you want to store items in several different units of measure in a location and allow them to be automatically combined in the picking process, turn on the **Allow Breakbulk** toggle on the Location Card page. Afterward, to fulfill a task [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will look for an item in the same unit of measure. If it doesn't find one, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will suggest that you break a larger unit of measure into the unit of measure that is needed.  

If only smaller units of measure are available, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will suggest that you gather items to fulfill the quantity on the shipment or production order. In effect, it breaks the larger unit of measure on the source document into smaller units for picking.  

## Breakbulk in put-aways  

In warehouse put-aways, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] suggests Place action lines in the put-away unit of measure. For example, it might suggest pieces even though the items arrive in a different unit of measure.  

## Breakbulk in movements  

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can also breakbulk in replenishment movements if the **Allow Breakbulk** toggle on the **Calculate Bin Replenishment** page is turned on.  

You can view the results of the conversion process from one unit of measure to another as intermediate breakbulk lines in the put-away, pick, or movement instructions.  

> [!NOTE]  
> If you select the **Set Breakbulk Filter** field on the warehouse instruction header, application will hide the breakbulk lines whenever the larger unit of measure is going to be completely used. For example, if a pallet is 12 pieces and you'll use all 12 pieces, the pick will then direct you to take 1 pallet and place 12 pieces. However, if you must pick only 9 pieces the breakbulk lines aren't hidden, even if you've selected the **Breakbulk Filter** field. The lines aren't hidden because you must put the remaining three pieces somewhere in the warehouse.  

> [!NOTE]  
> If you want your units of measure to perform optimally in the warehouse, also in connection with breakbulk, you should try to:  
>
> - Set up the base unit of measure for an item as the smallest unit of measure that you expect to handle in your warehouse processes.  
> - Set up your alternative units of measure for the item as multiples of the base unit of measure.

# Chart of sustainability accounts and ledger

This article explains how to manage the chart of sustainability accounts (CoSA), categories and subcategories, and details about sustainability ledger entries.

## Chart of sustainability accounts

The CoSA forms the foundational structured list that is used to record all emissions, water, and waste data. It serves as a framework that categorizes and organizes sustainability accounts based on their attributes, such as the scope or other groupings. Each account is typically assigned a unique code or number for easy reference and tracking. It has the same structure as a traditional chart of accounts but is customized specifically to monitor sustainability-related data and metrics in an organization.  

Users can add sustainability account categories and sustainability account subcategories to define how the system behaves. In this way, they can select dedicated emissions, water, or waste for tracking, emission factors, formulas, and similar configurations.

> [!NOTE]
> Based on the greenhouse gas (GHG) standards, there are three emission scopes:
>
> - **Scope 1 emissions** include emissions from stationary and mobile combustion, and from inadvertent fugitive emissions.
> - **Scope 2 emissions** include indirect emissions from the generation of energy that is purchased from utility providers.
> - **Scope 3 emissions** include a wide spectrum of emissions, from purchased goods and services and capital goods, to fuel and energy–related activities, to upstream and downstream transportation, to generated waste, to business travel and employee commuting, and so on.
> - **Out of scope** is for situations where you can't assign a specific emission to the transaction.

> [!NOTE]
> You can also select **Water/Waste** as one of options in the **Emission Scope** when they want to post transactions related to the water and waste management.  

From the CoSA, you can do things such as:

- View reports that show sustainability ledger entries and balances.
- Open the sustainability account card to add or change settings.
- View the category and subcategory for the account.
- View separate balances for each emission for a single account.
- Add single or multiple dimensions to each account and set dimension filters.

You can add, change, or delete sustainability accounts. However, to prevent discrepancies, you can't delete a sustainability account if one or more ledger entries are associated with it.

### Add or change accounts

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 3.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Chart of Sustainability Accounts**, and then select the related link.
2. On the **Chart of Sustainability Accounts** page, you can open each sustainability account, and then add or change settings. Hover over a field to read a short description.

For accounts of the **Total** account type, you must set the **Totaling** field.

For accounts of the **End-Total** type, the **Indent** action automatically sets the **Totaling** field. After you set up all the accounts, select the **Indent Chart of Sustainability Accounts** action to run the **Indent** action and set the **Totaling** field.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The **Indent Chart of Sustainability Accounts** action overwrites the value of all fields for **End-Total** accounts. Therefore, if you entered definitions in the **Totaling** field for **End-Total** accounts before you ran the **Indent Chart of Sustainability Accounts** action, you must enter them again after you run it.  

### Delete accounts

You can delete a sustainability account. However, you must first make sure that no ledger entries are associated with it. Business Central prevents you from deleting a sustainability account if one or more ledger entries are associated with it.

## Account categories

You must add a sustainability account category to each sustainability account to define how the system behaves. You can select emission scopes (gas, water, or waste), dedicated to type of transaction to track, formulas, and similar configurations.  

To review sustainability account categories, follow these steps:

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 3.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sustainability Account Categories**, and then select the related link.
2. On the **Sustainability Account Categories** page, you can edit the existing list or create a new category. To create a new category, select the **New** action.
3. Fill in the **Code** and **Description** fields.
4. In the **Emission Scope** field, select one of the scope options related to gas emissions or water or waste intensity.
5. Select the gas emissions, or water or waste intensity, that you want to track. Currently, the following options are available: **CO2**, **CH4**, **N2O**, **Water Intensity**, **Discharged Into Water**, and **Waste Intensity**. You can select any combination that you want to track, but you must select at least one of them.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you choose one of gas emissions scopes as the **Emission Scope** you can select the **CO2**, **CH4**, or **N2O**, but you can't select the **Water Intensity**, **Discharged Into Water**, or **Waste Intensity**. Also, if you select **Water/Waste** as the **Emission Scope**, you can select only the  **Water Intensity**, **Discharged Into Water**, or **Waste Intensity**, but you can't select **CO2**, **CH4**, or **N2O**.

6. In the **Calculation Foundation** field, select the calculation foundation (formula) to use for emission calculations if you don't know the accurate emission or water or waste intensity amount.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If the formulas in the **Calculation Foundation** field aren't enough, you can extend the field and add more calculations for use in sustainability journals.

7. If you selected **Custom** in the **Calculation Foundation** field, you can configure a custom description in the **Custom Value** field.

If you set the **Calculation Foundation** field, the following table explains how [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates emissions based on the option that you selected. In the table, **EF** represents the **Emission Factor** value that you can configure on the **Sustainability Account Subcategory** page.

| Emission Type | Calculation Foundation | Formula | Comment |
|---------------|------------------------|---------|---------|
| **Scope 1** | | | |
| Stationary combustion | Fuel/Electricity | *Emission* = *Fuel* &times; *EF* | *Fuel* = Amount of fuel that is spent for boilers, heaters, thermal oxidizers, and so on. |
| Mobile combustion | Fuel/Electricity | *Emission* = *Fuel* &times; *EF* | *Fuel* = Amount of fuel that is spent for on-road or off-road vehicles, rail, and so on. |
| | | *Emission* = *Distance* &times; *EF* | *Distance* = Mileage of on-road or off-road vehicles, rail, and so on. |
| Fugitive emissions | Installation | *Emission* = *Installation multiplier* &times; *Custom Amount* &divide; 100 &times; *Time Factor* &times; *EF* | *Custom Amount* = Assembly losses, annual leak rate, and so on. |
| **Scope 2** | | | |
| Utility providers | Fuel/Electricity | *Emission* = *Electricity* &times; *EF* | *Fuel/Electricity* = Electricity quantity, steam quantity, heating unit, and so on. |
| | Custom | *Emission* = *Custom Amount* &times; *EF* | *Custom Amount* = Thermal unit, ton-hour, and so on. |
| **Scope 3** | | | |
| Purchased goods and services, and capital goods | Custom | *Emission* = *Custom Amount* &times; *EF* | *Custom Amount* = Cost (GL), and so on. |
| Upstream transportation and distribution | Distance | *Emission* = *Distance* &times; *EF* | |
| | Distance | *Emission* = *Distance* &times; *Multiplier* &times; *EF* | *Multiplier* = Load Factor / Tons of cargo *|
| Downstream transportation and distribution | Distance | *Emission* = *Distance* &times; *EF* | |
| | Distance | *Emission* = *Distance* &times; *Multiplier* &times; *EF* | *Multiplier* = Load Factor / Tons of cargo *|
| Waste generated in operations and end-of-life treatment of sold products | Custom | *Emission* = *Custom Amount* &times; *EF* | *Custom Amount* = Waste |
| Business travel and employee commuting | Distance | *Emission* = *Distance* &times; *EF* | *Distance* = Mileage of the used company car, rental car, train, flight, and so on. |
| | Custom | *Emission* = *Custom Amount* &times; *EF* | *Custom Amount* = Hotel stays |
| | Fuel/Electricity | *Emission* = *Fuel* &times; *EF* | *Fuel* = Amount of fuel spent in the company car, rental car, and so on. This is the only formula used for water or waste intensity calculation. |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This note applies to the formulas for **Upstream Transportation and Distribution** and **Downstream Transportation and Distribution** when you use the tons-of-cargo calculation model. While you can adapt the formulas, we recommend against using the exact number of tons of cargo as a multiplier. Instead, consult your sustainability advisor to ensure accurate calculations because emissions don't increase linearly with weight. A more accurate approach is to use the **Load Factor**, which represents the percentage of the truck's total capacity utilized (by weight or volume). The load factor can be calculated as **Weight of Cargo** / **Maximum Load Capacity of Truck**. But always confirm with your sustainability expert before you finalize calculations.

## Account subcategories

You must add a sustainability account subcategory to each sustainability account. This subcategory defines the emission factors that the formulas use, based on the emission tracking choice in the sustainability account category.

To review sustainability account subcategories, follow these steps:

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 3.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sustainability Account Subcategories**, and then select the related link.
2. On the **Sustainability Account Subcategories** page, you can edit the existing list or create a new category. To create a new category, select the **New** action.
3. Fill in the **Code** and **Description** fields.
4. Based on the gas emissions that you track in the sustainability account category and connect this subcategory to, you can also set one or more emission factors:

    - **Emission Factor CO2** – The emission factor for carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) emission.
    - **Emission Factor CH4** – The emission factor for methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) emission.
    - **Emission Factor N2O** – The emission factor for nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O) emission.
    - **Water Intensity Factor** - The intensity factor for Water.
    - **Discharged Into Water Factor** - The intensity factor for Discharged Into Water.
    - **Waste Intensity Factor** - The intensity factor for Waste.

5. If the subcategory is related to renewable energy, select the **Renewable Energy** field. However, you can select this field only if it's related to gas emissions and to water or waste.  

> [!NOTE]
> The **Import Data** and **Import From** fields are intended for integration with external systems that are used to collect emission factors. However, in **2024 release wave 1**, these fields can't be used as a feature by default.

You can have more than one account subcategory for a sustainability account, but only one can be set as the default value. You must set the default value for the account every time if you want to use it for posting.  

> [!TIP]
> For example, if you want to use one account for cars, but you have different types of cars with different emission factors. You can set up one account and create account subcategories for the different emission factors. When you work in a sustainability journal, you can change your account subcategory based on the car type.  

## Sustainability ledger entries

The sustainability ledger stores the history of all posted sustainability transactions and organizes all emission data according to the CoSA. When you post a sustainability journal, the data is recorded there. All active reports are generated based on the sustainability ledger entries.

To open this ledger for a specific account, use the **Ledger Entries** action on the **Chart of Sustainability Account** page. To open all the ledger entries, select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 3.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sustainability Ledger Entries**, and then select the related link. Hover over a field to read a short description.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> After you post your data to the sustainability ledger, you can't delete it. If you made a mistake, you can post a reverse transaction that has the same details but uses the negative sign for the amount.

> [!NOTE]
> If you posted entries before enabling **CO<sub>2</sub>e** in the **Emission Fees** page, you can run the **Update Carbon Fees** action from the **Emission Fees** page to recalculate carbon equivalent to in all transactions in the **Sustainability Ledger Entries**.

# Managing Marketing Campaigns
Having a strong marketing plan in place enables you to identify, attract, and retain customers. A marketing plan consists of various campaigns and other interactions in connection with your sales and marketing activities. While planning a campaign, you need to decide which contacts to target, what type of campaign (such as trade show or direct mail), and what salespeople will perform each task.

Each campaign consists of various activities or tasks. You can combine multiple task, for example tasks that each represent a step, in activities. Activity tasks are related to each other by a date formula. Individual tasks can only be assigned to salespeople. Activities can be assigned to opportunities, salespeople, groups of sales people, and contacts. For more information, see [Set Up Opportunity Sales Cycles and Cycle Stages](marketing-how-setup-opportunity-sales-cycles-stages.md).

## Defining individual campaigns
Before you can create a campaign, you must set up *campaign status codes*. Using these codes will help you manage your campaigns by assigning a status to the campaign. As you work through the stages of a campaign, you are able to see what step a campaign is at and what step comes next. You set up campaign status codes on the **Campaign Status** page.

You can create a campaign card for each campaign that you want to keep track of. You can also view these campaign cards to view general information about your campaigns.
You can delete campaign entries, such as if the entry records an action that has been canceled. Only canceled campaign entries can be deleted.

### Selecting the target audience
After you have created a campaign, you can start creating segments that specify the target audience of the campaign. For more information, see [Managing Segments](marketing-segments.md).

### Registering discount percentages
When you have set up your campaign, decided what segments you want the campaign to cover, and set the starting and ending dates, you register the discount percentage that the customer will receive on the individual items on the lines on the **Sales Line Discounts** page. You can also register the sales prices for the individual items on the lines on the **Sales Prices** page. You can access both pages from the campaign card.

 When you have set up the sales prices/line discounts and the segments on the campaign card, you must activate them so that the campaign prices/discounts will be reflected on the lines.

> [!NOTE]  
>   In order to activate the sales prices/line discounts, you must specify if the whole segment or only some contacts are targets of the campaign. If the sales prices/line discounts covers all the contacts in the segment, select the **Campaign Target** field on the **Campaign** FastTab of the **Segment** card.

If the sales prices/line discounts are not to be offered to all the contacts in the segment, you can clear the **Campaign Target** field for the relevant contacts. If you cannot see this field, you can add it to your view. For more information, see [Personalize Your Workspace](ui-personalization-user.md).

## Conducting campaigns
As a campaign runs, all interactions with your contacts, or segment, are recorded so that you can get statistics and other information about the costs and success rates of the campaign.

Campaigns are conducted by salespeople, and you must create activities to represent each task and assign them to the relevant salespeople. For more information, see [Set Up Opportunity Sales Cycles and Cycle Stages](marketing-how-setup-opportunity-sales-cycles-stages.md).

> Due to the Payment Services Directive in Europe (PSD2), after September 14, 2019, you will no longer be able to automatically import bank statements from banks in the United Kingdom into [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. We are looking into the possibility of offering this feature again in the future.

> [!NOTE]
> The Envestnet Yodlee Bank Feeds service is only supported in the online version of Business Central. This functionality is not supported for on-premises versions of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], or for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] environments hosted on Embed ISV application services. To use this functionality on-premises, you must obtain a co-brand account from Envestnet, and you must add code to integrate with the Yodlee API.
>
> The Envestnet Yodlee Bank Feeds service is only supported in the United States and Canada.
> Only banks residing in these countries/regions are supported, even though banks from other countries/regions may appear in the Envestnet Yodlee Bank Feeds bank selection window in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For technical assistance with the Envestnet Yodlee functionality, contact Microsoft Support. Do not contact Envestnet Yodlee. For more information, see [Configuring Technical Support for Dynamics 365 Business Central](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/technical-support).

The Envestnet Yodlee Bank Feeds service is installed as an extension to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online and is ready to be enabled in the supported countries/regions. For more information, see [Customizing [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Using Extensions](ui-extensions.md).

After you enable the bank feed service, you must link a bank account to the online bank account that the feed will come from. You link bank accounts to online bank accounts in the following different scenarios:

* A bank account doesn't exist in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] for your online bank account. Therefore, you create the bank account by linking from the online bank account.
* A bank account exists in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], which you want to link to an online bank account.
* A linked bank account must be unlinked because you want to stop using the bank feed service for the account.
* Online bank accounts have changed and you want to update the information on bank accounts in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

When the bank feed service is enabled, you can set a bank account up to automatically import new bank statements into the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page every two hours. Transactions for payments that have already been posted as applied and/or reconciled on the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page won't be imported. For more information, see the “To enable automatic import of bank statements” section.

> [!NOTE]  
> If you use the Set Up Company assisted setup guide, some of the steps in the following procedures happen automatically when you get to the company bank account setup. For more information, see [Getting Ready for Doing Business](ui-get-ready-business.md).

# How to use approval workflows

When a record, such as a purchase document or a customer card, needs to be approved by someone in your organization, you send an approval request as part of a workflow. Based on how the workflow is set up, the appropriate approver is then notified that the record requires their approval.

You set up approval workflows on the **Workflow** page. You must also set up approval users, including any relevant amount limits, on the **Approval User Setup** page. Learn more at [Set Up Approval Workflows](across-set-up-workflows.md).  

In addition to the approval workflows described in this article, you can perform various other workflow tasks. Learn more at [Use Approval Workflows](across-use-workflows.md).

Core approval workflows for purchases documents, sales documents, payment journals, customer cards, and item cards are ready to start as guides. Learn more at [Getting Ready for Doing Business](ui-get-ready-business.md).

## Request a record approval

The following task is performed by an approval user.

1. On the page that presents the record, choose the **Send Approval Request** action.
2. To see all your approval requests, choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Approval Request Entries**, then choose the related link.  

The status of the approval entry is updated from **Created** to **Open**. The status of the record, such as a purchase invoice, is updated from **Open** to **Pending Approval** and remains locked for processing until all approvers have approved the record.

When all required approvers have approved the record, the status changes to **Released**. You can then continue working with the record.

## Cancel approval requests

The following task is performed by an approval user with approver rights.

A customer may want to change an order after it's been submitted for approval. In this case, you can cancel the approval process, make the necessary changes to the order, then request approval again.

- On the page displaying the record, choose the **Cancel Approval Request** action.

When the approval request has been canceled, the status of the related approval entry is changed to **Canceled**. The status of the record is updated from **Pending Approval** to **Open**. At this point, the approval process can start again.

## Approve or reject approval requests

The following task is performed by an approval user with approver rights.

You can process approval requests on the **Requests to Approve** page, including approving multiple requests at a time. Alternatively, you can approve individual records by choosing the link in the notification that you receive.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Requests to Approve**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select one or more lines of the record(s) you want to approve or reject.
3. Choose the **Approve**, **Reject**, or **Delegate** actions.

When a record has been approved or rejected, the approval status in the **Status** field changes to **Approved** or **Rejected**, respectively.

If an approver hierarchy is set up, the record status is **Pending Approval** until all requested approvers have approved the record. Then the record status changes to **Released**.

At the same time, the approval status changes from **Created** to **Open** as soon as an approval request for the record is created. If the request is rejected, the approval status changes to **Rejected**. The status remains **Open** or **Rejected** until all approvers have approved the request.

## Delegate approval requests

The following task is performed by an approval user with approver rights.

To prevent records from piling up or otherwise blocking the workflow, the approver and the approval administrator can delegate an approval request to a substitute approver. The substitute can either be a designated substitute, the direct approver, or the approval administrator, in that order of priority. You typically use this feature if an approver is unavailable or unable to approve requests before the due date.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Requests to Approve**, then choose the related link.
2. Select one or more lines of approval requests you want to delegate to a substitute approver, then choose the **Delegate** action.

A notification to approve the request is sent to the substitute approver.

## Manage overdue approval requests

The following task is performed by an approval user with approver rights.

At regular intervals you'll need to remind approval workflow users of overdue approval requests; you'll use the **Send Overdue Approval Notifications** function to do so.

The **Send Overdue Approval Notifications** function checks for all open approval requests currently overdue. Each approver with at least one overdue approval entry receives a notification with the list of all their overdue approval requests. The notification is also sent to their approver and all the requesters of the overdue approvals. This last step helps if the overdue approval entry must be delegated to a substitute.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Overdue Approval Requests**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Overdue Approval Requests** page, choose the **Send Overdue Approval Notifications** action.

# Create Service Quotes
You can think of service quotes as the basis for service orders. In fact, they are almost identical. They both contain information such as who the customer is, the type of order, the item that needs service, billing and shipping information, and information about the actual service work.
 
You can use a service quote as a preliminary draft for a service order, and then convert the quote to a service order.  
  
## To create a service quote  
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Quotes**, and then choose the related link.

# Record consumption or usage for projects

From the **Project Card** page, you can open the **Project Planning Lines** page to review and record use on various parts of your project. This information is automatically updated when you modify and transfer information between projects and project journals or project invoices. This requires that you turn on the **Apply Usage Link by Default** toggle on the **Project Setup** page. Learn more at [Set Up Projects](projects-how-setup-jobs.md).  

For example, for planning lines of type **Budget**, you can enter the quantity of a resource, and then specify the quantity to transfer to the project journal. If the type of the planning line is **Billable**, you can enter the quantity of the resource, and then specify the quantity to transfer to an invoice. To learn more about invoicing the customer, go to [Invoice Projects](projects-how-invoice-jobs.md). By comparing the original quantity, remaining quantity, or posted quantity you can quickly review use information. To learn more about how to estimate budgeted values during planning, go to [Manage Project Budgets](projects-how-manage-budgets.md).  

The following procedures describe how to record actual (budgeted) quantities and costs with a project journal. Alternatively, you can use purchase documents to record purchases for a project. Learn more at [Manage Project Supplies](projects-how-manage-project-supplies.md).

## To record usage for a project planning line of type Budget

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Projects**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the project, and then choose the **Project Planning Lines** action. 
3. Select a project planning line of type **Budget** or **Both Budget and Billable** for which you want to record usage.   

    > [!NOTE]
    > You can also record usage for a project planning line of type **Billable**. Typically, you use these lines to create invoices, but you can also transfer the information to a journal. Learn more at [Invoice Projects](projects-how-invoice-jobs.md) 

4. In the **Qty. To Transfer to Journal** field, enter the quantity to transfer. The default quantity is the value that you enter in the **Quantity** field.

    The **Remaining Quantity** field shows the quantity that remains to complete the project and transfer to the journal.
5. Choose the **Create Project Journal Lines** action.

    > [!TIP]
    > If you are going to add more project planning lines for this project, wait with this step until you have added all project planning lines.
6. On the **Project Transfer Project Planning Line** page, fill in the fields as necessary, and then choose the **OK** button. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
7. Choose the **Open Project Journal** action.  
8. On the **Project Journal** page, select the relevant line and then choose the **Post** action.

    [!INCLUDE [preview-posting-inventory](includes/preview-posting-inventory.md)]

9. On the **Project Planning Lines** page, review the recorded usage by observing the **Quantity**, **Remaining Quantity**, and **Qty. To Transfer to Journal** fields.  
10. Repeat steps 3 through 8 to record additional usage.  

## To create project journal lines manually

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Project Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
2. In the **Batch Name** field, choose a relevant project journal batch.  
3. On a new line, enter document number, project number, project task number, type, and the quantity of the type being consumed.  
4. When the project journal lines are complete, choose the **Post** action.  

    [!INCLUDE [preview-posting-inventory](includes/preview-posting-inventory.md)]

## To view project usage estimates and post updates

You can view project usage up to the completion of a project in one step. To do so, you use the **Project Calc. Remaining Usage** batch job for all the tasks up to and including the end of a project.  

This lets you track and compare your original estimates against actual results and make modifications or new entries as needed. For example, you may have estimated that a project required 10 hours, and to date, it has taken 15 hours. You can add the extra five hours to the existing journal line or create a new journal line to report these five hours as overtime, which is another work type. The appropriate cost and price are calculated, and you can then post to the journal.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Item entries create item ledger entries and reduce the inventory quantity. The **Post Inventory Cost to G/L** batch job transfers the cost from inventory to the general ledger. Resource entries create resource ledger entries.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Project Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select a relevant project journal, and then choose the **Calc. Remaining Usage** action.  
3. On the **Project Calc. Remaining Usage** page, enter the document number and posting date that is to be inserted in the journal, and then choose the **OK** button.  
4. Update the journal with any modifications that may be needed.  
5. Choose the **Post**.

## Create inventory and warehouse pick documents for a project

Use the **Create Inventory Pick** and **Create Warehouse Pick** actions on the **Project Card** page. To create or register a pick document, use the **Put-away/Pick Lines/Movement Lines** or **Registered Pick Lines** actions. Learn more at [Flows for Production, Assembly, and Projects](design-details-internal-warehouse-flows.md).

You can use the actions under the following conditions:

* The **Status** of the project is **Open**.
* The **Line Type** of the project planning line is **Budget** or **Both Budget and Billable**.
* The **Type** of the project planning line is **Item**.
* **Require Pick** is enabled for the related location.
* **Directed Pick and Put-away** is disabled.

> [!NOTE] 
> Although the setting is called **Require Pick**, you can still post consumption directly from the project journal line for the location. If your location is set up to require pick processing but not shipment processing, you use the **Inventory Pick** page to organize and print the picking information. You also use the page to enter and post the result of the pick, which in turn posts the consumption of the items. 
> 
> If your location is set up to require both pick and shipment processing, meaning that you have chosen both the **Require Pick** and **Require Shipment** fields on the **Location Card** page, use the **Warehouse Pick** page to handle the pick. Warehouse picks are similar to inventory picks. The difference is that rather than posting the picking information you register the pick. This registration doesn't post consumption, it just makes the items available for posting. As a warehouse manager, you can use a pick worksheet to organize pick information before creating the individual warehouse pick instructions

## To review planning lines for a project ledger entry

After you have posted project journal lines, you can see the planning lines that are associated with the project journal entries that have been posted.

> [!NOTE]  
> This requires that the **Apply Usage Link** check box has been selected for the project. For more information, see [Set up projects](projects-how-setup-jobs.md).  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Project Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select a relevant project journal, and then choose the **Ledger Entries** action.  
3. On the **Project Ledger Entries** page, choose **Show Linked Project Planning Lines** action.

# Sustainability value chain in assembly orders

The requirement for enabling the use of the sustainability value chain in the assembly orders processes is that you enable the **Enable Value Chain tracking**, **Item Emissions**, and **Resource Emissions** fields on the **Sustainability Setup** page.  

To do so, follow next steps:

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sustainability Setup**, and then select the related link.
2. Check whether the basic setup already exists. If it doesn't, follow [these instructions](finance-sustainability-setup.md) to set it up.  
3. On the **Procurement** FastTab, fill in the following fields:
   1. **Enable Value Chain tracking** to enable sustainability value entries postings through value chain operations and the visibility of these fields in operational documents and journals.
   2. **Item Emissions** to enable a default sustainability account and emissions on the **Item Card** page.
   3. **Resource Emissions** to enable default a sustainability account and emissions on the **Resource Card** page.
5. Close the page.

## Working with assembly orders  

To learn more about how to work with assembly orders, go to [Assembly Management](assembly-assemble-items.md). However, the connection of assembly orders with the sustainability value chain is demonstrated two steps:

- Tracking emissions for items and resources consumed during the assembly process.
- Transfer the total emission values to the assembly items.  

To use an assembly order in the sustainability value chain process, add CO2e (carbon equivalent) emissions in all lines. For each line, fill in the **Total CO2e** field with the total emission for the quantity related to the item or resource on the assembly order line.

To do so, follow next steps:

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Assembly orders**, and then select the related link.
2. Create a new assembly order, or open the existing order you want to use. To learn more about assembly orders, go to [To assemble an item to stock](assembly-how-to-assemble-items.md#to-assemble-an-item-to-stock).
3. If your items and resources in the assembly order lines already have default sustainability accounts and emissions, the values are added in the **Sustainability Account No.** and **Total CO2e** fields. You can change these values if you want.
4. If you didn't have these default values for your items or resources, choose a **Sustainability Account No.**, and then fill in the **Total CO2e** field with the total emission amount for this line. The amount is for the whole quantity, regardless how many items are assembled at this moment. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] recalculates the value for the specific consumption.

> [!NOTE]
> Although the total CO2e emission amount displays for each line, there's a field called **CO2e per Unit**. Its value comes from the item or resource, and is used for calculations. However, if you change the **Total CO2e** field on the line, the **CO2e per Unit** recalculates based on the total emission and quantity for that line.  

5. On the **Posting** FastTab, **CO2e per Unit** and **Total CO2e** fields show the total calculated emission per unit of the assembled item after posting.
6. If the values are correct, choose the **Post** action to post the order.
7. After you post the order, if your **Quantity to Assemble** was less than the **Quantity**, the **Posted Total CO2e** fields on the header and lines update with the belonging total CO2e emission.  

After you post the order, you can open the **Posted Assembly Order** page to find the **Total CO2e** field on the **Posting** FastTab. The value in the **CO2e per Unit** field is also updated for the newly assembled item. You can also check the result by opening the **Item Card** page for the item used as the assembled item to verify that the **CO2e per Unit** field updated based on the values from the posted assembly order.
