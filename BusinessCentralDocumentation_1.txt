# Posting Date on Adjustment Value Entry Compared to the Source Entry

This article compares the Posting Date on the Adjustment Value Entry with the Posting Date on the entry causing the running of the Adjust Cost - Item Entries batch job, in particular a Revaluation scenario and an Item Charge scenario.

The **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job will process your data depending on your scenario and configuration of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. In this section, we describe two separate processes, and for each one we show the type of impact the Adjust Cost - Item Entries batch job has on the data.

## Revaluation scenario

### Prerequisites  

Please enter the following values:

**Inventory setup**:  

- Automatic Cost Posting = Yes  

- Automatic Cost Adjustment = Always  

- Average Cost Calc. Type = Item  

- Average Cost Period = Day  

**General Ledger Setup**:  

- Allow Posting From = January 1, 2021  

- Allow Posting To = Empty  

**User Setup**:  

- Allow Posting From = December 1, 2020  

- Allow Posting To = Empty  

### To test the scenario

Test this scenario by carrying out the following steps.

1. Create an **Item** called TEST with the following values:  

     - Base unit of measure = PCS  

     - Costing Method = Average  

     - Select optional posting groups.  

2. Open an **Item Journal**, then create a new entry, and post a line as follows:  

     - Posting Date = December 15, 2020  

     - Item = TEST  

     - Entry Type = Purchase  

     - Quantity = 100  

     - Unit Amount = 10  

3. Open an **Item Journal**, then create a new entry, and post a line as follows:  

     - Date = December 20, 2020  

     - Item = TEST  

     - Entry Type = Negative Adjustment  

     - Quantity = 2  

4. Open an **Item Journal**, then create a new entry, and post a line as follows:  

     - Date = January 15, 2021  

     - Item = TEST  

     - Entry Type = Negative Adjustment  

     - Quantity = 3  

5. Open an **Item Revaluation Journal**, then create a new entry, and post a line as follows:  

     - Item = TEST  

     - Applies-to Entry = select Purchase entry posted at step 2. The Posting Date of the revaluation will be the same as the entry it adjusts.  

     - Unit Cost (Revalued) = 40  

The following **Item Ledger** and **Value Entries** have been posted:  

**Item Ledger Entry - purchase**:  

|Entry Number  |Item No.  |Posting Date  |Entry Type  |Document No.  |Quantity  |Cost Amount (Actual)  |Remaining Quantity  |

The **Adjust Cost – Item Entries** batch job has recognized a change in cost and adjusted the Negative Adjustments.  

**Review of Posting Dates on created adjustment value entries:** The earliest allowed Posting Date the Adjust Cost - Item Entries batch job has to relate to is January 1, 2021 as stated in the General Ledger Setup.  

**Negative Adjustment in step 3:** assigned Posting Date is January 1, provided by General Ledger Setup. The Posting Date of the Value Entry in the scope for adjustment is December 20, 2020. According to the General Ledger Setup, the date is not within the allowed posting date range. Therefore the Posting Date stated in the Allow Posting From field in the General Ledger Setup is assigned to the Adjustment Value Entry.  

**Negative Adjustment in step 4:** assigned Posting Date is January 15. The Value Entry in scope of adjustment has Posting Date January 15, which is within the allowed posting date range according to General Ledger Setup.  

The adjustment made for the Negative Adjustment in step 3 causes discussion. The favorable Posting Date for the Adjustment Value Entry would have been December 20 or at least within December as the revaluation causing the change in COGS was posted in December.  

To achieve adjustment in December of the Negative Adjustment in step 3, the General Ledger Setup, Allow Posting From field, needs to state a date in December.  

### Conclusion

With the experience gained in this scenario, when considering the most suitable setup for an allowed posting date range for a company, you might want to consider the following. As long as you allow changes in the inventory value to be posted in a period, such as December in this case, the setup that the company uses for allowed posting date ranges should be aligned with this decision. The Allow Posting From in the General Ledger Setup, stating December 1, would allow the revaluation made in December to be forwarded to affected outbound entries in the same period.  

User groups not allowed to post in December but in January, which was probably intended to be limited by the General Ledger Setup in this scenario, should instead be addressed via the User setup.  

## Item charge scenario  

### Prerequisites  

Please enter the following values:

**Inventory setup**:  

- Automatic Cost Posting = Yes  

- Automatic Cost Adjustment = Always  

- Average Cost Calc. Type = Item  

- Average Cost Period = Day  

**General Ledger Setup**:  

- Allow Posting From = December 1, 2020.  

- Allow Posting To = Empty  

**User Setup**:  

- Allow Posting From = December 1, 2020.  

- Allow Posting to = Empty  

### To test the scenario  

Test this scenario by carrying out the following steps:

1.  Create an **Item** Charge with the following values:  

     - Base unit of measure = PCS  

     - Costing Method = Average  

     - Select optional posting groups.  

2.  Create a new **Purchase Order** with the following values:  

     - Buy-from Vendor No.: 10000  

     - Posting Date = December 15, 2020

     - Vendor Invoice No.: 1234  

     On the Purchase Order Line select the following values:  

     - Item = CHARGE  

     - Quantity = 1  

     - Direct Unit Cost = 100  

     To complete the step, Post the document as Received and Invoiced.  

3.  Create a new **Sales Order** with the following values:  

     - Sell-to Customer No.: 10000  

     - Posting Date = December 16, 2020  

     On the Sales Order Line:  

     - Item = CHARGE  

     - Quantity = 1  

     - Unit Price = 135  

     To complete the step, Post the document as Received and Invoiced.  

4.  Enter values for the **General Ledger Setup** page:  

     - Allow Posting From = January 1, 2021  

    -  Allow Posting To = blank  

5.  Create a new **Purchase Order** with the following values:  

     - Buy-from Vendor No.: 10000  

     - Posting Date = January 2, 2021  

     - Vendor Invoice No.: 2345  

     On the Purchase Order Line:  

     - Item Charge = JB-FREIGHT  

     - Quantity = 1  

     - Direct Unit Cost = 3  

     - Assign the Item Charge to the Purchase Receipt from step 2.  

     To complete the step, Post the document as Received and Invoiced.

6.  On work date January 3, a purchase invoice arrives containing an additional item charge to the purchase made in step 2. This invoice has document date December 30, and is therefore posted with Posting Date December 30, 2020.  

     Create a new **Purchase Order** with the following values:  

     - Buy-from Vendor No.: 10000  

     - Posting Date = December 30, 2020  

     - Vendor Invoice No.: 3456  

     On the Purchase Order Line select the following values:  

     - Item Charge = JB-FREIGHT  

     - Quantity = 1  

     - Direct Unit Cost = 2  

     Assign Item Charge to the Purchase Receipt from step 2  

     To complete the step, Post the document as Received and Invoiced.

Inventory Valuation report is printed as of Date December 31, 2020

![Content of the Inventory Valuation report.](media/helene/TechArticleAdjustcost13.png "Content of the Inventory Valuation report")

**Summary of scenario:**  

The described scenario ends up with an Inventory Valuation report demonstrating Quantity = 0 while the Value = 2. The Item charge posted in step 6 is part of the Inventory Increase value of December while the Inventory Decrease of the same period is not affected.  

Having the General Ledger Setup stating Allow Posting From January 1 was a good thing for the first Item charge. The costs of the Inventory Increase and Decrease was recorded in the same period. For the second Item charge however, the General Ledger Setup causes the change in COGS to be recognized in the period after.  

**Conclusion:**  

It is a challenge to get the Inventory Valuation report to demonstrate Quantity = 0 while the Value <> 0. In this case it is also more difficult to express the optimal settings, having purchase invoices arriving the same day but addressing different periods or even fiscal years. Crossing to a new fiscal year usually requires some planning and as part of that the insight into Adjust Cost – Item entries process, recognizing COGS, is to be considered.  

In this scenario one option could have been to have the General Ledger Setup, field Allow Posting From, stating a date in December for a couple of more days and the posting of the first item charge postponed to allow all costs for the previous period/fiscal year to be recognized for the period they belong to first, having the Adjust Cost – Item entries batch job run and thereafter move the allowed posting date to the new period\/fiscal year. The first item charge with posting date January 2 could then be posted.

# Create service items

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the term "service item" refers to equipment or items that require service. When you create a service order, you specify the items that need service. In the order, you can link a service item to an item in inventory or a service item group.

When you receive an item that needs service, you can register it as a service item. There are several ways to do so. For example, you can create a service item on the **Service Items** page, or as part of another process, such as when working with a service order.

## To create a service item

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Items**, and then choose the related link.
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  

## To create service items within a service order

When you receive items for service that you want to register as service items, you can create them as service items in the **Service Order** or **Service Quote** pages.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  
3. Choose the **Create Service Item** action.  

    A number is assigned to the service item and a service item card is created. The **Service Item No.** field is filled in with the number of the new service item.

## To create a service item when shipping items

When you ship items by posting either sales orders or sales invoices, the shipped items are automatically registered as service items if the following condition is met. The items must belong to a service item group with the **Create Service Item** check box selected. If the items have serial numbers registered in the Item Tracking Lines page, this information is copied automatically to the **Serial No.** field on the service item card when creating service items.  

The following procedure shows how to create service items when you ship items on sales orders.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the relevant sales order.  
3. Choose the **Post** or **Post and Print** action.  
4. Choose the **Ship** or **Ship and Invoice** action.  
5. The service items are automatically created for the items on the order, provided these belong to a service item group that you have set up to create service items. If you registered specific serial numbers on the **Item Tracking Lines** page, they will be assigned to these service items.  

> [!NOTE]  
> If an item is a BOM and you have exploded the BOM, the exploded BOM items are processed in the same way as regular items. Service items are created based on the service items group condition and, optionally, the serial numbers condition. Additionally, if a service item is created for an exploded BOM item that is made up of other BOM components, these items are created as service item components for the exploded BOM service item.

> If an item is a BOM and you have not exploded the BOM, a service item is created for it based on the service item group condition and, optionally, the serial numbers condition.  

## To insert a starting fee for a service item

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Tasks**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **Item Worksheet** action.
3. Choose the service line, and then choose **Actions**, choose **Functions**, and then choose **Insert Starting Fee** action.  

    A service line of type **Cost** is inserted with the starting fee. The starting fee applies to the selected service item.

## Block items, item variants, or specific service items

You can prevent items, item variants, or service items from being used in service management transactions, such as service contracts, service orders, and service invoices. This can be useful if you want to restrict the availability of some items or service items for service purposes, for example, due to discontinued support, limited stock, or contractual agreements.

To block an item or an item variant from being used in service management transactions, turn on the **Service Blocked** toggle on the **Item Card**, **Item Variants**, and **Item Variant Card** page. You can also set this field on the **Item Template** page, and it will be copied to the items created from that template.

When an item or an item variant is service blocked, it isn't available for selection on the following pages:

- Service Line (except for service credit memos, where you'll see a notification that the item or variant is blocked, but allowed on this type of document)
- Service Item
- Service Contract Line
- Standard Service Line

If you manually enter an item number or variant that's blocked, you'll get an error message that states, "The field contains a value that cannot be found in the related table."

Additionally, if you have service contracts, service contract quotes, or service orders that include blocked service items or item variants, you can't use the following actions:

- **Lock** or **Make Contract** on the **Service Contract Quote** page.
- **Lock Contract**, **Sign Contract**, **Create Contract Service Orders** or **Create Contract Invoices**  on the **Service Contract** page.
- **Make Order** on the **Service Quote** page.
- **Release to Ship** or **Post** on the **Service Order** page.
- **Post** in the **Service Invoice** page.

### Block a service item

To block a service item from being used in service management transactions, on the **Service Item Card** page, in the **Blocked** field, choose one of the following options:

- **Service Contract**: Block the service item from being used in service contracts and service contract quotes, but not in service orders or other service documents.
- **All**: Block the service item from being used in any service management transaction, including service contracts, service orders, and other service documents.

When a service item is blocked, you can't select it on the following pages:

- Service Contract Line (if blocked for service contract, or all)
- Service Item Line (except for service credit memos, if blocked for all)

If you manually enter a service item number for a blocked service item, an error message displays "The field contains a value that cannot be found in the related table."

Additionally, if you have service contracts, service contract quotes, or service orders that include blocked service items, you can't use the following actions:

- **Lock** and **Make Contract** on the **Service Contract Quote** page (if blocked for service contract, or all).
- **Lock Contract**, **Sign Contract**, or **Change Customer** on the **Service Contract** page (if blocked for service contract, or all).
- **Make Order** on the **Service Quote** (if blocked for all).
- **Release to Ship**, **Post** on the **Service Order** (if blocked for all. If service order documents contain multiple service items, and some are blocked and others are not, you can release and post non-blocked lines. Consider whether to turn on the **One Service Item Line/Order** toggle on the **Service Management Setup** page).
- **Post** on the **Service Invoice** page (if blocked for all).

You can also view the blocked service items by applying a filter to the following reports:

- Service Items (report 5935)
- Service Items Out of Warranty (report 5937)
- Service Profit (Service Items) (report 5938)

### Data upgrade

This feature doesn't require additional setup. However, if you upgrade your [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], be aware of the following:

- If you have items, item variants, or item templates where the **Sales Blocked** toggle is turned on, the **Service Blocked** field is also turned on for those records during upgrade. This ensures that the existing sales blocked logic also applies to service management transactions.
- Data upgrades only if you have at least one service item in your company, which means you're using the service management functionality and need the data upgrade. If you don't have service items, the data upgrade is skipped and the **Service Blocked** toggle is turned off by default for all items, item variants, and item templates.

# Design Details: Rounding
Rounding residuals can occur when you value the cost of an inventory decrease that is measured in a different quantity than the corresponding inventory increase. Rounding residuals are calculated for all costing methods when you run the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job.  

 When you use the average costing method, the rounding residual is calculated and recorded on a cumulative, entry-by-entry basis.  

 When you use a costing method other than Average, the rounding residual is calculated when the inventory increase has been fully applied, that is when the remaining quantity for the inventory increase is equal to zero. A separate entry is then created for the rounding residual, and the posting date on this rounding entry is the posting date of the last invoiced value entry of the inventory increase.  

## Example  
 The following example illustrates how different rounding residuals are handled for the average costing method and non-Average costing method, respectively. In both cases, the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job has been run.  

 The following table shows the item ledger entries that the example is based on.  

|Posting Date|Quantity|Entry No.|  
|------------------|--------------|---------------|  
|01-01-20|3|1|  
|02-01-20|-1|2|  
|03-01-20|-1|3|  
|04-01-20|-1|4|  

 For an item using the Average costing method, the rounding residual (1/300) is calculated with the first decrease (entry number 2) and is carried forward to entry number 3. Therefore, entry number 3 is valued at –3.34.  

 The following table shows the resulting value entries.  

|Posting Date|Quantity|Cost Amount (Actual)|Item Ledger Entry No.|Entry No.|  
|------------------|--------------|----------------------------|---------------------------|---------------|  
|01-01-20|3|10|1|1|  
|02-01-20|-1|-3.33|2|2|  
|03-01-20|-1|-3.34|3|3|  
|04-01-20|-1|-3.33|4|4|  

 For an item using a costing method other than Average, the rounding residual (0.01) is calculated when the remaining quantity for the inventory increase is zero. The rounding residual has a separate entry (number 5).  

 The following table shows the resulting value entries.  

|Posting Date|Quantity|Cost Amount (Actual)|Item Ledger Entry No.|Entry No.|  
|------------------|--------------|----------------------------|---------------------------|---------------|  
|01-01-20|3|10|1|1|  
|02-01-20|-1|-3.33|2|2|  
|03-01-20|-1|-3.33|3|3|  
|04-01-20|-1|-3.33|4|4|  
|01-01-20|0|-0.01|1|5|

# Work with Service Contracts and Service Contract Quotes
You can create a service contract either manually or from a service contract quote. You can use a service contract quote as a forerunner of a service contract, in which your company makes an offer to the customer and obtains customer approval before you can convert it to a service contract. The procedures for creating either a service contract or service contract quote are similar.  

## To create a service contract or service contract quote  
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Contracts** or **Service Contract Quotes**,and then choose the related link.  
2. Create a new service contract or service contract quote.  
3. Fill in the **No.** field. A dialog box opens, asking whether you want to fill it with the common data from a contract template. If you want to create such a service contract or service contract quote, choose the **Yes** button. The **Service Contract Template List** page opens.  
4. Select the appropriate template, and then choose **OK** to use it to create the service contract or service contract quote.  
5. In the **Customer No.** field, choose the customer.  
6. If you do not want an annual amount difference to be distributed automatically, choose the **Allow Unbalanced Amounts** check box. The values in the **Annual Amount** and **Calcd. Annual Amount** fields are not automatically equalized. If you want application to do automatically distribute any annual amount difference that might occur from a change in the service contract, leave the **Allow Unbalanced Amounts** check box clear.  
7. Add contract lines to the service contract or service contract quote.  
8. Fill in the rest of the fields as necessary.  

## To convert a service contract quote to service contract  
When a customer has accepted a service contract quote, you convert it to a service contract. At the same time, you can create a service invoice for the starting period of the contract if the starting date of the contract is before the beginning of the next invoice period.

After you complete the following steps, a service contract is created with the status **Signed**. If a service invoice is created for the starting period of the contract, the invoiced amount is calculated in the following way, depending on whether the contract is detailed or not.  

For detailed contracts, the invoiced amount is calculated as follows:  

* Invoiced amount = sum of the invoiced amount for each contract line.  
* Invoiced amount for each contract line = ((quote value ÷ 12) × number of months in the starting period) + ((quote value ÷ number of days in the year) × number of days left in the starting period).  
* If the contract line expires before the starting period ends, the expiration date becomes the ending date of the starting period for the line.  

For contracts that are not detailed, the invoiced amount is calculated as follows:  

* Invoiced amount = (annual amount ÷ number of days in the year) × number of days in the starting period.  
* If the contract expires before the starting period ends, the expiration date becomes the ending date of the starting period.    

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Contract Quotes**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the service contract quote you want to convert to a service contract.  
3. Choose the **Make Contract** action.  
4. If the starting date of the contract is before the beginning of the next invoice period, you are asked if you want to create an invoice for the starting period of the contract. Choose **Yes**.  

 The service invoice is posted to the service account of the contract, even if the contract is prepaid.

## To create contract service credit memos
You can use a contract service credit memo when a customer cancels a prepaid service contract or removes a service item from a prepaid contract. You can also use it to correct an erroneous service invoice.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Credit Memos**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Create a new service credit memo.  
3. Fill in the **No.** field.  
4. In the **Customer No.** field, enter the number of the customer in the service contract.  

     The **Invoicing** FastTab shows information copied from the **Customer** card. If you want to post the credit memo to a different customer than the one specified on the **General** FastTab, enter the number of that customer in the **Bill-to Customer No.** field.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  You can compare the credit memo to the original posted document on the **Posted Service Invoices** page. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Posted Service Invoices**, and then choose the related link.  

5. Fill in the **Posting Date** and **Document Date** fields.  
6. On the credit memo lines, enter information about the items that have been returned or removed, or the allowance that will be sent. You can also use the **Get Prepaid Contract Entries** batch job.  

 To automatically create a credit memo when contract lines are removed from a service contract, on the **Service Contract** page, on the **Invoice Details** FastTab, select the **Automatic Credit Memos** check box.  

 To manually create a credit memo when contract lines are removed from a service contract, on the **Service Contract** page, choose the **Credit Memo** action.  

## Updating and evaluating contracts
Sometimes you have to change the terms of a contract after it has been created. In most cases, you open the relevant contract on the **Service Contract** page, and change it as necessary.  

You can change the status of the contract, initially set to **Locked**, add and remove contract lines, and cancel a contract. If you want to see how your business is doing as measured by gain and loss, you can do quick business analysis using the contract trendscape feature.

## To add a contract line to a service contract or contract quote  
When a customer purchases a new item and wants to include it in the existing service contract or contract quote, you can register the item as a service item and then add it as a new contract line to the contract or contract quote.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Contracts**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the relevant service contract or service contract quote that you want to add a new contract line for.  
3. Choose the **Open Contract** action to open the service contract or service contract quote for editing.  
4. On the **Invoice Details** FastTab, select the **Allow Unbalanced Amounts** field if you want to change the annual amount and distribute the annual amount difference manually on the contract lines. Otherwise, clear the check box in the **Allow Unbalanced Amounts** field. This will distribute the annual amount difference automatically on the contract lines after you change the annual amount.  
5. On the **Lines** FastTab, add a service item or item, or text description, on each contract line. Alternatively, you can add contract quote lines. Note that you can create multiple contracts per service item to have it included in different service contracts or contract quotes at the same time.  
6. Verify and correct the numbers in the **Line Discount %**, **Line Discount Amount**, **Response Time**, **Service Period**, and other fields as needed.

## To remove contract lines  
You may need to remove contract lines from the service contract as you remove corresponding service items from the service contract. Usually you remove a contract line that is expired or corresponds to the service item that has broken down.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Contracts**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the service contract from which you want to remove contract lines.  
3. Choose the **Open Contract** action to open the service contract for editing.  
4. Choose the contract line you want to remove. Fill in the **Contract Expiration Date** field with the date as of which you want to remove the line. For example, you could enter the date when the service item broke down.  
5. Choose the **Remove Contract Lines** action. The **Remove Lines from Contract** page opens.  
6. Fill in the default filters: **Contract No.**, **Service Item No.**, and **Contract Type**. If needed, you can apply more filters or change the existing ones.  
7. Fill in the fields on the **Options** FastTab, and then choose the **Delete Lines** action.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  If the contract is not detailed, you must update the value in the **Annual Amount** field on the **Invoice Details** FastTab on the **Service Contract** page, reflecting the loss of the service item from the contract.  
>   
>  If the contract is detailed and prepaid, and you have posted invoices for the contract, you can create a credit memo for the contract. Choose the **Create Credit Memo** action. This is unnecessary if the check box in the **Automatic Credit Memos** field on the **Invoice Details** FastTab is selected. In that case, a credit memo is created automatically when you remove a contract line.

## Service Line Cost and Value
On a service contract lines, the amounts in the **Line Cost** and **Line Value** are calculated as described in the following tables.

| Line Cost Options | Description|
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
|**Service item** | The cost is automatically retrieved from the **Default Contract Cost** field in the **Service Item** table and copied into the **Line Cost** field. The following formula is used to calculate the line cost:<br /><br /> Sales Unit Cost × Contract Value % ÷ 100|  
|**Item** | The cost is automatically retrieved from the **Unit Cost** field in the **Item** table and the **Contract Value %** field value in the **Service Mgt. Setup** table. The following formula is used to calculate the line cost:<br /><br /> Unit Cost × Contract Value % ÷ 100|  
|**Text description** | The value in the **Line Cost** field is set to zero.|  

| Line Value Options | Description|
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
|**Service item** | The price is automatically retrieved from the **Default Contract Value** field in the **Service Item** table and copied into the **Line Value** field.|  
|**Item** | Depending on the value in the **Contract Value Calc. Method** field in the **Service Mgt. Setup** table, the amount is retrieved from either the **Unit Price** or the **Unit Cost** field in the **Item** table. After that, this value is multiplied by the contents of the **Contract Value %** field in the **Service Mgt. Setup** table and divided by 100. This amount is copied into the **Line Value** field.<br /><br /> **NOTE:** If the **Contract Value Calc. Method** field is set to **None**, the contents of the **Line Value** field are not calculated.|  
|**Text description** | The contents of the **Line Value** field are set to zero.|  

## To add a contract discount to service contract quotes  
You can add contract discounts on services for contract quotes and service contracts. The discounts can be on spare parts in particular service item groups, on resource hours for resources in particular resource groups, and on particular service costs.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Contract Quotes**, and choose the related link.  
2. Choose the quote to add discounts for.  
3. Choose the **Service Discounts** action. The **Contract/Service Discounts** page opens.  
4. To create a new contract discount, choose the **New** action.  
5. Fill in the fields on the line as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)].  

> [!Tip]  
>  To add contract discounts directly to a service contract, perform similar steps from the **Service Contract** page.  

## To change the owner of a service contract  
You may need to change the owner of a service contract. If a service item in a service contract is registered in noncanceled multiple contracts owned by the same customer, then the owner of all service contracts that include this service item and of all other service items included in these contracts is updated automatically.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  In this case, only noncanceled contracts are considered. The status of the contract quotes is not taken into account.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  Service items and contracts can be related. Changing the owner of a service contract can affect these relationships.  
>   
>  For example, suppose service item No. 8 is included in contracts SC00003 and SC00015. Contract SC00015 also contains service item No. 15, which is also included in the contract SC00080. In this case, the owner for all three contracts and service items will be changed.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Contracts**, and then choose the related link. Open the relevant service contract whose owner you want to change.  
2. Choose the **Open Contract** action to open the contract for editing.  
3. Choose the **Change Customer** action. The **Change Customer in Contract** page opens.  
4. In the **Contract No.** and **Service Item No**. fields you can see the numbers of the contract and service item owned by the selected customer. If the customer owns more than one contract with more than one service item included, then the value of these fields will be **Multiple**. To see the list of related contracts or service items, select these field values.  
5. In the **New Customer No.** field, choose the new customer.  
6. In the **New Ship-to Code** field, choose the address.  
7. Choose the **OK** button to change the customer and ship-to code of the service contracts.  
8. Choose the **Lock Contract** action to lock the contract and to make sure that the changes will be part of the contracts.  

## To update a service contract price  
You can update the prices on service contracts by specifying a price update percentage.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Update Service Contract Prices**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the service contract.  
3. In the **Update to Date** field, enter a date. The batch job will update prices for contracts with next price update dates on or before this date.  
4. In the **Price Update %** field, enter the percentage that you want to update the prices by.  
5. In the **Action** field, select **Update Contract Prices**.  

## To post prepaid contract entries  
If you work with prepaid service contracts, you must regularly post prepaid contract entries, thereby transferring the prepaid payments from the prepaid contract accounts to the regular contract accounts.  

Before you can post prepaid contract entries, you must specify a number series in the **Prepaid Posting Document Nos.** field on the **Service Mgt. Setup** page.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Post Prepaid Contract Entries**, and then choose the related link.  
2. In the **Post until Date** field, enter a date. The batch job posts prepaid service ledger entries with posting dates up to this date.  
4. In the **Posting Date** field, enter the date you want to use as the posting date on the general journal line.  
5. In the **Action** field, choose **Post Prepaid Transactions**.  
6. Choose **OK** to post the entries.

## Changing the Service Contract Status
After the service contract is signed, the **Change Status** field value is automatically set to **Locked**. If you want to modify information in the service contract or service contract quote, first you have to change the status of the contract or contract quote from **Locked** to **Open**. Note that you cannot create service invoices for the service contract with the **Open** change status. After the contract or contract quote is modified, you have to change the status back to **Locked** to make it possible to create service invoices and ledger entries for the service contract, which includes the changes that you made to it.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  The **Change Status** field is not related to the **Release Status** field on the service order header, which governs the warehouse handling of service items.  

## To cancel a service contract  
You may need to cancel a service contract when the contract has expired or has been canceled by you or the customer.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  You cannot reopen a contract after it is canceled.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Contracts**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the relevant service contract to cancel.  
3. Choose the **Open Contract** action to open the service contract for editing.  
4. In the **Cancel Reason Code** field, choose the relevant reason code. To add more reason codes, choose the **Advanced** action.  

     If the check box in the **Use Contract Cancel Reason** field on the **Service Mgt. Setup** page is selected, you must specify a cancel reason code when canceling contracts.  

5. In the **Status** field, choose **Canceled**.  
6. If there are unposted invoices, credit memos, or opened prepaid entries for the contract, a confirmation message will appear. In the message box, choose **No** to return to the contract and post the documents, or **Yes** to continue the cancellation process.  

## Filing a service contract or contract quote  
You can file service contracts and contract quotes at any time to record and archive a copy of the contract or contract quote. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] files service contracts automatically when you convert contract quotes to service contracts or cancel service contracts. You can file a contract or quote yourself by choosing the **File Contract** action in the **Service Contracts** or **Service Contract Quotes** pages. If you want to view your archived contracts of quotes by searching for **Filed Contracts**.

# Sales by Location (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Sales by Location** report provides an overview of sales performance at locations. It showcases key metrics such as total sales amount, total quantity sold, and cost of goods sold. You can break down the metrics further by specific items sold at each location.

:::image type="content" source="media/powerbi/sales/sales-by-location.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Sales by Location Power BI report" lightbox="media/powerbi/sales/sales-by-location.png":::

## Use the report

Leadership and management teams use the report to help them track revenue and cost breakdown per location. The report is valuable for any organization that operates across multiple locations.

For COOs of retail companies with multiple warehouse locations, it's important to have a high-level view of the sales performance of each location. The overview can help you make informed decisions about resource allocation and expansion plans. You can quickly view the total revenue generated by each location and identify under-performing locations. This information helps you make better decisions about resource allocation to ensure that the organization is operating efficiently and effectively across all locations.

Regional managers who oversee several warehouse locations can track revenue and cost breakdown per location, identify areas for improvement, and adjust sales strategies. Analyze the total sales amount, quantity sold, cost of goods sold, and gross profit for each location to find out which locations perform well and which ones need improvement.

## Key performance indicators

The report includes the following key performance indicators (KPIs) and measures:

- **[Sales Amount](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#sales-amount)**  
- **[Sales Quantity](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#sales-quantity)**  
- **[Cost Amount](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#cost-amount)**  
- **[Cost Amount Non-Inv](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#cost-amount-non-inv)**  
- **[Gross Profit](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#gross-profit)**  
- **[Gross Profit Margin](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#gross-profit-margin)**

[!INCLUDE[click-on-a-kpi-link](includes/click-on-a-kpi-link.md)] 

[!INCLUDE[powerbi-tip-track-kpis](includes/powerbi-tip-track-kpis.md)]

## Data used in the report

The report uses data from the following tables in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]:

- Location
- Item
- Value Entry
- Sales Line

# Work with accounting periods and fiscal years

Accounting periods, also known as reporting periods, are periods of time for which a company or organization reports financial performance by generating, for example, their income statement or balance sheet. Typically, accounting periods refer to the company's fiscal year, which can contain several accounting periods, such as months or quarters.

For many companies the fiscal year doesn't align with the calendar year, for instance when the fiscal year ends on June 30 rather than December 31. For newly created companies, the fiscal year might even actually be longer than 12 months.  

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] only requires accounting periods if you want to close an income statement, or run data compression tasks.

You can use accounting periods in reporting such as when you're reviewing posted entries on the **Balance/Budget** page where the reporting interval is specified. One of the options you might specify is to report by accounting period. You can also build a financial report that compares results for different accounting periods.

## Creating a new fiscal year

You can create accounting periods in bulk by using the **Create Fiscal Year** batch job, or by doing so manually.

### How to create accounting periods in bulk

Use the **Create Fiscal Year** batch job to divide a fiscal year into periods of equal length.  

1. Choose the ![Search for Page or Report.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Accounting Periods**, then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **Create Year** action.
3. In the **Starting Date** field, enter the date on which the fiscal year starts.  
4. In the **No. of Periods** field, enter the number of accounting periods to divide the fiscal year into. There can be up to 365 periods in a year.  
5. In the **Period Length** field, enter a duration for each period. Duration identifiers include 1M for one month, 1Q for one quarter, and 1Y for one year.  
6. Choose **OK**.  

### How to create accounting periods manually

If the accounting periods in your fiscal year have different durations, such as the 4-4-5 calendar used in retail, you can manually set it up.  
  
1. Choose the ![Search for Page or Report.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Accounting Periods**, then choose the related link.  
2. In the **Starting Date** field, enter the date on which the fiscal year starts. The **Name** field will show the name of the month.  
3. Choose the **New Fiscal Year** check box to indicate that this is the first period in the year. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will use this period to determine which periods to close at year-end.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for each remaining period.  

## Closing a fiscal year

Closing the fiscal year is one of the tasks for closing the books. After you close a fiscal year, the **Closed** and **Date Locked** check boxes are selected for all periods in the year. You can't reopen a year or clear the check boxes.

> [!NOTE]  
> You must always have at least one open fiscal year. When closing a year, ensure that a new year has been created. Also, note that after you close one year, you cannot change the starting date of the following year.

1. Choose the ![Search for Page or Report.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Accounting Periods**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **Close Year** action.  

## Posting entries to a closed fiscal year

Although a fiscal year is closed, you can still post general ledger entries to it. When you do, the entries are marked as posted to a closed fiscal year and the **Prior Year Entry** check box is selected. By default, the check box isn't displayed on the page, but you can add it. The next steps are to close the income statement accounts and transfer the year's results to an account in the balance sheet. Repeat these steps each time you post entries to a closed fiscal year.

# Setting up service management
Before you can start using Service Management features in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], there are a few things to set up. For example, you can establish coding for standard services, symptoms, and fault codes, and the service items and service item types based on your company’s customer service requirements.  

When you set up Service Management, you must decide what services to offer customers and the schedule for those services. A service is a type of work performed by one or more resources and provided to a customer. For example, a service could be a type of computer repair. A service item is the equipment or item needing servicing, for example, the computer needing repair, installed at a specific customer. You can set up services as part of a group of related repair or maintenance items.  
  
When you define a service, you can associate it with the skills required to perform the service. To help your service representatives be efficient, you can also set up real time troubleshooting guidelines and assign typical startup costs, such as travel costs or other fees.  

The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the articles that describe them.

# Analyze data by dimensions

In financial analysis, a dimension is data you add to an entry as a kind of marker to group entries with similar characteristics. For example, dimensions often group entries for customers, regions, products, and salespeople. The groups let you easily retrieve data about them for analysis. You can use dimensions on entries in journals, documents, and budgets.

Each dimension describes the focus of analysis. So, a two-dimensional analysis, for example, would be sales per area. By using more than two dimensions when you create an entry, you can carry out a more complex analysis. An example of a complex analysis is exploring sales per sales campaign per customer group per area. That gives you greater insight into your business, such as how well your business is operating, where it is or isn't thriving, and where you should allocate more resources. That insight helps you make more informed business decisions. Learn more at [Work with Dimensions](finance-dimensions.md).

> [!TIP]
> As a quick way to analyze transactional data by dimensions, you can filter totals in the chart of accounts (COA) and entries in all **Entries** pages by dimensions. Look for the **Set Dimension Filter** action.

> [!NOTE]
> If you discover that an incorrect dimension value was used on posted general ledger entries, you can correct it and update your analysis views. To learn more, go to [Troubleshooting and Correcting Dimensions](finance-troubleshooting-correcting-dimensions.md#changing-dimension-assignments-after-posting).

## Set up an analysis view

An analysis by dimensions uses a selected combination of dimensions. You store, retrieve, and update that dimension set by creating an **Analysis View** card.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Analysis Views**, then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Analysis View List** page, choose the **New** action.
3. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
4. To add other dimension codes in addition to the four on the **Dimensions** FastTab, choose the **Filter** action, fill in the fields, then choose the **OK** button.  
5. To update the view, choose the **Update** action.

## Analyze by dimensions

Use analysis views you've already set up with the **Analysis by Dimensions** matrix to view the amounts in your general ledger.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Analysis Views**, then choose the related link.  
2. Select the relevant analysis view, then choose the **Analysis by Dimensions** action.
3. On the **Analysis by Dimensions** page, fill in the fields to define what data to show, and how.
4. Choose the **Show Matrix** action to open the matrix page for the analysis view.
5. To access details of an amount in the matrix page, choose the amount.  

- The columns on the left contain information based on what you've selected in the **Show as Lines** field in the header.  
- The columns on the right contain information based on what you've selected in the **Show as Columns** field in the header.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> You can't select a period length that's shorter than the period specified for the date compression on the **Analysis View** card. The **Next Set** and **Previous Set** actions aren't available if you've selected **Period** in either the **Show as Lines** or **Show as Columns** fields.  

> [!NOTE]  
> You can use the **Dimensions - Detail** report to display a detailed classification of how dimensions have been used on entries over a selected period. You can use the **Dimensions - Total** report to display only the total amounts.  

> [!TIP]  
> You can also change the view by changing the contents of the **Show as Lines** and **Show as Columns** fields. To reverse a view setting, choose the **Reverse Lines and Columns** action.

## Update an analysis view

The amounts on the **Analysis by Dimensions** page give you a picture of the company's state at the time of the last update. To get the current state, run the update action to update the analysis view.

Use the following procedure to update an analysis view from the **Analysis by Dimensions** page. The steps are similar to those for updating the **Analysis View Card** and **Analysis View List** pages.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Analysis Views**, then choose the related link.
2. Select the relevant analysis view, then choose the **Analysis by Dimensions** action.
3. On the **Analysis by Dimensions** page, choose the **Analysis View Code** field.  
4. Select the line with the relevant analysis view.  
5. On the **Analysis Views** page, select the analysis view, then choose the **Update** action.  

> [!TIP]  
> If you select the **Update on Posting** checkbox on an analysis view card, the view automatically updates when someone posts an associated transaction.

> [!NOTE]  
> To update some or all analysis views at the same time, use the **Update Analysis Views** batch job.

# The VAT Group Management extension for the United Kingdom

[!INCLUDE[azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id](~/../shared-content/shared/azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id.md)]

You can connect one or more businesses in the United Kingdom to combine value-added tax (VAT) reporting under a single registration number. This type of arrangement is known as a *VAT group*. You can engage with the group as a member or as the group representative.

## Forming a VAT group

VAT group members and the group representative can use the **Set Up VAT Group Management** assisted setup guide to both define their engagement with the group and create a connection between their [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] tenants. The group members use this connection to submit their VAT returns to the group representative. The group representative then uses a single VAT return to submit the group's VAT to tax authorities.

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports intra-group VAT return submissions for companies using [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises or online, in any combination, which influences the communication setup between businesses. This article describes various group setups.

### License requirements

Participants in the group must be licensed to use [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. You can't use guest accounts in VAT groups.

* To calculate and submit VAT returns, a user must be a full [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] user.
* To sign in and do basic tasks, such as create accounts, you need a [!INCLUDE[prod_long](includes/prod_long.md)] Team Member license.

## Set up a VAT group

The following is the recommended order of steps an administrator uses to set up a VAT group:

1. Create the setup in [Microsoft Entra ID setup for group members](#microsoft-entra-id-setup-for-group-members).
2. Share the technical information VAT group members and the group representative need to connect their [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] tenants. Usually, the group representative has this information, such as the [API URL](#group-api-setup) and the name of the VAT group representative's environment the VAT group members submit their VAT data to.
3. Create users that VAT group members use to authenticate when they connect to the VAT group representative's [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The users must have full user licenses for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].
4. Run the **Set Up VAT Group Management** assisted setup guide to connect the VAT group members.

   The VAT group representative must supply certain information to group members to complete their setup. (Learn more in the [Set up VAT group members](#set-up-vat-group-members) section below.) Make a note of the **Group Member ID** for each VAT group member. The group representative needs these IDs to add the companies to the VAT group.
5. Set up the VAT group management extension in the VAT group representative's [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] using the **Set Up VAT Group Management** assisted setup guide.

> [!NOTE]
> To connect to the VAT group representative, group members must have a user account that can access the VAT group representative's [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The VAT group representative must create at least one user for this. However, for security reasons we recommended that they create a user for each VAT group member, which can be a system user account that is not related to an actual person. Make sure to distribute the user credentials to VAT group members in a secure way.

### Microsoft Entra ID setup for group members

When the VAT group representative is using [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online or on-premises, VAT group members must use Microsoft Entra ID to authenticate users when they submit VAT returns to the VAT group representative. For [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, members must configure single sign-on. Learn more at [Configure Microsoft Entra authentication with WS-Federation](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/authenticating-users-with-azure-active-directory?tabs=singletenant%2Cadmintool).

If the VAT group members are also using [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, the member can authenticate with the designated user credentials and the sign-in information provided by the group representative. Learn more in the [Set up VAT group members](#set-up-vat-group-members) section below.

VAT group members who have [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises must set up an app registration in Microsoft Entra ID for the VAT group representative's [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] tenant. The app registration enables the VAT group representative's [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online to authenticate the group member. Learn more at [Quickstart: Register an application with the Microsoft identity platform](/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app).

When the VAT group member's administrator creates the app registration in Microsoft Entra ID, they must specify the following information.

* In the **Authentication** section, add **Web** as a platform, and use the following **Redirect URL**: `https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/OAuthLanding.htm`.
* In the **Authentication** section, in the option to select **Supported account types**, select **Accounts in any organizational directory (Any Microsoft Entra directory - Multitenant)**.
* In the **Certificates & secrets** section, create a new client secret and note the value. The VAT group members need the secret when they set up the connection to the group representative.
* In the **API permissions** section, add permissions to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Enable delegated access to **Financials.ReadWrite.All** and **user_impersonation**.
* In the **Overview** section, note the **Application (client) ID**. The VAT group members need the ID when they set up the connection to the group representative.

### Group API setup

The VAT group representative creates and supplies an API to group members. The members use this API to connect to the representative's [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] tenant and submit VAT returns. VAT group members often use [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in separate Microsoft Entra tenants. For that reason, setup is needed to connect the VAT group member and the representative's [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

> [!NOTE]
> This setup requires credentials for an administrator account that has a full user license for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

1. In the Business Central admin center for the representative's tenant, choose the **Environments** tab.
1. Choose the representative's environment.
1. In the **Details** section, copy the **URL**.
1. Open Notepad, and paste the URL. Replace `https://businesscentral.dynamics.com` with `https://api.businesscentral.dynamics.com/v2.0`.

## Set up VAT group members

VAT group members connect to the representative by calling a web service on the VAT group representative's tenant. The caller must be authenticated using OAuth2. When the VAT group management extension is set up, members are asked to authenticate to the VAT group representative, during which an access token is generated and saved. This access token is used when submitting VAT returns to the VAT group representative.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The member companies in the VAT group do not need to connect to HMRC because they report through the group's representative.

Before VAT group members start their setup (listed below), they need to contact the VAT group representative for the following information about their [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] tenant:

* The API URL
* The name of their company
* Sign in credentials for the dedicated user

1. In the top right corner, choose the **Settings** ![Settings.](media/ui-experience/settings_icon_small.png "Settings icon for role center") icon, then choose the **Assisted setup** action.
2. Choose the **Set Up VAT Group Management** action.
3. In the **VAT Group Role** field, choose **Member** then **Next**.
4. Copy the value of the **Group Member ID** field, and then share it with the VAT group representative so they can add your company as an approved member of the group.
5. In the **Group Representative Product Version** field, specify the version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] the representative is using.
6. In the **API URL** field, enter the API URL provided by the VAT group representative. Typically, the URL is formatted as follows: `https://api.businesscentral.dynamics.com/v2.0/[TENANT-ID]/[ENVIRONMENTNAME]`. For example, `https://api.businesscentral.dynamics.com/v2.0/aaaabbbb-0000-cccc-1111-dddd2222eeee/UKRepresentative`.
7. In the **Group Representative Company** field, enter the company name of the VAT group representative, such as, **CRONUS UK Ltd**.
8. In the **Authentication Type** field, choose **OAuth2**. If the VAT group representative is using [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, enable the **Group Representative Uses Business Central Online** toggle, and then choose **Next**.

   Then, follow the steps in either the [VAT Group Representative uses Business Central online](ui-extensions-vat-group.md#vat-group-representative-uses-business-central-online) or [VAT Group Representative uses Business Central on-premises](ui-extensions-vat-group.md#vat-group-representative-uses-business-central-on-premises) section below.

### VAT group representative uses Business Central online

1. Enter the user credentials provided by the VAT group representative, and add the required permissions to generate the access token.
2. Choose the VAT report configuration you use to submit VAT returns to the UK tax authorities. 

After you complete the setup, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will create a new configuration based on this choice that enables you to submit VAT returns to the VAT group representative.

### VAT group representative uses Business Central on-premises

1. Enter the user credentials provided by the VAT group representative and choose **Next**.
2. In the **Client ID** field, specify the client ID from the app registration in [Microsoft Entra ID setup for group members](#microsoft-entra-id-setup-for-group-members).
3. In the **Client Secret** field, specify the client secret from the app registration in Microsoft Entra ID.
4. In the **OAuth 2.0 Authority Endpoint** field, enter `https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2`.
5. In the **OAuth 2.0 Resource URL** field, enter `https://api.businesscentral.dynamics.com/`.
6. In the **OAuth 2.0 Redirect URL** field, enter `https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/OAuthLanding.htm`.
7. When you've specified the various fields, choose **Next**, and then confirm the authentication connection to generate the access token.
8. Choose the VAT report configuration you use to submit VAT returns to the UK tax authorities.

## Set up the VAT group representative

> [!NOTE]
> For on-premises, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports only a single tenant instance of the group representative.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The representative company must enable the **HMRC VAT Setup** service connection on the **Service Connections** page. Representatives must also download VAT return periods from HMRC.

1. In the top right corner, choose the **Settings** icon ![Settings.](media/ui-experience/settings_icon_small.png "Settings icon for role center"), and then choose the **Assisted setup** action.
2. Choose the **Set Up VAT Group Management** action.
3. In the **VAT Group Role** field, choose **Representative** to act as the VAT group representative, then choose **Next**.
4. In the **Group Settlement Account** field, specify the settlement account used for the group member VAT tax amounts. This account should have **Assets** as the **Account Category**.
5. In the **VAT Settlement Account** field, specify the account you use for VAT settlements. This account should have **Liabilities** as the **Account Category**.
6. In the **VAT Due Box No.** field, specify the box that represents the total VAT amount due from a VAT group submission.
7. In the **Group Settlement General Journal Template** field, specify the general journal template used to create the document with which the group representative posts the group VAT to the settlement account.
8. The **Approved Members** field shows the number of group members set up to submit VAT returns to the group representative. To add new members, choose the number to open the **VAT Group Approved Members** page and add the following information:
    1. In the **Group Member ID** field, enter an identifier for the group member, as displayed during the group member setup (learn more in the [VAT group member setup](#set-up-vat-group-members) section above).
    2. In the **Group Member Name** field, specify the name of the group member.
    3. In the **Company** field, specify the company from which the group member submits VAT returns in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], such as, **CRONUS UK Ltd**.
    4. Specify contact details for the company.

## Use the VAT group management features

VAT group members use the standard processes to prepare VAT returns. The only difference is members must choose the **VATGROUP** report version in the **VAT Return** page to submit the VAT return to the VAT group representative rather than the authorities. Learn more at [About the VAT Return report](finance-how-report-vat.md#vatreturn).

> [!NOTE]
> VAT group members can correct submitted VAT returns as long as the group representative has not released the VAT return for the group. To make a correction, the VAT group member must create a new VAT return for the VAT return period and submit it to the VAT group representative. On the VAT group representative's side, the member's latest VAT return replaces the previous and is included on the **VAT Returns** page.

The following sections describe the tasks that VAT group representatives must do to file the group VAT return.

### Review VAT member submissions

The **VAT Group Submissions** page lists the VAT returns that members have submitted. The page serves as a draft location for the submissions until the VAT group representative includes them in a VAT return for the group. The representative can open the submissions to review the individual boxes containing the amount reported by each VAT group member.

> [!TIP]
> On the **VAT Return Periods** page, the **Group Member Submissions** field shows how many returns members have submitted. To ensure that this number is up to date, choose the **Get VAT Returns** action.

### Create a group VAT return

To report VAT for the group, on the **VAT Returns** page, create a VAT return for your company only. Afterward, include the most recent VAT submissions from VAT group members by choosing the **Include Group VAT** action.  

When the group representative has submitted the group's VAT return to the authorities, the representative then normally runs the **Calculate and Post VAT Settlement** action. This action closes open VAT Entries and transfers amounts to the VAT settlement account. Currently, this action doesn't take the group submissions into account. Only the VAT entries of the VAT group representative company are posted. The VAT group member submission amounts must be posted using the **Post Group VAT Settlement** action.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The VAT group functionality is only supported in those markets where [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses a VAT framework that consists of VAT returns and VAT return periods. You cannot use VAT groups in markets with other implementations of local VAT reporting, such as Austria, Germany, Italy, Spain, and Switzerland.

## Issue with enabling Multifactor Authentication (MFA)

If you get an error message related to authorization during the renewal of the **OAuth2 Token** on the **VAT Report Setup** page after you enable MFA, complete the following steps.  

1. Sign in to the **Azure Portal** as an Authentication Administrator.  
2. Go to the **Microsoft Entra ID**.   
3. Browse to **Users**, and then select the user you want to perform an action.  
4. Select the **Authentication methods** and at the top of the page, select **Require re-register multifactor authentication**. 
5. Go back to Dynamics 365 Business Central and select to renew the token from the **VAT Report Setup**.  

This should be a onetime setup after you enable multifactor authentication for the user selected in **VAT Report Setup**.

# Analyze Data with Statistical Accounts

Use statistical accounts to supplement information in financial reports. Statistical accounts let you add metrics that are based on non-transactional data. You add the non-transactional data as number-based units, such as:

* Employee headcount
* Square footage
* The number of customers with overdue accounts

For example, you can measure revenue or costs based on the number of people in a department. The headcount for the department is the unit for the statistical account. The following image shows an example of a report that uses a statistical account to show revenue per employee.

:::image type="content" source="media/statistical account report example.png" alt-text="An example of a report that includes data from a statistical account.":::

In terms of how they work, statistical accounts are similar to posting accounts. They store transactions that you post using statistical account journals, so that you can use the transactions as data for financial reports. To learn more about financial reports, go to [Prepare Financial Reporting with Financial Data and Account Categories](bi-how-work-account-schedule.md). 

There are a couple of key differences between statistical accounts and posting accounts. Statistical accounts are separate entities, and aren't included in trial balance reports. Also, you don't need to balance debit and credit amounts when you use statistical account journals to post entries to a statistical account. You just post the amount.

## Set up a statistical account

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Statistical Accounts**, then choose the related link.
1. On the **General** FastTab, fill in the fields. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

## Post amounts to a statistical account

1. To post the amounts you want to track, on the **Statistical Accounts** page, choose the **Statistical Accounts Journal** action.
1. In the **Posting date** field, enter the last date of the posting period that you want to post amounts for.
1. Optional: If you want to track amounts for a specific document, in the **Document No.** field, enter the document's ID.
1. In the **Statistical Account No.** field, choose the statistical account that you'll post amounts to.
1. In the **Description** field, enter a brief description of what you're measuring.  
1. In the **Amount** field, enter the amount to post. 
1. Optional: If you'll want to include the statistical account in more advanced analyses, specify dimensions in the **Department Code** and **Customergroup Code** fields. To learn more about dimensions, go to [Analyze Data by Dimensions](bi-how-analyze-data-dimension.md).

## Verify statistical account amounts

On the **Statistical Accounts** page, use the **Statistical Accounts Balance** action to verify that the registered amounts are correct for each period.  

## Include the statistical account in a financial report

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Financial Reports**, then choose the related link.
1. Create a new financial report in one of the following ways:
    1. To start from scratch, choose **New**. To learn more about creating financial reports, go to [Create a new financial report](bi-how-work-account-schedule.md#create-a-new-financial-report).
    1. To use settings from a similar report you already have, choose the report to copy, and then choose the **Copy Financial Report** action. You can edit the settings you copy in your new report.
1. Add the statistical account:
    1. If you're starting from scratch, choose the **Edit Row Definition** action.
    1. To use a row definition from an existing report, choose the report to copy from, and then choose the **Copy Row Definition** action.
1. On the **Row Definition** page, in the **Row No.** field, define where the row will appear in the sequence of rows on the report.
1. In the **Description** field, enter text that indicates what you're measuring.
1. In the **Totaling Type** field, choose **Statistical Accounts**.
1. In the **Totaling** field, choose a statistical account.
1. In the **Row Type** field, choose whether to view the balance on the posting date or the beginning of the posting period, or to show the change to the amount during the period.
1. Fill in the remaining fields. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

# Design Details: Posting Engine Structure
Posting interface and some other functions in codeunit 12 use posting engine functions to prepare and insert general ledger entry and VAT entry records. The posting engine is also responsible for general ledger register creation.  
  
 The functions in the following table provide a standard framework for designing posting procedures (such as Code, CustPostApplyCustledgEntry, VendPostApplyVendLedgEntry, UnapplyCustLedgEntry, UnapplyVendLedgEntry, and Reverse) and exclusive access to table 17, G/L Entry.  
  
|Routine|Description|  
|-------------|---------------------------------------|  
|StartPosting|Initializes posting buffer TempGLEntryBuf, locks G/L Entry and VAT Entry tables, and initializes Accounting Period, G/L Register, and Exchange Rate. Should be called only once, then NextEntryNo is 0.|  
|ContinuePosting|Checks and posts unrealized VAT for previous transaction increment NextTransactionNo and prepares post of next line.|  
|FinishPosting|Completes posting by inserting G/L entries from temporary buffer into database table. Always used together with StartPosting. Checks for inconsistencies.|  
|InitGLEntry|Used to initialize new G/L entry for Gen. Jnl Line. Returns GLEntry as parameter.|  
|InitGLEntryVAT|Same as InitGLEntry, but also assigns Bal. Account No. and SummarizeVAT.|  
|InitGLEntryVATCopy|Similar to InitGLEntryVAT, but also copies posting groups data from VAT Entry before SummarizeVAT.|  
|InsertGLEntry|The only function that inserts G/L entry into global TempGLEntryBuf table. Always use this function for insert.|  
|CreateGLEntry|Performs an InitGLEntry, assigns Additional Currency Amount, and then performs InsertGLEntry. Replaces several lines of code with a single function call.|  
|CreateGLEntryBalAcc|Same as CreateGLEntry, but also assigns Bal. Account Type and Bal. Account No.|  
|CreateGLEntryVAT|Same as CreateGLEntry, but with additional processing for posting groups and saving to temporary VAT buffer:<br /><br /> `GLEntry.CopyPostingGroupsFromDtldCVBuf(DtldCVLedgEntryBuf,GenJnlLine."Gen. Posting Type");`<br /><br /> `InsertVATEntriesFromTemp(DtldCVLedgEntryBuf,GLEntry);`|  
|CreateGLEntryVATCollectAdj|Same as CreateGLEntry, but with additional collection of adjustments and saving to temporary VAT buffer:<br /><br /> `CollectAdjustment(AdjAmount,GLEntry.Amount,GLEntry."Additional-Currency Amount",OriginalDateSet);`<br /><br /> `InsertVATEntriesFromTemp(DtldCVLedgEntryBuf,GLEntry);`|  
|CreateGLEntryFromVATEntry|Same as CreateGLEntry, but also copies posting groups from VAT entry.|

# Convert service contracts that include VAT amounts

Because the VAT rate change tool can't convert service contracts, these contracts must be converted manually. This article describes several alternative methods that you can use for service contract conversion.  

> [!NOTE]  
> This article provides a high-level workflow.  

 The following procedure describes how to correct an invoice for a prepaid service contract that has been created a year in advance.  

> [!NOTE]  
> For this example, you must change your work date to 01.01.2017.  

## To correct an invoice for a prepaid service contract  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Contract Management**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Under **Lists**, choose **Service Contracts**.  
3. Create a new prepaid service contract. Enter a start date of **01.01.2017** and an invoice period year for customer **20000**.  
4. To sign the contract, choose the **Sign Contract** action.  
5. Create a service invoice.
6. The invoice is listed as an unposted service invoice. To view the service invoice, choose the **Service** action, choose the **Contract Management** action, and then choose the **Service Invoices** action.  
7. Post the service invoice.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Don't change the unposted service invoice. Since the service ledger entries are created when the invoice is created, a change in the unposted invoice will not change the already created service ledger entries. However, the VAT entries are created when the invoice is posted. This lets you change the general product posting group and the GSP product posting group on the unposted service invoice.  

### To create a credit memo for VAT difference 
 
The following procedure describes how to create a credit memo that only includes the VAT difference for the already invoiced period starting on **01.07.2017**. In this example, the VAT amount is only posted to the Financial Management module, not to the Service Management module. The VAT entries that are linked to the service ledger entry won't be corrected.  

1. Create a new general ledger account for the VAT difference. This account is used for direct posting of the VAT correction.  
2. Add a new line to the VAT posting setup.  

## To create contract expiration dates in contract lines  

The following procedure describes how to create new contracts by working with contract expiration dates in service contract lines.  

1. On the **Service Contract** page, set the contract expiration date to **30.06.2017**.  
2. Choose the **Create Credit Memo** action to automatically create a credit memo for July 2017 to December 2017.  
3. Because the contract has expired, you need to create a new contract for the period with the new VAT rate for July 1, 2017 to December 31, 2017.  

### To create a new credit memo  

The following procedure describes how to create a new credit memo using the **Get Prepaid Contract Entries** batch job. Entries that you don't want to correct from January 2017 to June 2017 will be deleted.  

1. Run the VAT rate change tool on July 1, 2017. The general product posting group or the VAT product posting group is changed. For more information, see [Work with VAT on Sales and Purchases](finance-work-with-vat.md).  
2. After running the VAT rate change tool, enter a contract expiration date for the service contract. You can now delete the service contract line and create a new line that is identical to the old one.  
3. Create a new invoice for the period of January 2017 to December 2012 using the new VAT rate.  
4. To create another credit memo, on the **Service Credit Memos** page, choose the **New** action to create a new service credit memo.  
5. Choose the **Get Prepaid Contract Entries** action.  
6. After the conversion is complete, VAT and service ledger entries will be correct.

# Replan or refresh production orders directly

The **Replan** action on production orders is typically used after you add or change components that constitute underlying production orders. The action calculates changes made to components and routings lines, and includes items on lower production BOM levels for which it might generate new production orders.  

Based on the changes to the components and routing lines, the **Replan** action calculates and plans for any new demand for the production order.  

The **Refresh** action on production orders is typically used after you:

- Create a production order header manually to calculate and create line data for the first time.
- Change the production order header to recalculate all the line data.

The **Refresh** action calculates changes to a production order header and doesn't involve production BOM levels. The action calculates and initiates the values of the component lines and routing lines based on the production BOM and routing. The calculation is according to the order quantity and due date on the production order’s header.

You can either insert the production order lines manually or use the action that calculates the production order lines from the header.  

> [!NOTE]
> If you use the **Refresh** action to recalculate production order lines, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] deletes the existing production order lines and calculates new lines.
> Even if the **Lines** option is disabled, non-top-level lines in a Make-to-order environment are deleted. Use the **Replan** action to restore them.

## To replan a production order

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Firm Planned Prod. Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the production order you want to replan.  
3. On the **Lines** FastTab, choose the **Lines** action, and then choose the **Components** action.  
4. Add a component that is a produced item or subassembly.  
5. From the production order, choose the **Replan** action.  

    On the **Replan Production Order** page, define how and what to replan.  
6. In the **Scheduling Direction** field, select one of the options in the following table.  

    | Option | Description |
    |--|--|
    | **Back** | Calculates the operation sequence backwards from the earliest possible ending date, defined by due date and/or other scheduled orders, to the latest possible starting date. **Note:**  This default option is relevant in most situations. |
    | **Forward** | Calculates the operation sequence forward from the earliest latest possible starting date, defined by due date and/or other scheduled orders, to the earliest possible ending date. **Note:**  This option is only relevant for expedite orders. |

7. In the **Plan** field, select whether to calculate production requirements for produced items on the production BOM. The following table describes the options.  

    |Option|Description|  
    |----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**No Levels**|Don't consider lower level production. This setting only updates the item’s schedule, like refresh.|  
    |**One Level**|Plan for first-level production demand. First-level production orders might be created.|  
    |**All Levels**|Plan for all-level production demand. All-level production orders might be created.|  

8. Select **One Level**, and choose the **OK** button to replan the production order and calculate and create a new underlying production order for the introduced subassembly if it isn't fully available.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Changes implemented with the **Replan** action probably change the capacity need of the production order. You might have to reschedule operations afterwards.  

## To refresh a production order

If you change production order lines, components, or routing lines, you must also refresh the information on the production order. In the following procedure, the components are calculated for a firm planned production order. The steps are similar for routing lines.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 2.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Firm Planned Prod. Order**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action. To learn more, go to [Create Production orders](production-how-to-create-production-orders.md).  
3. Choose the **Refresh** action.
4. On the **Refresh Production Order** page, select one of the options in the following table.

    |Field|Option|Description|  
    |----------------------------------|---------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Scheduling Direction**|**Forward**|Scheduling starts from the starting date and proceeds forward to the finishing date. You must fill in the starting date to use this option.|  
    ||**Backward**|Scheduling starts from the ending date and proceeds backward to the starting date.|  
    |**Calculate**|**Lines**|Select this field to calculate the production order lines.|  
    ||**Routings**|This field doesn't affect the calculations on production lines.|  
    ||**Component Need**|This field doesn't affect the calculations on production lines.|  
    |**Warehouse**|**Create Inbound Request**|This field doesn't affect the calculations on production lines.|  

5. Choose the **OK** button to confirm your selection. The production order lines are calculated.

> [!NOTE]  
> Calculating production order components deletes previous changes in the components.

## Reschedule production orders within a safety lead time

If you discover that you need the supply before the due date that planning set, you can manually reschedule the production order. To do that, you must turn on the **Manual Scheduling** toggle on the **Manufacturing Setup** page. If needed, in the **Safety Lead Time for Manual Scheduling** field, you can also specify an amount of buffer time to add to the end date when you manually reschedule a production order. You can move the due date to the current date or a future date, or change the end date directly by changing the starting date.

# Analyze cash flow in your company
The charts on the Accountant Role Center provide insights that can help you make solid decisions about what to do with your cash.  

| To answer questions like these | Use this chart |
| --- | --- |
| How long does the sales process tie up my cash?</br> Should I increase or reduce inventory levels? |Cash Cycle |
| When did cash move in and out of my company?</br> Are some periods better than others? |Cash Flow |
| Do the numbers seem off for a period?</br> Should I investigate? |Income & Expense |
| When might a cash surplus or deficit happens?</br> Should I pay down debt, or borrow to meet upcoming expenses? |Cash Flow Forecasts |

On the Accountant Role Center, under **Finance Performance**, the **Cash Cycle**, **Cash Flow**, and **Income & Expense** charts offer ways to analyze cash flow:  

* See figures for a period by using the timeline slider.  
* Filter the chart by choosing the source in the legend.  
* Change the length of the period, or go to the previous or next period, by choosing options on the **Finance Performance** drop down.  
* View the entries by choosing a point in the chart. For example, a point on the timeline or a column segment. If the numbers seem off, this is where you can make adjustments.  

Although it's separate, the **Cash Flow Forecast** chart is similar. You view details, filter results, and change what is displayed in the same ways. If you change a setting, you can refresh the forecast by choosing **Cash Flow Forecast**, and then **Recalculate Forecast**.

If you want to examine the forecast, in addition to forecast entries, you can also look at the cash flow worksheet. For example, you can see how the forecast:

* Handles confirmed sales and purchases.  
* Subtracts payables and adds receivables.  
* Skips duplicate sales orders and purchase orders.  

## To view a cash flow worksheet

1. Search for **Cash Flow Forecasts**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose a cash flow forecast, and then choose the **Cash Flow Worksheet** action.  
3. On the **Cash Flow Worksheet** page, choose the **Suggest Worksheet Lines** action.

# Combine shipments on a single invoice

You can manually or automatically combine shipments from sales or service orders in a single sales or service invoice.  

Before you can create a combined shipment, you must post, but not invoice, more than one sales or service shipments for the same customer in the same currency.

> [!NOTE]
> The procedures in this article describe how to combine shipments in a sales invoice. The steps are the same for service invoices. Just replace the word "sales" with "service."

## To manually combine shipments on a single invoice

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Invoices**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action, and then fill in the fields as necessary. To learn more, go to [Invoice Sales](sales-how-invoice-sales.md) or [Create service invoices or credit memos](service-how-create-invoices.md).
3. In the **Sell-to Customer No.** field, enter the customer to invoice for the shipped items.  
4. On the **Lines** FastTab, choose the **Get Shipment Lines** action.  
5. Select the shipment line that you want to include in the invoice:  

    - To insert all lines, select all lines and choose the **OK** button.  
    - To insert specific lines, select the lines and choose the **OK** button. You can use the Ctrl key to select multiple nonsequential lines.  

    If an incorrect shipment line was selected or you want to start over, you can delete the lines on the invoice and rerun the **Get Shipment Lines** action.  
6. To post the invoice, choose the **Post** action.  

> [!TIP]  
> If you shipped orders where the **Sell-to Customer No.** is different from the **Bill-to Customer No.**, those lines don't display in the **Get Shipment Lines** report. Use personalization to add the **Sell-to Customer** field to the page and remove the filter. Now you can add shipment lines to the invoice regardless of the value in the **Sell-to Customer No.** field, as long as the **Bill-to Customer No.** field on the shipment lines matches the value on the sales invoice.  

## To automatically combine shipments on a single invoice

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] selects only sales orders where **Combine Shipments** is chosen.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Combine Shipments**, and then choose the related link. The batch job request page opens.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
3. Choose the **Post Invoices** checkbox.  
4. Choose the **OK** button.  

> [!NOTE]  
> You must manually post the invoices if the **Post Invoices** checkbox wasn't selected on the batch job.  

## To remove open sales orders after combined shipment posting

When you combine and post shipments on an invoice, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates a posted sales or service invoice for the invoiced lines. The **Quantity Invoiced** field on the original order updates based on the invoiced quantity. The orders from which you post the shipments still exist, even if they're fully shipped and invoiced.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Delete Invoiced Sales Orders**, and then select the link.  
2. Specify in the **No.** filter field which sales orders to delete.  
3. Choose the **OK** button.  

Alternatively, delete individual sales or service orders manually.  

Repeat steps 1 through 3 for other affected documents, such as blanket sales orders.

# The Troubleshooting FA Ledger Entries Extension
Use the Troubleshooting FA Ledger Entries extension to round depreciation and acquisition amounts in fixed asset ledger entries to whole numbers. For example, to round an amount of 30,000.44 to 30,000. Typical causes of rounding issues are data migration, suddenly starting to post amounts to the general ledger, or customizations you've made to your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

The Troubleshooting FA Ledger Entries extension is pre-installed and ready to go. If you remove the extension, but want to install it again, you can find it on AppSource.

## Troubleshooting Fixed Asset Ledger Entries
When you open the **Fixed Asset Card** page for the first time, the **FA Ledger Entries Scan** job queue entry is scheduled to monitor amounts every Sunday. If it finds amounts that you might want to round, a notification will display the next time you open the Fixed Asset Card page. The notification provides a **See more** option that opens the **FA Ledger Entries with Rounding Issues** page, which lists the entries with amounts that you might want to round. To round the amounts, choose the entries, and then choose the **Accept Selection** action. You can use the **Find entries with issues** action to update the list with new issues that occurred after the job queue entry ran on the previous Sunday.

# Set up time sheets

Time sheets in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] handle time registration in weekly increments of seven days. You can use them to track the time used on projects, and you can use them to record simple resource time registration. Before you use time sheets, you must specify which users will submit time sheets and how you want to configure time sheets.  

> [!TIP]
> The people who use time sheets are *resources*. For example, that lets you use time sheets to track the work of non-employees. To track the work of employees, or to use time sheets to track employee absence, you must associate employees with resources. There's an assisted setup guide that can help you do that. To learn about the guide, go to [Set up time sheets with the assisted setup guide](#set-up-time-sheets-with-the-assisted-setup-guide).  

Optionally, specify whether and how time sheets are approved. Depending on the needs of your organization, you can designate:

* One or more users as the time sheet administrator and approver for all time sheets.
* A time sheet approver for each resource.

When you have set up time sheets, you can create time sheets for resources, and the resources can post time sheet lines. Optionally, assign time sheets to project planning lines. To learn more, go to [Use Time Sheets](projects-how-use-time-sheets.md).  

## Set up time sheets with the assisted setup guide

An assisted setup guide can help you set up time sheets.  

> [!TIP]
> If you're a version earlier than 2023 release wave 1 (v22), you must enable the **Feature Update: New time sheet experience** feature in the [Feature Management](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=2610) page to use this capability.
>
> This setting also lets you use time sheets on mobile devices.

Open the **Set Up Time Sheets** assisted setup guide from the [Assisted Setup](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=1801) page.

The assisted setup guide takes you through the following steps:

1. Set up the participants in the time sheet processes.

    The first page in the guide shows you the number of users in your [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. It also shows other required and optional information.  
2. Specify the first day of a work week in this organization.

    The first day of a work week is the default first day for all time sheets.
3. Specify the person who administers time sheets.

    This person can edit and delete all time sheets. Optionally, add the same role to other people in the **User Setup** page.
4. Set up the resources who will use time sheets, and the people who will approve time sheets.

At the end of the setup guide, you can choose to let [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] create time sheets based on your configuration. View the new time sheets in the **Time Sheets** page, which you can open [here](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=951). Alternatively, run the assisted setup guide again, or complete the setup manually.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you're using 2023 release wave 1 (v22) or later, to ensure that you can manage time sheets on mobile devices, you must manually turn on the **Use New Time Sheet Experience** option for the time sheet setup, as described in the next procedure.

## Set up time sheets manually

The following sections describe how to set up time sheets if you don't use the **Set Up Time Sheets** assisted setup guide.  

### Set up general information for time sheets manually

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Resources Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
1. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > If you're using 2023 release wave 1 (v22) or later, to ensure that you can manage time sheets on mobile devices, turn on the **Use New Time Sheet Experience** option.
1. For the **Time Sheet by Job Approval** field, select one of the following options.

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Never** |The user in the **Time Sheet Approver User ID** field on the resource card approves the time sheet. |
| **Always** |The user in the **Person Responsible** field on the Project Card approves the time sheet. |
| **Machine Only** |If the machine time sheet is linked with a job, then the user in the **Person Responsible** field on the Project Card approves the time sheet. If the machine time sheet is linked with a resource, then the user in the **Time Sheet Approver User ID** field on the resource card approves the time sheet. |

### Assign a time sheet administrator manually

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **User Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the user who will be the time sheet administrator, and then select the **Time Sheet Admin.** checkbox.  

> [!TIP]  
> We recommend that you designate only one user as the time sheet administrator for a company. In the following procedure, you set up a time sheet owner and approver where the time sheet approver is assigned for each resource.  

### Assign a time sheets owner and approver manually

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Resources**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the resource for which you want to set up the ability to use time sheets, and then select the **Use Time Sheet** checkbox.  
3. In the **Time Sheet Owner User ID** field, enter the ID of the owner of the time sheet. The owner can enter time usage on a time sheet and submit it for approval. Typically, when the resource is a person, that person is also the owner.  
4. In the **Time Sheet Approver User ID** field, enter the ID of the approver of the time sheet. The approver can approve, reject, or reopen a time sheet.  

> [!NOTE]  
> You can't change the ID of the time sheet approver if there are time sheets that haven't been processed and have the status of **Submitted** or **Open**.

# Sustainability value chain in assembly orders

The requirement for enabling the use of the sustainability value chain in the assembly orders processes is that you enable the **Enable Value Chain tracking**, **Item Emissions**, and **Resource Emissions** fields on the **Sustainability Setup** page.  

To do so, follow next steps:

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sustainability Setup**, and then select the related link.
2. Check whether the basic setup already exists. If it doesn't, follow [these instructions](finance-sustainability-setup.md) to set it up.  
3. On the **Procurement** FastTab, fill in the following fields:
   1. **Enable Value Chain tracking** to enable sustainability value entries postings through value chain operations and the visibility of these fields in operational documents and journals.
   2. **Item Emissions** to enable a default sustainability account and emissions on the **Item Card** page.
   3. **Resource Emissions** to enable default a sustainability account and emissions on the **Resource Card** page.
5. Close the page.

## Working with assembly orders  

To learn more about how to work with assembly orders, go to [Assembly Management](assembly-assemble-items.md). However, the connection of assembly orders with the sustainability value chain is demonstrated two steps:

- Tracking emissions for items and resources consumed during the assembly process.
- Transfer the total emission values to the assembly items.  

To use an assembly order in the sustainability value chain process, add CO2e (carbon equivalent) emissions in all lines. For each line, fill in the **Total CO2e** field with the total emission for the quantity related to the item or resource on the assembly order line.

To do so, follow next steps:

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Assembly orders**, and then select the related link.
2. Create a new assembly order, or open the existing order you want to use. To learn more about assembly orders, go to [To assemble an item to stock](assembly-how-to-assemble-items.md#to-assemble-an-item-to-stock).
3. If your items and resources in the assembly order lines already have default sustainability accounts and emissions, the values are added in the **Sustainability Account No.** and **Total CO2e** fields. You can change these values if you want.
4. If you didn't have these default values for your items or resources, choose a **Sustainability Account No.**, and then fill in the **Total CO2e** field with the total emission amount for this line. The amount is for the whole quantity, regardless how many items are assembled at this moment. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] recalculates the value for the specific consumption.

> [!NOTE]
> Although the total CO2e emission amount displays for each line, there's a field called **CO2e per Unit**. Its value comes from the item or resource, and is used for calculations. However, if you change the **Total CO2e** field on the line, the **CO2e per Unit** recalculates based on the total emission and quantity for that line.  

5. On the **Posting** FastTab, **CO2e per Unit** and **Total CO2e** fields show the total calculated emission per unit of the assembled item after posting.
6. If the values are correct, choose the **Post** action to post the order.
7. After you post the order, if your **Quantity to Assemble** was less than the **Quantity**, the **Posted Total CO2e** fields on the header and lines update with the belonging total CO2e emission.  

After you post the order, you can open the **Posted Assembly Order** page to find the **Total CO2e** field on the **Posting** FastTab. The value in the **CO2e per Unit** field is also updated for the newly assembled item. You can also check the result by opening the **Item Card** page for the item used as the assembled item to verify that the **CO2e per Unit** field updated based on the values from the posted assembly order.

# Integrating with Dynamics 365 Sales

[!INCLUDE[azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id](~/../shared-content/shared/azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id.md)]

The sales person role is often considered as one the most outward-facing jobs in a business. However, it can be helpful for sales people to be able to look inward in the business and see what is happening on the back end. By integrating [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)], you can give your sales people that insight. The integration lets people view information in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] while they're working in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]. For example, when preparing a sales quote it could be useful to know whether you have enough inventory to fulfill the order. For more information, see [Use Dynamics 365 Sales from Business Central](marketing-integrate-dynamicscrm.md).

> [!NOTE]
> This article describes the process of integrating the online versions of [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] through [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)]. For information about on-premises configuration, see [Preparing Dynamics 365 Sales for Integration on-premises](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/prepare-dynamics-365-for-sales-for-integration).

## Integrate through Dataverse

To make it easy to connect and synchronize data with other Dynamics 365 applications, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] also integrates with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)]. For example, you can connect to [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)], or even apps that you build yourself. If you're integrating for the first time, you must do so through [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)]. For more information, see [Integration with Dataverse](admin-common-data-service.md).

If you already integrated [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can continue to synchronize data using your setup. However, if you upgrade or turn off your [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] integration, to turn it on again you must connect through [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)]. For more information, see [Upgrading an Integration with Dynamics 365 Sales](admin-upgrade-sales-to-cds.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Reconnecting through [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] will apply default synchronization settings, and will overwrite any configurations you have. For example, the default table mappings will be applied.

## Integration settings that are specific to a [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] integration

Integration with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] happens through [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)], and many standard settings and tables are provided. In addition to the standard settings, there are some that are specific to [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]. The following sections list those settings.

## Permissions and security roles for user accounts in Sales

When you install the Integration Solution, permissions for the integration user account are configured. If those permissions are changed, you might need to reset them. You can do that by reinstalling the Integration Solution by choosing **Redeploy Integration Solution** on the **Dynamics 365 Connection Setup** page. The following security roles are deployed:

* Dynamics 365 Business Central Integration Administrator
* Dynamics 365 Business Central Integration User

> [!NOTE]
> To use the **Open in Business Central** action in Sales, you must have the following privileges for the following tables:
>
> * You must have Read permissions for the Dynamics 365 Business Central Connection (nav_connection) table.
> * You must have Read, Write, and Delete permissions for the Default Dynamics 365 Business Central Connection (nav_defaultconnection) table.

### Connection settings in the setup guide

You can use an assisted setup guide to quickly set up the connection and specify advanced features, such as coupling between records.

<!--
### User Account Settings
Integration with Business Central through Dataverse requires an administrator user account and an account that is used only for the connection between the apps. This account is called the "integration user." When you install the CDS Base Integration Solution, permissions for the integration user account are configured in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]. If those permissions are changed you might need to reset them. You can do that by reinstalling the Integration Solution or by manually resetting them. The following tables list the minimum permissions for the user accounts in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)].  -->
### Single and bi-directional synchronization of sales orders

When you set up your integration, there are options that control the direction in which you synchronize sales orders, and how you submit them.

The **Bidirectional Synch of Sales Orders** option lets you synchronize sales orders from Sales to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], and vice versa. For example, if a customer changes their mind about the product or quantity in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)], you can archive the sales document and create a new document in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The same is true for changes in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For example, when prices, tax amounts, or expected shipment dates change, the changes synchronize to [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]. Bidirectional synchronization helps keep your sellers up to date with the latest changes and the status of sales orders.

For bidirectional synchronization, you make sales orders available for synchronization when you change their status to **Submitted** in Sales. When you set that status, you can no longer change information on the order's lines. When you synchronize, the order is transferred to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with the status **Released**. If there's a mistake, you can revert the order to **Open** (in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]) or **Active** (in Sales), and then add or delete lines to correct the mistake, and submit the order again.

> [!TIP]
> When you enable the **Bidirectional Synch of Sales Orders** option, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates a record on the **Sales Order Archives** page when you post or change information on an order. For example, the archived versions can be useful for exploring an order's history.

The **Enable Legacy Sales Order Integration** option synchronizes only from Sales to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For this option, you use the **Submit** action in Sales to make orders available for synchronization. When you do, you can no longer change any information on the order. When you synchronize, the order is transferred to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with the status **Released**.

To use this option, you must provide credentials for an administrator user account in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]. To learn more, see [Handle Sales Order Data](marketing-integrate-dynamicscrm.md#handle-sales-order-data).

> [!NOTE]
> The **Bidirectional Synch of Sales Orders** and **Enable Legacy Sales Order Integration** options are mutually exclusive. You can't use both options at the same time.

For both options, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] shows all sales orders with the **Submitted** status on the **Orders - Microsoft Dynamics 365 Sales** page.

### Standard Sales entity mapping for synchronization

Entities in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)], such as orders, are integrated with equivalent types of tables in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], such as sales orders. To work with [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] data you set up links, called couplings, between tables in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)].

The following table lists the standard mapping between tables in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] that [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides.

| [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] | [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] | Synchronization Direction | Default Filter |
|--|--|--|--|
| Unit of Measure | Unit Group | [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] -> [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] |  |
| Item | Product | [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] -> [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] -> [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] | Sales contact filter: **Product Type** is **Sales Inventory** |

> [!NOTE]
> The mappings for the Item Unit of Measure, Resource Unit of Measure, and Unit Group tables are available only if your administrator has turned on the **Unit Group Mapping** toggle on the **Microsoft Dynamics 365 Connection Setup** page. To learn more, go to [Synchronizing Items and Resources with Products in Different Units of Measure](admin-prepare-dynamics-365-for-sales-for-integration.md#synchronize-items-and-resources-with-products-with-different-units-of-measure).

## Synchronize items and resources with products with different units of measure

Businesses often produce or purchase the items in one unit of measure, and then sell them in another. To synchronize items that use multiple units of measure, you must turn on the **Unit Group Mapping** toggle on the **Microsoft Dynamics 365 Connection Setup** page. 

When you turn on the feature update, a new Unit Group table is created and assigned to each item and resource in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The tables let you map the Unit Group, Item Unit of Measure, and Resource Unit of Measure tables in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to the Dynamics 365 Sales Unit Group in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]. The following image shows the mappings.

:::image type="content" source="media/unit group 1.png" alt-text="Table mappings for unit groups":::

You can create multiple units of measure for each unit group, and assign the groups to products in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]. Afterward, you can synchronize the products with items and resources in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. You can manually couple item units of measure or resource units of measure with a unit group. When you do, if the unit group for the item or resource isn't coupled to a unit group in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)], for example, because the unit group didn't exist, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically creates the unit group in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)].

### Map items and resources to products

When you turn on the **Unit Group Mapping** toggle on the **Microsoft Dynamics 365 Connection Setup** page, the following happens:

* New mappings are created for items and resources.
* Existing mappings are deleted. <!--which mappings?-->
* A data upgrade creates unit groups for items and resources.

To use the new mappings, you must synchronize unit groups, item unit of measure, and resource unit of measures. You must also resynchronize items and resources. 

> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] does not allow you to change a unit group for a product. Therefore, you must retire your products and uncouple the items and resources, and then synchronize by creating new products in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]. 

The following steps describe the steps to start mapping unit groups:

1. Be sure that products in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] aren't coupled with items or resources in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. If they are, go to the **Items** and/or **Resources** pages and use the filter options to select the coupled records. Then choose the **Dynamics 365 Sales** action, and select **Uncouple**. This action schedules a background job to uncouple the records. While the job is running, you can check its status by using the **Synchronization Log** action. For more information, see [Coupling and Synchronizing](admin-how-to-couple-and-synchronize-records-manually.md). 
2. Because new products are created in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] with new unit groups, to avoid duplicate names, do one of the following steps:

  * Rename your products, and then retire them in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]. For more information, see [Retire products (Sales Hub)](/dynamics365/sales-enterprise/retire-product). To bulk edit your products in Microsoft Excel, sign in to Power Apps, choose your environment, go to the **Product** table, and then choose the **Data** tab. Clear any filters that are applied. In the **Data** group, choose the **Edit Data in Excel** action. Add a prefix or suffix to the coupled products, and then retire them.
    * Retire your products and delete them. 

3. Follow these steps to synchronize **Unit Groups**, **Unit of Measures**, **Items**, and **Resources**:
    1. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], open the **Dynamics 365 Sales Connection Setup** page.
    2. Use the **Run Full Synchronization** action to open the **Dataverse Full Synch. Review** page.
    3. For the **ITEM UOM**, **RESOURCE UOM**, AND **UNIT GROUP** mappings, choose the **Recommend Full Synchronization** action.
    4. Choose the **Sync All** action.

    > [!NOTE]
    > For mappings that have not yet been fully synchronized, this action will fully synchronize them. To prevent those mappings from synchronizing, delete the mappings from the page. This only removes them from the current full synchronization, and does not delete the mappings.
    
5. Choose the **ITEM-PRODUCT** mapping, and then choose the **Restart** action. Restarting creates new products from the items in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)], and assigns a new unit group that is specific to the item.
6. Choose the **RESOURCE-PRODUCT** mapping, and then choose the **Restart** action. Restarting creates new products from the resources in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)], and assigns a new unit group that is specific to the resources.

### Synchronization rules

The following table lists the rules that control the synchronization between [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. These rules are in addition to rules defined for Dataverse, which also apply. For more information, see [Standard Entity Mapping](admin-synchronizing-business-central-and-sales.md#standard-table-mapping-for-synchronization).

> [!NOTE]  
> Changes to data in  that were made by the integration user account are not synchronized. Therefore, we recommended that you do not change data while using that account. For more information, see [Setting Up User Accounts for Integrating with Dynamics 365 Sales](admin-setting-up-integration-with-dynamics-sales.md).

|Table|Rule|
|-----|----|
|Units of Measure|Units of measure are synchronized with unit groups in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]. There can only be one unit of measure defined in the unit group.|
|Items|When it synchronizes items with [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] products, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically creates a price list in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]. To avoid synchronization errors, you shouldn't modify this price list manually.|
|Resources|Resources are synchronized with [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] products that have product type Service.|
|Customer Price Groups|Customer price groups are synchronized with Sales price lists.|
|Sales Prices|Sales prices that have sales type Customer Price Group and have a sales code defined are synchronized with [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] price list lines|
|Opportunities|Opportunities are synchronized with [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] opportunities. The Salesperson Code value defines the owner of the coupled table in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)].|
|Posted Sales Invoices|Posted sales invoices are synchronized with sales invoices. Before an invoice can be synchronized, it's better to synchronize all other tables that can participate in the invoice, from salespersons to price lists. The Salesperson Code value in the invoice header defines the owner of the coupled table in Sales.|
|Sales Orders|When you enable sales order integration, when you release sales orders in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] that were created from submitted sales orders in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] they synchronize with sales orders in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]. Before you synchronize orders, we recommend that you first synchronize all tables involved with the order. For example, sales persons and price lists. The Salesperson Code field in the order header defines the owner of the coupled table in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)].|

### Synchronization jobs for a Sales integration

The jobs are run in the following order to avoid coupling dependencies between tables. There are more jobs available from Dataverse. For more information, see [Use Job Queues to Schedule Tasks](./admin-job-queues-schedule-tasks.md).

1. UNITOFMEASURE - Dynamics 365 Sales synchronization job  
2. RESOURCE-PRODUCT - Dynamics 365 Sales synchronization job  
3. ITEM-PRODUCT - Dynamics 365 Sales synchronization job  
4. CUSTPRCGRP-PRICE - Dynamics 365 Sales synchronization job.
5. SALESPRC-PRODPRICE - Dynamics 365 Sales synchronization job.
6. POSTEDSALESINV-INV - Dynamics 365 Sales synchronization job.

For more information, see [Create a non-interactive user account](/power-platform/admin/create-users-assign-online-security-roles#create-a-non-interactive-user-account).

   * Dynamics 365 Business Central Integration Administrator
   * Dynamics 365 Business Central Integration User

   > [!Important]
   > This user must not have the System Administrator security role. Also, you cannot use the system administrator account as the integration user.

3. In the Azure portal, create an app registration for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For more information, see [Register an application in Microsoft Entra ID](/powerapps/developer/data-platform/walkthrough-register-app-azure-active-directory). 
  
   > [!NOTE]
   > We recommend that you register the app in the same tenant as your Dataverse environment so that you do not have to consent to letting the app access the environment. If you register the app in another environment, you must sign in to Microsoft Entra ID using the administrator account for your Dataverse environment and give consent.
   >
   > Additionally, the app that you register must not have a secret. Connecting an app with a secret to Dataverse is available only in Business Central 2020 release wave 1 and later.
  
4. Depending on your product version, do one of the following steps:

    * In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], search for **Microsoft Dynamics 365 Connection Setup**, and then choose the related link. 
    * In Dynamics NAV 2018, search for **Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Sales Connection Setup**, and then choose the related link.

5. In the **Authentication Type** field, choose the option for OAuth. 
6. Choose the CRM SDK version that matches solution version you imported in step 1.

   > [!NOTE]
   > This step is only relevant for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

7. Enter the URL of your [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] environment, and then enter the user name and password for the integration user. 

   * In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], use the **Server Address** field.
   * In Dynamics NAV 2018, use the **Dynamics 365 Sales URL** field.

8. In the **Connection String** field, specify the ID of the app registration. This field has two tokens in which the ID of your application should be specified.

   |Token           |Description  |
   |----------------|-------------|
   |**AppId**       |Set to the application ID.      |
   |**RedirectUri** |Set to the application ID, but add the **app://** prefix.         |

    **Example**
    The following example shows a connection string.

    ```
    AuthType=OAuth;Username=jsmith@contoso.onmicrosoft.com;Password=****;Url=https://contosotest.crm.dynamics.com;AppId=<your AppId>;RedirectUri=app://<your AppId>;TokenCacheStorePath=;LoginPrompt=Auto
    ```
9. Enable the connection.

> [!Note]
> If you want to configure a connection to a [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] instance with a specific authentication type, fill in the fields on the **Authentication Type Details** FastTab. For more information, see [Authentication with Microsoft Dataverse web services](/powerapps/developer/data-platform/authentication). This step is not required when connecting an online version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

# Exchanging Data
You can exchange data between [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and external files or streams in connection with common business tasks, such as sending and receiving electronic documents and importing and exporting bank files.  

Before you can send and receive electronic documents or import and export bank files, you must set up the data exchange framework to process the data files or streams. In addition, you must set up related areas, such as the customers that you send electronic invoices to, and the AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals extension if you distribute bank file conversions to an external service provider. For more information, see [Setting Up Data Exchange](across-set-up-data-exchange.md).

# Set Up Resource Allocation
To ensure that a service task is performed well, it's important to find a resource who is qualified to do the work. You can set up [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] so that it's easy to allocate someone who has the right skills for the job. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], we call this _resource allocation_. You can allocate resources based on their skill, availability, or whether they are in the same service zone as the customer. 

To use resource allocation, you must set up:  
  
* The skills required to repair and maintain service items. You assign these to service items and resources.  
* Geographic regions, called zones, that you define for your market. For example, East, West, Central, and so on. You assign these to customers and resources.  
* Whether to display resource skills and zones, and whether to display a warning if someone chooses unqualified resource, or a resource that is not in the customer zone.  

## To set up skills
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Skills**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  

## To assign skills to service items and resources
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Items** or **Resources**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the card for the service item or resource, and then choose one of the following:  
  
    * For service items, choose **Resource Skills**.  
    * For resources, choose **Skills**.  

## To set up zones
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Zones**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  

## To assign zones to customers and resources 
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customers** or **Resources**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the card for the service item or resource, and then choose one of the following:  
  
    * For customers, choose a zone in the **Service Zone Code** field.  
    * For resources, choose the **Service Zones** action.  

## To specify what to show when a resource is chosen
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Management Setup**, and then choose the related link. 
2. In the **Resource Skills Option** field, choose one of the options described in the following table.  
  
    |**Option**|**Description**|  
    |------------|-------------|  
    |Code Shown | Displays the code only.|  
    |Warning Displayed | Shows the information and displays a warning if you choose a resource that is not qualified.|  
    |Not Used | Does not show this information.|  

## To update resource capacity  
You may need to change the capacity of resources.  
  
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Resource Capacity**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the resource, and then choose the **Set Capacity** action.  
3. Make the changes, and then choose **Update Capacity**.  

## To update skills for items, service items, or service item groups
If you want to change the skill codes assigned to items, for example from **PC** to **PCS**, you can do so either for an item, service item, or for all items in a service item group.  
  
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items** or **Service Item**, or **Service Item Group**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the entity to update, and then choose the **Resource Skills** action.  
3. On the line with the code to be changed, in the **Skill Code** field, choose the relevant skill code.  
4.  If the item has associated service items, a dialog box opens with the following two options:  
  
    * Change the skill codes to the selected value: Select this option if you want to replace the old skill code with the new one on all the related service items.  
    * Delete the skill codes or update their relation: Select this option if you want to change the skill code on this item only. The skill code on the related service items will be reassigned, that is, the **Assigned From** field will be updated.

title: Mapping the tables and fields to synchronize

# Mapping the tables and fields to synchronize

The basis of synchronizing data is mapping the tables and fields in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with tables and columns in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)], so they can exchange the data. Mapping happens through integration tables.

## Mapping integration tables

An integration table is a table in the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] database that represents a table, such as an account, in [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)]. Integration tables include fields that correspond to columns in the [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] table. For example, the Account integration table connects to the Accounts table in [!INCLUDE[cds_short_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)]. There must be an integration table mapping for each table in [!INCLUDE[cds_short_md](includes/cds_short_md.md)] that you want to synchronize with data in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

When you create the connection between the apps, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] sets up some default mappings. You can change the table mappings if you want. For more information, see [Standard Table Mapping for Synchronization](admin-synchronizing-business-central-and-sales.md#standard-table-mapping-for-synchronization). If you changed the default mappings and want to revert your changes, on the **Integration Table Mappings** page, choose **Use Default Synchronization Setup**.

> [!Note]
> If you are using an on-premises version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the integration table mappings are stored in table 5335 Integration Table Mappings, where you can view and edit the mappings. Complex mappings and synchronization rules are defined in codeunit 5341.

> [!TIP]
> When a coupled record changes, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically synchronizes the data with Dataverse. Automatic synchronization is great in most cases. However, frequent changes to large amounts of coupled records in a table can slow down data synchronization.
>
> To avoid slow performance, on the **Integration Table Mappings** page, you can enable or disable event-based data synchronization for any table. By default, event-based synchronization is turned on so that existing integrations aren’t affected. Your administrator can turn it on or off for specific tables.

### Add table and field mappings to existing integration tables

[!INCLUDE [preview](includes/preview.md)]

On the **Integration Table Mappings** page, you can use the New Table Mapping action to add new table mappings to integration tables. The action starts the **Create new integration mappings** assisted setup guide, which helps you set up new integration table and field mappings.

The guide lets you map the tables in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with existing integration tables in Dataverse. You can also specify the Dataverse table's unique identifier in **Integration Table Unique Identifier Field Name** and the **Integration Table Modified on Field Name**, which are needed for data synchronization to work.

> [!NOTE]
> The lookup on the Table column shows all [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] tables, including custom tables, that aren't yet mapped. It excludes those that already exist on your Integration Table Mappings page. The lookup on the Integration Table column shows only Dataverse tables (AL Proxy Tables) that are part of out-of-the-box integrations. To add additional or custom Dataverse tables, you'll need help from a developer to create and deploy them through an extension.

The Advanced action opens extra table mapping settings that you can set up. In the **Advanced** section, the **Table Filter** field lets you specify filters for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Use the **Integration Table Filter** field for Dataverse data to consider in data synchronization together with the configuration template codes in **Table Config. Template Code** and **Int. Tbl. Config. Code** to prefill missing data when new data comes from either application.

The guide also helps you specify the fields you want the new mapping to contain. You can match a [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] field in the **Field Name** column with a Dataverse field name in the **Integration Field Name** column. You can also specify a **Direction**, whether the field always has the same value in the **Constant** column, and whether validations or transformations need to be applied during field mapping.

> [!NOTE]
> To reduce errors, the lookup for the **Integration Table Field** column filters to a list of available fields. To map fields that the filters don't include, you'll need help from a developer.
>
> * Fields must be enabled.
> * You can't use the guide to map FlowField and FlowFilter fields.
> * You can only map fields of the type BigInteger, Boolean, Code, Date, DateFormula, DateTime, Decimal, Duration, GUID, Integer, Option, and Text.

> [!TIP]
> You can also add new field mappings to existing integration table mappings through the **Integration Field Mappings** list page, which you can access by choosing **Fields** on the **Integration Table Mappings** page.
>
> Simply choose **New Field Mapping** to open the field mapping step of the **Create new integration mappings** assisted setup guide, and then proceed as described in this article.

New field mappings you add to an existing table mapping are in a Disabled state. You can choose **Edit List** to enable them later.

### Synchronization rules

An integration table mapping also includes rules that control how integration synchronization jobs synchronize records in a [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] table and a table in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)]. For examples of rules for an integration with Sales, go to [Synchronization Rules](#synchronization-rules).

### Strategies for autoresolving conflicts

Data conflicts can easily occur when business applications exchange data on an ongoing basis. For example, someone might delete or change a row in one of the applications, or both. To reduce the number of conflicts to manually resolve, you can specify resolution strategies. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically resolves conflicts according to the rules in the strategies.

Integration table mappings include rules that control how synchronization jobs synchronize records. On the **Integration Table Mapping** page, in the **Resolve Deletion Conflicts** and **Resolve Update Conflicts** columns, you can specify how [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] resolves conflicts that occur because records were deleted in tables in one or the other business application, or updated in both. 

In the **Resolve Deletion Conflicts** column, you can choose to have [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically restore deleted records, remove the coupling between the records, or do nothing. If you do nothing, you must manually resolve conflicts. 

In the **Resolve Update Conflicts** column, you can choose to have [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically send a data update to the integration table when sending data to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)], or to get a data update from the integration table when getting data from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)], or do nothing. If you do nothing, you must manually resolve conflicts.

After you specify the strategy, on the **Coupled Data Synchronization Errors** page, you can choose the **Retry All** action to automatically resolve conflicts.

## Mapping integration fields

Mapping tables is only the first step. You must also map the fields on the tables. Integration field mappings link fields in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] tables with corresponding columns in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)], and determine whether to synchronize data in each table. The standard table mapping that [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides includes field mappings, but you can change the mappings. For more information, see [Viewing Table Mappings](admin-synchronizing-business-central-and-sales.md#tip-for-admins-viewing-table-mappings).

> [!Note]
> If you are using an on-premises version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], integration field mappings are defined in table 5336 Integration Field Mapping.

You can manually map the fields, or you can automate the process by mapping multiple fields at the same time based on criteria for matching their values. For more information, see [To couple multiple records based on field value matching](admin-how-to-couple-and-synchronize-records-manually.md).

### Handle differences in field values

Sometimes the values in the fields that you want to map are different. For example, in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] the language code for the United States is "U.S.," but in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] it's "US." That means you must transform the value when you synchronize data. You can specify transformation rules for the fields on the **Integration Table Mappings** page by choosing **Mapping**, and then **Fields**. Predefined rules are provided, but you can also create your own. For more information, see [Transformation Rules](across-how-to-set-up-data-exchange-definitions.md#transformation-rules).

### Handle missing option values

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] contains option set columns that provide values that you can map to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] fields of the type **Option** for automatic synchronization. During synchronization, nonmapped options are ignored and the missing options are appended to the related [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] table and added to the **CDS Option Mapping** system table to be handled manually later. For example, by adding the missing options in either product and then updating the mapping. For more information, see [Handling Missing Option Values](admin-cds-missing-option-values.md).

## Couple records

Coupling links rows in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] to records in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For example, accounts in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] are typically coupled with customers in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Coupling records offers the following benefits:

* It makes synchronization possible.
* Users can open records or rows in one business app from the other.

Coupling requires that the apps are already integrated.

Couplings can be set up automatically by using the synchronization jobs, or manually by editing the record in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For more information, see [Synchronizing Data in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)]](admin-synchronizing-business-central-and-sales.md) and [Couple and Synchronize Records Manually](admin-manual-synchronization-of-table-mappings.md#synchronize-individual-table-mappings).

## Filter records and rows  

If you don't want to synchronize all rows for a specific table in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] or table in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can set up filters to limit the data that is synchronized. You set up filters on the **Integration Table Mappings** page.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Integration Table Mappings**, and then choose the related link.
2. To filter the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] records, set the **Table Filter** field.  
3. To filter the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] rows, set the **Integration Table Filter** field.  

## Create new records  

By default, only coupled records in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and rows in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] are synchronized by the integration synchronization jobs. You can set up table mappings to create new records or rows in the destination app for each row in the source app that isn't already coupled.  

For example, the SALESPEOPLE - Dynamics 365 Sales synchronization job uses the table mapping SALESPEOPLE. The synchronization job copies data from users in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] to salespersons in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. If you set up the table mapping to create new records, for every user in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] that isn't already coupled to a salesperson in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], a new salesperson row is created in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

### To create new records during synchronization  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Integration Table Mappings**, and then choose the related link.
2. In the table mapping entry in the list, clear the **Synch. Only Coupled Records** field.  

## Use configuration templates on table mappings

You can specify one or more configuration templates to use for new [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] records, and another template to use new [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] rows.  

If you install the default synchronization setup, most of the time, two configuration templates are automatically created and used on the table mapping for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] customers and [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] accounts: **CDSCUST** and **CDSACCOUNT**.  

* **CDSCUST** creates and synchronizes new customers in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] based on accounts in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)].  

     To create this template, copy an existing configuration template for customers. The **CDSCUST** is created only if there's an existing configuration template and the **Currency Code** field in the template is blank. If a field in the configuration template contains a value, the value replaces the value in the mapped column for the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] account. For example, if the **Country/Region** column in an account in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] contains *U.S.* and the **Country/Region** field in the configuration template is **GB**, then **GB** is used as the **Country/Region** for the customer in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

* **CDSACCOUNT** creates and synchronizes new accounts in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] based on an account in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

You can add more templates, and use filters to define conditions under which [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] applies them. The templates apply to data moving in either direction. For example, you might use a template for domestic customers in the United States, and another for foreign customers in the European Union, or vice versa. In that case, when the data synchronizes, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses the country/region code for the customer to apply the appropriate template.

### To specify configuration templates on a table mapping  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Integration Table Mappings**, and then choose the related link.
2. In the table mapping entry in the list, in the **Table Config Templates** field, choose to the configuration template to use for new records in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  
3. If you have multiple templates, to define the conditions that determine when to use the template, enter criteria in the **Integration Table Filter** field, and then enter a number in the **Priority** field. The priority determines the order in which [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] evaluates whether to use the templates.

   > [!NOTE]
   > The **Table Config Template Code** and **Int. Tbl. Config Template Code** fields show different values depending on the number of templates that you configure for a specific integration table mapping:
   >
   > * If you configure a single configuration template, the name of the configuration template shows in order to stay compatible with current capabilities.
   > * If you configure multiple configuration templates, the number of configured configuration templates shows.

4. Set the **Int. Tbl. Config Template Code** field to the configuration template to use for new records in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)].

# Undo Assembly Posting

Undo the posting of an assembly order to correct a mistake or remove an unwanted posting.

When you undo a posted assembly order, corrective item ledger entries are created to reverse the original entries. Each positive output entry for the assembly item is reversed by a negative output entry. Each negative consumption entry for an assembly component is reversed by a positive consumption entry. Fixed cost application is automatically created between the corrective and original entries to ensure exact cost reversal.  

When you undo a fully posted assembly order, you can recreate the original order. For example, to make corrections before you post it again.  

When you undo a partially posted assembly order, all affected quantity fields, such as the **Assembled Quantity**, **Consumed Quantity**, and **Remaining Quantity** fields, are restored to the values they had before the posting.  

To recreate or restore assembly orders, the item in the original posting must meet the following conditions:  

* It's still in inventory. That is, it hasn't been sold or otherwise consumed by outbound transactions.  
* It isn't reserved.  
* It's in the bin that it was output to.  

Assembly orders can only be restored if the number and sequence of lines on the original assembly order aren't changed.  

> [!TIP]  
> To resolve conflicts caused by changes in the lines, manually revert the changes on the lines in question before undoing the posted assembly order. You can post the assembly order and then recreate it when you undo the posting.  

The following procedure describes how to undo posted assembly orders that contain items that were assembled-to-stock. To undo posted assembly orders with items that were assembled-to-order, use the **Undo Shipment** action on the related posted shipment. To learn more about undoing shipments, go to [Reverse Journal Postings and Undo Receipts/Shipments](finance-how-reverse-journal-posting.md). Undoing the posted assembly order happens in the same way as described in that article.  

## To undo posting of an assembly order

You can undo fully or partially posted assembly orders.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Posted Assembly Orders**, and choose the related link.  

   Each partial posting creates a separate posted assembly order.  
2. Open the posted assembly order that you want to undo, and then choose the **Undo Assembly** action.  

    If the posted assembly order is related to a fully posted assembly order that's been deleted, you can recreate then deleted order. For example, you might recreate the order because you want to reprocess it.  
3. To recreate the assembly order, choose **Yes**. To undo the posting without recreating the assembly order, choose **No**.  

The **Reversed** field on the assembly order changes to **Yes**. The assembly order posting is now reversed. You can process the entire assembly order if you chose to recreate it, or the open assembly order that you have restored to its original state.  

> [!NOTE]  
> To restore quantities from multiple partial postings in an assembly order, you must undo all the posted assembly orders by following steps 1 through 3.

# Set up general inventory information

You specify your general inventory setup on the **Inventory Setup** page.

## To set up general inventory information

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Inventory Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Inventory Setup** page, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

### To set up inventory valuation and costing

To record inventory costs correctly, you must set up various fields and pages before you make transactions that include item. Typically, businesses choose a specific costing method and apply that to inventory items, for example, to help them track the value of items on stock.  

|**Field**|**Details**|  
|------------|-------------|
|**Automatic Cost Posting**|Ensure that the cost is automatically posted to the general ledger whenever an inventory transaction is posted. The field is turned on by default to ensure that inventory values are always correct in the general ledger. Alternatively, you can manually post costs at regular intervals with the **Post Inventory Cost to G/L** batch job. You can also turn off automatic cost posting. A notification displays from which you can start an assisted setup guide to help you schedule tasks for the job queue. To learn more, go to [Reconcile Inventory Costs with the General Ledger](finance-how-to-post-inventory-costs-to-the-general-ledger.md).|
|**Automatic Cost Adjustment**| Specifies if item value entries are automatically adjusted when an item transaction is posted. The field is set to **Always** by default to ensure that inventory values are always correct, which in turn keeps your sales and profit statistics up to date. Cost adjustment forwards cost changes from inbound entries, such as purchases or production output, to the related outbound entries, such as sales or transfers. The adjustment is helpful for new [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] customers and small businesses with relatively low inventory transaction levels. However, as a business grows and inventory levels increase, adjustments can slow down system performance. To minimize reduced performance during posting, select a time option to define how far back in time from the work date an inbound transaction can occur to potentially trigger adjustment of related outbound value entries. Alternatively, you can manually adjust costs at regular intervals with the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job. You can also set the **Automatic Cost Adjustment** field to **Never**. A notification displays from which you can start an assisted setup guide to help you schedule tasks for the job queue. To learn more, go to [Adjust Item Costs](inventory-how-adjust-item-costs.md).|
|**Expected Cost Posting to G/L**|Ensure that you post expected costs to the general ledger. The interim G/L accounts show an estimate of the amounts due and the cost of the traded items before you invoice them. To learn more, go to [Design Details: Expected Cost Posting](design-details-expected-cost-posting.md) and [Reconcile Inventory Costs with the General Ledger](finance-how-to-post-inventory-costs-to-the-general-ledger.md).|
|**Average Cost Calc. Type**|Define if the average cost is to be calculated per item only or per item for each stockkeeping unit and for each variant of the item. To learn more, go to [Design details: average cost](design-details-average-cost.md).|
|**Average Cost Period**|Select the period of time you would like application to use for calculating the weighted average cost of items that use the average costing method. To learn more, go to [Design details: average cost](design-details-average-cost.md).|
|**Default Costing Method**|Select the default costing method that determines whether an actual or a budgeted value is capitalized and used in the cost calculation. You can select a different costing method for a specific item either by selecting item template where costing method is defined or by manually selecting a different value on the **Item Card** page. To learn more, go to [Design details: costing methods](design-details-costing-methods.md).|

To learn more about costing in general, go to [Managing Inventory Costs](finance-manage-inventory-costs.md).  

If you want to include warehouse handling times in the order promising calculation on purchase lines, you can set it up as a default for inventory on the **Inventory Setup** page, and for your location. To learn more, go to [Calculate Order Promising Dates](sales-how-to-calculate-order-promising-dates.md).  

## Allow workers to post transactions at the same time

To allow people to post inventory transactions at the same time, you can enable the **Enable multiple users to post item ledger entries and value entries at the same time** feature on the **Feature Management** page. By default, the feature isn’t enabled.

> [!NOTE]
> Similar features are available for project, resource, and warehouse entries. To learn more, go to:
>
> * [Allow multiple people to post project transactions at the same time](projects-how-setup-jobs.md#allow-multiple-people-to-post-project-transactions-at-the-same-time)
> * [Allow multiple people to post resource transactions at the same time](projects-how-setup-resources.md#allow-multiple-people-to-post-resource-transactions-at-the-same-time)
> * [Design details: Creating warehouse entries](design-details-warehouse-entries.md)

If you enable the feature, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] assigns entry numbers for each table from `SequenceNumbers` in the database, which allows more people to post transactions at the same time. The result can be that sometimes inventory entries from two or more transactions are interleaved. For example, an item register might contain any or all of the entry tables, as shown in the following image.

:::image type="content" source="media/interleaved inventory tables.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the item register with several entry tables." lightbox="media/interleaved inventory tables.png":::

If you don’t enable the feature, when someone posts an inventory transaction the tables are locked and other users can’t post inventory transactions. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] finds the last entry in each table and assigns a number that’s one higher. This numbering ensures that entries that belong to the same register are consecutive, but prevents other people from posting at the same time.

> [!NOTE]
> You might not want to enable the feature if you have a feature or extension that:
>
> - Relies on consecutive entry numbers.
> - Requires that tables are locked throughout the posting process.

# Where is personalization stored?

When you interact with the Business Central web client to optimize your workspace, some user interface (UI) adjustments are automatically saved and roam with you across devices and browsers. Others are local and only affect your current browser.

- *Roaming personalization* is stored in the Business Central service and affects your experience no matter which device or browser you sign in to. Personalizing in one browser or device immediately affects other browsers or devices that you use. Roaming personalization is typically infrequent, more permanent, or time-consuming to recreate. Roaming settings can only be reset by clearing personalization from the Business Central web client.
- *Local personalization* is stored in your browser and only affects your experience when using different browser tabs in that same browser. It doesn't affect your Business Central experience on other devices, browsers, or browser profiles. UI adjustments that are saved locally are typically those adjustments that users frequently do and redo as they work in Business Central.  

  > [!NOTE]
  > If you delete the browsing data in your browser, specifically cookies and site data, you also delete any local personalization that you've done. To avoid deleting local personalization, make sure that the browser isn't set up to clear cookies and site data every time you close the browser. For example, in Microsoft Edge, you turn off the **Cookies and other site data** toggle in the **Privacy, search, and services** settings. Learn more at [Manage cookies in Microsoft Edge](https://support.microsoft.com/windows/manage-cookies-in-microsoft-edge-view-allow-block-delete-and-use-168dab11-0753-043d-7c16-ede5947fc64d#bkmk_deletecookieseverytimeyouclosethebrowser) or consult the documentation for your browser.

## Roaming versus local UI adjustments

The following table indicates which UI adjustments are roaming, local, or both. An \* indicates that the roaming personalization can be made without entering the personalization mode.

# Walkthrough: Set up and invoicing sales prepayments

This walkthrough takes you through the process of setting up and using prepayments in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. [!INCLUDE [prepayment_def](includes/prepayment_def.md)]

[!INCLUDE [prepayment_req](includes/prepayment_req.md)]

For example, you can send more prepayment invoices if more items are added to the order.  

## About this walkthrough  

This walkthrough will take you through the following scenarios:  

- Setting up prepayments  
- Creating an order that requires a prepayment  
- Creating a prepayment invoice  
- Correcting the prepayment requirements on an order  
- Applying prepayments to an order  
- Invoicing the final amount on an order with prepayment  

### Roles

This walkthrough includes tasks for the following roles:  

- Accounting Manager (Phyllis)  
- Order Processor (Susan)  
- Accounts Receivable Administrator (Arnie)  

## Story

 Phyllis is an accounting manager and makes decisions about which customers are required to pay a deposit before items are manufactured or shipped. Phyllis sets up [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to calculate prepayments automatically.  

 Susan is a sales order processor. When a customer calls to place an order, Susan enters the order into the system while the customer is on the telephone. This way, Susan can verify prices and payment terms with the customer immediately, and make changes to the order while negotiating with the customer.  

 Arnie works in the Accounts Receivable department and posts invoices and payments.  

 In this scenario, Phyllis sets up prepayment requirements for the customer Selangorian based on their credit history. Phyllis gives Susan instructions for how to handle their orders.  

 When the customer calls, Susan negotiates with the customer until they reach an agreement, and then chooses to calculate the prepayment in several different ways.  

 After Susan sends the prepayment invoice, the customer orders an extra item. Susan updates the order and creates a second prepayment invoice.  

 Arnie registers the customer's payment and applies it to the invoices, and then sends the final invoice.  

## Set up prepayments

Phyllis sets up the system to handle prepayments for customers.  

- Phyllis decides to have the same number series for prepayments as the one used for sales invoicing.  
- Phyllis sets application to check if prepayments are required before final invoicing on an order.  
- Phyllis sets up default values for a required prepayment percentage for particular items and customers.  

The following procedures describe how to complete Phyllis' tasks:  

### To set up number series for prepayments

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales & Receivables Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page, expand the **Number Series** FastTab.  
3. Verify that the number series for posted prepayment invoices in the **Posted Prepmt. Inv. Nos.** field is the same as for posted sales invoices (**Posted Invoice Nos.**), and the number series for posted prepayment credit memos (**Posted Prepmt. Cr. Memo Nos.**) is the same as for posted credit memos (**Posted Credit Memo Nos.**).  

### To block shipments for unpaid prepayment

1. On the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page, on the **General** FastTab, select the **Check Prepayment when Posting** check box.

Now you can't ship or invoice an order that has an unpaid prepayment amount.  

By default, Phyllis requires customer 20000 to be invoiced for a 30% down payment on all orders. Therefore, Phyllis will enter a default prepayment percentage on the customer card.  

Phyllis requires all customers to be invoiced a 20% deposit for item 1896-S. Customer 20000 has a poor payment history, so Phyllis requires a 40% prepayment from customer 20000 for item 1896-S. The following procedure illustrates how to set up default prepayment percentages.  

### To assign default prepayment percentages to customers and items

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customers**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the card for customer 20000 (Trey Research).
3. On the **Payments** FastTab, in the **Prepayment %** field, enter **30**.  
4. Choose the **Related** action, select the **Sales** menu item, and then choose the **Prepayment Percentages** menu item.  
5. Fill in two lines on the **Sales Prepayment Percentages** page as follows.  

    |**Sales Type**|**Sales Code**|**Item No.**|**Prepayment %**|  
    |--------------------|--------------------|------------------|----------------------|  
    |**Customer**|**20000**|**1896-S**|**40**|
    |**Customer**|**20000**|**1900-S**|**30**|  
    
    > [!TIP]
    > Depending on your country/region, you must also specify a tax group code on the **Costs & Posting** FastTab for item 1896-S. When you use the demonstration company, this field is already set.

6. Close all pages.  

### To specify an account for sales prepayments in general posting setup

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Posting Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the line where the **Gen. Bus. Posting Group** field is set to **DOMESTIC**, and the **Gen. Prod. Posting Group** field is set to **RETAIL**.  
3. In the **Sales Prepayments Account** field, specify the relevant account. Your selection is automatically saved.  

> [!TIP]
> If you cannot see the field in the **General Posting Setup** page, then use the horizontal scroll bar at the bottom of the page to scroll to the right.  

## Create an order that requires a prepayment

 In the following scenario, Susan, the order processor, creates an order when talking to a customer. The items the customer is ordering require a prepayment. Plus, the customer has made some late payments in the past. Susan's been instructed to require a fixed amount of **800** as a prepayment on the order.  

The customer asks to pay 35%, to which Susan agrees and changes the order.  

Susan creates the prepayment invoice and sends it to the customer.  

### To create a sales order with a prepayment

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. In the **Customer Name** field, choose **Trey Research**.  
4. Close the overdue balance warning that is displayed.  
5. Fill in two sales lines with the following information.  

    |**Type**|**No.**|**Quantity**|  
    |--------------|-------------|------------------|  
    |**Item**|**1896-S**|**1**|  
    |**Item**|**1900-S**|**1**|

    By default, the prepayment fields on the sales line are hidden. To display the fields, you must personalize the page. For more information, see [To start personalizing a page through the Personalizing banner](ui-personalization-user.md#start-personalizing-by-using-the-personalization-mode).

6. Verify that the **Prepayment %** field on the line with item **1900-S** contains **30**. The default value was taken from the sales header, which was populated from the customer card.  

    The **Prepayment %** field on the line with item **1896-S** contains **40**. 40 is the percentage you entered on the **Sales Prepayment Percentages** page for item **1896-S** and customer **20000**.  

    For more information, see [Set Up Prepayments](finance-set-up-prepayments.md).  
7. In the **Order** action, choose  **Statistics**.  
8. On the **Prepayment** FastTab, the **Prepayment Amount Excl. VAT** field contains **458.16**. If you create a prepayment invoice for the order now, 458.16 is the amount on the invoice.  

    In this scenario, Susan has been instructed to suggest a total prepayment of **800** for the order.  

    > [!IMPORTANT]  
    >  Depending on your country/region, the following step might not apply.  
9. Change the amount in the **Prepmt. Amount Excl. Tax** field to **800** and then close the page.  
10. Verify the **Prepayment %** field on the sales lines, and you'll see that it has been recalculated to **67.02438** and **67.02282**.  

     The recalculation includes all lines that have a prepayment percentage that is greater than 0.  

     Now the customer asks if the prepayment percent can be set to 35%. Susan's supervisor approves the change.
11. On the **Sales Order** page, on the **Prepayment** FastTab in the **Prepayment %** field, enter **35**.  
12. In the warning that appears, choose the **Yes** button. A rate of 35% will be applied as the payment percentage for the whole order.  
13. Verify that the lines have been updated correctly.  

## Create a prepayment invoice

After entering the correct prepayment values on the order, Susan creates the prepayment invoice and sends it to the customer.  

### To create a prepayment invoice

1. On the **Sales Order** page, choose **Actions**, then **Posting**, then **Prepayment** and then select **Post and Print Prepmt. Invoice**
2. Choose the **Yes** button to post the invoice.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Susan would now send the invoice to the customer.  

## Create an additional prepayment invoice

The following day, the customer calls Susan and makes changes to the order. The customer wants two of item 1896-S. Susan reopens the order, updates it, and then creates a second prepayment invoice for the order and sends it to the customer.  

### To create an additional prepayment invoice

1. On the **Sales Order** page, choose the **Release** action, and then **Reopen**.  
2. On the line for item **1896-S**, in the **Quantity** field, enter **2**.  

    In the **Order** action, choose **Statistics**. The **Prepayment Amount Excl. VAT** field now contains **768.04**, and the **Prepmt. Amt. Invoiced Excl. VAT** field contains **417.76**. These values show that there's an extra prepayment amount that hasn't been invoiced yet.  
3. To post an invoice for the extra prepayment amount, choose **Actions**, then **Posting**, then **Prepayment** and then select **Post and Print Prepmt. Invoice**
4. Choose the **Yes** button to post the invoice.  

## Apply the prepayments

The customer pays the prepayment amount. Arnie, from the accounting department, registers the payment, and applies it to the prepayment invoices.  

### To apply a payment to the prepayment invoices

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Cash Receipt Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in a journal line with the following information.  

    |Field name|Enter|  
    |----------------|-----------|  
    |**Document Type**|**Payment**|  
    |**Account Type**|**Customer**|  
    |**Account No.**|**20000**|  
3. Choose the **Process** action, and then **Apply Entries**.  
4. On the **Apply Customer Entries** page, select the first prepayment invoice, and then choose the **Process** action, and then choose the **Set Applies-to ID** action.  
5. Repeat the previous step for the second prepayment.  
6. Choose the **OK** button.  

    The **Amount** fields have now been filled in with the sum of the two prepayment invoices.  

7. To post the journal, choose the **Post/Print** action, then select **Post**.
8. Choose the **Yes** button.

## Invoice the remaining amount

Now Arnie has been informed that the items on the order have been shipped and that the order is ready for invoicing. Arnie creates the invoice for the order.  

### To invoice the remaining amount

1. Open the sales order.
2. Choose the **Posting** action, then **Post**.
3. Select **Ship and Invoice**, and then choose the **OK** button.
4. If you want to preview the invoice, choose the **Yes** button.

    > [!NOTE]  
    > Normally, the shipping department would have already posted the shipment.  

    Arnie can view the history to verify that the sales invoice was created as intended.

5. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Posted Sales Invoices**, and then choose the related link.  

## Update the status of prepaid orders and invoices automatically

You can speed up order and invoice processing by setting up job queue entries that automatically update the status of those documents. When a prepayment invoice is paid, the job queue entries can automatically change the document status from **Pending Prepayment** to **Released**. When you set up the job queue entries, the codeunits you'll need to use are **383 Upd. Pending Prepmt. Sales** and **383 Upd. Pending Prepmt. Purchase**. We recommend that you schedule the entries to run frequently, for example, every minute. For more information, see [Use Job Queues to Schedule Tasks](admin-job-queues-schedule-tasks.md).

## Next steps

This walkthrough covered the following steps to set up [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to handle prepayments. 

- Set up default prepayment percentages on customers and items.
- Use different methods to calculate the prepayments on an order.  
- Calculate the prepayment amount as a percentage of the total on the order.
- Assign one total prepayment amount to the order.  

You've also posted a prepayment invoice, created a second prepayment invoice when the order has changed, and posted the final invoice for the remaining amount.  

The prepayments capabilities make it easy to set up and enforce prepayment rules for customers and items. They also let you to post every payment against an invoice.

# Use e-documents in the purchase process

You can use configured electronic documents (e-documents) with the following purchase documents:

- Purchase invoices
- Purchase orders
- Purchase credit memos
- General journals

> [!NOTE]
> When you receive an e-document from a specific vendor, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] matches the e-document with the vendor by verifying the following information in this order:
>
> 1. **GLN** (from the Vendor card)
> 1. **VAT Registration No.** (from the Vendor card)
> 1. **Participation Identifier** from the **Service Participant** page (using the **E-Document Service Participation** field from the Vendor card)
> 1. **Name** and **Address** (from the Vendor card)

## E-documents in purchases

You can receive purchase e-documents manually, or by using the **Receive** batch job.  

### Set up vendors to work with different purchase documents  

Follow these steps to configure vendors for incoming electronic invoices:

1. Select the ![Tell Me feature](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Vendors**, and then select the related link.
1. Choose the vendor you want to configure.
1. On the **Receiving** FastTab, in the **Receive E-Document To** field, specify the default purchase document you want to generate from the received e-document.

   > [!NOTE]
   >
   > - In the **Receive E-Document To** field, you can either select a **Purchase Invoice** or **Purchase Order** based on what you want to create from the received e-invoice. This selection doesn't affect the creation of corrective documents. In both scenarios, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] generates a credit memo.
   >
   > - If you choose the **Purchase Order** option in the **Receive E-Document To** field, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] tries to update one of the existing purchase orders. However, if the purchase order for a vendor in the received e-document doesn't exist, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates a new purchase order, using the same approach as creating a new purchase invoice explained in this [article later](#work-with-purchase-invoices).

1. Choose one of the options you want to use for the selected vendor.
1. Close the page.

### Work with purchase invoices  

#### Run the batch job  

> [!NOTE]
> This batch job automates the process of collecting your incoming invoices. It works only in countries or regions where the functionality is available.  

Every time a **Job Queue** runs, if the external service has incoming invoices from your vendor, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] collects and imports those invoices. To complete the process, follow these steps:

1. After the batch job finishes running, the imported invoices are listed on the **E-Documents** page with their basic details.
1. To view more details, open a specific e-document.
1. Depending on whether your e-document setup automatically processes invoices, or requires that you review and confirm the details before processing, follow these steps. Learn more in [Set up e-documents](finance-how-setup-edocuments.md) for information about how to require confirmation.

   **Automatic processing**

   1. If you automatically process invoices, and there are no errors or issues in the e-document, the **Record** field maps the document number of the purchase invoice if a number series is specified on the **Vendor Card** page. To open the document, select the link.

   > [!NOTE]
   > This [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]-created document isn't the posted document.

1. To go directly to the purchase document, select the **Record** field. After you open the **Purchase Invoice** page, check the document. If everything is correct, post the document.  
1. When you post the purchase document, the **Record** field on the **E-Document** updates from **Invoice** to **Purchase Invoice**, and the number of the posted purchase document is available. You can select the number to open it.
   Details about logs are the same as they are in the sales process for e-documents.  

   **Review and confirm before processing**

   1. If you must review and confirm the details before processing the invoice, open the document.
   1. On the **E-Document** page, choose the **View extracted data** action.
   1. On the **Received purchase document data** page, review the details. If things look good, choose **OK**.
   1. To process the invoice, follow the steps described for **Automatic processing**.

   > [!TIP]
   > When you receive an incoming e-document, it's typically in XML or similar format that can be difficult, if not impossible, to read. For example, if you aren't technical and don't understand the XML format, it might be hard to review an invoice before you process it. To make it easier for everyone to review incoming e-documents, invoices and credit memos have an **E-invoice Lines** FastTab that displays details from the imported file, such as line and header information, in a way that's easy to understand.
   >
   > The preview feature is only available for invoice and credit memo types of incoming e-documents.

### Handle errors and warnings

Errors in the sales process are mostly related to the availability of the service. The incoming document can contain multiple reasons for errors. The most common reason is that [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can't recognize the lines on an e-document from your vendor and can't enter lines in your purchase invoice.

There are two common errors:  

- If you want to use a specific line from your vendor invoice that was directly posted to the general ledger (G/L) account, you must correctly configure the **Mapping Text** value. To bypass this error when using G/L accounts, select the **Map Text to Account** to create a specific mapping of the **Mapping Text** value with the **Debit Acc. No.**. Learn more about [account mapping](finance-how-use-edocuments-purchase.md#map-text-on-an-e-document-to-a-specific-vendor-account).  
- If you want to track the inventory and use lines from your vendor invoice to fill in the items on your document lines, you must correctly configure the **Item Reference No.** value. To bypass this error, map external items with your item numbers by using the item reference list. Learn more in [use item references](inventory-how-use-item-cross-refs.md).

After you fix the errors and warnings, you can manually specify when to create a purchase invoice based on your setup by selecting **Create Document**.

### Recreate a deleted purchase invoice or credit memo

Mistakes happen, so it's important to be able to fix them quickly. If you accidentally delete a purchase invoice or credit memo and can't link the incoming e-document to the correct one, you can now recreate a new purchase document based on details in the e-document. Problem solved, and you can go take care of other business.

If you accidentally delete a purchase invoice or credit memo, you can't proceed with the e-document connection with the regular purchase document in Business Central. To get yourself unstuck, you can run the **Recreate Document** action from the e-document. The action creates an unposted purchase invoice or credit memo based on the type of incoming document, its information, and the G/L mapping or item references used.

> [!NOTE]
> The action works only with unposted purchase invoices and credit memos. It doesn't work for purchase orders.

#### Map text on an e-document to a specific vendor account

To map lines with expenses for E-Documents, you need to map descriptions with **G/L Account**. Then, use the **Map Text to Account** action to link specific text on a vendor invoice from the **E-Document Service** to a vendor account. Any part of the E-document description that exists as a mapping text means that the **Vendor No.** field on the resulting document or journal lines of type **G/L Account** are filled with the vendor in question.

In addition to mapping text to a vendor account or G/L accounts, you can also map text to a bank account for electronic documents related to paid expenses. This option creates a general journal line that is ready to post to a bank account.

1. Select the relevant E-Document line with the displayed error message and then choose **Map Text to Account** action. The **Text-to-Account Mapping** page displays.
1. In the **Mapping Text** field, enter any text that appears on vendor invoices for which you want to create purchase documents or journal lines. You can enter up to 50 characters.
1. In the **Vendor No.** field, enter the vendor that the resulting purchase document or journal line will be created for.
1. In the **Debit Acc. No.** field, enter the debit-type G/L account that is inserted on resulting purchase document or journal line of type G/L Account.

   > [!NOTE]
   > Don't use the **Credit Acc. No.**, **Bal. Source Type**, and **Bal. Source No.** fields with E-documents.

1. Repeat steps 2 through 5 for all error messages on E-documents that you want to automatically create **G/L Accounts** and documents for.  

#### Manually import one or more invoices  

To manually import one or more external e-documents, follow these steps:

1. Select the ![Tell Me feature](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **E-Document Service**, and then select the related link.
1. On the **E-Document Service** page, select the active service.
1. Select **Receive**, and upload the e-document file that you got from the vendor.
1. If an error message occurs, open the e-document to fix the issues.
1. When you finish fixing the issues, in the **Import Manually** group, select **Create Document**.  
1. After you create the document in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], using a batch job doesn't change the way you view it.

#### Work with attachments  

Peppol and similar e-invoicing files are machine-readable formats that aren't easy for people to read. To improve reading, Peppol made it possible to embed a PDF file into the Peppol BIS 3 format as a binary object. If your incoming Peppol BIS 3 file has an embedded PDF, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically processes it and adds the PDF as an attachment to the purchase document after creating it.

## E-documents with purchase orders  

### Link purchase orders with the received e-documents

If your **Vendor** configured the **Received E-Document To** field to work with **Purchase Orders**, once an electronic document is created in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] (manually or from external end point), [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] does the following steps:  

1. If the **Purchase Order** for this particular vendor exists and there's a purchase order number in the receive **E-Document** file, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically links this **E-Document** with the mentioned **Purchase Order**, and the **Document Status** of this **E-Document** is set to **In Progress**, and the **E-Document Status** in the **Service Status** subpage is set to **Order linked**. This link is visible in the **Document** field on this specific **E-Document**. If you need to change the **Purchase Order** linked automatically, you can do it using the **Update Purchase Order Link** action and manually select one of the existing purchase orders for this vendor. You can only do it before matching the lines between **E-Document** and **Purchase Order**.  

1. If the **Purchase Order** for this particular vendor exists but there's no purchase order number in the received **E-Document** file, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers the possibility to choose one of the existing purchase orders when and if you uploaded this document manually. This condition opens the **Purchase Orders** list with orders only for the vendor from whom you received the **E-Document**. You need to select the **Purchase Order** you want and then select **OK**. If you failed to select the correct **Purchase Order**, or obtained the **E-Document** automatically from an external endpoint using the **Job Queue**, a new **E-Document** isn't linked to any purchase document. The **Document Status** then shows **Error**, and the **E-Document Status** in the **Service Status** subpage also shows **Imported document processing error**. To finish linking with the **Purchase Order**, select the **Update Purchase Order Link** action and choose one of the existing purchase orders for this vendor.

1. If the **Purchase Order** for this particular vendor doesn't exist when a new **E-Document** is created, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates a new **Purchase Order**, using the same model of creation that already exists for new **Purchase Invoices**. The **Document Status** of this **E-Document** is set to **Processed**, and the **E-Document Status** in the **Service Status** subpage is set to **Imported document created**. After which, this link is visible in the **Document** field on this specific **E-Document**.

### Match lines from received e-document with purchase order  

You can match your received electronic documents with purchase orders' lines from two different places: from the **E-Document** page or from the **Purchase Order** page. The easiest way to locate the already linked **Purchase Orders** is to use the **Linked Purchase Orders** tile as a part of **E-Document Activities**. All nonlinked documents can be found using the tile **Waiting Purchase E-Invoices** where you have a list of **E-Documents** that you need to review. The **E-Document Activities** with these two tiles can be found in the following **Role Centers**: Business Manager Evaluation, Business Manager, Accountant, Inventory Manager, and Shipping and Receiving.

> [!TIP]
> There are two ways to match lines. One way is to do it manually, as described in the article. The other way is to use the **E-document matching assistance with Copilot**. The E-document matching assistance feature helps you match received electronic invoices with existing purchase order lines by using large language modules (LLM) model. Learn more about [using Copilot][Map e-documents to purchase order lines with Copilot](map-edocuments-with-copilot.md).
> [!NOTE]
> If the VAT percentage differs between the incoming document and the company's VAT percentage, matching documents can't be used in a multi-country environment.  

#### Match lines from purchase order  

You can match the lines from the **Purchase Orders** list or from one of the opened **Purchase Orders**. To begin the process, use the following steps:  

1. Select the **Linked Purchase Orders** tile on your Role Center if there's a number.
1. Choose one of the two options for matching:

   - If you want to match the lines from the **Purchase Orders** list, select the **Purchase Order** line that you want to match and select the **Map E-Document Lines** action.  
   - If you want to first open the **Purchase Order**, open the document and then select the **Map E-Document Lines** action.
1. Because both options have the same process, the **Purchase Order Matching** page opens with the following content:

    1. In the header, you can find the following information, which can help you to map the lines easier:

       |Field name |Description |
       |--------|-----------------|
       |Vendor Name |Specifies the vendor’s name of the electronic document. |
       |E-Document No. |Specifies the linked electronic document number. |
       |E-Document Date |Specifies the linked electronic document date.  |
       |E-Document Amount |Specifies the linked e-document total amount including VAT. |

    1. In the lines, you can find the lines imported from the **E-Document** file on the left side and the lines from the existing **Purchase Order** on the right.  
    1. All lines on both sides have item numbers and descriptions, together with the **Direct Unit Cost** and **Line Discount %**.  
    1. On the **Imported Lines** side, you can also locate the **Quantity** field as a total quantity from e-invoice and the **Matched Quantity** field specifying the quantity that is already matched to the purchase order lines.
    1. On the **Purchase Orders Lines** side, you can also find the **Available Quantity** as the quantity that can be matched to this line (received, but not invoiced quantity) and **Qty. to Invoice**, specifying the quantity that is already matched to this line.
    1. To match lines, select the lines on both sides that you want to match and select the **Match Manually** action. The matched lines are marked in green.
    1. It's possible to match one to one, but it's also possible to match many to one or one to many, by selecting more lines on one side or the other before you choose the **Match Manually** action.
    1. You can also select the **Match Automatically** action to automatically match all lines with the same **Type**, **No.**, **Unit Price**, **Discount**, and **Unit of Measure**.
    1. If you make a mistake, you can select the **Remove Match** action to remove the matched lines on the purchase order side or select the **Reset Matching** action to reset all matches.
    1. If your **E-Document** has many lines, you can select the **Show Pending Lines** action during the matching process to remove all the e-document lines if they're already matched. If you need to view all the lines, you can always select the **Show All Lines** action.

1. After you finish the matching, select the **Apply To Purchase Order** action.
1. After you apply the matching to the purchase order, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] updates the following fields:

    1. The **Vendor Invoice No.** and **Document Date** fields on the document header update with values from the electronic document that you received and linked.
    1. The **Qty. to Invoice** field on the lines update with the values from the **Qty. to Invoice** column from the **Purchase Order Matching** page based on the match.
    1. Now you can post the document by choosing the **Post** action.  
    1. After you post the document, the value in the **Document** field on the **E-Document** page changes to relate to the **Posted Purchase Invoice**.
    1. Close the page.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> By default, you can match only the lines that have the same total amount in both documents. That means **Direct Unit Cost** together with the applied Line **Discount %** must be the same, because in one document you can have an amount without discount and in another with discount.  

If you want to add tolerance and allow the difference between lines in e-invoice and purchase order, follow these steps:

1. Select the ![Tell Me feature](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchases & Payables Setup**, and then select the related link.  
1. Allow tolerance in the **E-Document Matching Difference %** field by specifying the maximum percentage of cost difference to allow when matching an incoming e-document line with a purchase order line.
1. This setup applies to all the matching lines, but considers the tolerance for the total amount, as for **Direct Unit Cost** together with applied **Line Discount %**.  
1. Close the page.

##### Other options

If your inbound electronic invoice has lines that aren't on your purchase order, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] prevents you from posting the document because you can't partially post an incoming invoice. Therefore, you must ensure that you all invoice lines are correctly mapped to the purchase order. If you experience this issue, follow these steps to resolve it:

1. On the **Imported Lines** FastTab on the **Purchase Order Matching** page, choose the line that doesn't exist on the purchase order. Now choose the :::image type="content" source="media/assist-edit-icon.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the AssistEdit button."::: button, and choose the **Create Purchase Order Line** action.
1. On the **E-Doc. Create Purch Order Line** page, in the **Type** field, choose the type of line you want to create in your purchase order. You can choose any of type.
1. Based on the line type, you can choose the **No.** to specify what you received. For example, an item, general ledger account, resource, and so on.
1. The unit of measure, quantity, amount, discount, and other values are copied from the inbound invoice line.
1. You can select the **Learn matching rule** field to specify whether to create a matching rule. This feature works only for items and G/L accounts. Item references are created for items and text to account mappings are created for G/L accounts.
1. Select **OK**.
1. A purchase order line is created on the purchase order, and you can map it on the **Purchase Order Lines** FastTab on the **Purchase Order Matching** page.

> [!NOTE]
> If you change the quantity, the unit amount recalculates to the same total amount as the original invoice line.

#### Matching lines from e-document  

You can match the lines on the **E-Document** page. To begin, use the following steps:  

1. Select the ![Tell Me feature](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **E-Documents**, and then select the related link.
1. Select the **E-Document** that you want to match.
1. Choose the **Match Purchase Order** action to open the **Purchase Order Matching** page.  
1. Repeat the same steps that you used when you started matching from purchase orders.

## Overview of e-document statuses

To get a better overview of all e-documents in the company, you can select the **Accountant** Role Center where e-document statuses exist. There, you can find e-document activities that have the following statuses:

# Moving Average (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Moving Average** report gives a clear picture of your organization's average sales over a 30 day period. Use the report to identify key trends over a set period of time. This report focuses on the sales amount and comparing the current sales amount value against a 30 day average.

## Use the report

The **Moving Average** report is meant to help higher level employees identify key trends and make changes based on average sales.

Sales executives need to track the moving average of key sales metrics over a specific period. You can use this report to find recent performance trends and make strategic decisions for the short-term future.

Leaders of sales departments typically want to identify which items are selling well and which aren't. This information helps you make informed decisions about your inventory management and future marketing strategies.

## Key performance indicators

The report includes the following key performance indicators (KPIs) and measures:

- [**Sales Amount**](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#sales-amount)
- [**Sales Amount Average 30D**](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#sales-amount-avg-30d-fiscal)

# Process purchase returns or cancellations

If you want to return items to your vendor or cancel services that you have purchased, then you can create and post a purchase credit memo that specifies the requested change with regard to the original purchase invoice. To include the correct purchase invoice information, you can create the purchase credit memo directly from the posted purchase invoice or you can create a new purchase credit memo with copied invoice information.

If you need more control of the purchase return process, such as warehouse documents for the item handling or better overview when shipping back items from multiple purchase documents with one purchase return, then you can create purchase return orders. A purchase return order automatically issues the related purchase credit memo. For more information, see [To create a purchase return order based on one or more a posted purchase documents](purchasing-how-process-purchase-returns-cancellations.md#to-create-a-purchase-credit-memo-from-a-posted-purchase-invoice).

> [!NOTE]  
> If a posted purchase invoice has not yet been paid, then you can use the **Correct** or **Cancel** functions on the posted purchase invoice to automatically reverse the involved transactions. These functions only work for unpaid invoices, and they do not support partial returns or cancellations. You can also not correct or cancel purchase invoices that were posted with with receipts from more than one purchase order. For more information, see [Correct or Cancel Unpaid Purchase Invoices](purchasing-how-correct-cancel-unpaid-purchase-invoices.md).

Typically, you create a purchase credit memo or purchase return order in reaction to a credit memo sent to you by a vendor. The purchase credit memo or purchase return order functions as your internal documentation of the credit memo process for accounting purposes or to control the shipping of the involved items.

The change might relate to all the products on the original purchase invoice or only to some of the products. Accordingly, you can partially return received items or demand partial reimbursement of received services. In that case, you must edit the information on the purchase credit memo or purchase return order.

In addition to the original posted purchase invoice, you can apply the purchase credit memo or purchase return order to other purchase documents, for example another posted purchase invoice because you're also returning items delivered with that invoice.

The credit memo posting will also revert any item charges that were assigned to the posted document, so that the item's value entries are the same as before the item charge was assigned.

## Inventory costing
To preserve correct inventory valuation, you typically want to pick return items from inventory at the unit cost that they were purchased at, not at their current unit cost. This is referred to as exact cost reversing.

Two functions exist to assign exact cost reversing automatically.  

|Function|Description|  
|------------------|---------------------------------------|  
|**Get Posted Document Lines to Reverse** function on the **Purchase Return Order** page|Copies lines of one or more posted documents to be reversed into the purchase return order. For more information, see [To create a purchase return order based on one or more posted purchase documents](purchasing-how-process-purchase-returns-cancellations.md#to-create-a-purchase-return-order-based-on-one-or-more-posted-purchase-documents).|  
|**Copy from Document** function in the **Purchase Credit Memo** and **Purchase Return Order** pages|Copies both the header and lines of one posted document to be reversed.<br /><br /> Requires that the **Exact Cost Reversing Mandatory** check box is selected on the **Purchases & Payables Setup** page.|

To assign exact cost reversing manually, you must choose the **Appl.-from Item Entry** field on any type of return document line, and then select the number of the original purchase entry. This links the purchase credit memo or purchase return order to the original purchase sales entry and ensures that the item is valued at the original unit cost.

For more information, see [Design Details: Inventory Costing](design-details-inventory-costing.md).

## To create a purchase credit memo from a posted purchase invoice

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Posted Purchase Invoices**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Posted Purchase Invoices** page, select the posted purchase invoice that you want to reverse, and then choose the **Create Corrective Credit Memo** action.

    Most fields on the purchase credit memo header are filled with the information from the posted purchase invoice. You can edit all the fields, for example with new information that reflects the return agreement.
3. Edit information on the lines according to the agreement, such as the number of items returned or the amount to be reimbursement.
4. Choose the **Apply Entries** action.
5. On the **Apply Vendor Entries** page, select the line with the posted purchase document that you want to apply the purchase credit memo to, and then choose the **Applies-to ID** action. The number of the purchase credit memo is inserted in the **Applies-to ID** field.
6. In the **Amount to Apply** field, enter the amount that you want to apply if smaller than the original amount.

    At the bottom of the **Apply Vendor Entries** page, you can see the total amount to apply to reverse all involved entries, namely when the value in the **Balance** field is zero.
7. Choose the **OK** button. When you post the purchase credit memo, it will be applied to the specified posted purchase documents.

    When you have created or edited the needed purchase credit memo lines and the single or multiple applications are specified, you can proceed to post the purchase credit memo.
8. Choose the **Post** action.

The posted purchase invoices that you apply the credit memo to are now reversed. If you have already paid the original invoice, the vendor should now refund the payment to you. If the credit memo is only for part of the product on the original invoice, you might only pay the remaining amount on the original purchase invoice to close it.

The purchase credit memo is removed and replaced with a new document in the list of posted purchase credit memos.

## To create a purchase credit memo by copying a posted purchase invoice

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Credit Memos**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action to open a new empty purchase credit memo.
3. In the **Vendor** field, enter the name of an existing vendor.
4. Choose the **Copy from Document** action.
5. On the **Copy Purchase Document** page, in the **Document Type** field, select **Posted Invoice**.
6. Choose the **Document No.** field to open the **Posted Purchase Invoices** page, and then select the posted purchase invoice that contains lines that you want to reverse.
7. Select the **Recalculate Lines** check box if you want the copied posted purchase invoice lines to be updated with any changes in item price and unit cost since the invoice was posted.
8. Choose the **OK** button. The copied invoice lines are inserted in the purchase credit memo.
9. Complete the purchase credit memo as explained in [To create a purchase credit memo from a posted purchase invoice](purchasing-how-process-purchase-returns-cancellations.md#to-create-a-purchase-credit-memo-from-a-posted-purchase-invoice).

## To create a purchase return order based on one or more posted purchase documents

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Return Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. Fill in the fields on the **General** FastTab as necessary.
4. On the **Lines** FastTab, fill the lines manually, or copy information from other documents to fill the lines automatically:

    - Use the **Get Posted Document Lines to Reverse** function to copy one or more posted document lines from one or more posted documents. This function always exactly reverses the costs from the posted document line. This function is described in the following steps.    
    - Use the **Copy from Document** function to copy an existing document to the return order. Use this function to copy the entire document. It can be either a posted document or a document that isn't yet posted. This function only enables exact cost reversing when the **Exact Cost Reversing Mandatory** check box is selected on the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page.  

5. Choose the **Get Posted Document Lines to Reverse** action.
6. At the top of the **Posted Purchase Document Lines** page, select the **Show Reversible Lines Only** check box if you want to see only lines that have quantities that haven't yet been returned. For example, if a posted purchase invoice quantity has already been returned, you might not want to include that quantity on a new purchase return document.

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  This field only works for posted receipts and posted invoice lines, not for posted return or posted credit memo lines.  

    At the left side of the page, the different document types are listed, and the number in brackets shows the number of documents available of each document type.

7. In the **Document Type Filter** field, select the type of posted document lines you would like to use.  
8. Select the lines that you would like to copy to the new document.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  If you use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd> to select all lines, all lines within the filter you have set are copied, but the **Show Reversible Quantity Only** filter is ignored. For example, suppose you have filtered the lines to a particular document number with two lines, one of which has already been returned. Even if the **Show Reversible Quantity Only** field is selected, if you select <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd> to copy all lines, both lines are copied, instead of only the one that has not yet been reversed.  

9. Choose the **OK** button to copy the lines to the new document.  

    The following processes occur:  

    - For posted document lines of the type **Item**, a new document line is created that is a copy of the posted document line, with the quantity that hasn't yet been reversed. The **Appl.-to Item Entry** field is filled in as appropriate with the number of the item ledger entry of the posted document line.  

    - For posted document lines that aren't of the type **Item**, such as item charges, a new document line is created that is a copy of the original posted document line.  

    - Calculates the **Unit Cost (LCY)** field on the new line from the costs on the corresponding item ledger entries.  

    - If the copied document is a posted shipment, posted receipt, posted return receipt, or posted return shipment, the unit price is calculated automatically from the item card.  

    - If the copied document is a posted invoice or credit memo, the unit price, invoice discounts, and line discounts from the posted document line are copied.  

    - If the posted document line contains item tracking lines, the **Appl.-to Item Entry** field on the item tracking lines is filled with the appropriate item ledger entry numbers from the posted item tracking lines.  

     When you copy from a posted invoice or posted credit memo, application copies any relevant invoice discounts and line discounts as valid at the time of posting that document from the posted document line to the new document line. Be aware, however, that if the **Calc. Inv. Discount** option is activated on the **Purchases & Payables Setup** page, then the invoice discount will be newly calculated when you post the new document line. The line amount for the new line might therefore be different than the line amount for the posted document line, depending on the new calculation of the invoice discount.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  If part of the quantity of the posted document line has already been reversed or sold or consumed, a line is created for only the quantity that remains in inventory or that has not been returned. If the full quantity of the posted document line has already been reversed, a new document line is not created.  
    >
    >  If the flow of goods in the posted document is the same as the flow of goods in the new document, a copy of the original posted document line in the new document is created. The **Appl.-from Item Entry** field is not filled in because, in this case, exact cost reversing is not possible. For example, if you use the **Get Posted Document Lines to Reverse** function to get a posted purchase credit memo line for a new purchase credit memo, only the original posted credit memo line is copied to the new credit memo.  

10. On the **Purchase Return Order** page, in the **Return Reason Code** field on each line, select the reason for the return.
11. Choose the **Post** action.

## To create a replacement purchase order from a purchase return order

You might agree with your vendor that they compensate you for a purchased item by replacing the item. The replacement item can be the same or it can be different. This situation could occur if the vendor mistakenly shipped the wrong item.  

1.  On the **Purchase Return Order** page for an active return process, on an empty line, make a negative entry for the replacement item by inserting a negative amount in the **Quantity** field.  
2. Choose the **Move Negative Lines** action.  
3. On the **Move Negative Purchase Lines** page, fill in the fields as necessary.
4. Choose the **OK** button. The negative line is deleted from the purchase return order, and a new purchase order is created. For more information, see [Record Purchases](purchasing-how-record-purchases.md).  

## To create a purchase allowance

If you receive items from your vendor that aren't what you wanted, for example, if they're slightly damaged, the wrong color or the wrong size, the vendor might offer you a purchase allowance.  

You can post this reduced purchase cost as an item charge on a credit memo or return order and link it to the posted receipt. The following describes it for a purchase return order, but the same steps apply to a purchase credit memo.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Credit Memos**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action to open a new empty purchase credit memo.  
3. Fill in the credit memo header with information about the vendor who sent you the purchase allowance.  
4. On the **Lines** FastTab, in the **Type** field, select **Charge (Item)**.  
5. In the **No.** field, select the appropriate item charge value.  

    You might want to create a special item charge number to cover purchase allowances.  
6. In the **Quantity** field, enter **1**.  
7. In the **Direct Unit Cost** field, enter the amount of the purchase allowance.  
8. Assign the purchase allowance as an item charge to the items in the posted receipt. For more information, see [Use Item Charges to Account for Additional Trade Costs](payables-how-assign-item-charges.md). When you have assigned the allowance, return to the **Purchase Credit Memo** page.

When you post the purchase return order, the purchase allowance is added to the relevant purchase entry amount. In this way, you can maintain accurate inventory valuation.  

## To combine return shipments

If you want to return items covered by different purchase return orders to the same vendor, then you can use the **Combine Return Shipments** function.  

When you ship the items, you post the related purchase return orders as shipped and this creates posted purchase return shipments.  

When you're ready to invoice these items, instead of invoicing each purchase return order separately, you can create a purchase credit memo and automatically copy the posted purchase return shipment lines to this document. Then you can post the purchase credit memo and conveniently invoice all the open purchase return orders at the same time.  

When return shipments are combined on a credit memo and posted, then a posted purchase credit memo is created for the invoiced lines. The **Quantity Invoiced** field on the originating purchase return order is updated based on the invoiced quantity. However, this original purchase return order isn't deleted, even if it has been fully received and invoiced, and you must therefore delete the purchase return order manually.

> [!NOTE]  
> The following procedure assumes that there are several purchase return orders for the vendor, and that they have been posted as shipped.     

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Credit Memos**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. On the **General** FastTab, fill in the fields as necessary.  
4. Choose the **Get Return Shipment Lines** action.  
5. Select multiple return shipment lines that you want to include in the invoice.  

    If an incorrect return shipment line was selected or you want to start over, you can just delete the lines on the purchase credit memo and then use the **Get Return Shipment Lines** function again.  
6. Choose the **Post** action.  

### To remove open purchase return orders after combined return shipment posting  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Delete Invoiced Purchase Return Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary, and then choose the **OK** button.  
3. Alternatively, delete the individual purchase return orders manually.

# Building [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports for displaying [!INCLUDE [prod_long](includes/prod_long.md)] data

You can make your [!INCLUDE[prod_long](includes/prod_long.md)] data available as a data source in [!INCLUDE [powerbi-desktop-name](includes/powerbi-desktop-name.md)] and build powerful reports about the state of your business.

This article describes how to start using [!INCLUDE [powerbi-desktop-name](includes/powerbi-desktop-name.md)] to create reports that display [!INCLUDE[prod_long](includes/prod_long.md)] data. After you create reports, you can publish them to your [!INCLUDE [powerbi-service-name](includes/powerbi-service-name.md)] or share them with all users in your organization. When the reports are in the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-service-name](includes/powerbi-service-name.md)], users with access can view the reports in [!INCLUDE[prod_long](includes/prod_long.md)].

## Get ready

- Sign up for the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-service-name](includes/powerbi-service-name.md)].

  If you aren't signed up, go to [https://powerbi.microsoft.com](https://powerbi.microsoft.com). When you sign up, use your work email address and password.

- Download [Power BI Desktop](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/desktop/).

  [!INCLUDE [powerbi-desktop-name](includes/powerbi-desktop-name.md)] is a free application you install on your local computer. Learn more at [Quickstart: Connect to data in Power BI Desktop](/power-bi/desktop-quickstart-connect-to-data).

- Make sure the data you want in the report is available as an API (recommended) or published as a web service. Learn more in [Expose data through API pages or OData web services](admin-powerbi-setup.md#exposedata).

<!--- For [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, get the following information:

  - The OData URL for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].
  
    Typically, this URL has the format `http[s]://[computer]:[port]/[serverinstance]/ODataV4`, for example, `https://localhost:7048/BC190/ODataV4`. If you have a multi-tenant deployment, include the tenant in the URL, for example, `https://localhost:7048/BC190/ODataV4?tenant=tenant1`.
  - A username and web service access key of a [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] account.

    To get data from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], Power BI uses basic authentication. So, you'll need a username and web service access key to connect. The account might be your own user account, or your organization may have a specific account for this purpose.-->

- Download the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] report theme (optional).

  Learn more in [Use the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] report theme](#theme) in this article.

[!INCLUDE[note-multicompany-reports](includes/note-multicompany-reports.md)]

## <a name="getdata"></a>Add [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] as a data source in Power BI Desktop

The first task in creating reports is to add [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] as a data source in [!INCLUDE [powerbi-desktop-name](includes/powerbi-desktop-name.md)]. Once connected, you can start to build the report.

1. Start [!INCLUDE [powerbi-desktop-name](includes/powerbi-desktop-name.md)].
1. Select **Get Data**.

    If you don't see **Get Data**, select the **File** menu, then **Get Data**.
1. On the **Get Data** page, select **Online Services**.
1. In the **Online Services** pane, do one of the following steps:

    - To connect to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, select **Dynamics 365 Business Central**, then **Connect**.
    <!--- To connect to  [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, select **Dynamics 365 Business Central (on-premises)**, then **Connect**.-->

1. Sign in to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] (one-time only).

    If you aren't signed in to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] from [!INCLUDE [powerbi-desktop-name](includes/powerbi-desktop-name.md)], you're prompted to sign in.

    - For [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, select **Sign in**, and then choose the relevant account. Use the same account that you use to sign into [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. When done, select **Connect**.

    <!--- For [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, first enter the OData URL for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], then select **OK**. When prompted, enter the username and password of the account to use for connecting to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. In the **Password** box, enter the web service access key. When done, select **Connect**.-->

    > [!NOTE]  
    > After you connect to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you won't be prompted again to sign in. [How do I change or clear the account I'm currently using to connect to Business Central from Power BI Desktop?](/dynamics365/business-central/power-bi-faq?tabs=designer#perms)

6. When connected, [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] contacts the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] service. The **Navigator** window displays the data sources that are available for building reports. Select a folder to expand it and show the available data sources.

   These data sources represent all APIs and web services that are published for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], grouped by environments and companies. With [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, **Navigator** has the following structure:

    - **Environment name**
      - **Company name**
        - **Advanced APIs**

          This folder lists advanced APIs published by Microsoft, like the [Business Central automation APIs](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/itpro-introduction-to-automation-apis) and APIs published by other organizations (these APIs are called Custom APIs). Custom APIs are further grouped in folders according to the [APIPublisher](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/properties/devenv-apipublisher-property)/[APIGroup](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/properties/devenv-apigroup-property) properties of the API source code.

        - **Standard APIs v2.0**

          This folder lists the data APIs exposed in the [Business Central API V2.0](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/api-reference/v2.0/). You use these APIs to read data from the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] database, such as master data (customer, vendor, item, and so on), transactions (general ledger entries, customer entries, and so on), or setup data (dimensions, payment methods, unit of measure, and so on).

        - **Web services \(legacy)**

          This folder lists pages, codeunits, and queries that are published as web services in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Using this legacy method to read data from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is discouraged. We suggest using APIs instead.

    <!--
    > [!NOTE]
    > The structure for Business Central on-premises is different because it doesn't support API pages.-->

7. Select the data source or sources that you want to add to your data model, and then select the **Load** button.
8. If later you want to add more Business Central data, you can repeat the previous steps.

Once the data is loaded, you can see it in the right navigation on the page. At this point, you're connected to your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] data, and you can begin building your [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] report.  

> [!TIP]

## Creating accessible reports

It's important to make your reports usable for as many people as possible. Try to design reports so that they don't require any special adaptation to meet the specific needs of different users. Make sure the design lets users take advantage of assistive technologies, like screen readers. [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] includes various accessibility features, tools, and guidelines to help. To learn more, go to [Design Power BI reports for accessibility](/power-bi/create-reports/desktop-accessibility-creating-reports) in the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] documentation.

## Creating reports to display data associated with a list in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]

You can create reports that display in a FactBox on a [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] list page, and change when different rows are selected in the list. Creating these reports is similar to other reports, except there are a few things to do to make sure the reports display as expected. To learn more, go to [Creating Power BI Reports for Displaying List Data in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]](across-how-use-powerbi-reports-factbox.md).

## <a name="theme"></a>Using the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] report theme (optional)

Before building your report, we recommend that you download and import the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] theme file. The theme file creates a color palette so you can build reports with the same color styling as the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] apps, without requiring you to define custom colors for each visual.

> [!NOTE]
> This task is optional. You can always create your reports and then download and apply the style template later.

### Download the theme

The theme file is available as a json file on Microsoft Power BI Community Themes Gallery. To download the theme file, do the following steps:

1. Go to [Microsoft Power BI Community Themes Gallery for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central](https://community.powerbi.com/t5/Themes-Gallery/Microsoft-Dynamics-365-Business-Central/m-p/385875).
2. Select the download attachment **Microsoft Dynamics Business Central.json**.

### Import the theme on a report

After you download the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] report theme, you can import it to your reports. To import the theme, Select the **View** > **Themes** > **Browse for themes**. Learn more in [Power BI Desktop - Import custom report themes](/power-bi/create-reports/desktop-report-themes#import-custom-report-theme-files).

## Publish reports

After you create or modify a report, you can publish the report to your [!INCLUDE [powerbi-service-name](includes/powerbi-service-name.md)] and also share it with others in your organization. After you publish a report, it's available in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The report also becomes available for selection in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

To publish a report, select **Publish** on the **Home** tab of the ribbon or from the **File** menu. If you're signed into the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-service-name](includes/powerbi-service-name.md)], the report is published to this service. Otherwise, you're prompted to sign in. 

## Distribute or share a report

There are a couple of ways to share reports:

- Share a report from your [!INCLUDE [powerbi-service-name](includes/powerbi-service-name.md)] (recommended)

    If you have a [!INCLUDE [powerbi-pro-license-name](includes/powerbi-pro-license-name.md)] license or use [!INCLUDE [powerbi-premium-capacity-name](includes/powerbi-premium-capacity-name.md)], you can share the report directly from your [!INCLUDE [powerbi-service-name](includes/powerbi-service-name.md)]. To learn more, go to [Power BI - Share a dashboard or report](/power-bi/collaborate-share/service-share-dashboards#share-a-dashboard-or-report).

- Distribute reports as .pbix files.

    Reports are stored on your computer as .pbix files. You can distribute the .pbix file to users, like any other file. Then, the people you shared the file with can upload it to their [!INCLUDE [powerbi-service-name](includes/powerbi-service-name.md)]. To learn more, go to [Upload reports from files](across-working-with-powerbi.md#upload).

    > [!NOTE]
    > Distributing reports in this way means that refreshing data for reports is done individually by each user. This situation might impact [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] performance.

## How to develop cross-company or cross-environment [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports

The [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] API endpoints all have the prefix `https://api.businesscentral.dynamics.com/v2.0/<environment_name>/api/v2.0` followed by `/companies({company_id})/accounts({id})` (here we use the `accounts` API as an illustration). You can use this structure to create PowerQuery queries that load data for multiple companies or multiple environments if the user who is reading data can access them.

To set up a query to load data for multiple companies, follow these steps:

1. Take the PowerQuery query that loads data for a single company. Convert it to a custom Power Query function that takes the company ID (or maybe the environment name) as parameters. To learn more, go to [Using custom Power Query functions](/power-query/custom-function).
1. Now use the new custom function in a PowerQuery query, where you map the function over a list of companies and then merge the datasets using the [Table.Combine](/powerquery-m/table-combine) Power Query function.

## <a name="advancedopts"></a>Advanced: Customize language, timeout, database replica, or page size for your Business Central data source

The [!INCLUDE [powerbi-connector-name](includes/powerbi-connector-name.md)] supports several advanced properties for connecting to a Business Central data source that you can set in your Power Query queries. The following table describes the parameters.

|Parameter|Description|Default|Learn more at|
|-|-|-|-|
|AcceptLanguage|This parameter allows you to specify preferred languages for responses, ensuring users receive messages and translatable strings in their desired language. It sets the language in which the Business Central API session runs. It influences the language of error messages, formatted values in AL, and other values that depend on language or culture.<br><br>Setting this parameter improves user satisfaction and makes the data more accessible and relevant.|*not specified*|[Use locale values in multiple-language Power BI reports](/power-bi/guidance/multiple-language-locale#load-a-report-in-power-bi).|
|ODataMaxPageSize|This parameter limits the number of entities per results page, which allows for more flexibility when connecting to large datasets or using complex queries. It sets the maximum number of records to return for each page when calling an API. For example, if your table **Customers** has 13,000 records and ODataMaxPageSize is set to 5000, Power BI makes 3 API calls to get your customers. The first call gets 5,000 records, the next one gets 5000 more, and the last call gets the remaining 3000. This option can't be higher than the maximum page size enforced by Business Central, which is 20000.<br><br>Setting this parameter ensures efficient and responsive data retrieval, leading to faster insights and decision-making. You can't exceed the maximum page size defined on the service.|5000|[ODataPreferenceHeader.MaxPageSize Property](/dotnet/api/microsoft.odata.odatapreferenceheader.maxpagesize)|
|Timeout|This parameter defines the maximum duration for a request before cancellation. It sets the timeout for each single API call to Business Central. Its value can't exceed the timeout enforced on the Business Central service, which is currentæy 10 minutes (00:10:00).<br><br>Setting this parameter helps manage system resources effectively and prevents long-running queries from impacting overall system performance. Users experience minimal delays and interruptions, ensuring a smoother workflow. |00:08:00|[OData.Feed](/powerquery-m/odata-feed)|
|UseReadOnlyReplica|This parameter determines whether requests target the primary database or a read-only replica. Offloading read operations from the primary database can significantly boost performance.<br><br> Setting this property leads to faster data retrieval and improved system stability, especially during peak usage times.|true||

### Configure the advanced parameters

1. Start [!INCLUDE [powerbi-desktop-name](includes/powerbi-desktop-name.md)].
2. Complete the step that suits your scenario:

   # [Edit existing report](#tab/existing)

   1. Select **File** > **Open**.
   1. Browse for and select the report (.pbix). 
   1. In the ribbon, select **Transform Data** to open the **Power Query Editor**.

   # [Create new report](#tab/new)

   1. In the ribbon, select **Get Data**. If you don't see **Get Data**, select the **File** menu, then **Get Data**.
   1. On the **Get Data** page, select **Online Services** > **Dynamics 365 Business Central** > **Connect**.
   1. In the **Navigator** window, select the API endpoint that you want to load data from.
   1. Select **Transform Data** instead of **Load** as you might normally do. This step opens **Power Query Editor**.

   ---

3. In **Power Query Editor**, select **Advanced Editor** from the ribbon.
4. In **Advanced Editor**, locate the line that starts with `Source =`:

   ```powerquery
   Source = Dynamics365BusinessCentral.ApiContentsWithOptions(null, null, null, null),
   ```

5. In the line, replace the fourth parameter of `Dynamics365BusinessCentral.ApiContentsWithOptions` with a comma separated list of properties and values you want to set, for example:

   ```powerquery
   Source = Dynamics365BusinessCentral.ApiContentsWithOptions(null, null, null, Dynamics365BusinessCentral.ApiContentsWithOptions(null, null, null, [UseReadOnlyReplica = true, Timeout = Duration.From("00:07:00"), ODataMaxPageSize = 10000, AcceptLanguage = "it-it"])
   ```

6. Select **Done** to close **Advanced Editor**.
7. Select **Close & Apply** to save the changes and close Power Query Editor.

## Fixing problems

### "Expression.Error: The environment 'Production' does not exist." error when specifying a Business Central environment

> **APPLIES TO:** [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online

When you connect to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online from [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)], or when you install a [!INCLUDE [powerbi-desktop-name](includes/powerbi-desktop-name.md)] app from Microsoft AppSource that uses [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] data, you might be prompted to input the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] environment you want to connect to.

If you get an error similar to "Expression.Error: The environment 'Production' does not exist.", follow these steps to troubleshoot:

1. Make sure you're using the right credentials to access [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. These credentials might not be the same credentials you use to access [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)]. [How do I change or clear the account I'm currently using to connect to Business Central from Power BI Desktop?](/dynamics365/business-central/power-bi-faq?tabs=designer#perms)
2. If your environment is an embedded ISV environment, you need to specify the embedded ISV name in parenthesis as part of the environment name. For example, if you want to connect to an environment named Production from the embedded ISV named Fabrikam, you must specify "PRODUCTION (fabrikam)" as environment name.

### "Can't insert a record. Current connection intent is Read-Only." error connecting to custom API page

> **APPLIES TO:** Business Central online

By default, reports that use [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] data connect to a read-only replica of the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] database. In rare cases, depending on the API design, you might get an error when you try to connect to and get data from the API. The error looks like this:

`Dynamics365BusinessCentral: Request failed: The remote server returned an error: (400) Bad Request. (Can't insert a record. Current connection intent is Read-Only. CorrelationId: [...])".`

If you're using a custom API, we recommend you rework the AL code to make sure it doesn't make database modifications when it's just reading data. But in case your scenario requires it, you can [configure the connector to use a read-write connection instead](#advancedopts).

# Managing intercompany transactions

Businesses with more than one legal entity with separate accounting functions can benefit from intercompany transactions. For example, it's useful for businesses that have subsidiaries in multiple international markets or regions. Or, an organization might have several companies but lack the equivalent number of accounting and administrative teams. Intercompany transactions simplify and streamline business processes and transactions between companies in the intercompany partnership.

After you specify the customer and vendor relationships for intercompany transactions, partners enter information one time in sales and purchase documents. A corresponding document is created at the other partner involved in the transaction. Mapping the chart of accounts and dimensions helps ensure that information appears in the right places.  

There are four main benefits to the intercompany functionality:  

* Increased productivity as a result of time saved and simplified transactions  
* Minimized mistakes with one-time entry of information and system-wide, automated updates  
* Transparent audit trail and full visibility into business activities and transaction histories  
* Efficient transactions with affiliate and subsidiary companies  

## Streamline the flow of business activities  

Intercompany transactions let you distribute sales and purchasing documents and general journal entries to all of your satellite offices, sales offices, or subsidiary companies. Distributing transactions saves time and increases efficiency throughout the organization by reducing data entry. It cuts down on the need to send, receive, print, and archive sales and purchasing documents.  

You're in full control of all transaction documents. For example, you can reject a document sent to you and use the **Reverse Journal Postings** and **Undo Receipts/Shipments** actions to make corrections. Or, when making a purchase from a partner or subsidiary company, you can update the purchase order as long as the selling company hasn't shipped the goods.  

When you enter a transaction, you don't need to specify the accounts to use. You just choose the intercompany partner. The intercompany functionality creates general journal lines that balance the books of both companies involved in the transaction. In receivables and payables, you assign an intercompany partner code to any customer or vendor. From that moment on, all orders and invoices for transactions between these companies produce corresponding documents in the partner company. The result is correctly balanced accounts.  

Intercompany focuses on sales and purchase documents and general journal lines, and allows transactions between multiple [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] databases. For example:

* Different countries/regions
* Multiple currencies
* Different charts of accounts
* Different dimensions
* Different item numbers  

Intercompany transactions use several types of entries and documents:  

* General journal entries
* Purchase and sales orders
* Purchase and sales invoices
* Credit memos
* Return orders

When you set up intercompany transactions, you create a list of intercompany partners, an intercompany chart of accounts, and intercompany dimensions. Afterward, you can create transactions in intercompany general journals.

> [!NOTE]
> The general journal by itself doesn't include currencies. It converts all amounts to the local currency at the current exchange rate.

After you set up business partners as customers and vendors, and assign them intercompany partner codes, they can exchange intercompany purchase and sales documents, including items and item charges. 

> [!NOTE]
> Companies can't use intercompany to exchange all types of data. Purchase invoices are not submitted to business partners through intercompany processes. However, sales invoices that are submitted through intercompany processes will be created as purchase invoices in the receiving company.

Consolidating financial data might be relevant for intercompany processes. For more information, see [Consolidating Financial Data from Multiple Companies](finance-consolidated-company-reporting.md).

# Managing VAT rate changes

VAT rates can change depending on local legislation. Any change in VAT impacts your data in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] whether the VAT rate is lowered, raised, or removed. VAT is connected to many entities in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], such as customers, vendors, items, resources, item charges, and general ledger accounts. Changes in VAT rates usually happen at a specific date. Before that date, you should change your VAT setup, posting groups, and so on, so that new sales orders and purchase orders use the new VAT rate.

## Changing VAT rates

A good approach to managing a VAT rate change is to fully post and close open orders and other documents before the date of the rate change. Posting and closing helps ensure that the orders and documents aren't affected. This approach is the cleanest because it lets you start new orders and documents with the new VAT rate.

The following approach is suggested to manage a VAT rate change:

1. Post and close open orders, journals, and other documents fully before the switch date. However, you can wait until afterward as long as you don't add new lines and you ensure the effective date is before the switch date.  
2. Create the new VAT setup.  
3. Make the VAT switch on the relevant entities, such as customers, vendors, items, and so on.  
4. On the VAT rate switch date, you create new documents that use the new rate.  

## The VAT Rate Change tool

The VAT Rate Change tool can help you convert VAT rates on master data, journals, and orders. The tool is useful if you want to convert VAT on master data more easily or if you have orders that you can't close before the switch date. However, there are a few restrictions and limitations.

## Understanding the VAT rate conversion process and limitations

The VAT Rate Change tool converts VAT rates for master data, journals, and orders in different ways. The new general product posting group or VAT product post group update the selected master data and journals. If an order was fully or partially shipped, the shipped items keep the current general product posting group or VAT product posting group. A new order line is created for the unshipped items and updated to align current and new VAT or general product posting groups. Also, item charge assignments, configuration templates for items, reservations, and item tracking information updates accordingly.

On order lines, the unit price updates for all lines of the type Item and Resource, if you're using prices including VAT for the item. For other line types, you can decide whether to update the unit price.

There are a few things that the tool doesn't convert:

* Sales or purchase orders and invoices where shipments were posted. These documents are posted using the current VAT rate.  
* Documents with posted prepayment invoices. For example, you made or received prepayments on invoices that aren't completed before you use the VAT rate change tool. In this case, there's a difference between the VAT that's due and the VAT that was paid in the prepayments when the invoice is completed. The VAT rate change tool skips these documents and you must manually update them.  
* Sales or purchase orders with warehouse integration if they're partially shipped or received.  
* Drop shipments.
* Special orders.
* Assembly orders.
* Service contracts.  
* Credit memos.
* Return orders.
* Prices on items (master data)
* Prices on sales prices (master data)
* Business posting groups on customers and vendors.

### To prepare VAT rate change conversions

Before you set up the VAT rate change tool, make the following preparations.

* If you have transactions that use different rates, separate them into different groups. Do that either by creating new general ledger accounts for each rate or by using data filters to group transactions according to rate.  
* If you create new general ledger accounts, you must create new general posting groups.  
* To reduce the number of documents that get converted, post as many documents as possible. The fewer unposted documents you have, the better.  
* Back up data.

### To set up the VAT rate change tool

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Rate Change Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Master Data**, **Journals**, and **Documents** FastTabs, choose a posting group value from the option list for needed fields. For each group, choose whether to convert VAT product posting groups or general product posting groups, or convert both values if they're available for the master data. For some areas, you can also filter to convert only a subset of values, for example, G/L accounts.
3. On the **Unit Price Incl. VAT** FastTab, choose which line types on orders for which you want to update unit prices. Unit prices on lines of type Item and Resource always update.

### To set up product posting group conversion

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Rate Change Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **VAT Rate Change Setup** page, choose either the **VAT Prod. Posting Group Conv.** or **Gen Prod. Posting Group Conv.** action.  
3. In the **From Code** field, enter the current posting group.  
4. In the **To Code** field, enter the new posting group.  

### To perform VAT rate change conversion

You use the VAT rate change tool to manage changes in the standard rate of VAT. You perform VAT and general posting group conversions to change VAT rates and maintain accurate VAT reporting. Depending on your setup, the following changes happen:  

* VAT and general posting groups are converted.  
* Changes are implemented in general ledger accounts, customers, vendors, open documents, journal lines, and so on.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Before you perform VAT rate change conversion, you can test the conversion. To do so, follow these steps, but make sure to clear the **Perform Conversion** and **VAT Rate Change Tool Completed** checkboxes. During test conversion, the **Converted** field in the **VAT Rate Change Log Entry** table is cleared and the **Converted Date** field in the **VAT Rate Change Log Entry** table is blank. After the conversion completes, choose **VAT Rate Change Log Entries** to view the results of the test conversion. Verify each entry before you perform the conversion. In particular, verify transactions that use an old VAT rate.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Rate Change**, and then choose the **VAT Rate Change Setup** link.  
2. Verify that you already set up the VAT product posting group conversion or general product posting group conversion.  
3. Choose the **Perform Conversion** checkbox.  

    > [!IMPORTANT]  
    > Clear the **VAT Rate Change Tool Completed** checkbox. The checkbox is automatically selected when the VAT rate change conversion is completed.  

4. Choose the **Convert** action.  
5. After the conversion is complete, choose the **VAT Rate Change Log Entries** action to view the results of the conversion.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> After the conversion, the **Converted** field in the **VAT Rate Change Log Entry** table is chosen and the **Converted Date** field in the **VAT Rate Change Log Entry** table displays the conversion date.

# Categorize items

To maintain an overview of your items and to help you sort and find items, it's useful to organize your items in item categories.

To find items by characteristics, you can assign item attributes to items and also to item categories. For more information, see [Work with Item Attributes](inventory-how-work-item-attributes.md).
<br><br>  

> [!Video https://learn-video.azurefd.net/vod/player?id=4c02e1d8-7569-4eb4-94cf-105899787978]

## To create an item category
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Item Categories**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Item Categories** page, choose the **New** action.
3. On the **Item Category Card** page, on the **General** FastTab, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
4. On the **Attributes** FastTab, specify any item attributes for the item category. For more information, see [To assign item attributes to item categories](inventory-how-work-item-attributes.md#assign-item-attributes-to-item-categories).

> [!NOTE]  
> If the item category has a parent item category, as indicated by the **Parent Category** field, then any item attributes that are assigned to that parent item category are prefilled on the **Attributes** FastTab.

> [!NOTE]  
> Item attributes that you assign to an item category will automatically apply to the item that the item category is assigned to.

If you change your mind about an item category, you can delete it. However, if the category is assigned to an item, you must remove that assignment beforehand.

## To assign an item category to an item

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the card for the item that you want to assign to an item category.
3. Choose the lookup button in the **Item Category Code** field and select an existing item category. Alternatively, choose the **New** action to first create a new item category as explained in [To create an item category](inventory-how-categorize-items.md#to-create-an-item-category).

As an administrator, you can set up Cues that appear on the users' Role Centers to include an indicator that changes color based on the data values in the Cues.  

The indicator appears as a colored bar along the top border of the Cue tile. It provides a visual signal of the status of the Cue's activity, which can indicate favorable or unfavorable conditions to prompt the user to take action. For example, if a Cue displays ongoing sales invoices, you can set up the indicator to appear green (favorable) when total number of ongoing sales invoices is below 10, and appears red (unfavorable) when the total is greater than 20.  

From the **Cue Setup** page, you set up indicators for all the Cues that are available in the company database. You can set up the indicators to apply to all users in the company or an individual user only. The indicator settings on the **Cue Setup** page act as the default indicator settings. If the **Cue Setup End User** page is made available to users, then they can personalize the indicators settings that you define on the **Cue Setup** page.  

To set up the indicator, you specify up to two threshold values that define three ranges of data values (low, middle, and high) to which you can apply a different color (or style).  

### To set up colored indicators on Cues  
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Cue Setup**, and then choose the related link.  

     The **Cue Setup** page appears. The page lists the indicators that are currently setup up on Cues. Indicators that apply to all users in the company have a blank **User Name** field. Indicators that apply to a specific user include the user's name in the **User Name** field.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  If you set up a company-wide indicator and a user modifies the indicator later on, then a separate entry for the indicator appears in list for that user.  

2. Choose **Edit List** action.  
3. To set up an indicator for a Cue that is not listed on the page, choose the **New** action, and then fill in the fields as described in the following. If you want to modify an existing indicator, go to the next step.  

    |  Field  |  Description  |    
    |---------|---------------|  
    |**User Name**|If you want to set up the indicator for all users, leave this field blank.<br /><br /> If you want to set up the indicator for a specific user, then set this field to the user name.|  
    |**Table No**|Specifies the ID of the table object that contains the Cue. Use the drop down list to find the table. The drop down list includes all Cue tables in the company database.<br /><br /> The **Table Name** field will be automatically filled in based on your selection.|  
    |**Field No**|Specifies the ID of the Cue that you want to set up an indicator on. Use the drop down list to find the Cue that you want. **Note:**  The Cue ID corresponds to the field number that is assigned to the Cue in the table. <br /><br /> The **Field Name** field is automatically filled in based on your selection|  

4. To set up the indicator for a Cue, set the fields as described in the following table.  

    |  Field  |  Description  |    
    |---------|---------------|  
    |**LowStyle**|Specifies the color of the indicator when the Cue's value is below the value of the **Threshold 1** field.|  
    |**LowThreshold**|Specifies the value at or above which the indicator changes to the color specified by the **Middle Range Style** field.|  
    |**MiddleStyle**|Specifies the color of the indicator when Cue's value is greater than or equal to the value of the **Threshold 1** field but less than or equal to the value of the **Threshold 2** field.|  
    |**HighThreshold**|Specifies the value above which the indicator changes to the color specified by the **High Range Style** field.|  
    |**HighStyle**|Specifies the color to use when the Cue's value is above the value of the **Threshold 2** field.|  

     The following table lists the colors that correspond to the options of the **LowStyle**, **MiddleStyle**, and **HighStyle** fields.  

    |  Option  |  Color  |  
    |----------|---------|  
    |**None**|No color (same color as the Cue tile)|  
    |**Favorable**|Green|  
    |**Unfavorable**|Red|  
    |**Ambiguous**|Yellow|  
    |**Subordinate**|Gray|

# Track items with serial, lot, and package numbers

You can assign serial numbers, lot numbers, and package numbers to any outbound or inbound document, and its posted item tracking entries display on the related item ledger entries. You track items on the **Item Tracking Lines** page, which you can open from inbound or outbound documents.

The quantity fields at the top of the **Item Tracking Lines** page display the quantities and sums of item tracking numbers that are defined on the lines. The quantities must correspond to those on the document lines, which is indicated by *0* in the **Undefined** fields.

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] updates the availability information on the **Item Tracking Lines** page when you open the page. It doesn't update the information while you have the page open, even if changes occur in inventory or on other documents during that time.

> [!NOTE]  
> In order for the features described in this article to work, you must set up item tracking. To learn more, go to [Set Up Item Tracking with Serial, Lot, and Package Numbers](inventory-how-setup-item-tracking.md).

## Item tracking availability

When you work with serial, lot, and package numbers, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates availability information and shows it on various item tracking pages. It shows how much of a lot, package, or serial number is used on other documents. This information helps reduce errors and uncertainty caused by double allocations.

On the **Item Tracking Lines** page, a warning icon might display in the **Availability, Lot No.** or **Availability, Serial No.** field for the following reasons:

* If some or all of the quantity you've selected is already used in other documents.
* If the lot or serial number isn't available.

The **Lot No./Serial No.-List**, **Lot No./Serial No.-Availability**, and the **Item Tracking - Select Entries** pages show the quantity of an item that's in use. The following table lists the relevant fields.

|Field|Description|
|-----|-----------|  
|**Total Quantity**|The total number of an item currently in inventory.|
|**Total Requested Quantity**|The total number of items that are requested in this and other documents.|
|**Current Pending Quantity**|The number of items that are requested on the current document but that isn't posted.|
|**Current Requested Quantity**|The number of items that are requested that will be used on the current document|
|**Total Available Quantity**|The total number of items in inventory, minus the quantity of the item that's requested on this and other documents (total requested quantity), and minus the quantity that's requested but not yet posted on this document (current pending quantity).|

If you work on the **Item Tracking Lines** page for a long time, or if there's a lot of activities with the item you're working with, you can choose the **Refresh Availability** action. Also, the availability of the item is automatically rechecked when you close the page to confirm that there aren't availability problems.

## To assign serial or lot numbers during an inbound transaction

You might want to track items from the moment they arrive. In that case, the purchase order is often the central document. However, you can do item tracking from any inbound document and its posted entries display in the related item ledger entries.

The tracking numbers automatically transfer to all outbound warehouse activities.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Either open an existing purchase order or create a new purchase order.
3. Select the document line, and on the **Lines** FastTab, choose the **Line** action, and then choose the **Item Tracking Lines** action to open the **Edit - Item Tracking Lines** page.  

   You can assign serial or lot numbers in the following ways:  
   * Automatically, by selecting **Process** then choosing **Assign Serial No.** or **Assign Lot No.** to assign serial/lot numbers from predefined number series.  
   * Automatically, by selecting **Process** then choosing **Create Customized SN** to assign serial/lot numbers based on number series you define specifically for the arrived items.  
   * Manually, by entering serial or lot numbers directly, for example, the vendor's numbers.  
   * Manually, by assigning a specific number to each item unit.  

4. To assign automatically, choose the **Create Customized SN** action.  
5. In the **Customized SN** field, enter the starting number of a descriptive serial number series. For example **S/N-Vend0001**.  
6. In the **Increment** field, enter 1 to define that each sequential number increases by one.  

    The **Quantity to Create** field contains the line quantity by default, but you can modify it.  

7. Select the **Create New Lot No.** checkbox to organize the new serial numbers in a distinct lot.  
8. Choose the **OK** button.  

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates a lot number with individual serial numbers according to the item quantity on the document line. The number is prefixed with the value you entered in the **Customized SN** field. For example, starting from **S/N-Vend0001**.  

The quantity fields in the header dynamically display the quantities and sums of the item tracking numbers you define on the page. The quantities must correspond to those on the document lines, which is indicated by **0** in the **Undefined** field.  

When you post the document, the item tracking entries transfer to the item ledger entries.

### To handle serial and lot numbers when getting receipt lines from a purchase invoice

When you get posted receipt or shipment lines from related invoices or credit memos, item tracking lines on the warehouse documents transfer automatically. However, they're processed in a special way.

The functionality supports the following inbound processes:  

* **Get Receipt Lines** - from a purchase invoice.  
* **Get Return Shipment Lines** - from a purchase credit memo.  

The functionality supports the following outbound processes:  

* **Get Shipment Lines** - from a sales invoice or combined shipments.  
* **Get Return Receipt Lines** - from a sales credit memo.  

In these cases, the item tracking lines transfer to the invoice or credit memo, but the **Item Tracking Lines** page doesn't let you change the serial or lot numbers. You can only change the quantities.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Invoices**, and then select the related link.  
2. Open a purchase invoice for items that are purchase with serial or lot numbers.  
3. From a purchase invoice line, on the **Lines** FastTab, choose the **Get Receipt Lines** action.  
4. On the **Get Receipt Lines** page, select a receipt line that has item tracking lines, and then choose the **OK** button.  

    The source document is copied to the purchase invoice as a new line, and its item tracking lines are copied to the underlying **Item Tracking Lines** page.  

5. On the purchase invoice, select the transferred receipt line.  
6. On the **Lines** FastTab, choose the **Line** action, and then choose the **Item Tracking Lines** action to find the transferred item tracking lines.  

You can't change the **Serial No.** and **Lot No.** fields. However, you can delete complete lines or change the quantities to match changes on the source line.  

## To assign a serial or lot number during an outbound transaction

Outbound handling of serial or lot numbers is a frequent task in different warehouse processes. There are two ways to add serial and lot numbers to outbound transactions:  

* Select from existing serial or lot numbers. This applies when item tracking numbers are already assigned in an inbound transaction.
* Assign new serial or lot numbers for outbound transactions. This applies when item tracking numbers aren't assigned to items until they're sold and ready to ship.

### To select from existing serial or lot numbers  

When you work with items that require item tracking, and you're creating outbound transactions, you'll typically need to select lot or serial numbers that already exist.

1. From any outbound document, select the line that you want to select serial or lot numbers for.  
2. On the **Lines** FastTab, choose the **Line** action, then **Related Information**, and then select **Item Tracking Lines**.  
3. On the **Item Tracking Lines** page, you have three options for specifying lot or serial number:  

   * Select the **Serial No.** field, and then select a number on the **Serial No. List** page.
   * Select the **Lot No.** field, and then select a number on the **Lot No. List** page. Then, select the **Serial No.** field, and select a number on the **Serial No. List** page.
   * Select the **Process** action, and then choose **Select Entries**. The **Select Entries** page shows all lot and serial numbers along with availability information.

4. In the **Selected Quantity** field, enter the quantity of each lot or serial number to use.
5. Choose the **OK** button. The item tracking information transfers to the **Item Tracking Lines** page.  

The quantity fields in the header dynamically display the quantities and sums of the item tracking numbers you define on the page. The quantities must correspond to those of the document line, which is indicated by **0** in the **Undefined** field.  

When you post the document line, the item tracking information transfers to the associated item ledger entries.

### To assign new serial or lot numbers  

This process applies when items don't have serial or lot numbers while they're in inventory. Instead, you assign item tracking numbers when the items are sold and ready to be shipped. In this case, you'll typically assign numbers from a predefined number series.

1. Select the relevant document, for example a sales invoice or sales order, and on the **Lines** FastTab, choose the **Line** action, then **Related Information**, and then choose the **Item Tracking Lines** action.  

    You can assign item tracking numbers in the following ways:  
    * Automatically, from a predefined number series: Choose the **Assign Serial No.** or **Assign Lot No.** action.  
    * Automatically, based on parameters you define specifically for the outbound item: Choose the **Create Customized SN** action.  
    * Manually, by entering serial or lot numbers without using a number series.  

2. For this procedure, assign a serial number automatically by choosing **Assign Serial No.**  

    The **Quantity to Create** field contains the line quantity by default, but you can change it.  
3. Select the **Create New Lot No.** field to organize the new serial numbers in a distinct lot.  
4. Choose the **OK** button to create a lot number and new individual serial numbers according to the quantity to handle on the related document line.  

The quantity fields at the top dynamically display the quantities and sums of the item tracking numbers that you define on the page. The quantities must correspond to those of the document line, which is indicated by **0** in the **Undefined** field.  

When the document is posted, the item tracking entries transfer to the item ledger entries.

### Assign tracking numbers on source documents

Some companies define specific serial or lot numbers on source document, such as sales orders. For example, if a customer requests a specific lot. When you create the inventory pick or warehouse pick document from an outbound source document where serial or lot numbers are already defined, you can't change any fields on the **Item Tracking Lines** page under the inventory pick. The one exception is the **Qty. to Handle** field. In that case, the inventory pick lines specify the item tracking numbers on individual take and place lines. The quantity is already split into unique serial or lot number combinations because the sales order specifies the item tracking numbers to ship.

## To handle serial and lot numbers on transfer orders

Procedures for handling serial and lot numbers that are being transferred between different locations are similar to those applied when items are sold and purchased.  

However, transfer orders are unique in that shipment and receipt are both done from the same transfer line and use the same instance of the **Item Tracking Lines** page. Item tracking numbers that shipped from one location must be received unchanged at the other location.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Transfer Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the transfer order you want to process. On the **Lines** FastTab, choose the **Line** action, choose the **Item Tracking Lines** action, and then choose the **Shipment** action.  
3. On the **Item Tracking Lines** page, assign or select serial or lot numbers as for any other outbound item transaction.  

    When you handle serial and lot numbers for transfer items, numbers are typically already assigned numbers. Therefore, you'll often choose from existing serial or lot numbers.  

4. Post the transfer order, first ship and then receive, to record that the items are transferred and carry their item tracking entries.  

During the transfer, you can't change values on the **Item Tracking Lines** page.  

## To record additional serial or lot number information

If you need to link special information to an item tracking number, for example, for quality assurance, you can do so on a serial or lot number information card.

1. Open a document that has serial or lot numbers assigned.
2. Open the **Item Tracking Lines** page for the item you want to enter information for.
3. Choose the **Line** action and then, for example, the **Serial No. Information Card** action.  
4. Choose the plus sign **(+)** sign at the top of the list to create a new entry. The **Serial No.** and **Lot No.** fields are prefilled from the item tracking line.
5. Enter a short piece of information in the **Description** field, for example about the condition of the item.  
6. Choose the **Related** action, choose the **Serial No.** action, and then choose the **Comment** action to create a separate comment record.  
7. Select the **Blocked** field to exclude the serial or lot number from any transactions.  

<!--If you create serial numbers in bulk by using the **Create Customized SN** or **Assign Serial No.** actions, you can enable **Create SN Information** and an information card will be created for each tracking line.

Alternatively, you can create an information card when you post journals or documents. On the **Item Tracking Code** page, turn on the **Create SN Info. on posting** or **Create SN Info. on posting** toggles. -->

You can modify created serial or lot information cards later.

## To modify existing serial or lot number information

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select an item that has an item tracking code and has serial or lot number information.
3. From the **Item Card** page, choose the **Related** action, choose the **Related** action, choose the **Entries** action, and then choose **Ledger Entries**.
4. Choose the **Lot No.** or **Serial No.** field. If information exists for the item tracking number, then the **Lot No. Information List** or **Serial No. Information List** page opens.  
5. Select a card, and then choose the **Lot No./Serial No. Information Card** action.  
6. Modify the short description text, the comment record, or the **Blocked** field.  

You can't change the serial or lot numbers or quantities. To do that, you must reclassify the item ledger entry. To learn more about reclassification, go to [To reclassify lot or serial numbers](inventory-how-work-item-tracking.md#to-reclassify-serial-or-lot-numbers).

## To reclassify serial or lot numbers

Reclassifying item tracking for an item means changing a lot or serial number to a new lot or serial number, or changing the expiration date to a new expiration date. If you use lots, you can also merge multiple lots into one. Use an item reclassification journal to do these tasks.

> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] verifies that each line has a unique combination of serial, lot, and/or package numbers. If you want to split a lot, package, or a lot and package into several lots or packages, you must use multiple journal lines.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Item Reclassification Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the line with the relevant information. For more information, see [Count Inventory Using Documents](inventory-how-count-inventory-with-documents.md) or [Count, Adjust, and Reclassify Inventory Using Journals](inventory-how-count-adjust-reclassify.md).
3. Choose the **Item Tracking Lines** action.  
4. In the **Serial Nos.** or **Lot Nos.** field, select the current serial or lot number.  
5. If you want to enter a new item tracking number, enter it in the **New Serial No.** or **New Lot No.** field. If you want, you can merge one or more lots to one new or existing lot.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > When you reclassify expiration dates, items with the earliest expiration dates for outbound transactions are suggested first. To learn more, go to [Picking by FEFO](warehouse-picking-by-fefo.md).  

6. To specify a new expiration date for the serial or lot number, enter it in the **New Expiration Date** field.  

    > [!IMPORTANT]  
    > * If you're reclassifying a lot to the same lot number but with a different expiration date, you must reclassify the entire lot using one item reclassification journal line.
    > * If you're reclassifying more than one lot to one new lot number, meaning that you are merging more than one lot into one new lot, you must enter the same new expiration date for all the lots. 
    > * If you're reclassifying one existing lot to a second existing lot that has a different expiration date, you must use the expiration date from the second lot. 
    > * If you leave the **New Expiration Date** field blank, the lot or serial number will be reclassified with a blank expiration date.  

7. If you have existing information on the old serial or lot number, you can copy it to the new serial or lot number.  

    1. On the **Item Tracking Lines** page, choose the **New Serial No. Information** action or the **New Lot No. Information** action.  
    2. To copy information from the old lot or serial number, choose the **Copy Info** action.  
    3. In the information list page, select the lot or serial number that you would like to copy from, and choose the **OK** button.  

8. If you want to modify the existing information for the lot or serial number, you can record lot or serial information.  
9. Post the journal to link the renewed item tracking numbers or expiration dates to the associated item ledger entry

## Scan barcodes with the Business Central mobile app

[!INCLUDE [barcode-mobile-app](includes/barcode-mobile-app.md)]

On the **Item Tracking Lines** page, if you want to scan several serial, lot, or package barcodes, you can use the **Scan multiple** action. After you scan a barcode, its value is entered in the field on the page and the next quick-entry field becomes available. You can also use the barcode scanner icon to populate specific field.

The following tables list the pages that support barcode scanning for item tracking from the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] mobile app.

|Page  |Field values you can scan  |
|---------|---------|
|Item Tracking Lines     |* Serial No.<br><br>* New Serial No.<br><br>* Lot No.<br><br>* New Lot No.<br><br>* Package No.<br><br>* New Package No.|

# Set up the E-Documents connector with external endpoints

This article explains how to set up E-Documents functionality when connected to external endpoints.

Before you use the functionality that this article describes, you must install the **E-Document Core** app and one of the E-Documents connectors with external endpoints apps. You can use these apps for default integration with the external, non-Microsoft, access points to automate the e-document flow. Because these apps represent only some of the selected connectors, you aren't limited to existing integrations.

## Install an E-Documents connector  

To install an E-Documents connector, follow these steps:

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **E-Document Services**, and then select the related link.
2. Choose the **Install E-Documents integration from AppSource** action to open the **Microsoft AppSource apps** page.
3. Choose the connector you want, and then select the **View on AppSource** action.
4. Install the app from the AppSource.

## Set up the connection

[!INCLUDE[e-documents connectors](includes/edocuments-connectors-include.md)]

Based on the endpoint service provider, the next steps might be different. You can find details about set up parameters for all available service providers [here](finance-edocuments-connectors.md).

## Set up company information

Before you start using e-documents, update your **Company Information** page by completing the following steps:

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Company Information**, and then select the related link.
2. In addition to filling in the usual fields, you must also fill in the following fields:

    | Field name | Description |
    |---|---|
    | SWIFT Code | Specify the SWIFT code (international bank identifier code) of your primary bank. |
    | Bank Branch No. | Specify the bank's four-digit branch number. |
    | VAT Registration No. | Specify the company's value-added tax (VAT) registration number. |

3. Close the page.

## Set up customers to receive e-documents

To enable customers to receive your e-documents, complete the following steps:

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customers**, and then select the related link.
2. Open the **Customer** card.
3. In addition to filling in the usual fields, in the **GLN** field, specify the customer you send electronic documents to.
4. Turn on the **Use GLN in Electronic Documents** toggle to indicate whether to use the global location number (GLN) as an identification number in electronic documents.
5. Close the page.

## Other setup

Before you start to work with e-documents, set up the e-document **workflows** and **document sending profiles** to use your workflows. After the service connection is established, you can start to use your e-document solution.

## Available service providers

Microsoft wants to encourage access point providers to add their connectors on top of our **E-Document Core** app.

The following list of access point providers are covered by default:  

- Avalara
- B2BRouter
- Logiq
- Pagero
- SignUp

Microsoft has no contractual obligations with these providers. Therefore, you must make a contract with them to get the necessary credentials. The services might require extra licensing or payments for their services.

# Set up or change the Chart of Accounts

The chart of accounts (COA) shows the ledger accounts that store your financial data. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes a standard COA that is ready to support your business. You can, however, change the default accounts, and you can add new accounts.
<br><br>  

> [!Video https://learn-video.azurefd.net/vod/player?id=944c65b0-9b0f-4d35-b330-de2fad57143a]

## Add or change accounts

From the COA, you can open each general ledger (G/L) account and add or change settings. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)] 

If necessary, you can use more than one line for a general ledger account name. On the **G/L Account Card** page, in the **Account** group, choose **Extended Texts**, and then fill in one or more lines with the account name and copied text.  

For accounts of the **Total** account type, you must fill in the **Totaling** field. For **End-Total** accounts, this field is filled in automatically by the Indent function. After you set up the accounts, choose the **Process** action, then choose **Indent Chart of Accounts**.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you have entered definitions in the **Totaling** fields for **End-Total** accounts before executing the indent function, you must enter them again because the function overwrites the values in all **End-Total** fields.

## Delete accounts

You can delete a general ledger account. However, before you delete it, the following conditions must be true:  

* The balance on the account must be zero.  
* The **Allow G/L Acc. Deletion Before** field must be set on the **General Ledger Setup** page, and the account must not have ledger entries on or after that date.  
* If the **Check G/L Account Usage** field on the **General Ledger Setup** page is selected, the account must not be used in any posting groups or posting setup.  

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] prevents you from deleting a general ledger account that stores data that is needed in the chart of accounts.  

You can also specify when to allow people to delete accounts. On the **General Ledger Setup** page, the **Block Deletion of G/L Accounts** toggle works together with the date in the **Check G/L Acc. Deletion After** field to act as an extra validation. If you turn on the **Block Deletion of G/L Accounts** toggle, you can't delete G/L accounts with ledger entries after the date in the **Check G/L Acc. Deletion After** field. To delete such an account, someone with access to the **General Ledger Setup** page must turn off the **Block Deletion of G/L Accounts** toggle.  

Turning on the **Block Deletion of G/L Accounts** field is often a best practice, as is setting the date in the **Check G/L Acc. Deletion After** field, for example, to the date through which regulations require you to store finance data.  

### Video guidance

This video shows how to specify whether, and when, people can delete G/L accounts.

# Set Up Finance Charge Terms

When a customer does not pay by the due date, you can have finance charges calculated automatically and add them to the overdue amounts on the customer's account. You can inform customers of the added charges by sending finance charge memos. But first, you must set up a code that represents each finance charge calculation. Then you can enter this code in the Fin. Charge Terms Code field on customer cards.  

## Finance charge terms

You must set up finance charge terms for each finance charge calculation, and then assign the terms to the customer in the **Fin. Charge Terms Code** field on the **Customer** page.

Finance charges can be calculated using either the average daily balance or the balance due methods.

* Average daily balance  
  
  The number of days the payment is overdue is taken into account:  
  *Average Daily Balance method* - *Finance Charge* = *Overdue Amount* x *(Days Overdue / Interest Period)* x *(Interest Rate/100)*

* Balance due  
  
  The finance charge is a percentage of the overdue amount:  
  *Balance Due method* - *Finance Charge* = *Overdue Amount* x *(Interest Rate / 100)*

Additionally, each term in the Finance Charge Terms table is linked to a subtable, the Finance Charge Text table. For each set of finance charge terms, you can define a beginning and/or an ending text to include on the finance charge memo.

### To set up finance charge terms

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Finance Charge Terms**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary.
3. To use more than one combination of finance charge terms, set up a code for each one.

    For each finance charge term, you can specify individual conditions that can include additional fees in both LCY and in foreign currency. You can define additional fees in foreign currencies for each term on the **Finance Charge Terms** page.
4. Choose the **Currencies** action.
5. On the **Currencies for Fin. Chrg. Terms** page, define for each term a currency code and an additional fee.

    > [!NOTE]  
    > When you create finance charges in a foreign currency, the foreign currency conditions that you set up here will be used to create finance charge memos. If there are no foreign currency finance charge conditions set up, the LCY finance charge conditions specified on the **Finance Charge Terms** page will be used and then converted to the relevant currency.

    For each finance charge term, you can specify text that will be printed before (**Beginning Text**) or after (**Ending Text**) on the entries on the finance charge memo.  
6. Choose the **Beginning Text** or **Ending Text** actions respectively, and fill on the **Finance Charge Text** page.
7. To automatically insert related values in the resulting finance charge text, enter the following placeholders in the **Text** field.

|Placeholder|Value|  
|-----------------|-----------|  
|%1|Content of the **Document Date** field on the finance charge memo header|  
|%2|Content of the **Due Date** field on the finance charge memo header|  
|%3|Content of the **Interest Rate** field on the related finance charge terms|  
|%4|Content of the **Remaining Amount** field on the finance charge memo header|  
|%5|Content of the **Interest Amount** field on the finance charge memo header|  
|%6|Content of the **Additional Fee** field on the finance charge memo header|  
|%7|The total amount of the reminder|  
|%8|Content of the **Currency Code** field on the finance charge memo header|  
|%9|Content of the **Posting Date** field on the finance charge memo header|

# Manage Interactions for Segments
The **Segment** page is a type of worksheet where you can:

* Create segments.
* Save the segmentation criteria you have used to select contacts.
* Log the segment and record interactions involving the contacts within the segment.

## Segmenting
There are several ways to create segments:

* You can manually enter the contacts you want to include in the segment in the segment lines.
* You can select contacts.
* You can reuse a logged segment as the basis to create a new one.
* You can reuse saved segmentation criteria.

## Interactions
On the **Segment** page, you can create interactions for several contacts simultaneously. For example, you can merge a segment with a Microsoft Word document, so that you can send a letter to all the contacts in the segment.

You can specify information about the interaction for the segment on the **Segment** header. For example, you can decide which interaction template you want to use for all the contacts, specify a description, a correspondence type, and so on. However, you can modify this information in the segment line for each particular contact, for example, by specifying another description for one contact. If you are merging a segment with a Microsoft Word document, you can personalize the document to be sent for one or several of the contacts within the segment, for example, by adding individualized comments to the document.

## Logging
On the **Segment** page, when you choose **Log**, the application records the interactions on the **Interaction Log Entry** page, and logs the segment. After you have logged the segment, you can only find it on the **Logged Segments** page.

On the **Logged Segments** page, you can decide to create a follow-up segment containing the same contacts as the segment you have logged.

# Administration Tasks

Central administration tasks are usually performed by one role in the company. The scope of these tasks can depend on the company's size and the administrator's job responsibilities. These tasks can include managing database synchronization of job and email queues, setting up users, and customizing the user interface.  

Entering the correct setup values from the start is important to the success of any new business software. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes a number of setup guides that help you set up core data. For more information, see [Setting Up Business Central](setup.md).

> [!NOTE]
> You can use the data migration tools to migrate existing data to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online. Alternatively, you can set up a new company in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with configuration packages to shorten deployment times, improve quality of implementation, introduce a repeatable approach to implementations, and enhance productivity by automating and simplifying recurring tasks. For more information, see [Migrate On-Premises Data to Business Central Online](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/migrate-data).

You can support your setup decisions with some general recommendations for selected setup fields that are known to potentially cause the solution to be inefficient if defined incorrectly.  

A super user or an administrator can set up the Data Exchange Framework to enable users to export and import data in bank and payroll files, for example for various cash management processes. For more information, see [Exchanging Data Electronically](across-data-exchange.md).

# Invoicing prepayments

[!INCLUDE [prepayment_def](includes/prepayment_def.md)]

[!INCLUDE [prepayment_req](includes/prepayment_req.md)]

For example, you can specify a total amount for the entire order, or you can distribute the prepayment across each line on the order. You can also send additional prepayment invoices if, for example, additional items are added to the order. You can increase quantities or add new lines to an order after issuing a prepayment, and then you can post another prepayment invoice.  

> [!NOTE]
> If you want to delete a line for which a prepayment has already been invoiced, you must issue a prepayment credit memo before you can delete the line.

The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the articles that describe them.

# Quote an Assemble-to-Order Sale

You can use assembly management to customize an assembly item to a customer's request during the sales process. For more information, see [Sell Items Assembled to Order](assembly-how-to-sell-items-assembled-to-order.md).  

As when you sell any other type of item, you can also create a sales quote for a customized assembly item before converting it to a sales order. This process involves several extra steps when you compare it to creating a regular sales quote, and it uses a variation of a linked assembly order, which is an assembly quote.

> [!NOTE]  
>  Like all types of quotes, the quantities on assembly quotes are not used in availability, planning, or reservations.  

## To create a sales quote for an assemble-to-order item

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Quote**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Create a sales quote line with one line for an assembly item. For more information, see [Make Sales Quotes](sales-how-make-offers.md).  
3.  In the **Qty. to Assemble to Order** field, enter the full quantity.

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  You should not quote a partial quantity. Therefore, you must enter the same quantity that you entered in the **Quantity** field on the sales quote line.  

4.  On the **Lines** FastTab, choose **Line**, choose **Assemble to Order**, and then choose **Assemble-to-Order Lines**. Alternatively, choose the **Qty. to Assemble to Order** field on the line.  
5.  On the **Assemble-to-Order Lines** page, review or modify the assembly order lines according to the quote that the customer is requesting. If you want to view more information, choose the **Show Document** action to open the complete blanket quote order. You cannot change the contents of most fields, and you cannot post.  
6.  When you have adjusted the assembly order lines according to the quote, close the **Assemble-to-Order Lines** page to return to the **Sales Quote** page.  
7.  If the customer accepts the quote, then create a sales order for the quoted assembly item. For more information, see [Make Sales Quotes](sales-how-make-offers.md). The linked assembly quote and any customizations are linked to that new sales order to prepare for assembly of the item or items to be sold.

# Viewing table information

The **8700 Table Information** page provides information about the number of records in all system and business tables in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], and how much data each table contains.

This information is useful for troubleshooting performance problems because it shows the distribution of data sizes across tables.

## View table information

To open this page, select the ![Search for Page or Report.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Table Information**, and then choose the related link.

The following table describes the information provided for each table:

|Column|Description|
|------|-----------|
|Company Name|The name of the company, if any, that the table belongs to.|
|Table Name|The name of the table.|
|Table No.|The ID of the table.|
|No. of Records|The total number of records stored in the table.|
|Record Size|The average record size in KB/record. The value is calculated using the following formula: 1024(Size)/(No. of Records). |
|Size (KB)|The total amount of space the table occupies in the database. This value is the sum of the values in the Data Size and Index Size fields.|
|Data Size (KB)|How much space the data in the base table occupies in the database.|
|Index Size (KB)|How much space the table indexes (keys) on the base table occupy in the database.|
|Compression|The type of compression, **Row**, **Page**, or **None** that is applied to the table in the database. To learn more, go to [Data compression](/sql/relational-databases/data-compression/data-compression?).|

> [!NOTE]
> If you delete data in a table, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] starts several processes behind the scenes to make sure that everything is cleaned up in your database. The values on the Table Information page don't update until those processes are complete, which can take a while. The amount of time it takes can vary, depending on the size of your database.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The **Table Information** page shows data and index (key) sizes for the base table. It doesn't include the sizes for *indexed views* used to maintain SIFT totals and it doesn't include the data and index sizes used by table extensions. Furthermore, the sum of table sizes doesn't match the total capacity used because it displays the data size, not the actual allocated size. Allocated space is always larger than used space to avoid having to allocate space on every insert, which would limit performance significantly.

# Development of Validated Localization apps

This article describes the requirements and guidelines for developing a Validated Localization app for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## What is a Validated Localization app?

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is available [globally in 170+ markets](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/compliance/apptest-countries-and-translations?toc=/dynamics365/business-central/toc.json). In some markets, Microsoft works with independent software vendor (ISV) partners to localize [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] through localization apps that we make available on [Microsoft AppSource](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2081646). For those regions, localizations can be available through preferred localization app program. Preferred localization apps program recognizes those apps, which are built according to Microsoft quality guidelines. ISV partners who comply with those program requirements and guidelines can benefit technically and commercially to serve their resellers and customers.  

In the following sections, you can find requirements and guidelines. You can reach out to the program team if you want to participate in this program and comply with the below requirements by contacting us through [Microsoft localization team](mailto:d365bcloc@microsoft.com).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Validated Localization apps initiative is currently being rolled out as a pilot program. The following requirements and benefits can change based upon the partner and customer feedback.  

Apps in the Validated Localization pilot program contain a set of functionalities addressing local regulatory requirements that fall within one of the categories in the following list.  

- **Regulatory requirements** - local functionality that helps businesses fulfill their legal requirements, such as tax reporting, local E-invoicing formats, local GAAP, and other regulatory requirements.
- **National standards requirement** – local functionality that addresses local standards, such as address formats, national banking formats, or local interpretations of global standards.
- **Local language** - local language in the localization app, but also for a base app if this language isn't currently on the list of [supported languages](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/compliance/apptest-countries-and-translations?toc=/dynamics365/business-central/toc.json).

> [!NOTE]
> Local market needs or industry requirements should not be included in the preferred localization apps. If apps contain these functionalities, the apps can't be approved as Validated Localization apps.

> [!NOTE]
> Local functionality is beneficial to the productivity business processes in a country and thereby adds value to a business but isn't required from a regulatory perspective, such as specific banking and payment formats, expense reports, HR features, and payroll. Similar smaller or bigger, and nice-to-have features should be isolated into other apps. If apps contain these functionalities, they aren't approved as Validated Localization apps.

## Validated Localization app business requirements  

- The Validated Localization App provider complies with all requirements to be a CSP indirect provider.  
- The Validated Localization App provider brings to market a minimum of offerings across five countries/regions, which bundle Dynamics 365 Business Central with a Validated Localization App.
- The Validated Localization App provider has a minimum of 10 [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online customers with production environments, which are actively using the Validated Localization App.
- The Validated Localization App provider submits a business plan on a yearly basis to the program v-team. The plan includes planned marketing and readiness activities to promote the bundled offering with the CSP Indirect Resellers in applicable countries/regions. Plan can be submitted at the start of each quarter to [Microsoft localization team](mailto:d365bcloc@microsoft.com).  
- The Validated Localization Apps are available to all customers and partners who want to benefit from them.
- The Validated Localization App provider engages in recurring workstreams with Microsoft.
- The Validated Localization App provider must maintain its status as an Embedded Localization Partner.  
- The Validated Localization App provider agrees to continuously adhere to the business, functional, and technical requirements outlined on this page.

## Validated Localization app functional and technical requirements  

### Functionality requirements

In addition to the technical requirements for the preferred localization app, the minimum viable product scope for preferred localization app is:  

- Local Regulatory Features:  
  - Legal requirements.
  - Officially mandatory features.
  - Horizontal only features (not industry-specific).  
  - Applicable in most businesses.  
  - Within the following blueprint:
    - Areas of the most frequent legislative changes.
    - Already tracked as a localization in Microsoft localizations.
    - Feature references – seldom new.  
    - No vendor or bank specific formats, payroll, or similar.
    - No global features not built by Microsoft.
- Translations:
  - Translation of a localization app to local languages.
  - Translation of a base app to local languages if the language isn't already [supported](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/compliance/apptest-countries-and-translations?toc=/dynamics365/business-central/toc.json).  
  - Translation of the localization app's documentation to local languages.
- Even though they're both part of localization, we recommended that National Standard Features (local part) are built as separate apps from Local Regulatory Features.
- Demo data in the local language for the specific market.
- All features must be designed with a basic user interface. They're intended primarily for the SMB market.  
- Avoid building new features if the same or similar functionality is already in the base app. For example, electronic invoicing, audit exports, VAT features, data exchange, and others. Most of the functionality is common to all countries/regions, but there are local rules or business formats that are extensions of global frameworks or formats. Instead of building new features, extend existing ones.  
- Prepare setup guides (wizards) for areas that are complex to set up to help users enable, discover, and have good first experience using your localization app.  
- Partners must provide functional documentation for all aspects of their localization.  

### Technical requirements  

The following are requirements that you must meet before submitting the Validated Localization app as an extension for validation. This list doesn’t change the [technical validation list](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-checklist-submission) and only extends requirements from there.  

- Providers must build the Validated Localization app based on the W1 base app.  
- Providers must follow Microsoft lifecycle and support policies.   
- Mandatory test automation must cover a minimum 80% of code and all business processes that change with the Validated Localization app must be covered by test automation.  
- Providers must update and/or test its Validated Localization app before the official launch of new release (minimum with the RC before new release) to confirm there are no issues. 
- All objects in the Validated Localization app code must be in English.   
- The Validated Localization app providers must follow Microsoft policy for obsolete objects and breaking changes and best practices for deprecation of the AL Code.  
- The Validated Localization app providers should add new events if required by the market (other implementation partners or customers) if it makes reasonable business sense. The events must follow Microsoft policy and practice. Otherwise, the validated localization app providers must provide a response to justify why it doesn't make reasonable business sense to add them.
- The Validated Localization app providers must provide written test scenarios in English and enable Microsoft to do manual testing if required by Microsoft.  
- If a Validated Localization app extends the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] data model with new tables and/or fields, the Validated Localization app provider must set the **DataClassification** property correctly.

> [!NOTE]  
> You can also create an integration if you find it beneficial to have some functionality placed outside the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] environment and instead connect to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] using for example, APIs or web services.

# Reconcile payments using automatic application

The **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page specifies payments, either incoming or outgoing, that have been recorded as transactions on your online bank account or on a payment service. You can apply the payments to related open customer, vendor, and bank account ledger entries. Fill in the journal by importing a bank statement as a bank feed or file or by manually entering transactions that you make through your payment service.

> [!NOTE]
> The page offers automatic matching functionality that applies payments to their related open entries based on a matching of data on a bank statement line (journal line) with data on one or more open entries. Note that you can overwrite the suggested automatic applications, and you can choose to not use automatic application at all. For more information, see step 7.

A payment reconciliation journal is related to one bank account in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The bank account represents the online bank account where the payment transactions are recorded. Any open bank account ledger entries related to the applied customer or vendor ledger entries will be closed when you choose the **Post Payments and Reconcile Bank Account** action. The bank account will be automatically reconciled for payments that you post with the journal.

If you use the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page to register and apply customer payments, you can set up the journal to use a specific number series. Afterward, you can specify the number series in the **Payment Reconciliation No. Series** field on a bank account. Using a dedicated number series can make it easier to identify any entries that were posted through the journal.

Similar to other journals, when you correct posted entries you can reverse entries that were posted through the payment reconciliation journal from the **G/L Register** page. For example, you might want to reverse entries for payments you applied to the wrong customer. You must first un-apply the posted customer ledger entries. Then you can use the **Reverse Register** action in the **G/L Register** page to reverse the journal that posted the payments. Alternatively, on the **Posted General Journals** page, you can use the **Copy Selected Lines to Journal** action to reverse specific lines from the posted payment reconciliaiton journal. 

When you use automatic application, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] recognizes bank ledger entries that have already been posted, which helps prevent double-posting.

You can import bank transactions as .csv bank files or other format that your bank provides. If you want to import bank statements as bank feeds, you must first enable a dedicated bank integration service, and then link the bank account to its related online bank account. The payment reconciliation journal will then automatically detect bank feeds when you choose the **Import Bank Transactions** action. In addition, you can set a bank account up to automatically import new bank statement feeds every hour. Transactions for payments that have already been posted as applied and/or reconciled won't be imported. You can use the Envestnet Yodlee Bank Feeds service for to get those transactions, which is preinstalled in some country versions of [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)]. For more information, see [Set Up the Envestnet Yodlee Bank Feeds Service](bank-how-setup-bank-statement-service.md). Alternatively, a Microsoft partner can help you meet your business or country requirements.

The **Map Text to Account** action lets you set up mappings between text on payments and specific debit, credit, and balancing accounts so that such payments are posted to the specified accounts when you post the payment reconciliation journal. Mapping is useful, for example, for recurring cash receipts or expenses, such as frequent purchases of car fuel or bank fees and interest, that regularly occur on the bank statement and don't need a related business document. (See step 10) For more information, see [Map text on recurring payments to accounts for automatic reconciliation](receivables-how-map-text-recurring-payments-accounts-auto-reconcilliation.md).

Journal lines might have no suggested application, which can happen for various reason. For example, because a document is missing, or a customer overpaid and there's an excess amount after applying the payment on another journal line. For such cases, you can use the **Transfer Difference to Account** action to create and post the missing general ledger entry, for example for a refund, that is needed to apply the payment to. (See step 11) For more information, see [Reconcile payments that can't be applied](receivables-how-reconcile-payments-cannot-apply-auto.md).

You use the **Apply Automatically** function either automatically when you import a bank file or feed with payment transactions or when you activate it, to apply payments to their related open entries based on a matching of text on a bank statement line (journal line) with text on one or more open entries. This automation is based on rules that you define on the **Payment Application Rules** page, where you also define whether an application suggestion requires review. For more information, see [Set up rules for automatic application of payments](receivables-how-set-up-payment-application-rules.md).

On journal lines where a payment has been applied automatically to one or more open entries, the **Match Confidence** field has a value of **Low**, **Medium**, or **High** to indicate the quality of the data matching that the suggested payment application is based on.

Some payment applications require your review as defined by the used matching rule, such as lines with **Low** match confidence. Other lines require your review and manual change because there's a value in the **Difference** field. To review one or more payment applications, choose the **Lines to Review** or **Lines with Difference** field at the bottom. The **Payment Application Review** page opens showing all relevant information about the customer or vendor that the payment is applied to, the matching details, and actions to process the line, such as the **Accept Application** action. (See steps 7 and 8)

For each journal line on the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page, you can open the **Payment Application** page to see all candidate open entries for the payment and view detailed information for each entry about the data matching that a payment application is based on. Here, you can manually apply payments or reapply payments that were applied automatically to a wrong entry. (See step 10) For more information, see [Review, or apply payments after automatic application](receivables-how-review-apply-payments-auto-application.md).

> [!NOTE]  
> You can start the bank transactions import at the same time as you open the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page for an existing journal. The following procedure describes how to import bank transactions into the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page after you have created a new journal.

## To reconcile payments using automatic application
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Payment Reconciliation Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. To work in a new payment reconciliation journal, choose the **New Journal** action.
3. On the **Payment Bank Account List** page, select the bank account that you want to reconcile payments for, and then choose the **OK** button.
   The **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page opens prepared for the selected bank account.
4. Choose the **Import Bank Transactions** action.
   If the bank account for the selected journal isn't set up for importing bank transactions, [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] will help you do that.
5. On the **Select a file to import** page, select the file that contains the bank transactions for payments that you want to reconcile, and then choose the **Open** button.  
6. If the Envestnet Yodlee Bank Feeds service is enabled, on the **Bank Statement Filter** page that opens automatically, specify the date interval for the bank statements to be imported.

    The **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page is filled with lines for payments representing bank transactions in the imported bank statement.

     On lines for payments that have been automatically applied to related open entries, the **Match Confidence** field indicates the quality of the data matching on which the suggested payment application is based. Also, the **Account Name**, **Account Type**, and **Account No.** fields show information about the customer or vendor that the payment is applied to.

    The automatic applications, the matching qualities, and whether lines require review are controlled by rules. You can edit the rules to adjust the results. For more information, see [Set Up Rules for Automatic Application of Payments](receivables-how-set-up-payment-application-rules.md).

7. To review, accept/remove, or manually change multiple payment applications that have a value in the **Difference** field, choose the **Lines with Difference** action at the bottom.

    The **Payment Application Review** page opens and shows the first application to review. The next application to review will be shown on the page as you process the preceding one. The review includes information about the customer or vendor that the payment is applied to, the matching details, and actions to process the line, such as the **Accept Application** and **Apply Manually** actions.

8. To review, accept or remove, or manually change multiple payment applications that the rule has set to be reviewed, choose the **Lines to Review** action. 

9. To change an automatic application, select a journal line, and then choose the **Apply Manually** action to reapply or apply the payment manually on the **Payment Application** page. For more information, see [Review or apply payments after automatic application](receivables-how-review-apply-payments-auto-application.md).

10. Select an unapplied journal line for a recurring cash receipt or expense, such as a car gasoline purchase, and then choose the **Map Text to Account** action. For more information, see [Map text on recurring payments to accounts for automatic reconciliation](receivables-how-map-text-recurring-payments-accounts-auto-reconcilliation.md).

    When you've finished your mapping of payment text to accounts, choose the **Apply Manually** action.

    When text-to-account mapping is set up, the resulting automatic payment application will contain **High - Text-to-Account Mapping** in the **Match Confidence** field.

11. For a journal line has no suggested application because no ledger entry exists that it can be applied to, choose the **Transfer Difference to Account** action to create and post the missing general ledger entry that is needed to apply the payment to. For more information, see [Reconcile payments that can't be applied.](receivables-how-reconcile-payments-cannot-apply-auto.md)

12. When no more lines require review and the **Difference** field is blank on all lines, choose the **Post** action, and then choose one of the following options:

    - **Post Payments and Reconcile Bank Accounts** - To post the payments as applied and also close the related bank account ledger entries as reconciled.
    - **Post Payments Only** - To only post the payments as applied, but leave the related bank account ledger entries open. Required that you reconcile the bank account separately,  for example: For more information, see [Reconcile bank accounts](bank-how-reconcile-bank-accounts-separately.md).
    - **Test Report** - To review the result of posting before you post. The **Bank Account Statement** report opens and shows the same fields as at the bottom of the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page.

When you post the payment reconciliation journal, the applied open entries are closed. The customer, vendor, or general ledger accounts are updated. For payments on journal lines based on text-to-account mapping, the specified customer, vendor, and general ledger accounts are updated. For all journal lines, bank account ledger entries are created. If you choose the **Post Payments and Reconcile Bank Account** action, any open bank account ledger entries related to the applied customer or vendor ledger entries will be closed. This means that the bank account is automatically reconciled for payments that you post with the journal.

You can compare the value in the **Balance on Bank Account After Posting** field together with the value in the **Statement Ending Balance** field to track when the bank account is reconciled based on payments that you post.

> [!NOTE]  
>   If you do not want to reconcile the bank account from the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page, then you must use the **Bank Account Reconciliation** page. For more information, see [Reconcile bank accounts](bank-how-reconcile-bank-accounts-separately.md).

# Design details: Inbound warehouse flow

The inbound flow in a warehouse begins when items arrive in the warehouse of the company location, either received from external sources or from another company location. You can receive physical and non-inventory items. To learn more about receiving non-inventory items, go to [Post non-inventory items](#post-non-inventory-items).

In principle, the process of receiving inbound orders consists of two activities:

* Receive items at the dock, identify them, match them to a source document, and record the received quantity.
* Put away items in stock, and record the place you put them.

The source documents for inbound warehouse flow are:

* Purchase orders  
* Inbound transfer orders  
* Sales return orders  

> [!NOTE]
> Production and assembly output also represent inbound source documents. Learn more about handling production and assembly output for internal processes at [Design Details: Internal Warehouse Flows](design-details-internal-warehouse-flows.md).  

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you receive items and put them away using one of four methods, as described in the following table.

|Method|Inbound Process|Require Receipts|Require Put-aways|Complexity Level (Learn more at [Warehouse Management Overview](design-details-warehouse-management.md))|  
|------------|---------------------|--------------|----------------|------------|  
|A|Post receipt and put-away from the order line|||No dedicated warehouse activity.|  
|B|Post receipt and put-away from an inventory put-away document||Turned on|Basic: Order-by-order.|  
|C|Post receipt and put-away from a warehouse receipt document|Turned on||Basic: Consolidated receive/ship posting for multiple orders.|  
|D|Post receipt from a warehouse receipt document and post put-away from a warehouse put-away document|Turned on|Turned on|Advanced|  

Selecting an approach depends on your company's practices and level of organizational complexity. The following are some examples that might help you decide.

* In an order-by-order warehouse environment, where most of the warehouse staff works directly with order documents, you might decide to use method A. 
* An order-by-order warehouse that has a more complex put-away process, or where warehouse staff separates their put-away activities from the order document, might use method B.
* Companies that need to plan the handling of multiple orders may find it helpful to use warehouse receipt documents, methods C and D.  

In methods A, B, and C, receiving and putting away are combined in one step when posting documents as received. In method D, the receipt is posted first to record the increase of inventory and that items are available for sale. The warehouse worker then registers the put-away to make the items available to pick for outbound orders. 

> [!NOTE]
> While warehouse put-aways and inventory put-aways sound similar, they're different documents and are used in different processes.
> * The inventory put-away used in method B, together with registering put-away information, also posts the receipt of the source document.
> * The warehouse put-away used in method D can't be posted and only registers the put-away. The registration makes the items available for the further processing but doesn't post the receipt. In the inbound flow, the warehouse put-away requires a warehouse receipt.

## No dedicated warehouse activity

The following articles provide information about how to process receipts for source documents if you don't have dedicated warehouse activities.

* [Record Purchases](purchasing-how-record-purchases.md)
* [Transfer Orders](inventory-how-transfer-between-locations.md)
* [Process Sales Return Orders](sales-how-process-sales-returns-orders.md)

## Basic warehouse configurations  

In a basic warehouse configuration, the **Require Put-away** toggle is turned on, but the **Require Receipt** toggle is turned off on the **Location Card** page for the location.

The following diagram illustrates the inbound warehouse flows by document type in basic warehouse configurations. The numbers in the diagram correspond with the steps in the sections following the diagram.  

:::image type="content" source="media/design_details_warehouse_management_inbound_basic_flow.png" alt-text="The basic inbound flow in a warehouse.":::

### 1: Release a source document to create a request for an inventory put-away  

When you receive items, release the source document, such as a purchase order or an inbound transfer order. Releasing the document makes the items available to be put away. You can also create inventory put-away documents for individual order lines, in a push fashion, based on bins and quantities to handle.  

### 2: Create an inventory put-away  

On the **Inventory Put-away** page, in a pull fashion, you can get the pending source document lines based on inbound warehouse requests. In a push fashion, you can also create inventory put-away lines when you create the source document.  

### 3: Post an inventory put-away  

On each line for items that have been put away, partially or fully, fill in the **Quantity** field and then post the inventory put-away. Source documents that are related to the inventory put-away are posted as received.  

* Positive item ledger entries are created.
* Warehouse entries are created for locations that require a bin code on all item transactions.
* The put-away request is deleted, if it's fully handled. For example, the **Quantity Received** field on the inbound source document line is updated.
* A posted receipt document is created that reflects the purchase order, for example, and the received items.  

## Advanced warehouse configurations  

To use an advanced warehouse configuration, turn on the **Require Receipt** toggle on the Location Card page for the location. The **Require Put-away** toggle is optional.

The following diagram illustrates the inbound warehouse flow by document type. The numbers in the diagram correspond with the steps in the sections following the diagram.  

:::image type="content" source="media/design_details_warehouse_management_inbound_advanced_flow.png" alt-text="The advanced inbound flow in a warehouse.":::

### 1: Release the source document  

When you receive items, release the source document, such as the purchase order or an inbound transfer order. Releasing the document makes the items available to be put away. The put away will contain references to the source document type and number.

### 2: Create a warehouse receipt  

On the **Warehouse Receipt** page, get the inbound source document lines. You can combine several source document lines in one warehouse receipt document. Fill in the **Qty. to Handle** field and select the receiving zone and bin, if necessary.  

### 3: Post the warehouse receipt  

Post the warehouse receipt to create positive item ledger entries. The **Quantity Received** field on the inbound source document line is updated.  

If the **Require Put-away** toggle is not turned on on the location card, this is where the process stops. Otherwise, posting the inbound source document makes the items available to be put away. The put away contains references the source document type and number.  

### 4: (Optional) Generate put-away worksheet lines

Get warehouse put-away lines in the **Put-away Worksheet** based on posted warehouse receipts or operations that produce output. On the lines you'll put-away, specify the following information:

* The bins to take items from.
* The bins to put items in.
* How many units to handle.

The bins can be predefined by the setup of the warehouse location or the resource that performed the operation.  

When all put-aways are planned and assigned to warehouse workers, generate the warehouse put-away documents. Fully assigned put-away lines are deleted from the **Put-away Worksheet**.  

> [!NOTE]  
> If the **Use Put-away Worksheet** toggle is not turned on on the location card, warehouse put-away documents are created directly based on posted warehouse receipts. In that case, this step isn't needed.  

### 5: Create a warehouse put-away document

Create a warehouse put-away document in a pull fashion, based on the posted warehouse receipt. Alternatively, create the warehouse put-away document and assign it to a warehouse worker in a push fashion.  

### 6: Register a warehouse put-away

On each line for items that have been put away, partially or fully, fill in the **Quantity** field on the **Warehouse Put-away** page, and then register the warehouse put-away.  

* Warehouse entries are created for locations that require a bin code on all item transactions.
* The warehouse put-away lines are deleted, if they're fully handled.
* The warehouse put-away document remains open until you register the full quantity of the related posted warehouse receipt.
* The **Qty. Put Away** field on posted warehouse receipt order lines is updated.

# Troubleshoot and correct dimensions

Financial reporting and analysis views often rely on data from dimensions. Despite the safeguards that are available, sometimes a mistake happens that can lead to inaccuracies. This article describes some of the typical errors, and explains how to correct dimension assignments on posted transactions so that financial reports are accurate.

## Troubleshooting dimensions errors

When you post documents or journal lines that contain dimensions, various errors might occur. However, they're typically related to an incorrect dimension setup or assignment.

> [!NOTE]
> In the following list of potential error messages, the *%X* codes are placeholders for the data variables that the actual message will contain in the UI depending on the context. For example, *%1 %2 is blocked.* could appear in the UI as "Dimension Code AREA is blocked.".  

|Issue|Error Message|Possible Solution|
|-----|-------------|-----------------|
|Blocked dimension|%1 %2 is blocked.|-Find nonposted documents containing the dimension set with the blocked dimension and unblock it.<br />-Remove the dimension set line for the blocked dimension.|
|Deleted dimension|%1 %2 can't be found.|-Restore the missing dimension.<br />-Find nonposted documents containing the dimension set with the missing dimension and add it.<br />-Remove the dimension set line for the missing dimension.|
|Blocked dimension value|%1 %2 - %3 is blocked.|-Find nonposted documents containing the dimension set with the blocked dimension value and unblock it.<br />-Remove the dimension set line for the blocked dimension value.|
|Deleted dimension value|    %1 for %2 is missing.|-Restore the missing dimension value.<br />-Find nonposted documents containing the dimension set with the missing dimension value and add it.<br />-Remove the dimension set line for the missing dimension value.|
|Disallowed dimension value|Dimension Value Type for %1 %2 - %3 must not be %4.|-Change the **Dimension Value Type** field on the **Dimension Values** page to **Standard** or **Begin-Total**.<br />-Remove the dimension set line for the blocked dimension value.|
|Blocked dimension combination|Dimensions %1 and %2 can't be used concurrently.|-Find nonposted documents containing the dimension set with the blocked dimension combination and unblock it.<br />-Modify one of the conflicting permission set lines for the dimension combination.|
|Blocked dimension value Combination|Dimension combinations %1 - %2 and %3 - %4 can't be used concurrently.|-Find nonposted documents containing the dimension set with the blocked dimension value combination and unblock it.<br />-Modify one of the conflicting permission set lines for the dimension value combination.|
|Blank dimension value code for default dimension where the **Value Posting** field contains **Code Mandatory**|-Select a %1 for the %2 %3.<br />-Select a %1 for the %2 %3 for %4 %5.|-Change the **Value Posting** field on the **Default Dimension** page.<br />-Enter a nonblank dimension value for the conflicting dimension in the dimension set.|
|Wrong dimension value code for default dimension where the **Value Posting** field contains **Same Code**|-Select %1 %2 for the %3 %4.<br />-Select %1 %2 for the %3 %4 for %5 %6|-Change the **Value Posting** field on the **Default Dimension** page.<br />-Enter the required dimension value for the conflicting dimension in the dimension set.|
|Nonblank dimension value code for blank default dimension where the **Value Posting** field contains **Same Code**|-%1 %2 must be blank.<br />-%1 %2 must be blank for %3 %4.|-Change the **Value Posting** field on the **Default Dimension** page.<br />-Enter a blank dimension value code for the conflicting dimension in the dimension set.|
|Unexpected dimension value for default dimension where the **Value Posting** field contains **No Code**|-%1 %2 must not be mentioned.<br />-%1 %2 must not be mentioned for %3 %4|-Change the **Value Posting** field on the **Default Dimension** page.<br />-Remove the conflicting line from the dimension set.|
|A dimension correction doesn't complete correctly.||-Choose **Reset** to revert the correction to a draft state. This resets the changes, and you can run the correction again.|

## Changing dimension assignments after posting

If you discover an incorrect dimension on posted general ledger entries, you can correct the dimension values and update your analysis views. The correction helps keep your financial reports and analyses accurate.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The features for correcting dimensions are intended only to help make financial reporting accurate. Dimension corrections apply only to the G/L entries. They do not change the dimensions assigned to the entries in other ledgers for the same transaction. There will be a mismatch between the dimensions assigned in the general ledger and the sub-ledgers.

### Set up dimension corrections

There are two things to consider when setting up dimension corrections:

* Are there dimensions that you don't want to allow people to change? On the **Dimension Correction Settings** page, specify the dimensions that you want to block for changes.
* Who can change dimensions? To allow people to make changes, assign the **D365 DIM CORRECTION** permission to the users. The permissions allow them to create dimension corrections, run them, and undo them if needed. They can also specify blocked dimensions. For more information, see [Assign Permissions to Users and Groups](ui-define-granular-permissions.md). 

### Correct a dimension

You can manually select one or more general ledger entries, or use filters to select sets of entries. If needed, you can also add or delete dimensions. 

1. To start a dimension correction, use one the following pages:

    * On the **G/L Registers** page, by selecting a register, and then choosing the **Correct Dimensions** action. This action starts a correction for the entries in the selected register.
    * On the **General Ledger Entries** page, by choosing the **Correct Dimensions** action. 

2. In the **Description** field, enter information about the change. Other people might use this information later to understand what was done.
3. On the **Selected Ledger Entries** FastTab, choose the relevant entries.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > When you change a selection, the values on the **Dimension Correction Changes** FastTab are reset. Therefore, always select the entries before you specify dimension value changes.

   The following table describes the options.

   |Option  |Description  |
   |---------|---------|
   |Add Related Entries     |Add G/L entries that are in the same G/L register.|   
   |Add by Filter     |Use filter criteria when adding G/L entries.|
   |Manual Selection     |Select specific G/L entries.         |
   |Add by Dimensions     |Filter G/L entries by dimensions.         |
   |Remove Entries     |Deselect G/L entries.         |
   |Manage Selection Criteria     |Keep track of the selection process, and undo selections if needed.         |

4. On the **Dimension Correction Changes** FastTab, choose the dimension that you want to change in the **Dimension Code** field, and the new value in the **New Dimension Value Code** field.
5. To validate that the correction, choose **Validate Dimension Changes**. For more information, see [Validating Dimension Corrections](finance-troubleshooting-correcting-dimensions.md#validate-dimension-corrections).
6. Choose **Run**.

### Validate dimension corrections

Before you run a correction, it's a good idea to validate it first. Validation checks for restrictions on value posting for the G/L accounts, restrictions for dimensions, and whether the dimension values are blocked. During validation, the status of the correction is set to **Validation in Process**. After you validate a correction, the result is shown in the **Validation Status** field. If errors were found, you can use the **View Errors** action to investigate them. After you correct an error, you must use the **Reopen** action to run the correction or a new validation.

You can either run a correction immediately, or schedule it to run a later time. If you're running corrections on a large data set, we recommend that you schedule it to run outside business hours. For more information, see [Dimension Corrections on Large Data Sets](finance-troubleshooting-correcting-dimensions.md#dimension-corrections-on-large-data-sets).

### Undo a correction

After you correct a dimension, if you don't like what you see you can use the **Undo** action to reset the previous value. However, you can only undo the most recent correction. Before you undo a correction, you can validate the changes that result from the undo action. For example, validation is useful if dimension restrictions changed after the correction was made.

If the Undo action isn't available, for example because you have many corrections, you can use the **Copy to Draft** action to start a new correction for the same entries.

### Dimension corrections on large data sets

Use caution when correcting large sets of entries, for example, sets that include more than 10,000 entries. If you can, we recommend that you use the filters to run the corrections on smaller sets of data. It's also a good idea to run corrections outside the normal business hours. 

### Use analysis views with dimension corrections

If **Update on Posting** is enabled for an analysis view, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can update the view when documents and journals are posted. You can also update views with this setting enabled with results of dimension corrections. To do so, turn on the **Update Analysis Views** toggle. Updating analysis views can affect performance, especially for large data sets, so we recommend that you update analysis views only for small data sets.  

### View historical dimension corrections

If a general ledger entry was corrected, you can investigate the change by using the **History of Dimension Corrections** action.

### Handle incomplete corrections

If a correction doesn't complete, a warning displays on the correction card. If that happens, you can use the **Reset** action to revert the correction to a draft status and undo the changes. You can then run the correction again.

> [!NOTE]
> Resetting an incomplete correction will not affect updates to analysis views because those happen at the end of the correction process.

### Use cost accounting with corrected G/L entries

After you correct dimensions, your data for cost accounting is out of sync. Cost accounting uses dimensions to aggregate amounts for cost centers and cost objects, and to run cost allocations. Changing dimensions for G/L entries probably means that you should rerun your cost accounting models. Depending on the data that was updated and how your cost accounting capabilities are set up, you might need to:

* Delete just a few cost registers and rerun allocations.
* Delete everything and rerun all of your models.

You must manually identify where dimension corrections affect cost accounting, and where updates are needed. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't currently provide an automated way to do that.

# Power BI integration component and architecture overview

In this article, you'll learn about the different aspects of Power BI integration with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to help you understand its implementation and use.

## Components

The following table describes the major components involved with Power BI integration.

|Component|Description|
|---------|-----------|
|Power BI|A cloud-based report hosting and management service.|
|Power BI Desktop|An authoring tool for building reports and dashboards, and allows you to run reports. It's available as a free download on Microsoft Store and is installed locally.|
|[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]|Online or on-premises solution with connectors exposed to Power BI and the ability to embed a Power BI part.|

## What's available from the start

The following table describes available features.

|Feature|[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online or on-premises support|
|-------|---------------------|
|Power BI connectors|Both. Different connectors for online and on-premises. Same connector used for Power BI Desktop and Power BI Service |
|Embedded experience for viewing a given report inside a FactBox in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]|Both. Requires configuration to display reports for on-premises.|
|Power BI report management from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]|Online|
|Default Power BI reports on role centers deployed to Power BI|Online|
|Power BI Apps on Microsoft AppSource|Online|

## Architecture

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] integrates with Power BI through a connector using OData. The data source for Power BI reports is exposed as API pages and OData web services.

:::image type="content" source="./media/power-bi-architecture.svg" alt-text="Image alt text." lightbox="./media/power-bi-architecture.svg":::

Starting in February 2022, Power BI reports for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online are sourced from a secondary, read-only database replica. The database replica is part of the [read scale-out](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/database-read-scale-out-overview) capability in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online. This configuration frees up the main database for transactions, which enhances performance of the system. Connecting to the read-only database replica is an integral part of the Business Central online connector, and requires no extra setup on your part. All new reports will connect to the read-only database replica by default. Old reports will still use the main database. For more information, see [Business Central 2021 Release Wave 2 Plan](/dynamics365-release-plan/2021wave2/smb/dynamics365-business-central/use-secondary-read-only-database-power-bi-reporting).

## General Flow

The following diagram illustrates the basic workflow for users when connecting [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to Power BI.

![Power BI workflow  for integration with Business Central.](./media/power-bi-flow-v2.svg)

1. User signs up for a Power BI account.
2. User connects to Power BI from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].
3. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] verifies the license.
4. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] deploys default reports to the Power BI service. This step only happens for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online.
5. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] makes reports in Power BI available for selection in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Default reports are automatically displayed in Power BI parts.
6. User creates a report in Power BI Desktop.
7. User publishes the report to the Power BI service. The reports are then available for selection in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

# Enable Application of Ledger Entries in Different Currencies

If you purchase from a vendor in one currency and submit payment in another currency, you can apply the payment to the purchase.

Likewise, if you sell to a customer in one currency and receive payment in another currency, you can apply the payment to the sales invoice.

The following procedure describes how to set this up for vendor ledger entries on the **Purchases & Payables Setup** page. The setup is similar for customer ledger entries on the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page.

## To enable application of vendor ledger entries in different currencies

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchases & Payables Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. In the **Appln. between Currencies** field, select one of the following options.

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| None |Application between currencies is not allowed. |
| EMU |Application between EMU currencies is allowed. |
| All |Application between all currencies is allowed. |

## To set up G/L accounts for currency application rounding differences

If you apply entries in different currencies, you must set up the general ledger accounts to which you want to post rounding differences.  

> [!NOTE]  
> You must set up the general ledger accounts before you complete the task. For more information, see [Understanding the General Ledger and the Chart of Accounts](finance-general-ledger.md).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customer Posting Groups**, and then choose the related link.  
2. In the **Debit Curr. Appln. Rndg. Acc.** and **Credit Curr. Appln. Rndg. Acc.** fields, enter the relevant general ledger accounts to post rounding differences.  
3. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Vendor Posting Groups**, and then choose the related link.  
4. In the **Debit Curr. Appln. Rndg. Acc.** and **Credit Curr. Appln. Rndg. Acc.** fields, enter the relevant general ledger accounts to post rounding differences.

# Reconcile customer payments from a list of unpaid sales documents

After customers make electronic payments to your bank account, you must take the following actions:

* Apply each paid amount to the related sales document.
* Post the payment to update the customer, general ledger, and bank ledger entries.

Depending on your business needs, you can register payments manually, automatically, and through payment services.  

> [!NOTE]  
> You can do the same tasks, including vendor payments, on the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page. For example, you can import bank statements, use automatic application, and reconcile bank accounts. For more information, see [Reconcile Payments Using Automatic Application](receivables-how-reconcile-payments-auto-application.md).

Use the **Register Customer Payments** page to balance internal accounts by using actual cash figures to ensure that payments are collected. You can quickly verify and post individual or lump-sum payments, process discounted payments, and find the unpaid documents.

You must post payments for different customers that have different payment dates as individual payments. Payments for the same customer that have the same payment date can be posted as a lump-sum payment. Lump-sum payments are useful, for example, when a customer made a single payment that covers multiple sales invoices.

## To set up the payment registration journal

Because you can post different payment types to different balancing accounts, you must select a balancing account on the **Payment Registration Setup** page before you start processing customer payments. If you always post to the same balancing account, you can set that account as the default and avoid this step every time that you open the **Register Customer Payments** page.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Payment Registration Setup**, and then choose the related link. You can also choose the **Setup** action on the **Register Customer Payments** page.
2. Fill in the fields on the **Payment Registration Setup** page. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](../archive/SetupAndAdministration/includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)].  

> [!TIP]
> To make it easier to later identify entries that were posted through the journal, you can assign a specific number series to the payment journal. The number series is useful if you use payment reconciliation journals to register and apply payments.

## To register customer payments individually

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Register Customer Payments**, and then choose the related link.  

    The **Register Customer Payments** page shows all posted documents for which a payment can be registered. You can also open the page from the **Customers** and **Customer Card** pages, filtered for the specified customer.  
2. Select the **Payment Made** checkbox on the line that represents the posted document for which a payment was made.
3. In the **Date Received** field, enter the date when the payment was made. This date might be different from the work date.  

   If the **Auto Fill Date Received** checkbox is selected on the **Payment Registration Setup** page, the **Date Received** field contains the work date.  
4. In the **Amount Received** field, enter the amount that was paid.

    For full payments, this amount is the same as the amount in the **Remaining Amount** field on the line. For partial payments, this amount is lower than the amount in the **Remaining Amount** field on the line.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 for other lines for posted documents for which payments are made.  
6. Choose the **Post Payments** action.  

The payment information is posted for documents on lines where the **Payment Made** checkbox is selected. Payments entries are posted to general ledger, bank, and customer accounts.

## To reconcile lump-sum payments

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Register Customer Payments**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the **Payment Made** checkbox on the lines for posted documents for the same customer and for which a lump-sum payment was made.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > The customer in the **Name** field must be the same on all lines to include in the lump-sum payment.  

    If the **Auto Fill Date Received** checkbox is selected on the **Payment Registration Setup** page, the **Date Received** field contains the work date.  
3. In the **Date Received** field, enter the date when the payment was made. This date might be different from the work date.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > This date must be the same on all lines that will be posted as a lump-som payment.  
4. In the **Amount Received** field, enter amounts on multiple lines that sum up to the lump payment amount.  

    > [!TIP]  
    > Try to post as many full payments as possible with the lump-sum amount. Enter amounts that are the same as the amount in the **Remaining Amount** field on as many lines as possible.  
5. Repeat steps 2-4 for other lines that represent posted documents for the same customer for which a lump-sum payment was made.  
6. Choose the **Post As Lump Payment** action.

   The payment information is posted for documents on lines where the **Payment Made** checkbox is selected. Payment entries are posted to general ledger, bank, and customer accounts. Each payment is applied to the related posted sales document.  

If a payment in the bank isn't represented by a line on the **Register Customer Payments** page, it might be because the related document isn't posted. In that case, you can use a search function to quickly find the document and post it to process the payment. For more information, see [To find a specific sales document that isn't fully invoiced](#to-find-a-specific-sales-document-that-isnt-fully-invoiced).  

If a payment in the bank isn't represented by a document, you can open a prefilled general journal from the **Register Customer Payments** page to post the payment directly to the balancing account without applying the payment to a document. Alternatively, you might want to record the payment in the journal until the origin of the payment is resolved. For more information, see [To record or post a payment without a related document](receivables-how-reconcile-customer-payments-list-unpaid-sales-documents.md#to-record-or-post-a-payment-without-a-related-document).  

## To process customer payments with discounts manually

If you agree on a payment discount with your customer, payment amounts can be lower than the invoice amounts if payment occurs before the agreed discount date.  

The following procedures explain ways to post discounted payments on the **Payment Registration** page.  

* The payment amount is equal to the remaining discounted amount, and the payment date is before the discount date. You post the payment as is.  
* The payment amount is equal to the remaining discounted amount, but the payment date is after the discount date. You post the payment as partial. The document remains open to collect/pay the remaining amount. You can also set the discount date later to allow the payment in full.  
* The payment amount is lower than the remaining discounted amount. You post the payment as partial. The document remains open to collect/pay the remaining amount.  
* The payment amount is more than the remaining discounted amount. You post the payments as is. Only the remaining amount is posted. The extra amount is credited to the customer.  

### To process a payment amount that is equal to the discounted amount and where the payment date is before the discount date

5. Choose the **Post Payments** action to post the full payment to general ledger, bank, and customer accounts.  

The related document is closed, and the customer is credited the excess payment amount.  

## To find a specific sales document that isn't fully invoiced

The **Register Customer Payments** page supports you in tasks needed to balance internal accounts with actual cash figures to ensure effective collection from customers. It shows outstanding incoming payments as lines that represent sales documents where an amount is due for payment.  

Typically, when a payment is made, recorded in the bank or otherwise, the sales or purchase document is represented as a line on the **Register Customer Payments** page. The document is waiting for you to post the payment to the outstanding amount. However, sometimes a payment that was made isn't represented by a line on the **Register Customer Payments** page, typically because the document isn't fully invoiced.

Use the **Search Documents** action to search for documents that aren't fully invoiced. You can search based on one or more of the following criteria:  

* Document number  
* Amount or amount range  

The following procedure explains how to find a specific document by using both search criteria.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Register Customer Payments**, and then choose the related link.
2. With the pointer on any line, Choose the **Search Documents** action.
3. On the **Document Search** page, enter a search value in the **Document No.** field.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > The value that you enter in this field is enclosed in hidden wildcard characters. This means that the action searches for all document numbers that contain the entered value.
4. In the **Amount** field, enter the specific amount on the document you want to find.  
5. In the **Amount Tolerance %** field, enter a percentage value to define the range of amounts that you want to search to find the open document.  

    If you enter 10, the action searches for amounts in a range of plus or minus 10 percent of the value in the **Amount** field.
6. Choose the **Search** action.  

If one or more documents match the criteria, the **Document Search Result** page opens to display lines that represent those documents. Each line contains a document number, description, and an amount.

If a payment in the bank isn't represented by a document, you can use the  open a prefilled general journal from the **Register Customer Payments** page to post the payment directly to the balancing account without applying the payment to a document. Alternatively, you might want to record the payment in the journal until the origin of the payment is resolved.  

## To record or post a payment without a related document

If a payment in the bank isn't represented by a document, you can use the **General Journal** action to open a prefilled general journal line from the **Register Customer Payments** page. Use the journal to post the payment directly to the balancing account without applying the payment to a document. Alternatively, you might want to record the payment in the journal until the origin of the payment is resolved.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Register Customer Payments**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **General Journal** action.  

    The **General Journal** page opens with one line that contains the balancing account of the journal batch that is set up on the **Payment Registration Setup** page.  
3. Fill in the remaining fields on the general journal line. For example, provide the amount, customer number, or information from the bank statement. For more information, see [Post Transactions Directly to the General Ledger](finance-how-post-transactions-directly.md).  

You can post the journal line to update the total on the balancing account. You can also leave the journal line unposted, and perhaps append it with a note that the payment needs more analysis.  

If you don't post the journal line, its value is added to the value in the **Rem. Amount Incl. Discount** field on the **Payment Registration** page.

# Manage user profiles

Assign all users to profiles that reflect:

* Their business role
* The department they work in
* Another type of categorization

Profiles allow administrators to centrally define and manage what different types of users can access in Business Central.

The typical business use of a profile is a role. A profile is therefore named *Profile (Role)* in the UI.

As an administrator, you create and manage profiles on the **Profiles (Roles)** page. Each profile has a card where you manage settings for the related role. The card contains the following information:

* Name of the role
* User settings
* The Role Center that the profile uses

For more information about user settings and Role Centers, see [Change Basic Settings](ui-change-basic-settings.md).

Before you can manage user profiles, you must create and add the users through the Microsoft 365 Admin Center. You can then assign permissions to each user or user group. Permissions define the features that users can access. To learn more about permission settings, go to [Assign Permissions to Users and Groups](ui-define-granular-permissions.md).

## Page customization

You can customize page layouts for a profile so that all users assigned the profile sees the customized pages. As an administrator, you customize pages by using the same functionality as users do when they personalize. To learn more about custom page layouts, go to [Customize Pages for Profiles](ui-personalization-manage.md).

## Create a profile

If you can't copy an existing profile, you can create a new one manually.

1. Select the ![Search for Page or Report.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Profiles (Roles)**, and then select the related link.  
2. On the **Profiles (Roles)** page, select the **New** action.  
3. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

> [!TIP]
> If you want a particular profile to be available only for specific users, you can enter **Navigation menu only** in the **Description** field. That setting excludes the profile from the list of available roles on the **My Settings** page.

## Copy a profile

To save time, you can create a new profile by copying an existing one that has similar settings. When you copy a profile, you also copy page customizations, both user-created and those from extensions.

1. On the **Profiles (Roles)** page, select the line for the profile that you want to copy, and then select the **Copy Profile** action.
2. Fill in the **Profile ID** and **Display Name** fields, and then select the **OK** button.
3. On the **Profiles (Roles)** page, open the newly created profile card, and then edit other fields as necessary.

## Edit a profile

You can edit a profile by changing the fields on the **Profiles (Roles)** page. However, the changes aren't available to the user assigned the profile until they sign out and sign in.

> [!Caution]
> Don't rename a profile while users assigned the profile are signed in. They might have to restart [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and sign in again.

## Assign a profile to a user

Users can assign themselves a role (representing a profile) by choosing the **Role** field on the **My Settings** page. As an administrator, you can do the same through the **Profiles (Roles)** page.

1. On the **Profiles (Roles)** page, select the profile that you want to assign, and then select the **User Personalization List** action.
2. On the **User Settings** page, select the user that you want to assign the profile to, and then select the **Edit** action.
3. In the **Profile ID** field, select the relevant profile.

If you assign another profile to a user, any personalizations made by the user with the previous profile are preserved.

## Define user settings for a profile

On the **My Settings** page, users can define basic behavior of their account, such as the Role Center, the language, and which notifications they get. To learn more about user settings, go to [Change Basic Settings](ui-change-basic-settings.md).

As an administrator, you can define settings for a profile. The settings apply to all users assigned to the role.

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Profiles (Roles)**, and then select the related link.
2. Select the line for the profile that you want to change user settings for, and then select the **User Personalizations List** action.
3. On the **User Personalizations** page, open the card for the user whose settings you want to change.
4. On the **User Personalization Card** page, edit the fields as necessary.

## Activate a profile

When you create a profile, you can define if, where, and how the profile and its information are available to users.

On the **Profiles (Roles)** page, select the following checkboxes:

* **Enabled** to specify if the related role is visible in the **Available Roles** page for users to choose from.  
* **Use as default profile** to specify the profile that applies to users who aren't assigned a specific role.
* **Disable personalization** to specify if users of the related role can personalize their workspace.
* **Show in Role Explorer** to specify if actions to business features included in the profile are shown in the extended view of the role explorer, a feature overview. To learn more about Role Explorer, go to [Finding Pages with the Role Explorer](ui-role-explorer.md).

## Export profiles

You can export profiles from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and reuse them in another tenant. The profiles export to a zip file that contains Application Language (AL) files. You can reuse the AL files to develop extensions. To learn more about exporting profiles, go to [Use the Client to Create Profiles and Page Customizations](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-design-profiles-using-client).

* On the **Profiles (Roles)** page, select the **Export Profiles** action.

    This action exports a zip file that contains AL files for all profiles.

## Import profiles

You can import profiles that are exported from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The steps are more or less the opposite of the steps to export profiles.

1. On the **Profiles (Roles)** page, select the **Import Profiles** action.
1. Follow the steps in the **Import Profiles** assisted setup guide.

    If you only want to import selected profiles, use the **Selected** checkbox to indicate which to import.
1. Select the **Import Selected** button.

    This action imports a zip file that contains AL files for the selected profiles.

## Delete a profile

You can delete a profile by choosing the **Delete** action on the **Profiles (Roles)** page. However, the following limitations apply:

* You can't delete a profile that is assigned to a user or a security group.
* You can't delete profiles that originate from extensions. The extension must first be uninstalled.
* You can only delete one profile at a time.

## Delete personalizations

### Delete all personalizations made by a specific user

You can delete all changes that a user makes to any pages, which reverts the pages to the the original layout. Personalizations aren't associated with a profile (role). If a user personalizes a page, they experience the personalizations on the page no matter which role they're using.

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **User Settings**, and then select the related link.

    The **User Settings** page lists all users<!--who make personalizations-->.

2. Select the user whose personalizations you want to delete.
3. On the **User Settings** card page, select the **Clear Personalized Pages** action, and then accept the message that appears.

The user experiences the changes the next time they sign in.

You can also delete all page customizations for a profile. To learn more, go to [To delete all customizations for a profile](ui-personalization-manage.md#delete-all-customizations-for-a-profile).

### Delete personalizations for specific pages

You can delete personalizations that one or more users make to specific pages. Deleting personalizations can be useful, for example, if a business process change means that a personalization isn't relevant. Deletions restore the page layout back to what the profile defines.

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Personalized Pages**, and then select the related link.

    The **Personalized Pages** page lists all personalized pages and the user they belong to.

    <!--A checkmark in the **Legacy Personalization** field indicates that the personalization was done in an older version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], which handled personalization differently. Users who try to personalize these pages are locked from doing so unless they choose to unlock the page.-->

2. Select the line for the page personalization that you want to delete, and then select the **Delete** action.

The user experiences the changes the next time they sign-in.  

You can also delete individual page customizations for a profile. To learn more, go to [To delete customization for specific pages for a profile](ui-personalization-manage.md#delete-customization-for-specific-pages-for-a-profile).

## Managing user sessions

As the administrator of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, you can manage user sessions in the administration center. To learn more, go to [Managing Sessions][def] in the administration content.  

For [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, you can manage sessions using SQL Server Management Studio, for example. To learn more, go to [SQL Server technical documentation](/sql/sql-server).

# Inventory by Serial No. (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

If you track items by serial numbers, the **Inventory by Serial No.** report shows your total inventory per serial number. Use this report to track the performance of items on a serial by serial basis.

:::image type="content" source="media/inventory/inventory-by-serial-no.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Inventory by Serial No Power BI Report" lightbox="media/inventory/inventory-by-serial-no.png":::

## Use the report

Inventory management and warehousing staff use this report to track inventory per serial number.

Inventory managers use the report to optimize stock levels for each serial number. This information can help identify slow moving inventory, so you can take corrective action. It can also help you find serial numbers that are due to expire.

The report gives warehouse staff a clear picture of the quantities of each serial number, so you can manage inventory efficiently and avoid stock-outs.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The *Inventory by Serial No.* report includes the following KPIs:

- [**Quantity**](inventory-powerbi-kpis.md#quantity)
- [**Inventory (Quantity)**](inventory-powerbi-kpis.md#inventory-quantity)

# Reverse journal postings and undo receipts/shipments

Reverse journal postings are useful, for example, for correcting errors and for clearing out an old accruals entry before entering a new one. A reverse entry is the same as the original entry, but has an opposite sign in the **Amount** field. The reverse entry must have the same document number and posting date as the original entry. After you reverse an entry, you must make the correct entry.

You can only reverse entries that are posted from a general journal line. An entry can only be reversed one time.

To undo a receipt or shipment posting, before they're posted as invoiced, you can use the **Undo** function on the posted document. You can undo quantities of type **Item** and **Resource**.

If you posted an incorrect negative quantity, such as a purchase order with the wrong number of items, as received but not invoiced, you can undo the posting.

If you posted an incorrect positive quantity as shipped but not invoiced, you can undo the posting. For example, if you posted a sales shipment or a purchase return shipment with the wrong number of items.

> [NOTE!]
> Due to how [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] posts and updates amounts in an additional reporting currency (ACY), you can't use this feature if you use ACY. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] converts amounts in local currency to the alternate currency, but doesn't net transactions. If you use ACY, you must manually reverse the amounts.

## To reverse the journal posting of a general ledger entry

You can reverse entries from all **Ledger Entries** pages. The following procedure is based on the **General Ledger Entries** page.

> [!NOTE]
> The entry must originate from a journal posting.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Ledger Entries**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the entry that you want to reverse, and then choose the **Reverse Transaction** action.
3. On the **Reverse Transaction Entries** page, choose the **Reverse** action.
4. Choose **Yes** to confirm the reversal.

## To post a negative entry  

Use the **Correction** field to post a negative debit instead of a credit, or to post a negative credit instead of a debit on an account. By default, the field is available in all journals. The **Debit Amount** and **Credit Amount** fields include both the original entry, and the corrected entry. These fields have no effect on the account balance.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Journals**, and then choose the related link  
2. In the **Batch Name** field, select the required batch name.  
3. Enter information into the relevant fields.  
4. In the journal line that you want to activate for negative entries, select the **Correction** check box.  
5. To post the journal, choose the **Post** action, and then choose the **Yes** button.

## To undo a quantity on a posted purchase receipt  

The following steps describe how to undo a posted receipt of items or resources. The steps are similar for posted shipments.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Posted Purchase Receipts**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the posted receipt that you want to undo.  
3. Select the line or lines that you want to undo.  
4. Choose **Undo Receipt** action.

A corrective line is added under the selected receipt line. If the quantity was received in a warehouse receipt, then a corrective line is added on the posted warehouse receipt.  

The **Quantity Received** and **Qty. Rcd. Not Invoiced** fields on the related purchase order are set to zero.

## To undo and then redo a quantity on a posted return shipment

The following steps describe how to:

* Undo a posted return shipment of items or resources.
* Repost the purchase return with a new quantity.

The steps are similar for posted return receipts.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Posted Return Shipments**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the posted return shipment to undo.
3. Select the line or lines to undo.  

4. Choose the **Undo Return Shipment** action.  

    A corrective line is inserted in the posted document, and the **Return Qty. Shipped** and **Return Shpd. Not Invd.** fields on the return order are set to zero.  

    Now go back to the purchase return order and redo the posting.  

5. On the **Posted Return Shipment** page, take a note of the number in the **Return Order No.** field.  
6. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Return Orders**, and then select the related link.  
7. Open the return order in question, and then choose the **Reopen** action.  
8. Correct the entry in the **Quantity** field and post the purchase return order again.  

[!INCLUDE [rev-general-journal](includes/rev-general-journal.md)]

## Reverse a customer and vendor ledger entry with a realized gain or loss entry

You can use the **Reverse transaction** action to reverse payments that were applied to entries that originated in foreign currencies and were adjusted using the Exchange Rate Adjustment batch job. The feature works for both purchases and sales.

The following steps are a simple scenario that illustrates how it works:

1. Post a sales invoice for a customer using a foreign currency.
2. Adjust the exchange rate for that currency.
3. Post a payment applied to the invoice.
4. Unapply and reverse the payment transaction, for example, from the **Customer Ledger Entries** page.

# Record interactions with contacts

Recording interactions with business contacts consists of these tasks:

* Setting up interaction templates  
* Creating interactions on contacts or segments  
* View and manage recorded interactions  

## Set up interaction templates

Before you can record interactions, you must set up interaction templates. An interaction template is a model that defines the basic characteristics of an interaction. When you record an interaction, you specify the interaction templates it's based on. Settings such as the mode of communication that was used, who initiated the interaction, and its cost, transfer to the interaction.

You set up an interaction template on the **Interaction Templates** page.

When you set up an interaction template, you can add an attachment. For example, you might attach a Microsoft Word document that contains notes from a meeting. To learn more about attachments, go to [Attachments for interactions](marketing-interaction-attachments.md). Repeat the steps to set up as many interaction templates as you want.  

## Create interactions

There are two ways to record interactions:

* You can manually create interactions that are linked to a single contact or to a segment. For more information, see [Create Interactions on Contacts and Segments](marketing-how-create-interactions.md).  
* You can automatically record interactions when you perform actions in the application—for example, when you print an invoice or quote. For more information, see [Automatically Record Interactions with Contacts](marketing-auto-record-interactions.md).

## View and manage recorded interactions

You can view all the recorded interactions that have not been deleted on the **Interaction Log Entries** page. You can open this page by:

* Using the **Search for Page or Report** icon to search on **Interaction Log Entries**.
* Choosing the **Interaction Log Entries** action on a contact or segment.

  The **Interaction Log Entry** page contains the interactions you create manually and the interactions that [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] records automatically.

Use the Interaction Log Entries page to view the status of interactions and cancel interactions.

You can delete interaction log entries that have been canceled. To delete interaction log entries, choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Delete Canceled Interaction Log Entries**, choose the related link, and then fill in the information.

# Create bank deposits

> [!NOTE]
> The ability to create bank deposits is new in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] 2022 release wave 1 for a lot of country/region versions. If you were using [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in the United States, Canada, or Mexico before that release, you might be using the earlier capabilities. You can continue, but the new capabilities will replace the old ones in a future release. To start using the new features described in this article, your administrator can go to the **Feature Management** page and turn on **Feature Update: Standardized bank reconciliation and deposits**.  

Use the **Bank Deposits** page to register deposits as a single document that posts one or more entries to a bank account. Typically, bank deposits are used to register cash deposits. The Bank Deposits page is available on the **Cash Management** menu on the Business Manager Role Center, and other Role Centers that deal with cash management.

Amounts on bank deposits can come from several sources:

* Sales, using a G/L account for revenue.
* Customers payments.
* Cash refunds from vendors, or cash payments to them. 

Bank deposit lines contain information about individual deposits, such as checks from customers. The total of the amounts on the lines must add up to the total amount of the deposit.

After you fill in the deposit information and lines, you must post it. Posting updates the relevant ledgers, including the general ledger, and the bank, customer, and vendor ledgers. Posted deposits are stored for future reference on the **Posted Bank Deposits** page.

The **Bank Deposit** report displays customer and vendor deposits with the original deposit amount, the amount of the deposit that remains open, and the amount applied. The report also shows the total posted deposit amount to reconcile.

## Before you start

There are a few things to set up before you can use bank deposits. You must have a number series and general journal template ready. You should also specify whether to post bank deposit amounts as a lump sum. That is, as a total of all the amounts on the deposit lines. Otherwise, each line is posted as an individual entry. Posting a deposit as a single bank ledger entry can make it easier to do bank reconciliation.

### Number series and lump sum deposits

You must set up a number series for bank deposits, and then specify the series in the **Bank Deposit Nos.** field on the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page. To learn more about number series, go to [Create Number Series](ui-create-number-series.md).

Also on the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page, to post deposits as lump sums rather than individual lines, turn on the **Post Bank Deposits as Lump Sum** toggle. Posting a deposit as a lump sum creates one bank ledger entry for the full amount of the deposit, which can make it easier to do bank reconciliation.

### General journal templates for bank deposits

You must also create a general journal template for deposits. You use general journals to post entries to bank, customer, vendor, fixed asset, and general ledger accounts. The journal templates design the general journal to suit the purpose of your work. That is, the fields on the journal template are exactly the ones you need.

The deposits are cash receipts, so you might want to reuse your number series for cash receipt journals. Alternatively, if you need to distinguish between bank deposit and cash receipt journal entries, use a different number series.

You also need to create a batch job for the template. To create a batch job, on the **General Journal Templates** page, choose the **Batches** action. To learn more about batches, go to [Using Journal Templates and Batches](ui-work-general-journals.md#use-journal-templates-and-batches).

## Dimensions on bank deposit lines

The lines on the bank deposit use the default dimensions you specified in the **Department Code** and **Customer group Code** fields. When you choose **Customer** or **Vendor** in the **Account Type** field, the dimensions for the customer or vendor replace the defaults. You can change the dimensions on the lines, if needed.

> [!TIP]
> Dimension on lines are set according to Default Dimension Priorities. Line dimensions prioritized over header dimensions. To avoid conflicts, you can create rules that prioritize when to use a dimension depending on the source. If you want to change how dimensions are prioritized, you can change their rankings on the **Default Dimension Priorities** page. For more information, see [To set up default dimension priorities](finance-dimensions.md#to-set-up-default-dimension-priorities).

## Create a bank deposit

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Bank Deposits**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose **New** to open the **Bank Deposit** page.
3. Choose the general journal template that you created for bank deposits.  

    > [!NOTE]
    > If the general journal template has more than one batch, you'll be prompted to choose one.

4. In the **Bank Account No.** field, choose the bank account in which to make the deposit.

    > [!TIP]
    > You can double-check that you're depositing to the correct account by using the **Account Card** and **Account Ledger Entries** actions to look up the ledger entries for the selected bank account. For example, to check whether similar deposits were made to the account.

5. In the **Total Deposit Amount** field, enter the total amount of the deposit. This total must be the sum of the amounts on all lines.
6. Fill in the remaining fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](../archive/SetupAndAdministration/includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

    The date in the **Posting Date** field and the dimensions in the **Department Code** and **Customergroup Code** fields are assigned to the lines that you create for the bank deposit. You can change them if needed.

7. Depending on whether you want to post the bank deposit as lump sum or each line individually to the bank ledger, turn the **Post as Lump Sum** toggle on or off. The default setting comes from the same toggle on the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The **Currency Code** field shows the currency that is specified for the bank account you chose. You cannot choose a different currency.

8. On the **Lines** FastTab, create a new line for each cash payment that you want to deposit.
9. In the **Account Type** field, specify where the payment originated. For bank deposits, the type is typically **Customer** or **Vendor**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You can also register a cash payment to a vendor. To do that, choose **Vendor** and then enter the payment amount as a negative number in the **Credit Amount** field on the line.

10. In the **Document No.** field, enter the document number of the invoice from which the credit amount originated. You can use a document number for each line, or the same number for all lines.

    > [!TIP]
    > Typically, you don't need to fill in the **Document Type** field for financial entries. For example, if you're depositing cash from a day's sale you leave the field blank. If you're depositing cash from a customer payment, you choose **Payment**.

11. If you're depositing a cash payment for a specific customer invoice, choose the **Apply Entries** action, and then enter the invoice number in the **Applies-to ID** field.
12. If you're ready to post the bank deposit, choose the **Post** action.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If the bank account has default dimensions where the **Value Posting** field contains **Code Mandatory**, **Same Code**, or **No Code**, you must post the deposit as a lump sum. If you don't post as a lump sum, posting might fail because the dimension values of the accounts on the bank deposit lines violate the value posting rules of the bank account.

    > [!TIP]
    > Before you post the deposit, you can use the **Test Report** action to review your data. The report shows whether there are any issues, such as missing data, that might prevent posting.  

## Apply multiple checks for multiple invoices for a customer in a lump sum deposit

You can post lump sum deposits from multiple checks on deposit lines for customer ledger entries. 

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Bank Deposits**, and then choose the related link.
2. Create or choose a line for the customer, and in the **External Document No.** field, enter the check number.
3. Choose **Apply Entries**.
4. On the **Apply Customer Entries** page, for each document you want to apply the check to, in the **Applies-to ID** field, enter the check number.
5. In the **Amount to apply** field, enter the amount on the check.

   > [!NOTE]
   > When you enter the amount to apply, the **Applies-to ID** field might reset to the bank deposit document number. Double-check the field, and if it reset, reenter the check number.  

6. Choose **OK**.
7. Repeat steps two through six for each check.

   > [!TIP]
   > Before you post the bank deposit, it's a good idea to use the **Test Report** action to validate the applications.

## Find posted bank deposits

The **Posted Bank Deposits** page lists your company's previous deposits. In the list, you can review the comments and dimensions that were specified for the deposits. You can open the bank deposit to view more details, and from there you can investigate further. For example, you can choose the **Find entries** action to view the posted bank ledger entries. From the bank ledger entry, you can find its corresponding posted general ledger entry.

If you want to look up all general ledger entries for the posted deposit lines, go to the **G/L Register** page and use the **General Ledger** action. The action shows all of the general ledger entries, including the entries for customers and vendors.

## Reverse a posted bank deposit

There are a couple of ways to reverse a posted bank deposit:

* On the **Posted Bank Deposits** page, choose the deposit, and then choose the **Undo Posting** action.
* On the **G/L Registers** page, find the register for the deposit, and then choose the **Reverse Register** action.

> [!NOTE]
> You can only reverse a register that contains a single type of entry. That is, the register must contain only customer entries or vendor entries, but not both. If a register contains both you must manually reverse the deposit.

# Troubleshoot Copilot and agent capabilities

Copilot is an AI-powered functionality in Business Central that assists in various tasks like drafting marketing text and reconciling bank accounts. If you're experiencing trouble with Copilot or other agent capabilities, this article can help you identify and fix common issues.

## Copilot doesn't appear on pages

If Copilot functionality, such as the **Draft with Copilot** action for marketing text suggestions or the **Reconcile with Copilot** action for bank account reconciliation assist, doesn't appear on a page as expected, check the following:

- Make sure that the feature is enabled if it's controlled under Feature Management. [Learn more about feature management](admin-feature-management.md).

- Make sure that the functionality isn't hidden by personalization. [Learn more about personalization](ui-personalization-user.md).

## Copilot appears on pages, but you get an error that it's not activated

When you try to use Copilot and you get an error similar to **Sorry, Copilot is not activated for \[feature\]**, there are a couple things to check:

- First, make sure that the feature is activated on the **Copilot & agent capabilities** page. [Learn more about activating Copilot and agent capabilities](enable-ai.md#activate-features). 
- Next, make sure that privacy notice statement for Azure OpenAI integration isn't set to **Disagree for everyone**. If it is, change it to **Agree for everyone**. [Learn more about privacy notices](privacy-notices-status.md).

## Copilot capabilities from Microsoft not listed on Copilot & agent capabilities page

If none of the AI features from Microsoft are shown in the **Copilot & agent capabilities** page, it's likely because you have one or more embed apps installed on your environment. Embed apps can offer their own Copilot capabilities, but capabilities published by Microsoft aren't compatible with environments having embed apps.

# Set up prepayments

You use prepayments when:

* You require your customers to submit payment before you ship an order to them.
* Your vendor requires that you submit payment before they ship an order to you.

Prepayments let you invoice and collect deposits from customers or to remit deposits to vendors, to ensure that all partial payments are posted against an invoice. For more information, see [Create Prepayment Invoices](finance-how-to-create-prepayment-invoices.md).

Before you can post prepayment invoices, you have to set up the posting accounts in the general ledger, and you have to set up number series for prepayment documents. You must specify an account for prepayments related to sales and an account for prepayments related to purchasing. You can specify the same posting accounts for all prepayments related to all general business posting groups or general product posting groups. You can also specify specific accounts for specific posting groups for sales and purchasing, respectively. The best method to use depends on your company's requirements for tracking prepayments.  

You can define the percentage of the line amount to invoice for prepayment for a customer or vendor, and for all or selected items. After you complete the setup, you can generate prepayment invoices from sales and purchase orders. You can use the default percentages for each sales or purchase line, or you can change the amounts on the invoice as needed. For example, you can specify a total amount for the entire order.  

> [!NOTE]
> We recommend that you do not use a prepayment percentage of 100 in the following cases:
>
> * If you are located in North America. Due to how taxes are calculated, a prepayment percentage of 100 can lead to issues with prepayment invoices.
> * In all regions, if you manually deduct a payment discount from the invoice. A prepayment percentage of 100 will not automatically leave an amount from which to deduct the discount.
>
> Also, when you're using prepayment percentage of 100, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] might need to create off-setting rounding entries. When that happens, you will need to choose a G/L account in the **Invoice Rounding Account** field on the **Customer Posting Groups** page. This is true even if you have not turned on the **Invoice Rounding** toggle on the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page. If you do not specify an account you you will not be able to post prepayment invoices.

The prepaid amount belongs to the buyer until they receive the goods or services. You must set up general ledger accounts to hold the prepayment amounts until you post the final invoice. Sales prepayments must be recorded in an account for liabilities until the items ship. Purchase prepayments must be recorded in an account for assets until the items are received. In addition, you must set up a separate general ledger account for each VAT identifier.  

[!INCLUDE[local-func-setup-link](includes/local-func-setup-link.md)]

## To add prepayment accounts to the general posting setup  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Posting Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **General Posting Setup** page, for the relevant lines, fill in the following fields:  

    * **Sales Prepayments Account**  
    * **Purch. Prepayments Account**  

If you don't already have general ledger accounts for prepayments, you can open the **G/L Account List** page from the relevant account field.  

## To set up number series for prepayment documents  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales & Receivables Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page, on the **Number Series** FastTab, fill in the following fields:  

   * **Posted Prepmt. Inv. Nos.**
   * **Posted Prepmt. Cr. Memo Nos.**

3. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchases & Payables Setup**, and then choose the related link.
4. On the **Purchases & Payables Setup** page, on the **Number Series** FastTab, fill in the following fields:

    * **Posted Prepmt. Inv. Nos.**
    * **Posted Prepmt. Cr. Memo Nos.**

> [!NOTE]  
> You can use the same number series for prepayment invoices and regular invoices, or you can use different number series. If you use different series, they must not overlap because there must not be any numbers that exist in both series.  

## To set up prepayment percentages for items, customers, and vendors

For an item, you can set up a default prepayment percentage for all customers, a specific customer, or a customer price group. If you don't want to apply the same prepayment percentage to all customers, you must specify which customers or which customer price groups the prepayment percentage applies to.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select an item, and then choose the **Sales Prepayment Percentages** action.  
3. On the **Sales Prepayment Percentages** page, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

For a customer or vendor, you can set up one default prepayment percentage for all items and all types of sales lines. You enter the percentage on the customer or vendor card. The following procedure shows how to specify a prepayment percentage for a customer, but similar steps apply to vendors.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customers**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the card for a customer.
3. On the **Payments** FastTab, fill in the **Prepayment %** field.
4. Repeat the steps for other customers or for vendors.  

> [!TIP]
> You can also access the **Sales Prepayment Percentages** page from the customer or vendor card.

### To determine which prepayment percentage has first priority  

An order might have a prepayment percentage on the sales header, and a different percentage for the items on the lines. To determine which prepayment percentage applies to each sale line, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] looks for and applies the first default percentage in the following order:  

1. A prepayment percentage for the item on the line and the customer that the order is for.  
2. A prepayment percentage for the item on the line and the customer price group that the customer belongs to.  
3. A prepayment percentage for the item on the line for all customers.  
4. The prepayment percentage on the sales or purchase header.  

In other words, the prepayment percentage on the customer card only applies if no prepayment percentage is set for the item. However, if you change the contents of the **Prepayment Percentage** field on the sales or purchase header after you create the lines, the prepayment percentage on all of the lines update. The update makes it easy to create an order with a fixed prepayment percentage, regardless of the percentage set on items.

## To automatically release sales orders when prepayments are applied

You can save time by setting up a job queue entry that will automatically release sales orders that require prepayment after payments are applied. Automating the process saves you the step of releasing the sales order.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales & Receivables Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. In the **Prepmt. Auto Update Frequency** field, specify how often you want the job queue entry to run.

> [!TIP]
> While you're here, consider adding a safeguard against shipping or invoicing sales orders that have unpaid premayment amounts. If you turn on the **Check Prepmt. when Posting** toggle, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will prevent people from posting orders with outstanding prepayment amounts.

3. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Job Queue Entries**, and then choose the related link.
4. Set up the **Upd. Pending Prepmt. Sales** job queue entry, for example, by using the settings on the **Recurrence** FastTab to schedule how often you want it to run. For more information, see [Use Job Queues to Schedule Tasks](admin-job-queues-schedule-tasks.md).

# Finding pages and reports with the role explorer

You can get an overview of the pages and reports that make up the features that people your business role often use. You can also explore what's available for other roles. This article refers to the overview of pages and reports as the *role explorer*.

In addition to the overview, the role explorer provides actions that open pages or reports, for example, so you can explore the information that the page or report includes. You can also use the role explorer as a way to get around in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

[!INCLUDE [about-ui-learn](includes/about-ui-learn.md)]

## Open the role explorer

You can open the role explorer from role centers, list pages, and the **Tell Me** window.

- On your role center or any list page, choose the ![Menu button.](media/ui_menu_button.png "Menu button") button, or select <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>F12</kbd>.
- In the **Tell Me** window, choose the **exploring pages** action.

## Open the role explorer filtered to show reports

You can open the role explorer in a filtered view that only shows reports:

- On your role center or any list page, choose the **All Reports** action.
- In the **Tell Me** window, choose the **exploring reports** action.

## Open pages and reports

The actions that open pages or reports are organized under nodes that are named after application areas. You can collapse or expand each node individually, or all nodes together.

- To expand/collapse an individual top-level or subnode, choose the node.
- To expand/collapse all top-level nodes on the page, but leave the subnodes as they are, choose **...** at the top, then choose **Expand** or **Collapse**.
- To expand/collapse all top-levels node and all subnodes under it, choose **...** at the top, then choose the **Expand All** or **Collapse All** action.

## Search for pages and reports

To quickly locate a page or report, select **Find**, and then enter a word or phrase for what you want to find. Role explorer highlights any matching text. If the page or report is hidden in a collapsed node, the collapsed node is marked with a dot.

## Explore other roles

To explore roles other than your own, select **Explore more roles**. Role explorer displays each role under its own heading, with links to its features. You can find and go to features just like you do when exploring your role.

> [!NOTE]
> You can only access roles that are set up to show in the role explorer. If a role isn't available, it probably isn't set up to show. To learn more, go to [Manage Profiles](admin-users-profiles-roles.md).

When you explore other roles, you can also narrow down your exploration by using the **Report & Analysis** and **Administration** actions.

- **Report & Analysis** filters the role explorer to show only reports and analysis features.
- **Administration** filters the role explorer to show only pages for administrative tasks, such as pages related to how you set up your [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

> [!TIP]
> For developers, you categorize pages and reports by setting the [UsageCategory property](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/properties/devenv-usagecategory-property) in the object's AL code.
<!--
 
## Role explorer actions

There a several actions along the top of the role explorer to help you locate features of your role and other roles.

|Action|Description|

# Consolidate financial data from multiple companies

Some organizations use [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in multiple business units or legal entities. Others use [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in subsidiaries that must report into parent organizations. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] gives accountants tools that help them transfer general ledger entries from two or more companies (subsidiaries) into a consolidated company.  

Each company involved in a consolidation is called a business unit. The company in which you combine the data is called the consolidated company.  

You can transfer financial data from subsidiaries to the consolidated company, even if the subsidiaries use [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in different environments. To learn more about how to connect to other environments, go to [Set Up Company Consolidation](finance-consolidated-company-reporting-setup.md#busunit).

If the financial statements of a business unit use a different currency than the consolidated company, you must set up exchange rates for consolidation. To learn more about exchange rates for consolidations, go to [Set Up Company Consolidation](finance-consolidated-company-reporting-setup.md#exchrates).  

You can consolidate:  

* Across companies that have different charts of accounts.  
* Companies that use different fiscal years and different currencies.  
* Either the full amount or a percentage of a company's financial information.
* Using different currency exchange rates in individual G/L accounts.
* Companies in other accounting and business management programs.
* Companies in different [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] environments.

You set up the consolidated company in the same way that you set up other companies. The chart of accounts is independent of the chart of accounts in the business units. The chart of accounts in the business units can differ from one another. To learn more about setting up a consolidation, go to [Set Up Company Consolidation](finance-consolidated-company-reporting-setup.md).  

> [!TIP]
> Consolidating financial data can be especially relevant for intercompany processes. To learn more about intercompany features, go to [Managing Intercompany Transactions](intercompany-manage.md).

## Consolidate data

Before you consolidate, it's a good idea to test your data before you transfer it to the consolidated company. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] looks for differences in the information in the business units and the consolidated company. For example, whether account numbers or dimension codes are different. Correct any errors you find before you run the report. You can test the database or, if you're importing data from an XML file, the file.

### Test the data before you consolidate

1. Open the consolidated company.  
2. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Business Units**, and then choose the related link.  
3. Test the file and database, as follows:  

    * To test a file, choose the **Test File** action, enter the name of the file to test, and then choose **Print**.  
    * To test the database, choose **Test Database**.  

### Run the consolidation

After you've tested the data, you can transfer it to the consolidated company. An assisted setup guide will help you through the process.

> [!NOTE]
> When you run the consolidation you can choose the companies to include. If your consolidated company doesn't have access to one or more subsidiaries, the guide will let you grant access to them.

1. Sign in to the consolidated company.  
2. On the **Business Units** page, choose the **Consolidate** action.  
3. Fill in the required fields.  

## Use the Consolidated Trial Balance report

The **Consolidated Trial Balance** report can give you an overview of the overall financial health of your business. The report combines general ledger entries from each of your companies in a new company that you created for the consolidated data. The consolidated company is just a container for the consolidated data, and doesn't have any live business data. The companies that you include in the consolidated company become **Business Units** in the report. If you have four business units or fewer, you can also use the **Consolidated Trial Balance (4)** report.  

The report shows a line for each account, and follows the structure of the chart of accounts. An account isn't shown if all the amounts on the line are 0. The report shows the following information for each account:

* The account number and the name of the account.
* The totals for the consolidated company and for each business unit. Totals can display either as a net change or the balance to date.
* The eliminations made in the consolidated company. Eliminations always show for a period corresponding to the consolidated company's fiscal year.
* The total for the consolidated company after the eliminations show either as a net change or the balance to date.

## Eliminate repeated transactions

After you consolidate the companies, you must find and eliminate any transactions that are recorded more than once across companies. Processing consolidation eliminations is a manual process.  

To eliminate repeated transactions:

1. Find transactions that might need to be adjusted, and enter general journal lines to eliminate them.
2. Run the **G/L Consolidation Eliminations** report to help you assess the effect of the general journal lines before posting.
3. Post the adjusting transactions.

The **G/L Consolidation Eliminations** report displays a tentative trial balance where you can simulate the consequences of eliminating entries. The report compares the entries in the consolidated company with the eliminations entered in the general journal.

Before you can include a business unit in the report, you must set up the unit on the **Business Units** page. Make sure to turn on the **Consolidate** toggle.

A line is created for each account, following the structure of the chart of accounts. An account isn't shown if all amounts on the line are 0. The report shows the following information for each account:

* Account number.
* Account name.
* If you selected one or more business unit codes in the **Business Unit Code** field on the request page, a total shown for the consolidated company excludes the selected business units and eliminations. If you didn't fill in **Business Unit Code** field, the total for the consolidated company excludes eliminations.
* If you selected a business unit code in the **Business Unit Code** field on the request page, a total shows for the imported entries from the business unit. If you didn't fill in the **Business Unit Code** field, a total shows for the posted eliminations in the consolidated company.
* The total for the consolidated company with all the business units and all posted eliminations.
* The eliminations to make in the consolidated company. That is, the entries in the general journal that is selected on the request page.
* The posting text copied from the general journal.
* The consolidated company's total after the eliminations, if they're posted.

## Export and import consolidated data between databases

If data for a business unit is in another database, you can do a manual file-based transfer or automate the process by using an API. To learn more about the API, go to [Use our API to automatically share data across environments](#use-our-api-to-automatically-share-data-across-environments).

This section describes the manual, file-based process.

You export the data to a file before you include it in the consolidation. Export each company separately by using the **Export Consolidation** batch job.  

> [!TIP]
> Use the same process to export consolidated data that you must submit to Dynamics 365 Finance. For example, if the business unit is a subsidiary and the parent company uses Dynamics 365 Finance.

After you run the batch job, all entries in general ledger accounts are processed. For every combination of selected dimensions and date, the contents of the entries' **Amount** fields are totaled and exported. The next combination of the selected dimensions and date with the same account number is processed. Then the combinations in the next account number are processed, and so on.  

The exported entries contain the following fields: **Account No.**, **Posting Date**, and **Amount**. If dimensions information was also exported, dimension codes and dimension values are also included.  

1. For each exported line, if the total of the **Amount** fields is a debit, the account number that is set up in the business unit's **Consol. Debit Acc.** field is exported to the line. If the total is a credit, the corresponding number in the **Consol. Credit Acc.** field is exported to the line.  
2. The date used for each exported line is either the period's ending date or, if the transfer occurs each day, the exact date of the calculation.  
3. The dimension value exported for the entry will be the consolidated company dimension value that is specified in the **Consolidation Code** field for that dimension value. If a consolidated company dimension value hasn't been entered in the **Consolidated Code** field for the dimension value, the dimension value itself will be exported to the line.  
4. The XML files also contain the currency exchange rates in the consolidation period. These rates are included in a separate section at the beginning of the file.  

## Use our API to automatically share data across environments

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides an API that let's you automate the process of sharing financial data from business units to the consolidated company. The API is free to use and easy to set up. It even let's you share data across [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] environments. For example, you might need to share across environments when business units are not in the same Azure geographies. To learn more about using the API to automate the consolidation process, go to [Set Up Company Consolidation](finance-consolidated-company-reporting-setup.md#busunit).

# Walkthrough: managing projects

<!-- [!INCLUDE[complete_sample_data](includes/complete_sample_data.md)]   -->

This walkthrough introduces you to the project management features. Projects are a way for you to schedule the usage of your company's resources and to keep track of the various costs associated with the resources on a specific project. Projects involve the consumption of employee hours, machine hours, inventory items, and other types of usage that you might want to track as a project progresses.  

This walkthrough covers the setup of a new project and related tasks:

- Handle fixed pricing
- Make payments in installments
- Post invoices from projects
- Copy projects

## About this walkthrough

 This walkthrough demonstrates the following tasks:  

### Setting up a project

With the budget structure set up for projects, creating a project is straightforward. This walkthrough covers the following procedures:  

- Set up project task lines and planning lines.  
- Create project-specific prices for items, resources, and general ledger accounts.  
- Invoice customers for a project.  

### Handling fixed prices

 You can handle fixed prices and the prices for services or goods that are agreed upon in advance with customers. In this walkthrough, you'll learn how to:  

- See how contract and invoice values are determined.  
- Allow for extra work in the schedule that isn't invoiced.  

### Copying a Project

 This part of the walkthrough focuses on how to copy part or all of a project in order to reduce manual data entry and improve accuracy.

- Copy part of a project to a new project.  
- Copy project-specific prices.  
- Copy planning lines.  

### Making Payment by Installment

 When a large, expensive project lasts for a long period, the customer often makes an agreement with the company to pay by installments. This scenario shows how you set up payment by installments and covers:  

- Create payment by installments for a project.  
- Invoice payments to customers.  
- Account for usage in a project set up for payment by installments.  

## Roles

 This walkthrough includes tasks for the following roles:  

- Project Manager  
- Project Team Member  

## Prerequisites

 Before you can perform the tasks in the walkthrough, you must:  

- Install the CRONUS demonstration database.
- Create sample data by using the steps in the following section.  

## Story

This walkthrough focuses on CRONUS, which is a fictional design and consultancy firm that designs and fits new infrastructures. For example, conference halls and offices with furniture, accessories, and storage units. Most of its work is project oriented. Prakash, a project manager at CRONUS uses project to get an overview of each ongoing task that CRONUS started and completed. Prakash is usually the one who sets up deals with customers and enters the core of the project, which is task and planning lines in addition to prices, into [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Prakash finds that creating, maintaining, and reviewing information is straightforward. Prakash also likes the way [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] enables copying projects and payment by installments.

 Tricia, a project team member who reports to Prakash, is responsible for monitoring the project day-to-day. Tricia enters the work done by technicians on every task, records the items that they used, and the costs that they incurred.  

## Preparing sample data

To prepare for this walkthrough, you must add Tricia as a resource.  

### To prepare the sample data  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Resources**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action to create a new resource card.  
3. On the **General** FastTab, enter the following information:  

    - **No.**: **Tricia**  
    - **Name**: **Tricia**  
    - **Type**: **Person**  

4. Choose the **Base Unit of Measure** field, and choose the **New** action to open the **Resource Unit of Measure** page. In the **Code** field, select **Hour**.  
5. On the **Invoicing** FastTab, enter the following information:  

    - **Direct Unit Cost**: **5**  
    - **Indirect Cost %**: **4**  
    - **Unit Cost**: **10**  
    - **Gen. Prod. Posting Group**: **Services**  
    - **VAT Prod. Posting Group**: **VAT 25**  

6. Close the page.

In the next procedure, you create a project journal batch for Tricia in order to post their usage.  

### To create a project journal batch  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Project Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Project Journal** page, choose the **Batch Name** field. The **Project Journal Batches** page opens.  
3. Choose the **New** action to create a new line with the following information:  

    - **Name**: **Tricia**  
    - **Description**: **Tricia**  
    - **No. Series**: **JJNL-GEN**  

4. Choose the **OK** button to save the changes.

## Setting up a project

In this scenario, CRONUS won a contract with a customer, Progressive Home Furnishings, to design a conference and dining hall. The customer is based in the United States and the project requires special software. The project manager reaches an agreement with the customer and creates a project that covers the agreement.  

### To set up a project  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Projects**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action to create a new card.  
3. On the **General** FastTab, enter the following information:  

    - **Description**: **Advising on conference hall setup**  
    - **Bill-to-Customer No.**: **01445544**  

4. On the **Posting** FastTab, enter the following information:  

    - **Status**: **Planning**  
    - **Project Posting Group**: **Setting Up**  
    - **WIP Method**: **Cost Value**  

5. On the **Duration** FastTab, type today's date into the **Starting Date** and **Ending Date** fields. These dates help apply currency conversions when the project is invoiced.  
6. On the **Foreign Trade** FastTab, set the currency code to **USD**. If you select USD in the **Invoice Currency Code** field, the project is invoiced in U.S. dollars and planned in the local currency of CRONUS only.  

 You can customize the pricing for customers on a per project basis, depending on the agreements you have. In the next procedure, the project manager specifies a cost for Tricia's time, sets the price for the required software, and adds in the travel costs that the customer agreed to pay.  

### To customize pricing  

1. From the **Project Card**, choose the **Resource** action.  
2. On the **Project Resource Prices** page, enter the following information:  

    - **Code**: **Tricia**  
    - **Unit Price**: **20**  

3. Close the page.  
4. Choose the **Item** action.  
5. On the **Project Item Prices** page, enter the following information and customized price:  

    1. **Item No.**: **80201 (Graphic Program)**  
    2. **Unit Price**: **200**  

6. Close the page.  
7. Choose the **G/L Account** action.  
8. On the **Project G/L Account Prices** page, enter the following information and the cost of travel, for which the customer agreed to pay cost plus 25 percent:  

    1. **G/L Account**: **8430 (Travel)**  
    2. **Unit Cost Factor**: **1.25**  

9. Close the page.  

 The final steps in setting up a project are adding the project tasks and the planning lines that are part of each task. The planning lines determine what is invoiced to the customer.  

### To add project tasks  

1. On the **Project** card for the new project, choose the **Project Task Lines** action.  
2. The following table describes the information that you should enter in the fields.  

    |Project Task No.|Description|Project Task Type|  
    |------------------|---------------------------------------|-------------------|  
    |1000|Consulting on hall setup|Begin-Total|  
    |1010|Consultation meeting with customer|Posting|  
    |1020|Development|Posting|  
    |1090|Consulting Total|End-Total|  

3. To show that some tasks are subcategories of other tasks, choose the **Indent Project Tasks** action.  

A planning line can be one of the following types:  

- **Budget**: Added to the schedule, but not invoiced.  
- **Billable**: Invoiced, but not added to the schedule.  
- **Both Budget and Billable**: Invoiced and added to the schedule.  

In this walkthrough, the project manager uses **Both Budget and Billable**. They create three planning lines for task 1010, and two planning lines for task 1020.  

### To create planning lines  

1. Select line 1010, and then choose the **Project Planning Lines** action.  
2. Create planning lines with the following information:  

    | Line | Line Type | Planning Date  | Type        | No.   | Quantity | Unit Price |
    |------|-----------|----------------|-------------|-------|----------|------------|
    | 1    | Both Budget and Billable | (today's date) | Resource | Tricia | 40        |     |
    | 2    | Both Budget and Billable | (today's date) | Resource | Timothy | 40        |     |
    | 3    | Both Budget and Billable | (today's date) | G/L Account | 8430 (Travel) | 2 | 400    |

     Close the page. The totals are updated on the **Project Task Lines** page.  
3. Select line 1020, and then choose the **Project Planning Lines** action. Enter the following information:  

    | Line | Line Type | Planning Date  | Type        | No.   | Quantity | Unit Price |
    |------|-----------|----------------|-------------|-------|----------|------------|
    | 1    | Both Budget and Billable | (today's date) | Resource | Tricia | 80        |     |
    | 2    | Both Budget and Billable | (today's date) | Item | 80201 (Graphic program) | 1 |     |

4. Close the page. Totals are updated on the **Project Task Lines** page.  

## Calculating remaining usage

Tricia, the team project member, has been working on the project for a while and wants to register their hours and usage. Tricia didn't work more hours than was agreed upon with the customer in advance. Tricia uses the **Calculate Remaining Usage** batch job to calculate remaining usage in a project journal. For each task, the batch job calculates the difference between scheduled usage of items, resources, and general ledger expenses and the actual usage posted in project ledger entries. The remaining usage is then displayed in the project journal, and Tricia can post it.  

### To calculate remaining usage  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Project Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Project Journal** page, in the **Batch Name** field, open the **Project Journals Batches** list. Select the **Tricia** project journal batch.  
3. Choose the **Calc. Remaining Usage** action.  
4. On the **Project Calc. Remaining Usage** page, on the **Project Task** FastTab, choose the **Project No.** field, and select the relevant project number, typically project J00010.  
5. On the **Options** FastTab, type **J00001** in the **Document No.** field. This information makes future tracking of the posting easier.  
6. Enter today's date as the posting date.  
7. Choose the **OK** button. This action generates project journal lines based on the planning lines that Prakash created.  
8. Choose the **OK** button on the confirmation page. The generated lines are added to the project journal.  
9. Make sure that all the document numbers are J00001, and then choose the **Post** action. Choose **Yes** to confirm the posting.  

The lines are now posted.  

## Creating and posting a project sales invoice

Next, Tricia can create a new invoice for the whole project or for part of a project. Tricia can also attach the invoice to another invoice for the same customer for the same project. In this case, Tricia invoices for the whole project because the project is now completed.  

### To create a project sales invoice  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Projects**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the project that you created earlier, and then choose the **Create project Sales Invoice** action.  
3. On the **Project Task** FastTab, clear any filter on **Project Task No.** in order to invoice the project. In the **Project No.** field, select the relevant project.  
4. On the **Options** FastTab, fill in the posting date and define whether you want to create one invoice per task or just a single invoice for all tasks.  
5. Choose the **OK** button to create the invoice and choose the **OK** button on the confirmation page.  

After Tricia creates the invoice, it's available from the **Sales Order Processor** Role Center, for example.

### To post a new sales invoice  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Invoices**, and then choose the related link.

3. Choose the **Close** button to close the **Project Statistics** page.  

## Handling fixed prices

CRONUS is contracted to set up conference rooms. As the project manager, Prakash wants a good overview of the tasks required for the project with the associated budgeted and incurred costs for each task. In addition, Prakash wants to know the total contracted price for the project and the amount that was invoiced to this point. They're in agreement with the customer regarding fixed pricing for the project.  

### To manage fixed pricing in projects  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Projects**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the **Guildford** project number, and then choose the **Project Task Lines** action.  
3. Select line 1120, and in the **Budget (Total Cost)** field, right-click the amount and choose **DrillDown**.  

     By reviewing the Project Planning Lines, it's determined that Prakash needs Tricia for 30 hours for this stage of the project. Prakash agrees on a fixed price with the customer.  

4. On the **Project Task Lines** page, select line 1120, and then choose the **Project Planning Lines** action. Create a planning line with the following information:  

    | Line | Line Type | Type        | No.   | Quantity |
    |------|-----------|-------------|-------|----------|
    | 1    | Both Budget and Billable  | Resource | Tricia | 30 |

     Close the page.  
5. In the **Budget (Total Cost)** field, right-click the field, and choose **Drilldown** again on the **Project Task Lines** page. View the changes to the schedule. You see that 30 hours are added to the schedule.  
6. Close the pages.  

After being added to the schedule for this task line, Tricia works 25 hours on the project, and enters these hours into the project journal.  

### To enter hours in a project journal  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Project Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On a new line, enter the following information:  

    - **Line Type**: **(blank)**  
    - **Posting Date**: **(today's date)**  
    - **Document No.**: **J00002**  
    - **Project No.**: **Guildford**  
    - **Project Task No.**: **1120**  
    - **Type**: **Resource**  
    - **No.**: **Tricia**  
    - **Quantity**: **25**  

3. Choose the **Post** action.  

     A few days later, Tricia works for another 10 hours on the project and has worked 35 hours in all. Because the agreement is for 30 hours with the customer, only five of these hours are charged to the customer. Tricia manually adds the other five hours to the schedule.  

4. On the **Project Journal** page, choose the **Calc. Remaining Usage** action.  
5. On the **Project Calc. Remaining Usage** page, on the **Options** FastTab, enter the following information:  

    - **Document No.**: **J00003**  
    - **Posting Date**: **(today's date)**  

6. On the **Project Task** FastTab, enter the following information:  

    - **Project No.**: **Guildford**  
    - **Project Task No.**: **1120**  

7. Choose the **OK** button to run the calculation.

    There are five hours of work remaining for Tricia. The **Line Type** field is blank, which indicates that only the usage remains to be posted because the work was already scheduled.  

8. In the **Project Journal**, create a new line with the following information. Make sure that both project numbers are sequential with the numbers you've already used:  

    - **Line Type**: **Budget**  
    - **Project No.**: **Guildford**  
    - **Project Task No.**: **1120**  
    - **Type**: **Resource**  
    - **No.**: **Tricia**  
    - **Quantity**: **5**  

     If you use the **Budget** line type, there are updates to the scheduled costs and prices, but no updates to the contract costs and prices that are invoiced to the customer.  

9. Choose the **Post** action. Choose the **OK** button to close the page.  
10. Open the **Projects** list.  
11. Select the GUILDFORD project, and then, in the **Project Task Lines** section, select line 1120 and in the **Budget (Total Cost)** field, right-click the amount. Choose **DrillDown** to view the information.  

     Changes are automatically entered on the line for Project Task No. 1120. In the total cost of scheduled work, five more hours of work by Tricia were added to the schedule.  

12. Choose the **Close** button to close the page.  
13. Right-click the amount in the **Contract (Total Cost)** field and choose **DrillDown** to view the information.  

In the total price for the contract, only the original contracted 30 hours are included, as agreed upon with the customer.  

## Copying projects

Prakash reached an agreement with a customer, Selagorian Ltd, to set up 10 conference rooms. The agreement resembles an earlier project. Therefore, it saves time to copy that earlier project.  

On the **Copy Project** page, you can select the project and task lines that you want to copy.

- Copy the source project ledger entries to create planning lines based on actual use.
- Copy the source project planning lines to copy the original planning lines to the new project.

You can then choose what planning line or ledger entry line type that you want to include, selecting only what is relevant to this new project. Finally, you can select the project that you want to copy to and define whether prices and quantities should be copied as well.  

### To copy a project  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Projects**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action to create a new project. Enter the following information:  

    - **Description**: **Setting up 10 Conference Rooms**  
    - **Bill-To Customer No.**: **20000**  

3. Choose the **Copy Project Tasks from** action.  
4. On the **Copy Project Tasks** page, enter the following:  

    - **Project No.**: **Guildford**  
    - **Project Task No. From**: **1000**  
    - **Source**: **Project Planning Lines**  
    - **Incl. Planning Line Type**: **Budget + Billable**  
    - **To Project No.**: **GuildfordSetting up 10 Conference Rooms**  
    - Select the **Copy Dimensions** and **Copy Quantity** fields.  

5. Choose the **OK** button to copy the project, and then choose the **OK** button to close the confirmation page.  

By comparing prices, project task lines, and project planning lines for the two projects, you can see that the information was successfully copied.  

## Making payments by installments

CRONUS just landed a large project that will take a year to complete. Because it requires many resources, the project manager sets up the contract so that the customer pays part of the price up front, part when the project is halfway completed, and the final payment upon completion.  

### To set up a new account  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Chart of Accounts**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Chart of Accounts** page, choose the **New** action to create a new card.  
3. On the **New G/L Account** card, enter the following information:  

    - **No.**: **40255**  
    - **Name**: **Project Payment**  

4. On the **Posting** FastTab, in the **Gen. Prod. Posting Group** field, select **Services**. Close the page.  
5. On the **Chart of Accounts** page, select **No. 40255 Job Payment**, and then choose the **Indent Chart of Accounts** action. Choose **Yes** to confirm.  

The following procedures show how to create a new project, set pricing, and then set up payment by installment. In the project task lines, you can create specific lines dedicated to the payment by installments. All work completed on the project that is added to the schedule will be entered on the usage lines. For each payment task line on the planning lines, the line type is **Billable**, which means that the customer will be invoiced. Enter a new line for the down payment. On the usage task line, you can enter the information for the items and resources that have been used in this project, which will increase the schedule, such as employee hours and items used on the project.  

### To make a payment by installment  

1. Create a new project.  
2. On the new **Project** card, fill in the following information:  

    - **Description**: **Redecoration of Reception Area**  
    - **Bill-to-Customer No.**: **30000**  
    - **Project Posting Group**: **Setting up**  
    - **WIP Method**: **Cost Value**  

3. On the Project Card, choose the **Prices** action, and then choose the **Resource** action. Enter the following information:  

    - **Code**: **Tricia**  
    - **Unit Price**: **10**  

     Close the page.  

4. On the **Project** card, in the **Tasks** section, add project task lines as described in the following table:  

    | Line | Project Task No. | Description          | Project Task Type |
    |------|--------------|----------------------|---------------|
    | 1    | 1000         | Payment-Down Payment | Posting       |
    | 2    | 2000         | Usage                | Posting       |
    | 3    | 3000         | Payment - Midway     | Posting       |
    | 4    | 4000         | Payment - Completion | Posting       |

5. Choose task 1000, and then choose the **Project Planning Lines** action.  

6. Create a planning line with the following information:  

    | Line | Line Type | Planning Date  | Type        | No.   | Quantity | Unit Price |
    |------|-----------|----------------|-------------|-------|----------|------------|
    | 1    | Billable  | (today's date) | G/L Account | 40255 | 1        | 5000       |

     Close the page.  

7. Choose task 2000, and then choose the **Project Planning Lines** action.  

8. Create a planning line with the following information:

    | 2    | Budget    | (today's date) | Item     | 70104  | 10       |

     Close the page. On the **Project Task Lines** page, you can see the schedule amounts have been updated.  

9. Choose task 32000, and then choose the **Project Planning Lines** action.  

10. Create a planning line with the following information:

    | Line | Line Type | Planning Date   | Type        | No.   | Quantity | Unit Price |
    |------|-----------|-----------------|-------------|-------|----------|------------|
    | 1    | Billable  | (a future date) | G/L Account | 40255 | 1        | 5000       |

     Close the page.  

11. Create a similar planning line entry for project task 4000.  

 Now that the task and planning lines have been entered, Prakash creates an invoice for the first payment. Prakash does this from the project task lines to make sure that the invoice only contains the lines for the first payment. You can open the sales order from the planning lines or the task lines.  

### To create an invoice  

1. On the **Project Task Lines** page, select line 1000, and then choose the **Create Sales Invoice** action.  
2. On the **Create Sales Invoice** page, set today's date as the posting date, specify **Per Task**, and choose the **OK** button to create an invoice with the default information. Choose the **OK** button to close the confirmation page.  
3. Choose the **Sales Invoice/Credit Memo** action. On the sales invoice, you can see that only the down payment is included in the invoice. You can now send this to the customer as agreed.

# Design details: Handling reordering policies

To include an item in supply planning, you must specify a reordering policy for it on the **Item Card** page. The following reordering policies are available:  

* Fixed Reorder Qty.  
* Maximum Qty.  
* Order  
* Lot-for-Lot  

The **Fixed Reorder Qty.** and **Maximum Qty.** policies relate to inventory planning. These policies coexist with the step-by-step balancing of supply and order tracking.  

## The role of the reorder point

A reorder point represents demand during lead time. When inventory is projected to pass below the level defined by the reorder point, it's time to order more. Inventory decreases gradually until the replenishment arrives. It might reach zero or the safety stock level. The planning system suggests a forward-scheduled supply order at the point when the inventory passes below the reorder point.  

Inventory levels can move significantly during the time bucket. Therefore, the planning system constantly monitors available inventory.

## Monitoring the projected inventory level and the reorder point

Inventory is a type of supply, but for inventory planning, the planning system distinguishes between two inventory levels:  

* Projected inventory  
* Projected available inventory  

### Projected inventory  

At the start of the planning process, projected inventory is the gross quantity of inventory. The gross quantity includes posted and unposted supply and demand in the past. This quantity becomes a projected inventory level that gross quantities from future supply and demand maintain. Future supply and demand are introduced along the time line, whether reserved or allocated in other ways.  

The planning system uses projected inventory to monitor the reorder point and determine the reorder quantity using the **Maximum Qty.** reordering policy.  

### Projected available inventory  

Projected available inventory is the inventory that is available to fulfill demand at a given point in time. The planning system uses projected available inventory when monitoring the safety stock level. Safety stock must always be available for unexpected demand.  

### Time buckets  

Projected inventory is important detecting when the reorder point is reached or crossed, and to calculate the right order quantity when using the **Maximum Qty.** reordering policy.  

The projected inventory level is calculated at the start of the planning period. It's a gross level that doesn't consider reservations or other allocations. To monitor this inventory level during the planning sequence, the planning system monitors the aggregated changes over a period of time. That period is called a *time bucket*. To learn more about time buckets, go to [The role of the time bucket](#the-role-of-the-time-bucket). The planning system ensures that the time bucket is at least one day. One day is the minimum unit of time for demand or supply events.  

### Determining the projected inventory level  

The following sequence describes how the planning system determines the projected inventory level:  

* When a supply event is fully planned, such as a purchase order, it increases the projected inventory on the event's due date.  
* When a demand event is fully satisfied, it doesn't decrease the projected inventory right away. Instead, it posts a decrease reminder, which is an internal record that holds the date and quantity of the addition to projected inventory.  
* When a later supply event is planned and added to the timeline, the system investigates posted decrease reminders one by one to the planned date of the supply. During this process, the reorder point level of the internal increase reminder might be reached or crossed.  
* When a new supply order is introduced, it checks whether it was entered before the current supply. If it is, the new supply becomes current supply and the balancing procedure restarts.  

The following image shows this principle.  

![Determining the Projected Inventory Level.](media/nav_app_supply_planning_2_projected_inventory.png "Determining the Projected Inventory Level")  

1. Supply **Sa** of 4 (fixed) closes Demand **Da** of -3.  
2. CloseDemand: Create a decrease reminder of -3 (not shown).  
3. Supply **Sa** is closed with a surplus of 1 (there isn't more demand).  

     The projected inventory level increases to +4, while the projected **available** inventory becomes -1.  

4. The next supply **Sb** of 2 (another order) is already placed on the timeline.  
5. The planning system checks for a decrease reminder before **Sb** (in this example there isn't, so no action is taken).  
6. The planning system closes supply **Sb** (no more demand exists) by either A, reducing it to 0 (cancel) or B, by leaving it as is.  

     The projected inventory level increases (A: +0 => +4 or B: +2 = +6).  

7. The planning system makes a final check. Is there any decrease reminder? Yes, there's one on the date of **Da**.  
8. The planning system adds the decrease reminder of -3 reminder to the projected inventory level, either A: +4 -3 = 1 or B: +6 -3 = +3.  
9. For A, the planning system creates a forward-scheduled order starting on date **Da**. For B, the reorder point is reached and a new order is created.

## The role of the time bucket

The purpose of the time bucket is to collect demand events within a time period in order to make a joint supply order.  

For reordering policies that use a reorder point, you can define a time bucket. Time buckets help ensure that demands within the same time period are accumulated. The system then checks the effect on projected inventory and whether the reorder point is passed.

If you pass the reorder point, the system forward schedules a new supply order from the end of the time bucket. Time buckets begin on the planning starting date.  

The time bucket concept reflects the manual process of checking the inventory level on a frequent basis rather than for each transaction. You define the frequency (the time bucket). For example, you might gather all item needs from a vendor to place a weekly order.  

![Example of time bucket in planning.](media/nav_app_supply_planning_2_reorder_cycle.png "Example of time bucket in planning")  

Time buckets are often used to avoid a cascade effect. For example, a balanced row of demand and supply where an early demand is canceled, or a new one is created. The result would be that every supply order (except the last one) is rescheduled.

## Stay below the overflow level

When using the **Maximum Qty.** and **Fixed Reorder Qty.** reordering policies, the planning system focuses on the projected inventory in the given time-bucket only. It might suggest extra supply when negative demand or positive supply changes happen outside the time bucket. For extra supply, the planning system calculates the quantity by which you should decrease the supply. This quantity is called the "overflow level." The overflow is available as a planning line with a **Change Qty. (Decrease)** or **Cancel** action and the following warning message:  

* Attention: The projected inventory [xx] is higher than the overflow level [xx] on the Due Date [xx].*  

![Inventory overflow level.](media/supplyplanning_2_overflow1_new.png "Inventory overflow level")  

### Calculating the overflow level  

The overflow level is calculated in different ways depending on the reordering policy.  

#### Maximum Qty.

Overflow level = maximum inventory  

> [!NOTE]  
> If you use a minimum order quantity, it's added as follows:
>
> overflow level = maximum inventory + minimum order quantity.  

#### Fixed Reorder Qty.  

overflow level = reorder quantity + reorder point  

> [!NOTE]  
> If the minimum order quantity is higher than the reorder point, it's replaced as follows:
>
> overflow level = reorder quantity + minimum order quantity  

#### Order multiple  

If an order multiple exists, it adjusts the overflow level for both the Maximum Qty. and Fixed Reorder Qty. reordering policies.  

### Creating the planning line with an overflow warning  

A planning line is created when a supply causes the projected inventory to be higher than the overflow level at the end of a time bucket. To warn about the extra supply, the planning line has a warning message, the **Accept Action Message** field isn't selected, and the action message is either **Cancel** or **Change Qty.**  

#### Calculating the planning line quantity  

The quantity on a planning line is calculated as follows:

planning line quantity = current supply quantity – (projected inventory – overflow level)  

> [!NOTE]  
> As with all warning lines, the maximum and minimum order quantity and order multiple are ignored.  

#### Defining the action message type  

* If the planning line quantity is higher than 0, the action message is **Change Qty.**  
* If the planning line quantity is equal to or less than 0, the action message is **Cancel**  

#### Composing the warning message  

If there's overflow, the **Untracked Planning Elements** page displays a warning message with the following information:  

* The projected inventory level that triggered the warning  
* The calculated overflow level  
* The due date of the supply event  

Example: “The projected inventory 120 is higher than the overflow level 60 on 01-28-23”  

### Example scenario  

In this scenario, a customer changes a sales order from 70 to 40 pieces between two planning runs. The overflow feature reduces the purchase that was suggested for the initial sales quantity.  

#### Item setup  

|Reordering Policy|Maximum Qty.|  
|-----------------------|------------------|  
|Maximum Order Quantity|100|  
|Reorder Point|50|  
|Inventory|80|  

#### Situation before a sales decrease  

|Event|Change Qty.|Projected Inventory|  
|-----------|-----------------|-------------------------|  
|Day one|None|80|  
|Sale|-70|10|  
|End of time bucket|None|10|  
|Suggest new purchase order|+90|100|  

#### Situation after sales decrease  

|Change|Change Qty.|Projected Inventory|  
|------------|-----------------|-------------------------|  
|Day one|None|80|  
|Sale|-40|40|  
|Purchase|+90|130|  
|End of time bucket|None|130|  
|Suggest to decrease purchase<br><br> order from 90 to 60|-30|100|  

#### Resulting planning lines  

The system creates a warning planning line to reduce the purchase by 30, from 90 to 60, to keep the projected inventory at 100 according to the overflow level.  

![Plan according to overflow level.](media/nav_app_supply_planning_2_overflow2.png "Plan according to overflow level")  

> [!NOTE]  
> Without the overflow feature, no warning is created if the projected inventory level is above the maximum, which could cause an extra supply of 30.

## Handling projected negative inventory

The reorder point expresses the anticipated demand during the lead time of the item. The projected inventory must be large enough to cover the demand until the new order is received. Meanwhile, the safety stock should take care of fluctuations in demand up to a targeted service level.  

The planning system considers it an emergency if a future demand can't be served from the projected inventory. Or, expressed in another way, that the projected inventory goes negative. The system suggests that you create a new supply order to cover the unmet part of the demand. The size of the new supply order doesn't consider the maximum inventory or the reorder quantity nor the following order modifiers:

* Maximum order quantity
* Minimum order quantity
* Order multiple 

Instead, it reflects the exact deficiency.  

The planning line for this type of supply order displays an **Emergency** warning icon provide additional information about the situation.  

In the following image, supply D represents an emergency order to adjust for negative inventory.  

![Emergency planning suggestion to avoid negative inventory.](media/nav_app_supply_planning_2_negative_inventory.png "Emergency planning suggestion to avoid negative inventory")  

1. Supply **A**, initial projected inventory, is below the reorder point.  
2. A new forward-scheduled supply is created (**C**).  

     (quantity = maximum inventory – projected inventory level)  
3. Supply **A** is closed by demand **B**, which isn't fully covered.  

     (Demand **B** could try to schedule Supply C in, but the time-bucket prevents that.)  
4. New supply (**D**) is created to cover the remaining quantity on Demand **B**.  
5. Demand **B** is closed (creating a reminder to the projected inventory).  
6. The new supply **D** is closed.  
7. Projected inventory is checked. The reorder point isn't crossed.  
8. Supply **C** is closed (there's no more demand).  
9. Final check. There are no outstanding inventory level reminders.  

The following section describes the characteristics of the four supported reordering policies.

## Reordering policies

Reordering policies define how much to order when the item needs to be replenished. Four different reordering policies exist.  

### Fixed Reorder Quantity

The Fixed Reorder Qty. policy is typically used for inventory planning for items with the following characteristics:

* Low inventory cost
* Low risk of obsolescence
* Low number of items

Typically, use this policy with a reorder point that reflects the anticipated demand during the item's lead time.  

#### Calculated per time bucket  

If you reach or cross at the reorder point in a time bucket (reorder cycle), the system suggests two actions:

* Create a new supply order for the reorder quantity
* Forward schedule the order from the first date after the end of the time bucket  

The time bucketed reorder point reduces the number of supply suggestions. It reflects a process of manually checking to actual contents of bins in your warehouse.  

#### Creates only necessary supply  

Before it suggests a new supply order to meet a reorder point, the planning system checks for the following supply:

* Whether supply is already ordered
* Whether you expect to receive the supply within the item’s lead time

The system doesn't suggest a new supply order if a supply brings the projected inventory to the reorder point within the lead time.  

Supply orders that are created specifically to meet a reorder point are excluded from supply balancing and aren't changed. If you want to phase out an item that has a reorder point, review your outstanding supply orders manually or change the reordering policy to **Lot-for-Lot**. The system reduces or cancels extra supply.  

#### Combines with order modifiers  

The Minimum Order Quantity, Maximum Order Quantity, and Order Multiple order modifiers shouldn't play a significant role when you use the Fixed Reorder Qty. policy. However, the planning system takes them into account:

* Decrease the quantity to the specified maximum order quantity (and create two or more supplies in order to reach the total order quantity)
* Increase the order to the specified minimum order quantity
* Round up the order quantity to meet a specified order multiple  

#### Combines with calendars  

Before suggesting a new supply order to meet a reorder point, the planning system checks whether the order is scheduled for a nonworking day. It uses the calendars you specify in the **Base Calendar Code** field on the **Company Information** and **Location Card** pages.  

If the scheduled date is a nonworking day, the planning system moves the order forward to the nearest work day. Moving the date might result in an order that meets a reorder point but doesn't meet a specific demand. For such unbalanced demand, the planning system creates an extra supply.  

#### Shouldn't be used with forecasts  

Because the anticipated demand is already expressed in the reorder point level, it isn't necessary to include a forecast in the planning. If it's relevant to base the plan on a forecast, use the **Lot-for-Lot** policy.  

#### Must not be used with reservations  

If you reserve a quantity, for instance a quantity in inventory, for a distant demand, you might disturb the planning foundation. Even if the projected inventory level is acceptable in relation to the reorder point, the quantities might not be available. The system might try to compensate by creating exception orders. However, we recommend that the **Reserve** field is set to **Never** on items that are planned using a reorder point.

### Maximum Quantity

The Maximum Quantity policy is a way to maintain inventory using a reorder point.  

Everything regarding the Fixed Reorder Qty. policy also applies to this policy. The only difference is the quantity of the suggested supply. When you use the maximum quantity policy, the reorder quantity is defined dynamically based on the projected inventory level. Therefore, it usually differs from order to order.  

#### Calculate per time bucket

When you reach or cross the reorder point, the system determines the reorder quantity at the end of a time bucket. It measures the gap between the current projected inventory level and the specified maximum inventory to determine the quantity to order. The system then checks:

* Whether supply is already ordered
* Whether you expect to receive the supply within the item’s lead time

If so, the system reduces the quantity of the new supply order by the quantities already ordered.  

If you don't specify a maximum inventory quantity, the planning system ensures that the projected inventory reaches the reorder quantity.

#### Combine with order modifiers

Depending on your setup, it might be best to combine the Maximum Quantity policy with order modifiers:

* Ensure a minimum order quantity
* Round the quantity to an integer number of purchase units of measure
* Split the quantity into lots as defined by the maximum order quantity  

### Combine with calendars

Before suggesting a new supply order to meet a reorder point, the planning system checks whether the order is scheduled for a nonworking day. It uses the calendars you specify in the **Base Calendar Code** field in the **Company Information** and **Location Card** pages.  

If the scheduled date is a nonworking day, the planning system moves the order forward to the nearest work day. Moving the date might result in an order that meets a reorder point but doesn't meet a specific demand. For such unbalanced demand, the planning system creates an extra supply.

### Order

In a make-to-order environment, an item is purchased or produced to cover a specific demand. Typically, the Order reordering policy is used for items with the following characteristics

* Demand is infrequent
* The lead-time is insignificant
* Required attributes vary  

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates an order-to-order link, which acts as a preliminary connection between the supply (a supply order or inventory) and the demand. You can apply the order-to-order link during planning in the following ways:  

* When you use the Make-to-Order manufacturing policy to create multi-level or project type production orders (producing needed components on the same production order)  
* When you use sales order planning to create a production order from a sales order  

> [!TIP]
> If item attributes don't vary, it might be best to use a Lot-for-Lot reordering policy. As a result, the system uses unplanned inventory and only accumulates sales orders with the same shipment date or within a defined time bucket.  

#### Order-to-order links and past due dates

Unlike most supply-demand sets, linked orders with due dates before the planning starting date are fully planned for by the system. The reason for this exception is that specific demand-supply sets must be synchronized. To learn more about the frozen zone that applies to most demand-supply types, go to [Process orders before the planning start date](design-details-balancing-demand-and-supply.md#process-orders-before-the-planning-start-date).

### Lot-for-Lot

The Lot-for-Lot policy is the most flexible because the system only reacts to actual demand. It acts on anticipated demand from forecast and blanket orders and then settles the order quantity based on the demand. The policy is intended for items where inventory can be accepted but should be avoided.  

In some ways, the Lot-for-Lot policy is similar to the Order policy. It can accept quantities in inventory, and it bundles demand and supply in the time buckets you define.

You specify the time bucket in the **Time Bucket** field on the **Item Card** page. The minimum size of time bucket is one day, because that's the smallest time unit of measure on demand and supply events in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

The time bucket also limits when you should reschedule a supply order to meet a given demand. Supply within the time bucket is rescheduled in or out to meet the demand. Earlier supply causes extra inventory, and you should cancel it. For supply that's later, create a new supply order.  

With this policy, you can specify a safety stock to compensate for changes in supply or to meet a sudden demand. The lot-for-lot policy can also include a dampener period and dampener quantity to reduce order scheduling.  

Together with the **Rescheduling Period** field, the **Lot Accumulation Period** field contributes to defining the reorder cycle. From the date of the first demand, the system accumulates all demands in the next lot accumulation period into one supply order on the date of the first demand. Demand that is outside the lot accumulation period isn't covered by the supply order.

Because the supply order quantity is based on the actual demand, it can make sense to use order modifiers:

* Round up the order quantity to meet an order multiple (or purchase unit of measure)
* Increase the order to a specified minimum order quantity
* Decrease the quantity to the specified maximum quantity (and thus create two or more supplies to reach the total needed quantity)

# Dimension Set Entries Overview
This topic describes how dimension set entries are stored and posted in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

## Dimension Sets  
A dimension set is a unique combination of dimension values. It is stored as dimension set entries in the database. Each dimension set entry represents a single dimension value. The dimension set is identified by a common dimension set ID that is assigned to each dimension set entry that belongs to the dimension set.  

The following example shows a dimension set that has three dimension set entries. The dimension set is identified by a dimension set ID, which is 108.  

|Dimension Set ID|Dimension Code|Dimension Value Code|Dimension Value Name|  
|----------------------|--------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|  
|108|AREA|70|America North|  
|108|BUSINESSGROUP|HOME|Home|  
|108|DEPARTMENT|SALES|Sales|  

## Dimension Set Entries  
Dimension sets are stored in the **Dimension Set Entry** table as dimension set entries with the same dimension set ID.  

![Flow of dimension set entries.](media/dimensionentrynav7.png "Flow of dimension set entries")  

When you create a new journal line, document header, or document line, you can specify a combination of dimension values. Instead of explicitly storing each dimension value in the database, a dimension set ID is assigned to the journal line, document header, or document line to specify the dimension set.  

When you edit and close the **Edit Dimension Set Entries** page, a check is performed to see whether the combination of dimension values exists as a dimension set in the table. If the combination occurs in the table, then the corresponding dimension set ID is assigned to the journal line, document header, or document line. Otherwise, a new dimension set is added to the table, and the new dimension set ID is assigned to the journal line, document header, or document line.

## Codeunit 408 Dimension Management
Codeunit 408, Dimension Management, is a function library that handles common tasks that are related to dimensions, such as copying from one table to another or from one document to another.

## Performance Improvement  
By storing dimension sets once in the database, database space is preserved and overall performance is improved.

# Use item references

If you buy or sell items that you and your vendor or customer use different terms for, then you can set up a reference between your terms for the items and the terms that the customer or vendor of that item uses. This way, the vendor's or customer's item description, unit of measure, or variant code is automatically inserted on the relevant documents when you fill in the **Item Reference No.** field.  

## To set up an item reference

1. Choose the :::image type="icon" source="media/ui-search/search_small.png" border="false"::: icon, enter **Items**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the card for an item for which you want to create a reference.
3. Choose the **Item References** action.

     If you can't find the **Item References** action, choose to view more options, and then find it under **Related** > **Item**.
  
4. On a new line on the **Item Reference Entries** page, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)].

The following procedure describes how you specify the item reference on a purchase order. Similar steps apply to sales documents and other purchase documents.  

## To enter a vendor's item description on a document

1. Choose the :::image type="icon" source="media/ui-search/search_small.png" border="false"::: icon, enter **Purchase Orders**, and then choose the related link.
2. Create a purchase order for the vendor that you set up an item reference for in the previous procedure.
3. Create a purchase line for the item that you set up an item reference for in the previous procedure.
4. In the item reference **No.** field, select the relevant item reference, and then choose the **OK** button.

The **Description** field on the line is overwritten with the vendor's item description, as set up on the item reference entry. If the item reference includes a variant code or a unit of measure, these values are also copied to the document.  

## Scan barcodes with the Business Central mobile app

[!INCLUDE [barcode-mobile-app](includes/barcode-mobile-app.md)]

The following table lists the pages that support barcode scanning of item references from the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] mobile app.

|Page  |Field value you can scan  |
|---------|---------|
|Item Reference     | Reference No.        |
|Item Journal Line     | Item Reference No.        |
|Phys. Invt. Order Line     |Item Reference No.         |
|Purchase Line     |   Item Reference No.      |
|Sales Line     | Item Reference No.        |

# Add extended text

Use extended texts to communicate additional information for items, stock-keeping units, general ledger accounts, project planning lines, and resources. For example, the extra details might be about special prices, terms, or handling instructions. Provide the information by adding extra lines as extended text. You can also set up conditions for use of the extra lines.  

The following section describes how to add extended text to a description of an item. The same steps apply to stock-keeping units, general ledger accounts, project planning lines, and resources.  

## To define extended text for a description

1. Open the card for an item that you want to add extended text to, and then choose the **Extended Text** action.
2. Fill in the **Code** and **Description** fields.
3. Choose the **New**.
4. Fill in the **Language Code** field, or turn on the **All Language Codes** toggle if you use language codes.
5. Fill in the **Starting Date** and **Ending Date** fields if you want to limit the dates on which the extended text is used.
6. On the **Lines** FastTab, in the **Text** field, enter the extended text.
7. On the **Sales**, **Purchases**, and **Service** FastTabs, turn on the toggles for the documents you want to include the extended text.
8. Close the page.

You can now add this extended text to documents. The following procedure explains how to add extended text to a sales order, but the same steps apply to any other document that you specified for the extended text.  

## To add an extended item text on a sales order line

1. Open a sales order that has a sales line for an item with extended text. To learn more, go to [Sell Products](sales-how-sell-products.md).
2. Select the line, and then choose the **Insert Ext. Text** action.

# Managing Sales Opportunities
Any incoming lead can be considered a sales opportunity. You can create opportunities and associate them to a salesperson so that you can keep track of potential sales.

Before you can start using opportunity management, you must set up sales cycles and sales cycle stages. As you create opportunities, you should provide information about the contact, salesperson, sales cycle, and dates, as well as your estimates for the sales value of the opportunity and your estimation of the chances of its success.

The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the topics that describe them.

# (Obsolete) Update Custom Report Layouts

[!INCLUDE[legacy-custom-layouts](includes/legacy-custom-layouts.md)]

Occasionally, you may need to update a custom report layout that is used on a report. This is required when there has been a design change to the report's data set, for example, a field that is used in the layout has been removed from the report data set. If a report layout requires updating, you will get an error message when you try to preview, print or save the report.  

You can automatically update a report layout from the error message that appears when you run the report by choosing the **Yes** button on the error message. Or, in advance of running reports, you can update specific report layouts or all custom report layouts that might be affected by dataset changes.  

You also have the option to test updates without applying the required changes to the custom report layouts. This enables you to see what changes will be applied to the report layout and identify possible issues in the process. From the test results, you can open the custom report layouts directly for editing to fix any issues. We recommend that you test the report layout update before you apply the updates.  

Not all report dataset changes can be automatically updated in the report layouts. Some changes will require that you manually edit the report layout. For more information, see [Limitations of the Custom Report Layout Update](ui-update-report-layouts.md#UpdateLimitations).  

## To update one or more custom report layouts  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Report Layout Selection**, and then choose the related link.  

2.  On the **Report Layout Selection** page, if you want to update a specific report, select the layout from the list, and then choose the **Update Layout** action. Or, if you want to update all custom report layouts for the company, choose the **Update All Layouts** action.  

If no errors occur, then the updates is applied to the report layouts. If errors occur, then a message that contains the errors appears. You will then have to manually edit the custom report layout to fix the error. For more information, see [Fixing Errors](ui-update-report-layouts.md#FixErrors).  

## To test custom report layout updates  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Report Layout Selection**, and then choose the related link.  

2.  On the **Report Layout Selection** page, choose the **Test Layout Updates** action.  

 Changes to the report layouts are tested but not applied to the actual report layouts. A **Report Layout Update Log** page appears that provides the status a potential updates for each report layout. If there are errors for a report layout, you can access the report layout directly for editing from the message to fix any issues. For more information, see [Fixing Errors](ui-update-report-layouts.md#FixErrors).  

##  <a name="UpdateLimitations"></a> Limitations of the Custom Report Layout Update  
 There are several types of changes that the automatic update can apply to custom report layouts, for example, a field that is used in the layout has been removed from the report data set. However, the automatic update cannot handle the following changes to a report dataset.  

1.  Deleted fields, labels, or data items.  

2.  Duplicate field names in the report layout after a field has been renamed in the dataset. This should be treated as a design error.  

3.  Upgrade scenarios where there are multiple iterations of a report layout that causes multiple rename actions on the same fields, labels or data items.  

 If the update process detects any one of these issues, the update cannot be applied. You will have to fix the issues manually, for example by editing the report layout in Word, or programmatically by using upgrade codeunits.  

##  <a name="FixErrors"></a> Fixing Errors  
 If you get an error message when you update or test report layout updates, you most likely will have to modify the report layout to fix the problem. Read the error message to help determine the cause of the problem.  

 The most typical problem occurs when a field that is used on the layout has been removed from the report dataset. In this case, you will see a line in the error message that states that an item has been removed. To fix this issue, you will have to modify the layout and remove the field in question.  

 For more information, see [Create and Modify a Custom Report Layout](ui-how-create-custom-report-layout.md#ModifyCustomLayout).  

After you modify the layout, try to update the layout again.

# Set up posting groups

Posting groups map entities to general ledger accounts. Examples of entities are customers, vendors, items, resources, and sales and purchase documents. Posting groups save time and help avoid mistakes when you post transactions. The transaction values go to the accounts specified in the posting group for that particular entity. The only requirement is that you have a chart of accounts. For more information, see [Set Up the Chart of Accounts](finance-setup-chart-accounts.md).  

Posting groups are covered under three umbrellas:  

* General

  Define who you sell to and buy from, and what you sell and what you buy. You can also combine groups to specify things like the income statement accounts to post to, or use groups to filter reports.  
* Specific

  Use sales documents, for example, instead of posting directly to the general ledger. When you create entries in the customer ledger, corresponding entries are made in the general ledger.  
* Tax

  Define the tax percentages and calculation types that apply to who you sell to and buy from, and what you sell and what you buy.

The following sections describe the posting groups under each umbrella.  

## General posting groups

The following table describes the general posting groups.

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| General Business Posting Groups |Assign this group to customers and vendors to specify who you sell to, and who you buy from. Set up these posting groups on the **Gen. Business Posting Groups** page. When you do, think about how many groups you need to break down sales and purchases. For example, group customers and vendors by geographical area, or by the type of business. |
| General Product Posting Groups |Assign this group to items and resources to specify what you sell, and what you buy. Set up these posting groups on the **Gen. Product Posting Groups** page. When you do, consider the number of groups you need to break down sales by product (items and resources) and purchases by items. For example, divide these groups by raw materials, retail, resources, capacity, and so on. |
| General Posting Setups |Combine business and product posting groups and choose the accounts to post to. For each combination of business and product posting groups, you can assign a set of general ledger accounts. For example, you can post the sale of the same item to different general ledger accounts because customers are assigned to different business posting groups. Set these configurations up on the **General Posting Setup** page. |

## Specific posting groups

The following table describes the posting groups that are specific to types of data.

|Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Customer Posting Groups |Define the accounts to use when you post accounts receivable transactions. If you use inventory with receivables, the accounts that the sales order lines post to are determined by the general business posting group assigned to your customer, and the general product posting group assigned to the inventory item. See *General Business Posting Groups* and *General Product Posting Groups* in the [General posting groups](#general-posting-groups) section. Set up these posting groups on the **Customer Posting Groups** page. |
| Vendor Posting Groups |Define where to post transactions for payables accounts, service charge accounts, and payment discount accounts. This is similar to customer posting groups. Set up these posting groups on the **Vendor Posting Groups** page. |
| Inventory Posting Groups |Define inventory posting groups that you then assign to the relevant item accounts on the **Inventory Posting Setup** page. This way, when you post entries concerning an item, the system posts to the G/L account that is set up for the combination of inventory posting group and location that is linked to the item. Inventory posting groups also provide a good way to organize your inventory, so you can separate items by their posting group when you generate reports. Set up these posting groups on the **Inventory Posting Groups** page. |
| Bank Account Posting Groups |Define the general ledger accounts that bank account entries are posted to. For example, this can simplify the processes of tracing transactions and reconciling bank accounts. Set up these posting groups on the **Bank Account Posting Groups** page. We recommend that these G/L accounts have the **Direct Posting** field set to *No*. |
| Fixed Assets Posting Groups |Define accounts for different types of expenses and costs, such as acquisition costs, accumulated depreciation amounts, acquisition costs on disposal, accumulated depreciation on disposal, gains on disposal, losses on disposal, maintenance expenses, and depreciation expenses. Set up these posting groups on the **FA Posting Groups** page. |

### Allow substitute customer or vendor posting groups on documents

You can let people choose other customer and vendor posting groups than the default groups when they're working with sales or purchase documents and journals.

To allow changes to customer posting groups, choose **Allow Multiple Posting Groups** on the **Sales & Receivable Setup** and **Service Mgt. Setup** pages, and the **Purchase & Payables Setup** page for vendor posting group changes.

On the **Customer Posting Groups** or **Vendor Posting Groups** pages, you can specify the posting groups to allow as substitutes by choosing **Substitutions**. Substitute posting groups can replace the default customer or vendor posting groups specified for a customer or vendor.

After you set this up, you can choose from the allowed substitute posting groups and change the customer or vendor posting group when posting sales or purchase documents and journals. The substitute customer or vendor posting groups are copied to posted documents and journals, and payable or receivable G/L entries are posted to the G/L accounts specified for the substitutes.

When applying, for example, an invoice and payment that are posted with different customer or vendor posting groups (different G/L accounts), [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] transfers the amounts between the G/L accounts to balance them.

## Tax posting groups

The following table describes the tax-related posting groups.

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Tax Business Posting Groups |Determine how to calculate and post sales tax for customers and vendors. Set up these posting groups on the **Tax Business Posting Groups** page. When you do, think about how many groups you need. For example, it might depend on factors like local legislation, and whether you trade both domestically and internationally. |
| Tax Product Posting Groups |Indicate the tax calculations needed for the types of items or resources you buy or sell. |
| Tax Posting Setup |Combine tax business posting groups and tax product posting groups. When you fill in a general journal line, purchase line, or sales line, we look at the combination to identify the accounts to use. |

If your country/region uses value-added tax (VAT), see [Set Up Calculations and Posting Methods for Value-Added Tax](finance-setup-vat.md).  

## Example of linking posting groups

Here's a scenario.  

These posting groups are chosen on the customer card:  

* General business posting group
* Customer posting group  

These posting groups are chosen on the item card:  

* General product posting group  
* Inventory posting group  

When you create a sales document, the sales header uses the customer card information, and the sales lines use the item card information.  

* The revenue posting (income statement) is determined by the combination of the general business posting group and the general product posting group.  
* The accounts receivable posting (balance sheet) is determined by the customer posting group.  
* The inventory posting (balance sheet) is determined by the inventory posting group.  
* The cost of goods sold posting (income statement) is determined by the combination of general business posting group and general product posting group.  

Your setup determines when posting happens. For example, the timing is affected by when you do periodic activities, such as posting inventory cost or adjusting cost item entries.

## Copy posting setup lines

The more product and business posting groups you have, the more lines you'll have on the **General Posting Setup** page. While there might be many different combinations of business and product posting groups, different combinations might still post to the same general ledger accounts. To limit the amount of manual entry, copy the general ledger accounts from an existing line on the **General Posting Setup** page.

## Set up posting groups on the go

To get users started faster, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can show notifications of missing G/L accounts in various posting group setups. To get these notifications, make sure that the **G/L Account is missing in posting group or setup** notification is selected in the **My Notifications** page, which you can access from the **Change when I receive notifications** field in the **My Settings** page.  

This way, when you work on a document that uses a posting group or a setup that is missing a required general ledger account, you get a notification. Choose the link in the notification to open a page where you can make the relevant changes, provided you have permission to do so.  

> [!NOTE]
> In order to take you directly to the posting group or setup that is missing a general ledger account, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will create a placeholder posting group or setup. Posting groups and setups are a way for the accountant to control how entries are posted to the general ledger, so such the just-in-time creation of posting groups and setups might not be allowed in your organization.  
>
> In that case, disable the *G/L Account is missing in posting group or setup* notification, and then work with your accountant to make the relevant changes to the posting group, setup, or your document. This is an important step, because after documents are posted, you can't delete incorrectly used posting groups or setups because general ledger entries are created for them.

Use the **Blocked** field in the **General Posting Setup** page to prevent users from mistakenly using a setup that is no longer relevant for new postings. 

## Access all fields and accounts when you set up a posting group  

Posting groups can be complex to set up. Because some types of accounts aren't frequently used, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't show them as columns on the lines. Also, to make it a bit easier to choose the right accounts, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] filters the accounts that you can choose in field lookups. 

If you want to access all accounts on the lines and in the field lookups, there are a couple of settings that can help:

* To show all accounts as columns on the lines, turn on the **Show All Accounts** toggle.
* On individual lines, to access all accounts in the field lookups, choose the **View All Accounts on Lookup** checkbox.

> [!NOTE]
> The **Show All Accounts** toggle might not seem to work on the **General Posting Setup** page. That's because [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] always shows all accounts as columns on the lines on that page.

## Troubleshooting posting group errors

Posting groups are one of the more advanced concepts to set up in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. If they aren't set up correctly, errors can occur when posting documents or journal lines. For example, these errors are typically caused by a mistake in how general ledger accounts are assigned, or how posting groups are combined.

When something is wrong, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will display the **Error Messages** page. The **Error Messages** page can make it easier to identify and resolve the issue. The page offers a description of the error that points out the posting group setup that needs attention. For example, the message might read "Sales Prepayment account is missing a General Posting Setup." There's also a link to open the page that's the source of the issue, so you can quickly resolve it.  

> [!NOTE]
> The error handling described above is not available on item, resource, employee, and fixed asset journals, or for G/L accounts added in local versions of posting groups.

## Audit changes to posting groups

You can use the Change Log feature to capture changes users make to your posting group setup. [!INCLUDE [include-audit-what-who-when](includes/include-audit-what-who-when.md)]

The following table lists the table for posting group and their IDs.

| Table | Table ID |
| ----- | -------- |
| Gen. Product Posting Group | 251 |
| Customer Posting Group | 92 |
| Inventory Posting Group | 94 |
| FA Posting Group | 5606 |
| Vendor Posting Group | 93 |

# Work with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]

While you're working in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you interact with data in different ways. For example, you create records, enter data, sort and filter data, write notes, and export data to other applications.

There are lots of ways to customize the appearance of pages:

- Adjust the size and position of any page.
- Expand the width of columns and increase the height of column headers.
- Change how you sort data in columns.

If you want to use the horizontal scroll bar to view all columns on a list page or on document lines, there's a vertical freeze pane to keep some columns from scrolling.

## Getting around in Business Central

Here's a short video about how to get around in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

> [!VIDEO https://www.youtube.com/embed/zqz03iMihx0]

## Choosing a desktop browser

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports multiple browsers, and each browser offers various features. The browser plays a significant role in the responsiveness and fluidity of the user interface. Check out the list of supported, recommended browsers for [Business Central online](./product-requirements.md) and browsers for [Business Central on-premises](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/deployment/system-requirement-business-central-v15).

- Where possible, avoid older browsers such as Internet Explorer. Instead, switch to one of our recommended modern browsers, such as the [new Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/edge/).  

    > [!NOTE]
    > Internet Explorer is no longer supported. To learn more, go to [Microsoft Edge documentation](https://support.microsoft.com/hub/4337664/microsoft-edge-help).
- Keep your browser up to date with the latest version.

## Action bars

Inside [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you do most of your work in a list, a document, or a card. All pages have a bar with actions that are relevant to them. The actions are almost the same for the individual card or document and the list of entities. This way, you can manage an individual sales order in the **Sales Order** page and in the **Sales Orders** list, including posting it and invoicing it.  

How you open a page and the context of what you're doing affect whether actions are available. Actions can appear differently, not be available, or even not be present. Not all actions are relevant, or supported, for all processes. Also, some actions require that you make a selection. If an action isn't relevant or supported, we make them unavailable. We do that to help clarify what you can do with your selections.

Specifically for list pages, the list page that you open from the home page and the page that opens when you use the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon to search for it aren't identical.  

When you search for and open a list page, such as the **Sales Orders** list, it's in view mode. The actions for editing, viewing, or deleting an individual entity, such as a sales order, are shown when you choose the **Manage** action.  

> [!TIP]
> If you know that you'll often use actions on the second level of the action bar, choose the :::image type="icon" source="media/pin.png" border="false"::: icon to pin the action bar and make the actions under the various menus immediately discoverable.
>
> To hide the second level of the action bar again, choose the :::image type="icon" source="media/unpin.png" border="false"::: icon.

When you open the same list page from your home page, the **Manage** action isn't available. Instead, to open an individual sales order, choose the **Number** field. In this view, you can't pin the action bar.

# Change which features are displayed

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is designed to help you run your business regardless of the size and complexity. At the core of the product, you find essential features, such as financial reporting, sales, purchasing, and inventory management. As business complexity increases, you can turn on functionality for manufacturing and service management, for example.

You can define the product complexity level, and thereby which features the company's users get access to, by changing the **Experience** setting on the **Company Information** page. Note that the experience setting can also be changed by adding certain extensions from AppSource. For more information, see [Customizing [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Using Extensions](ui-extensions.md).

The following table lists the experiences that are currently available.

| Experience | Impact on User Interface |
| --- | --- |
| **Essential** |Shows all actions and fields for all common business functionality.|
| **Premium** |Shows all actions and fields for all business functionality, including Manufacturing and Service Management.|

The experiences that can be selected in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] reflect the solution licenses, called plans, that are defined for the product. For information about the Essential and Premium plans, see [Business Central](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2264940) on the Microsoft Dynamics 365 marketing site. See also the [[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Licensing Guide](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2264939).

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Users of type Team Member, Internal Admin, External Accountant, and Delegated Admin can be assigned a different plan than other users in the solution. Only users of type Evaluation or Premium can change the value in the **Experience** field from Essential to Premium.

> [!NOTE]
> In 2024 release wave 1, a user with the Premium plan can sign in to a company that's using the Essentials plan. However, the Premium user can't use any of the features that the Premium license provides. The same isn't true in the opposite direction. Users who have the Essentials plan can't sign in to a company that's using the Premium plan.

Prior to defining a company's experience setting, you define users' access to specific functions and pages by assigning permission sets. For more information, see [Assign Permissions to Users and Groups](ui-define-granular-permissions.md).

The **Experience** setting applies to all users in a company, but each user can personalize their own experience further by changing page layouts and content. For more information, see [Personalize Your Workspace](ui-personalization-user.md).

## Enabling premium features after upgrading a plan

Users are assigned to plans in Microsoft 365 Admin Center in connection with the general work to create the Business Central users. For more information, see [Add users and assign licenses at the same time](/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/add-users?view=o365-worldwide&preserve-view=true).

### To update plan changes in users groups

[!INCLUDE [2023rw1-sec-group-short](includes/2023rw1-sec-group-short.md)]

When you have made a change to users plans in Microsoft 365 Admin Center, such as assigned more users to the Premium plan, you must update [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to reflect the change.

1. Sign is as an administrator.
2. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Users**, and then choose the related link.
3. On the **Users** page, choose the **Update users from Microsoft 365** action.

### To select the Premium experience

You can now proceed to select the new experience.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Company Information**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Company Information** page, on the **User Experience** FastTab, select Premium  in the **Experience** field.

## Help assumes the Premium experience

All feature descriptions in user documentation for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] assume the **Premium** experience, meaning the descriptions cover the full scope of UI elements.

# Chat with Copilot (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]

This article explains how to chat with Copilot to get answers about your company data and assistance with tasks and subject matters related to Business Central.​

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/production-ready-preview-dynamics365.md)]

## About chat with Copilot

Microsoft Copilot is an AI-powered assistant that helps spark creativity, boost productivity, and eliminate tedious tasks. By chatting with Copilot in Business Central, you can ask questions and find business data using natural language. Here's what you can do:

- Find business data for your company in Business Central. Use chat to look up and open data about entities or records related to business processes, such as customers, vendors, sales orders, and items. For example, ask: "Show me the latest sales order for Adatum".

  Copilot can also organize data for you. Just ask it to group records or do calculations like adding or averaging, and it generates an analysis tab, displaying the results.

- Get explanations or step-by-step guidance on various tasks. For example, ask: "Help me understand dimensions" or "How do I post a sales order". Learn more about prompting in [Prompting for aggregating data on analysis tabs](#prompting-for-aggregating-data-on-analysis-tabs).
- Know the purpose and use of each field. When you choose **Ask Copilot** in a tooltip for a field, chat opens with an Explain prompt for the field name and Copilot provides information about it. Copilot links to the articles it referenced, so it's easy to verify the description.
  
Using chat with Copilot streamlines your workflow by bypassing traditional navigation and product help. Watch [Work smarter with Copilot in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2250609) to learn more.

Copilot's source responses are generated from the official [Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central documentation](/dynamics365/business-central/) page.

## Prerequisites

- For Business Central update 25.3 through 25.5, Chat with Copilot feature must be enabled on the **Feature Management** page by an administrator. Learn more in [Enabling Upcoming Features Ahead of Time](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/feature-management).
- The **Chat** capability is activated by an administrator. Learn more in [Configuring Copilot and agent capabilities](enable-ai.md).

## Get started using chat with Copilot

1. In the upper-right corner of the screen, select the ![Shows the icon for chat with Copilot](media/chat-copilot-icon.png) **Copilot** icon ![Shows cllour number 1](media/callout-number-1.svg).

   The **Copilot** pane appears as shown in the image:

    ![Shows the icon for chat with Copilot pane with callouts](media/chat-with-copilot-pane.svg)

1. In the **Ask a question** box at the bottom ![Shows callout number 2](media/callout-number-2.svg), enter your question, and then select the arrowhead or press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to get an answer.

   Your input, known as a *prompt*, can be a question, statement, or command.

   > [!TIP]
   > Copilot includes a couple of features that can help you write questions:
   > - To help formulate questions, select one of the prompt guides&mdash;**Find**, **Explain**, or **Guide**&mdash;available at the top of the pane ![Shows callout number 3](media/callout-number-3.svg) or from the ![Shows prompt guide icon](media/prompt-guide-icon.png) **View Prompts**  icon above **Ask a question** box ![Shows callout number 4](media/callout-number-4.svg). Prompt guides are predefined short phrases that begin a question or prompt. They save you time, guide Copilot's responses toward a category of answers, and help you learn how to phrase questions to get the best responses.
   > - Select the prompt suggestions above the **View prompts** button ![Shows callout number 5](media/callout-number-5.svg) to automatically ask a predefined question to see how the questions and answers work. Prompt suggestions are only available when you're using the CRONUS demonstration company.

1. Review the answers displayed in the Copilot pane ![Shows callout number 6](media/callout-number-6.svg).

   The answers you receive depend on your question—it could include text, links to pages in Business Central, or helpful articles from Microsoft Learn.

   To assist you better, Chat might ask for more details about your prompt and give you a few options to choose from. In some instances, Chat follows an answer with related prompt suggestions for you to choose from ![Shows callout number 5](media/callout-number-5.svg).

1. Ask another question to refine the answer.

   Chat remembers the context, which means that you don't have to repeat key points from the original question.

## Clear chat to start over

To switch to a different topic with Copilot, select the ![Shows the clear chat icon](media/clear-chat-icon.png) **Start a new Copilot chat session**  icon at the bottom of the Copilot pane, just above the question box. This clears Copilot's memory of your last few messages. Starting over is often helpful after a lengthy conversation and it can help Copilot deliver more accurate answers.

The chat also clears if you close or sign out of Business Central.

## Tips for better questions

### Basic techniques to improve the answers

Here are some ways you can improve the answers you get from Copilot:

- Ask clear and specific questions.
- Be concise and avoid long sentences or multiple sentences.
- Ask one question at a time. <!--Avoid asking about multiple questions in one message.-->
- Use natural language, expressing the questions in a friendly and conversational manner.
- Use keywords, phrases, and terms that you know are used in Business Central, either in the app or documentation.
- Ask follow-up questions or rephrase the last question if the initial response doesn't fully answer your questions.
- Clear the current chat session to start over if you're asking a question on a different subject matter than the previous question.

### Prompting for aggregating data on analysis tabs

If you prompt using phrases related to data aggregation, chat creates an analysis tab that you can open from a link it replies with in the Copilot pane. For example, the following figure illustrates an answer you could get for the prompt: "In which countries are my top customer?":

![Shows a link tot ana analysis tab in the chat with Copilot pane](media/chat-analysis-tab.png)

To generate this type of response, use common words and phrases related to data aggregation and analysis, like "group", "pivot", "sum", "average", "most", and "least", in different variations. For example:

`show me customers grouped by their country and zipcode`

`group the current records by name and location`  

Learn more about analysis tabs in [Analyze data in lists with help from Copilot](analysis-assist.md).

### Example prompts

Your questions to Copilot vary depending on your role, current task, the processes that your organization follows, and how you express yourself in words. Here are some examples to show different ways to ask questions in the chat pane to help inspire you to write your own based on your situation.

Prompt: `Find the Item with Description 'ATHENS Desk'`

In this example, you give clear instructions for Copilot to locate a single record. For example, you hint that the record is found in the Item list. You indicate the field 'Description' must be a specific text that you typed using quotes and with correct capitalization. Copilot usually responds accurately when given a few precise hints, but you can also use more casual language as in the next example.

Prompt: `Give me the latest invoice for adatum`

In this example, you ask Copilot to locate a record, but the question is less precise and might result in a less accurate answer. Copilot can often understand, or guess, that the invoice you're looking for isn't a purchase invoice but a sales invoice from the Posted Sales Invoice list. Copilot would also need to match `adatum` with `Adatum Corporation` that is the full and precise name for the sell-to Customer name associated with the invoice.

Prompt: `Show me customer ledger entries for Adatum from about three weeks ago`

In this example, you ask Copilot to solve a common date puzzle that typically requires you to open a calendar for reference, or to use advanced date range filters. Copilot can usually understand common expressions and business terms.

Prompt: `How does I save my filterrings for later?`

In this example, you ask Copilot for guidance on how to perform some task in Business Central. Copilot can usually understand the intent of your question, even if there are a few grammatical errors, spelling mistakes or abbreviations.

## Provide feedback on answers

You can rate the answers you get from Copilot by using the like (thumbs up) button for good rating or the dislike (thumbs down) button for a poor rating. When you select the dislike button, you can choose a reason, including inaccurate, inappropriate, or other. This information can help us improve suggestions.

# Inventory analytics

Businesses capture lots of data during daily activities that supports business intelligence (BI) for inventory managers:

- Shipping of goods when sales orders are fulfilled.
- Receipts of items when purchase orders are fulfilled.
- Movements of items between locations.

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides features to help you gather, analyze, and share your organization's inventory data:

- Power BI reports for inventory
- Ad-hoc analysis on lists
- Ad-hoc analysis of data in Excel (using Open in Excel)
- Built-in inventory analytics tools
- Built-in inventory reports

Each of these features has its advantages and disadvantages, depending on the type of data analysis and the role of the user. To learn more, go to [Analytics, business intelligence, and reporting overview](reports-bi-reporting.md).

This article introduces how you can use these analytical features to gain insights into your inventory.

## Analytics needs in inventory

When you think about the analytics needs in inventory management, it might help to use a persona-based model that describes different analytics needs at a high-level.

:::image type="content" source="/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/media/analytics-personas.svg" alt-text="Illustration of different personas for analytics" lightbox="/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/media/analytics-personas.svg":::

People in different roles have different needs when it comes to data, and they use the data in different ways. For example, people in asset management and finance interact with data differently than people in sales.

:::image type="content" source="/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/media/analytics-personas-scenarios.svg" alt-text="Illustration of how different personas have different analytics needs." lightbox="/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/media/analytics-personas-scenarios.svg":::

| Role              | Data aggregation  | Typical ways to consume data                          | 
|-------------------|-------------------| ----------------------------------------------------- |
|COO / CFO / CEO    | Performance data  | KPIs, dashboards, financial reports           |
|Inventory Manager  | Trends, summaries | Built-in managerial reports, ad-hoc analysis      | 
|Warehouse worker   | Detailed data     | Built-in operational reports, on-screen task data |

<!-- 
## Inventory KPIs

A key performance indicator (KPI) is a measurable value that shows how effectively you’re meeting your goals. In inventory management, people often use the following KPIs to monitor their organization's sales performance:

- TODO  
-->

## Using Power BI to monitor inventory KPIs

A key performance indicator (KPI) is a measurable value that shows how effectively you’re meeting your goals. In inventory management, people often use the following KPIs to monitor their core inventory performance:

- Number of Scheduled Receipt
- Number of Planned Order Receipt
- Gross Requirement
- Projected Available Balance
- Quantity on Sales Orders, Purchase Returns, Service Orders, Projects, Production Orders, or Assemply Component
- Inventory by Item/Location/Lot/Serial No.

:::image type="content" source="media/inventory/inventory-overview.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Inventory Overview Power BI Report" lightbox="media/inventory/inventory-overview.png":::

For inventory valuation, you can use the following KPIs to monitor the value kept in your inventory:

- Ending balance inventory value
- Variance by item/location
- Invoiced Quantity
- Increases/Decreases in quantity (by item/location)

:::image type="content" source="media/inventory-valuation/inventory-valuation-by-location.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Inventory Valuation by Location Power BI Report" lightbox="media/inventory-valuation/inventory-valuation-by-Location.png":::

All of these purchasing KPIs (and more) are available in the Inventory Power BI apps for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

To learn more, go to:

- [Power BI Inventory app](inventory-powerbi-app.md)
- [Power BI Inventory Valuation app](inventory-valuation-powerbi-app.md)

### Reports in the Power BI Inventory app

[!INCLUDE [power-bi-inventory-app](includes/power-bi-inventory-app.md)]

To learn more, go to [Power BI Inventory app](inventory-powerbi-app.md).

### Reports in the Power BI Inventory Valuation app

[!INCLUDE [power-bi-inventory-valuation-app](includes/power-bi-inventory-valuation-app.md)]

To learn more, go to [Power BI Inventory Valuation app](inventory-valuation-powerbi-app.md).

## Use financial reporting to produce financial statements and KPIs related to inventory

The **Financial Reporting** feature gives you insights into the financial data shown on your chart of accounts (COA). You can set up financial reports to analyze figures in general ledger (G/L) accounts, and compare general ledger entries with budget entries. Specifically for inventory management, you can set up financial reports on the general ledger (G/L) accounts that you use to track inventory postings.

Dimensions play an important role in business intelligence. A dimension is data that you add to an entry as a parameter. Dimensions let you group entries that have similar characteristics, such as customers, regions, products, and salesperson. Among other purposes, use dimensions when you define analysis views and create financial reports. To learn more, go to [Work with Dimensions](finance-dimensions.md).

To learn more about financial reports, go to [Prepare Financial Reports with Financial Data and Account Categories](bi-how-work-account-schedule.md).

## Finance reporting across business units or legal entities (related to inventory)

Some organizations use [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in multiple business units or legal entities. Others use [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in subsidiaries that report to parent organizations. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] gives accountants tools that help them transfer general ledger entries from two or more companies (subsidiaries) into a consolidated company. Specifically for inventory management, you might want to consolidate general ledger entries for your inventory accounts to be able to track sales KPIs across business units or legal entities.

To learn more, go to [Company consolidation](finance-consolidated-company-reporting.md).

## Ad-hoc analysis of inventory data

Sometimes, you just need to check whether the numbers add up correctly, or quickly confirm a figure. The following features are great for ad-hoc analyses:

- Data analysis on ledger list pages
- Open in Excel

The Data Analysis feature lets you open almost any list page, such as **Item Ledger Entries**, enter analysis mode, and then group, filter, and pivot data as you see fit.

:::image type="content" source="media/data-analysis-inventory-dead-stock.png" alt-text="Example of how to do a old stock data analysis on the Item Ledger Entries page." lightbox="media/data-analysis-inventory-dead-stock.png":::

Similarly, you can use the **Open in Excel** action to open a list page, optionally filter the list to a subset of the data, and then use Excel to work with the data. For example, by using features such as Analyze Data, What-If Analysis, or Forecast Sheet.

<!-- :::image type="content" source="media/open-in-excel-item-ledger-entries.png" alt-text="Example of how to do data analysis on the Item Ledger Entries data using Excel." lightbox="media/open-in-excel-item-ledger-entries.png"::: -->

> [!TIP]
> If you configure OneDrive for system features, the Excel workbook opens in your browser.

To learn more about how to do ad-hoc analysis on inventory data, go to [Ad hoc analysis of inventory data](ad-hoc-analysis-inventory.md).

## Built-in reports for inventory

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes several built-in reports, tracing functions, and tools to help inventory organizations report on their data.

[!INCLUDE [inventory_reports_report_explorer](includes/inventory-reports-report-explorer-include.md)]

To learn more about reports that are relevant for inventory, go to [Built-in inventory and warehouse reports](inventory-WMS-reports.md).

## On-screen inventory analytics

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] has several pages that give you inventory overviews and tasks to do. Here are some examples to get you started:

- [View the Availability of Items](inventory-how-availability-overview.md)
- [Track items with serial, lot, and package numbers](inventory-how-work-item-tracking.md)
- [Trace item-tracked items](inventory-how-to-trace-item-tracked-items.md)
- [Audit the reconciliation between the inventory ledger and the general ledger](finance-how-to-post-inventory-costs-to-the-general-ledger.md#to-audit-the-reconciliation-between-the-inventory-ledger-and-the-general-ledger)
- [View cross-docked items in a shipment or pick worksheet](warehouse-how-to-cross-dock-items.md#to-view-cross-docked-items-in-a-shipment-or-pick-worksheet)

The sales module also include analytics pages related to inventory:

- [Calculate order promising dates](sales-how-to-calculate-order-promising-dates.md)
- [Calculate delivery dates for sales orders](sales-date-calculation-for-sales.md)
- [Track packages](sales-how-track-packages.md)

### Show inventory-related general ledger entries and balances from the Chart of Accounts page

The **Chart of Accounts** page shows all general ledger accounts with aggregated numbers posted to the general ledger. From this page, you can do things like:  

- View reports that show general ledger entries and balances.  
- Review a list of posting groups for that account.
- View separate debit and credit balances for a single account.

Specifically for inventory management, you can create a view on the Chart of Accounts page that only shows the accounts you use to post inventory entries.

:::image type="content" source="media/chart-of-accounts-page.png" alt-text="Example of how the Chart of Accounts page shows finance insights" lightbox="media/chart-of-accounts-page.png":::

To learn more, go to [Understand the Chart of Accounts](finance-general-ledger.md#the-chart-of-accounts).

### Analyze inventory data by dimensions

Dimensions are values that categorize entries so you can track and analyze them on documents, such as sales orders. Dimensions can, for example, indicate the project or department an entry came from.  

So, instead of setting up separate general ledger accounts for each department or location, you can use dimensions as a basis for analysis and avoid having to create a complicated chart of accounts structure.

To learn more, go to [Analyze Data by Dimensions](bi-how-analyze-data-dimension.md).

# Specify posting periods

Use posting periods to specify when users can post to the general ledger.  

## To specify posting periods

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Ledger Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **General Ledger Setup** page, define the period by entering dates in the **Allow Posting From** and **Allow Posting To** fields.  

> [!NOTE]  
> These posting periods apply to the company and to all users. To allow for exceptions, you can define different posting periods for specific users on the **User Setup** page. These posting periods overrule those specified on the **General Ledger Setup** page. For more information, see [Set up time constraints for users](ui-define-granular-permissions.md#set-up-time-constraints-for-users).

## Video guidance

When you're closing an accounting period, you might want to prevent new posts from coming in, or allow only certain people to post transactions. The following video shows how to control when, and who, can post transactions to your general ledger.

# Allocate revenue and costs to multiple general ledger accounts

This article describes how to use allocation accounts to distribute amounts on sales and purchase documents and general journal lines to different G/L accounts. You can allocate amounts through a fixed or variable distribution.  

Allocation splits a general journal line into the lines defined on the **Allocation Account** page. For example, if you split a rent expense three ways using dimensions, you'll have three lines to post for the allocation. Therefore, you'll have six G/L lines (or possibly more if you're using VAT or sales tax). Although this posts more G/L entries than you might need, it allows you to reverse individual lines instead of reversing the whole allocation.

Allocation accounts also work with deferrals. To learn more about deferrals, go to [Defer Revenues and Expenses](finance-how-defer-revenue-expenses.md).

The following table introduces the allocation methods you can use.

|Allocation Method  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|Fixed     | When you want to split up expenses in a way that's repeated over a longer period of time, you can use a fixed allocation. A fixed allocation lets you define the allocation split. This split will only change when you change the setup on the **Allocation Account** page.        |
|Variable     | To distribute revenue or expenses based on values that change over time, use the variable allocation method. Variable allocations let you specify the sources to use to calculate the allocation percentages. This method is useful, for example, for splitting employee costs that according to varying headcounts in departments or divisions. Another example is the distributing the cost of rent based on production floor footage that might vary per production line over time. Variable allocations use a combination of dimensions and statistical accounts to determine how amounts distribute over a period of time. To learn more about statistical accounts, go to [Analyze Data with Statistical Accounts](bi-use-statistical-accounts.md). To learn more about dimensions, go to [Work with Dimensions](finance-dimensions.md).        |

## Use a fixed share or percentage method to allocate amounts

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Allocation Account**, and then choose the related link.  
1. On the **Allocation Accounts** page, choose **New**.
1. Fill in the **No.** and **Name** fields.
1. In the **Account Type** field, choose **Fixed**.
1. In the **Destination Account Type** field, choose **G/L Account** or **Bank Account**.
1. In the **Destination Account Number** field, choose the account to post the value to.
1. Optional: Choose the **Dimensions** action, and then specify the dimensions to post for the line.
1. In the **Share** and **Percent** fields, specify how to distribute amounts to the destination account.
  
   > [!TIP]
   > If you enter the actual amount to allocate for a fixed allocation in the **Share** field, the **Percent** field shows the percentage of the total amount.
1. Repeat this process for each account to include in the allocation.

## Use a variable method to allocate amounts

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Allocation Account**, and then choose the related link.  
1. On the **Allocation Accounts** page, choose **New**.
1. Fill in the **No.** and **Name** fields.
1. In the **Account Type** field, choose **Variable**.
1. In the **Destination Account Type** field, choose **G/L Account**.
1. In the **Destination Account Number** field, choose the account to post the value to.
1. In the **Breakdown Account Type** field, choose **Statistical Account**.
1. In the **Calculation Period** field, choose the period for which to distribute amounts.
1. Optional: To filter on specific global dimension values, choose the **Breakdown account balance filters** action, and then specify the filter values.
1. Optional: Choose the **Dimensions** action, and then specify the dimensions to post for the line.

## Allocate amounts on the fly

You create allocation accounts to split revenue and costs for G/L accounts and bank accounts. Automating allocation can save time. However, if you want to use allocation accounts, but you don't want to create them for each G/L account, you can save even more time.

The Inherit from parent option lets you use the allocation account to split amounts for any G/L account on a line on a document or journal. In the **Account Type** field on a document or journal line, you choose a G/L account, and then choose the allocation account in the **Allocation Account No.** field. The amount on the line is split for the G/L account according to the setup in your allocation account. It's a less transparent way of allocating, but you don't have to create an allocation account specifically for the G/L account.

Ad-hoc allocations are easy to set up. Instead of specifying a bank or G/L account in the **Destination Account Type** field on the **Allocation Account** page, choose the **Inherit from parent** option. Leave the **Destination Account Number** field blank. When you choose the G/L account on the document or journal line, that account is used to allocate amounts.

## Verify that amounts distribute correctly before you post them

There are a couple of ways to verify that amounts distribute correctly:

* On the **Allocation Account** page, choose the **Test Allocation** action. Use the **Amount to Allocate** field to test different amounts.
* On the **General Ledger Journals** page, choose the journal, and then use the **Posting Preview** action.

## Adjust the distribution

If you find something in an allocation that you'd like to change, you can adjust the allocation before you post it.  

1. Open the document or journal that has the allocation you want to change.
1. Choose the line, and then choose the **Redistribute Account Allocations** action.
1. On the **Change Allocations** page, make your adjustment.

## Post an allocation transaction

# Sustainability scorecards and goals overview

This article offers guidance on how to create scorecards and goals, and how to update the status of goals. Scorecards and goals allow organizations to curate sustainability metrics and track them against key business objectives. Goals can be created based on current and target values, so users can keep track of the progress of current gas emissions, or water/waste intensity, compared to previous periods.  

## Create a scorecard  

To create a sustainability scorecard, follow these steps:

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sustainability Scorecards**, and then select the related link.
2. On the **Sustainability Scorecards** page, select **New** to create a new scorecard.  
3. Specify the **No.** and the **Name** fields on the **General** FastTab, and then add the **Owner**.

> [!NOTE]
> In the **Owner** field, you can only choose users who enabled the **Sustainability Manager** field on the **User Setup** page.

## Create goals  

To create a new sustainability goal, follow these steps:

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sustainability Scorecards**, and then select the related link.
2. Choose the **Goals** action to create a new sustainability goal for the scorecard.  
3. Select **New** to start creating a goal.
4. The **Scorecard No.** is automatically added based on the value from the sustainability scorecard, and you can't edit this field. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] also fills in the **Unit of Measure** field based on the **Emission Unit of Measure Code** on the **Sustainability Setup** page.  
5. Fill in **No.** and **Name** of the new sustainability goal. The **Owner** field is automatically filled in based on the value from the connected **Sustainability Scorecard**.
6. You can create a sustainability goal for the entire company, a specific country/region, or a facility. To create a specific goal, choose the country or region in the **Country/Region Code** field or the facility in the **Responsibility Center** field.  
7. Select the **Start Date** and **End Date** fields to set up a dedicated period for tracking current values. This configuration determines the values in the **Current Value for CO2**, **Current Value for CH4**, **Current Value for N2O**, **Current Value for Water Intensity**, and **Current Value for Waste Intensity** fields.  
8. Select the **Baseline Start Date** and **Baseline End Date** fields to set up a dedicated baseline period for comparing current values. This configuration determines the values in the **Baseline for CO2**, **Baseline for CH4**, **Baseline for N2O**, **Baseline for Water Intensity**, and **Baseline for Waste Intensity** fields.  
9. You can also add target values in the selected **Unit of Measure** field for the current period using the following **Target Value for CO2**, **Target Value for CH4**, **Target Value for N2O**, **Target Value for Water Intensity**, and **Target Value for Waste Intensity** fields.
10. You can specify one of these goals as a **Main Goal**. Values from the main goal are used on the **Sustainability Manager** Role Center.  

If you have many goals on the page, you can use the **Show My Goals** action to show only your goals. To show all, run the **Show All Goals** action.  

> [!NOTE]
> You can only create sustainability goals for a specific sustainability scorecard. You can't create goals that aren't related to a scorecard, but you can create more goals for one scorecard. You can only have one sustainability goal as the **Main Goal**.  

> [!NOTE]
> You can set up different combinations of goals for the whole company, specific countries or regions, and a responsibility center for a sustainability scorecard. You can also use different periods for the same model of tracking.

# Project Realization (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Project Realization** report shows how billing is performing against the costs.

The report compares the billable (invoiced price) value to the actual (total price) value, and highlights how much of each project was invoiced.

:::image type="content" source="media/projects/project-realization.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Project Realization Power BI Report" lightbox="media/projects/project-realization.png":::

## Use the report

Leadership and project managers use the report to identify which projects they need to invoice. CFOs also use this report.

CFOs can check which projects have low realization, and send invoices accordingly to ensure you meet monthly invoicing goals and have healthy turnover.

Project managers use this report to identify projects with completed work that isn't invoiced.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The *Project Realization* report includes the following KPIs:

- [**Actual (Total Price)**](projects-powerbi-kpis.md#actual-total-price)
- [**Billable (Invoiced Price)**](projects-powerbi-kpis.md#billable-invoiced-price)
- [**Realization %**](projects-powerbi-kpis.md#realization-)
- [**Realization Variance**](projects-powerbi-kpis.md#realization-variance)

[!INCLUDE[click-on-a-kpi-link](includes/click-on-a-kpi-link.md)] 

[!INCLUDE[powerbi-tip-track-kpis](includes/powerbi-tip-track-kpis.md)]


## Data used in the report

The report uses data from the following tables in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]:

- Project
- Project Ledger Entries

# Allocate recurring costs and income

You can allocate an entry in a recurring general journal to several accounts when you post the journal. To learn more about recurring general journals, go to [Work with recurring journals](ui-work-general-journals.md#work-with-recurring-journals).

The following allocation methods are available:

* Quantity
* Percentage (%)
* Amount

The allocation features work with recurring general journals and in fixed asset journals.
<!--You can also distribute the cost or revenue of a line to an intercompany partner when you post a sales or purchase document. When you post the document, a line will be posted in your general journal, and a corresponding line will be created in the intercompany outbox.-->

The following procedures describe how to prepare to allocate costs in a recurring general journal by defining allocation keys. When allocation keys are defined, you complete and post the journal like any other recurring general journal. For more information, see [Work with General Journals](ui-work-general-journals.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> **Allocation Accounts** aren't supported in recurring journals. While the **Allocation Account** option is available in the **Account Type** field on the lines of the journal, this option isn't supported. Instead, use the allocations feature as described in this article.
>
> If you defined allocation accounts in a previous version of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], update the setup to use allocations.

## To set up allocation keys

You can allocate an entry in a recurring general journal to several different accounts when you post the journal. The allocation can be a quantity, percentage, or amount.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Recurring General Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **Batch Name** field to open the **General Journal Batches** page.
3. You can either modify allocations on an existing batch in the list or create a new batch with allocations.
   * To create a new batch, choose the **New** action, and go to the next step.
   * To change the allocations of an existing journal, select the journal and go to step 7.    
4. In the **Name** field, enter a name for the batch, such as CLEANING. In the **Description** field, enter a description, such as Cleaning Expenses Journal.
5. When you're done, close the page. A new, empty recurring journal opens.
6. Fill in the fields on the line.
7. Choose the **Allocations** action.
8. Add a line for each allocation. You must fill in either the **Allocation %**, **Allocation Quantity**, or **Amount** field. You must also fill in the **Account No.** field and, if you're allocating the transaction among global dimensions, the global dimension fields.
9. If you enter a percentage on a line, the amount in the **Amount** field is calculated automatically. These amounts have the opposite sign from the total amount in the **Amount** field in the recurring journal.
10. After entering the allocations lines, choose **OK** to return to the **Recurring General Journal** page. The **Allocated Amt. (USD)** field is filled in and matches the **Amount** field.
11. Post the journal.

## To change an allocation key that is already set up

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Recurring General Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Recurring General Journals** page, select the journal with the allocation.
3. Choose the line with the allocation, and then choose the **Allocations** action.
4. Change the relevant fields, and then choose **OK**.

# Schedule jobs to adjust and reconcile inventory cost

Schedule Jobs for automatic cost adjustment with the general ledger, posting to the general ledger are turned on by default.
However, as data accumulates over time that might impact performance. To reduce the load on the application, it's often helpful to use job queue entries to move tasks to run in the background.

## Move the task of adjusting item costs to the background with the help of assisted setup

Creating the job queue entries can be tricky, even for an experienced consultant, so we have an assisted setup guide to make the process easier for adjusting item costs.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Inventory Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Inventory Setup** page, toggle the **Automatic Cost Posting** field, or specify **Never** in the **Automatic Cost Adjustment** field.  
3. In the notification that now displays at the top of the page, choose the **Schedule Job Queue Entry** link. This opens the **Schedule Cost Adjustment and Posting** assisted setup guide.  
4. Specify the task that you want to schedule.  

  > [!NOTE]
  > You cannot create a new job queue entry if a job queue entry for the specified task already exists.

5. Select the **View job queue entries when finished** field to review and adjust settings. For more information, see [Use Job Queues to Schedule Tasks](admin-job-queues-schedule-tasks.md).  

## To create a job queue entry for adjusting and reconciling inventory cost manually

Alternatively, you can create job queue entries manually. The following procedure shows how to set the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job to automatically run daily, but the same steps apply to the **Post Inventory Cost to G/L** batch job.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Job Queue Entries**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. In the **Object Type to Run** field, choose *Report*.  
4. In the **Object ID to Run** field, choose *795*, **Adjust Cost - Item Entries**.  
5. In the **Next Run Date Formula** field, enter *1D*.
6. In the **Starting Time** field, enter *2 AM*.
7. Choose the **Set Status to Ready** action.

Now, inventory cost will be updated every night.  

To schedule a task for reconciling inventory with the general ledger, choose Codeunit 2846 **Post Inventory Cost to G/L**.

> [!TIP]
> To avoid locking, do not schedule tasks for the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job, the **Post Inventory Cost to G/L** codeunit, and tasks for posting sales or purchasing transactions at the same time. Also, make sure that they use same job queue category.

# Manage Work across Multiple Companies in the Company Hub

[!INCLUDE[azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id](~/../shared-content/shared/azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id.md)]

Some people work in multiple companies in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], and some also work in more than one organization, such as external accountants, or employees and managers of corporations with multiple subsidiaries. For these users, and many others, the company hub serves as a landing page that gives a financial overview across companies and environments. It provides users with a tool for managing work across the various environments that they work in, across companies, environments, and regions.  

You can access the company hub by switching to the **Company Hub** role in My Settings, or by opening the **Company Hub** page directly. You can do the same work in both places, but actions are placed slightly different in menus.  

[![Shows the company hub page that lists all companies.](media/company-hub.png)](media/company-hub.png#lightbox)  

> [!NOTE]
> You can connect the company hub to as many companies as you need. However, you can only connect the company hub to companies that are hosted in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online.

## Company hub home page

If you use the **Company Hub** role, your home page shows a list of companies that you have access to, including information about key point of interest (KPI) data, and links to open each company. <!--You can customize the dashboard to show the data points that you want to see by adding or removing columns. For example, you might want to see taxes that are due, how many open sales documents each company has, or the number of purchase invoices that are due next week. You can configure the view to suit your needs. If you have added many companies, you can use filters to sort your view.--> Choose the **Company Hub** action to open the company hub, where you can work more closely with each company.  

> [!TIP]
> To access a specific company in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], choose the name of the company, or choose the **Go To Company** menu item - you are logged in automatically in a new browser tab.

:::image type="content" source="media/company-hub-company-list-actions.png" alt-text="Actions for a company that is listed in the company hub.":::

You can add new companies, such as when you get a new client, or when your corporation adds a new subsidiary. For more information, see [Add Companies to Your Company Hub](company-hub-add-company.md).  

> [!TIP]
> In order to refresh the data in the company hub, you must have access to the data in the companies that the data comes from.

<!--## Company details

In the **Company Hub** page, you can see more information about each company by choosing the name of the company that you want to learn more about. This opens the **Company Details** pane, where you can see additional information, such as the following:  

* Cash account balances  
* Cash flow forecast  
* Overdue purchase invoices  
* Overdue sales invoices  

> [!TIP]
> You can launch predefined Excel workbooks from the **Reports** tab in the ribbon. These Excel workbooks are designed as ready-to-print key financial statements and reports, but you can also modify them to fit your needs. For more information, see [Analyzing Financial Statements in Microsoft Excel](finance-analyze-excel.md).  

Otherwise, close the details pane and continue to the next company.  -->

## Assigned tasks

In [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can assign tasks to yourself and others, and others can assign tasks to you. The company hub gives you an overview of assigned tasks for each company, and you can also access a list of all assigned tasks by choosing **My User Tasks** on the **Home** page.  

<!--In the client company, you also have cues that call out tasks assigned to you in this particular client.  -->

### My user tasks

The **My User Tasks** list helps you prioritize your day by showing more information about tasks assigned to you across all your companies.  

You can sort by due date, for example, or any other type of data that helps you prioritize your day. By default, the list shows all tasks that are assigned to you, but you can set up filters to only show tasks that are marked as high priority, for example.  

To pick up a task, choose it from the list of pending user tasks. In the ribbon, the link **Go to Task Item** opens the page where you can do the work.  

When you have completed a task, mark it as completed.  

For more information about companies and environments, see [Environment links](company-hub-add-company.md#environment-links).  

## Access the company hub

[!INCLUDE [2023rw1-sec-group-short](includes/2023rw1-sec-group-short.md)]

In order to access the company hub, you must have access through either the *D365 COMPANY HUB* user group or through the *D365 COMPANY HUB*  permission set. You must also have access to the companies that are listed in your company hub, which means that you must be a user in those companies. For more information, see [Create Users According to Licenses](ui-how-users-permissions.md).  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The company hub is a company-wide list, so any user who is granted access to the company hub will be able to see all companies in their own [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] tenant, and all KPIs for the companies that they have access to.

If you cannot find the company hub, and you know that you have been granted access to it, then check with your administrator if the company hub is listed in the **Extension Management** page. For more information, see [Customizing Business Central Using Extensions](ui-extensions.md).  

## Set up the company hub

To start using the company hub, you must add one or more companies to your dashboard. For more information, see [Add Companies to Your Company Hub](company-hub-add-company.md).  

But to add a company, you must have been given access to one or more instances of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in addition to the company that you use the company hub in.  

For example, if you are an accountant, your clients can invite you to their [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For more information, see [Inviting Your External Accountant to Your Business Central](finance-accounting.md#inviteaccountant).  

Administrators can use the same assisted setup guide to add you to their [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], or they can add you to the relevant Microsoft Entra account in the Microsoft 365 admin center. For more information, see [Manage users and groups](/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/?view=o365-worldwide&preserve-view=true).

# Use the AMC banking 365 fundamentals extension

The AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals extension makes it easier, and more accurate, to send data to your banks. The extension connects [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with the AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central service, which can convert bank data from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] into formats that are required by over 600 banks around the world. For example, this makes it easier to transfer payments and credits to vendors by entering the payments in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], and then uploading them to your bank. The formats can also smooth out bank reconciliation processes. For more information, see [AMC Banking for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central](https://www.amcbanking.com/bc-fundamentals/).

> [!NOTE]
> AMC Banking has built additional extensions that work with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. This topic describes only the Fundamental extension.

> [!NOTE]
> In the generic version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], a global provider of services to convert bank data to any file format that your bank requires is set up and connected. In North American versions, the same service can be used to send payment files as electronic funds transfer (EFT), for example the commonly used Automated Clearing House (ACH) network, however with a slightly different process.

## Use our demonstration account

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] comes with a demonstration account that lets you try out the AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals extension. We provide default settings for connecting to AMC Banking, specifying the bank accounts to get data from in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], plus a few data exchange definitions. You can view the connection settings on the **AMC Banking Setup** page. For bank accounts, the extension applies values in the **Bank Name**, **Credit Transfer Msg. Nos.**, **Bank Statement Import Format**, and **Payment Export Format** fields on bank account cards.

We provide the settings, but to try out the extension you must run the assisted setup guide to apply them. To run the guide, on the **AMC Banking Setup** page, choose the **Assisted Setup** action.

> [!NOTE]
> There are some limitations on the demo account. For example, when you convert payments, the amount in the converted file will not match the actual amount. Instead, the amount will always be five units of the currency that you use for payments.  

## Setting up the extension

Getting started with the extension involves just a few easy steps, and an assisted setup guide will make the connection and turn on the extension. The guide helps you things like install the data exchange definitions for bank statement export/import setups and initiate the number series used for credit transfer messages.  

### To set up the required permission sets

Before people can use this extension, your administrator must copy the following permission sets, edit them, and then assign the new permission sets to users instead of original:

* **D365 Basic**
* **D365 Team Member**
* **D365 Read**
* **IntelligentCloudBC**

For more information, see [To copy a permission set](ui-define-granular-permissions.md#copy-a-permission-set).

For each new permission set, grant only the **Read** permission for the **AMC Banking Setup table (20101)**. For more information, see [To create or modify permissions manually](ui-define-granular-permissions.md#create-a-permission-set).

### To connect the extension to AMC Banking

2. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **AMC Banking Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
3. On the **AMC Banking Setup** page, choose the **Assisted Setup** action.
4. Complete the steps in the assisted setup guide.

### To connect bank accounts to the extension

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Bank Accounts**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the card for the bank account that you want to connect to the service.
3. In the **Name** field, choose the format that your bank requires.

# Set the layout used by a report

> **APPLIES TO:** Business Central online, Business Central on-premises 2022 release wave 1 and later. For earlier versions, go [here](ui-how-change-layout-currently-used-report.md).

A report layout determines the look of a report. It controls which data fields of a report dataset appear, how they're arranged, styled, and more. A report may have more than one layout, which you can then switch among as needed.

When there are multiple companies in the application, the layouts are set on a per-company basis. So the same report in one company can have a different layout in another company.

## Get started

There are a few ways to set which layout a report uses. Each way has advantages, depending on what you're looking to do: 

- From the report request page

  When setting up a report to run, the report request page includes the **Reports Layout** field that shows the current default layout used by the report. You can use this field to temporarily switch to another available layout the report you're running. After you run the report, the layout will revert to the default layout again. For more information, see [Run and Print Reports](ui-work-report.md#switch-the-report-layout).

- From the **Report Layout Selection** page

  The **Report Layout Selection** page displays a list of all reports. This page indicates what the current default layout for a report is. It lets you set layouts in different companies, without having to switch the company you're working with.

- From the **Report Layouts** page
  The **Report Layouts** page displays all available layouts for each report in the current company. It's also used to specify the default layout for reports. It's easy to find a specific layout by sorting or filtering the list. Once you find the layout, you can set it for a report with a single selection.

  > [!NOTE]
  > You can't use the **Report Layouts** page for Word and RDLC layouts that were created by using the legacy **Custom Layouts** feature. In fact, you won't even see these custom layouts listed on the **Report Layouts** page. For these layouts, you can only set them by using **Report Layout Selection** page.

## Set the layout from the Report Layouts page

1. [!INCLUDE[open-report-layouts-page](includes/open-report-layouts-page.md)]
2. Find the layout in the list, select it, then select the **Set Default** action at the top of the page.

## Set the layout from Report Layout Selection page

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Report Layout Selection**, and then choose the related link.
  
   The page lists all the reports that are available for the company that's specified in the **Company** field at the top of the page. The **Layout Description** field specifies the layout that the report currently uses.
2. Set the **Company** field at the top to the company that includes the report.
3. Find and select the report in the list, then do one of the following steps:

   - If the layout that you want to switch to is a different type than the current layout, select the **Layout Type** field, then choose the type of the layout you want to set on the report. 
   - If the layout that you want to switch to the same type as the current layout, select the **Select Layout** action at the top.

4. In the **Report Layouts** page, select the layout, then select **OK**.

## Revert to the original default layout

Reports are designed to use a layout by default. You can switch back to the original default layout from **Report Layout Selection** page. Just select the report, then select the **Restore Default Selection** action at the top of the page.

# Define document layouts for customers and vendors

Document layouts use report layouts to define the look and feel of documents that you send to customers and vendors. Business Central provides standard layouts, but you can also tailor custom layouts for each of your business partners. Learn more in [Get started creating report layouts](ui-get-started-layouts.md). You select standard and custom document layouts from customer and vendor cards by choosing the **Document Layouts** action. The value in the **Usage** field defines the process for which the document layout is used. For example, for customers, you might use **Reminder**, **Shipment**, and **Confirmation** types of document layouts.

Document layouts can also save you time when you send documents to customer or vendor contacts by email. For each layout that you assign to the customer or contact, you can by specify one or more contact email addresses. For example, you can send an invoice to the customer's purchasing and warehouse contacts. Adding contact email addresses is easy. On the **Document Layouts** page, the **Select Email from Contacts** action let's you choose from a list of the contact email addresses that you registered for the customer or vendor. You can also add email addresses manually. If you enter multiple addresses, separate them with a semi-colon, and don't add spaces between the addresses.

Before you define which document layout to use for which processes, and which contact to send the document to, load all the available reports (documents) from the **Report Selections** page. You can quickly load the documents by using the **Copy from Report Selection** action on the **Document Layouts** page.

The steps in the following sections describe how to define sales document layouts from the **Customer Card** page. For vendors, the steps are the same from the **Vendor Card** page.

## Load the standard document layouts for sales documents for a customer

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customers**, and then choose the related link.
1. Open the **Customer Card** page for the customer, and then choose the **Document Layouts** action.
1. On the **Document Layouts** page, choose the **Copy from Report Selection** action.

The **Document Layouts** page displays all layouts that are available for sales documents.

## Select a report layout to use for the sales document layout

The following steps assume that layout you want for the type of document is already created. Learn more about creating layouts in [Get started creating report layouts](ui-get-started-layouts.md).

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customers**, and then select the related link.
1. Open the **Customer Card** page for the customer, and then select the **Document Layouts** action.
1. On the **Document Layouts** page, on the line for document layout that you want to use a report layout for, set the **Email Body Layout** and **Email Attachment Layout** fields. You can choose different layouts for each.

   >![!NOTE]
   > If you want to use a legacy custom report layout, set the layout in the **Custom Layout Description** field. By default, the **Custom Layout Description** field is hidden. If the field isn't available, you can personalize the page to add it. To personalize the page, select the :::image type="content" source="media/ui-experience/settings_icon_small.png" alt-text="The Settings icon."::: icon, and then select **Personalize**. Learn more about legacy custom report layouts in [(Legacy) Create and modify custom report layouts](ui-how-create-custom-report-layout.md)

## Specify which contact receives which document layout for a customer

To save time when you send documents to customer and vendor contacts by email, specify their email addresses on document layouts. For example, you can always send customer statements to their accountant contacts and sales orders to their purchasers, or purchase orders to vendor salespeople.

1. On the **Document Layouts** page, on the line for a report layout that you want to send to a specific contact for the customer, select the **Select Email from Contacts** action.
1. On the **Contacts** page, select one or more contacts, and then select **OK**.

# Set up payment methods

Payment methods define the way you prefer for customers to pay you, and how you like to pay your vendors. The method can vary for each customer or vendor. Examples of typical payment methods are **bank**, **cash**, **check**, or **account**.

You can assign a payment method to customers and vendors so that the same method is always used on the sales and purchase documents you create for them. If needed, you can change the method on the sales or purchase document. For example, if you want to pay a particular purchase invoice in cash rather than by check. The default payment method assigned to the vendor doesn't change.

The same payment methods are used for sales and purchase documents. For example, a _cash_ payment method is used to make payments and to receive them. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] knows that when you're creating a sales invoice you expect to receive payment, and the opposite for purchase invoices.

Credit memos for returns, however, are exceptions because money is flowing in the opposite directions, from you to your customer and from your vendor to you. Therefore, a default payment method isn't assigned to credit memos. There is, however, a workaround. You can specify terms of payment for the customer or vendor. Though the **Calc. Pmt. Disc. on Cr. Memos** field isn't intended for this workaround, if you choose the checkbox on the **Payment Terms** page a default payment method is added when you create a credit memo. <br><br>

## To set up a payment method

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides a few payment methods that businesses often use. You can, however, add as many as you need.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Payment Methods**, and then choose the related link.
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

Optionally, add payment terms to your payment method. For more information, see [Set Up Payment Terms](finance-payment-terms.md).  

## To assign a payment method to a customer or vendor

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customer** or **Vendor**, and then choose the related link.
2. In the **Payment Method Code** field, choose the method to use by default for the customer or vendor.

## Audit changes to payment methods

You can use the Change Log feature to capture changes users make to your payment method setup. [!INCLUDE [include-audit-what-who-when](includes/include-audit-what-who-when.md)] 

The following table lists the table for payment methods and its ID.

# Sign up for a free Dynamics 365 Business Central trial

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers a free trial. There are two ways to access the trial version, depending on your location. If you are in a country where Microsoft offers official localization, you can follow one path. If you are in a country where localization is handled by partners, you'll need to follow a different path. Explore the different types of localization [here](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/compliance/apptest-countries-and-translations). After a quick sign-up, you'll have access to many of the app's key features. The trial allows you to test the app with sample data. If you want to try out things with your own data, you'll switch to a free 30-day trial. [Learn more about Business Central features](across-business-functionality.md).  

## Start the trial in Microsoft-based localizations 

You can find your free [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] trial on the **[Dynamics 365 Business Central product](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics-365/products/business-central)** page. You just need to follow the steps and you'll get trial localized version tailored for your location. If you want eventually to try different localization, you can do it in the sandbox. 

<!--## To sign up for the trial-->

[!INCLUDE [trial-get](includes/trial-get.md)]

## Start with the trial in location with partner-based localizations  

In countries where Microsoft doesn't offer built-in localization, obtaining a localized version by default isn't possible due to localization being managed by partners. Consequently, Microsoft can only provide the standard base app, typically without localization or translation. To avoid confusion not offering all local requirements and the language, we have different path of getting trial version, so you can have full local experience.  

You can get your trial version following these steps:

1. You must run "Find your partner" on [Microsoft web site](https://partner.microsoft.com/partnership/find-a-partner) or ask local Microsoft office for advice. 
2. Microsoft can help you find a partner for you or you might have already found a partner based on your experience. 
3. You might offer your partner for the trial version and then partner goes to CSP.  
   1. Finds or adds customer tenant.   
   2. Assigns the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Trial SKU in CSP. 
   3. Assigns the localization and translation, and eventually assigns translated demo data to the created tenant. 
   4. Sends customer link to the environment.   
   5. The test trial environment will be accessible. 

> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft doesn't oversee how partners set up the trial environment or what specific elements are included. While Microsoft offers recommendations, partners have the flexibility to implement them in their own way. Using a trial version from one partner doesn't obligate you to purchase a license from them, and you can always choose to switch partners at any time.  

## What to try

Your trial environment includes the same features as the paid version. The links below guide you through some of the key features.

- [Overview of business functionality](across-business-functionality.md)  
- [Get started](ui-get-ready-business.md#get-started)  
- [Get productive](ui-work-product.md)  
- [Quick starts](quick-start-business-central.md)  

## Get started with a subscription

Each time you sign in during the trial period, a notification in a blue bar at the top displays the time remaining. If you decide to subscribe, find a [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] partner. For more information, see [How do I find a reselling partner?](/dynamics365/business-central/across-faq#how-do-i-find-a-reselling-partner). The reselling partner can help you set up [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to fit your business, including importing your data from your previous system. You can also customize [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] by adding apps from [the Microsoft commercial marketplace](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2081646).  

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online uses Microsoft 365. If your company uses a different type of email setup, the reselling partner can help you decided how to migrate, or if you should use [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises.  

You can also contact the [[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Sales team](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=828707).

# Run and print reports in Business Central

Reports help you collect and display data based on specific criteria. It organizes and presents the information in an easy-to-read format you can print or save as a file. There are many reports you can access throughout the application. The reports typically provide information related to the context of the page you're on. For example, the **Customer** page includes reports for the top 10 customers, sales statistics, and more.

> [!NOTE]
> Batch jobs and XMLports do more or less the same as reports, but are used more to process or export data. For example, the **Create Reminders** batch job creates reminder documents to send to customers with overdue payments. This article refers mainly to "reports", but similar information applies to batch jobs and XMLports.

## Get started

You can find reports in the **Reports** menu on selected pages, lists, and cards. You can also use the search ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") to find reports by name. For an overview of built-in reports, you can use in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], sorted by categories, see [Available Reports in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]](reports-available-reports.md).

When you choose a report, you see a request page titled after the report's name where you set various options and filters that determine what data is included. The following sections explain how to use the request page to build, preview, and print a report.

## <a name="SavedSettings"></a>Use default values&mdash;predefined settings

Most report request pages include the **Use default values from** field. With this field, you can select predefined settings for the report, which automatically set options and filters. Select an entry from the dropdown list to see the options and filters on the report request page change accordingly.

The entry called **Last used options and filters** is always available. This entry sets the report to use the options and filters you used the last time you ran the report.

The **Use default values from** field provides a fast and reliable way to consistently generate reports that contain the correct data. After you select an entry, you can change any of the options and filters before you preview or print the report. The changes you make won't be saved to the predefined settings entry you selected, but they'll be saved to the **Last used options and filters** entry.

> [!NOTE]
> The predefined settings are typically set up and managed by an administrator. Learn more in [Manage Saved Settings for Reports and Batch Jobs](reports-saving-reusing-settings.md).

## Specify the data to include in a report

Use the fields under **Options** and **Filters** to change or limit the information you want in the report. You can set filters in a report in more or less the same way as you set filters on lists. Learn more in the [Filtering](ui-enter-criteria-filters.md#filtering) section.

> [!CAUTION]
> The **Filter** FastTab on a report request page provides a generic filtering capability for reports. These filters are optional.
>
> Some reports ignore any such filters, which means no matter what filter is set in the **Filter** FastTab, the output of the report is the same. It's not possible to provide a list of which fields are ignored in which reports, so you'll have to experiment with the filters when using them.
>
> **Example**: When you use the **Create Reminders** batch job, a filter for the **Customer Ledger Entries** field of **Last Issued Reminder Level** is ignored because filters are fixed for that batch job.

## Preview a report

By previewing a report, you can see what the report looks like before you print it. The preview isn't based on the printer selected in the **Printer** field on the request page. It's controlled by the browser. After previewing, you can then go back to the request page and make changes to options and filters as you need.

The preview choices on the **Report Request** page depend on the report. So, for some reports, you can select **Preview**, while for others, the choice is **Preview & Close**. Both choices open a preview of the report. The difference is that **Preview** keeps the request page open, so you can go back to it, make changes, preview again, or print. In contrast, with **Preview & Close** the request page closes, and you have to open the report again to make changes or print.

> [!NOTE]
> If you're using Business Central 2020 release wave 1 or earlier, the only choice is **Preview**, which closes the request page on preview, as described for **Preview & Close**.

### Work with the preview

In the preview, use the menu bar on the report preview to:

- Move through pages
- Zoom in and out
- Resize to fit the page
- Select text
  
  You can copy text from a report, then paste it somewhere else, such as a page in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] or Microsoft Word. Using a mouse, for example, select the left mouse button and hold where you want to start. Slide the mouse to select one or more words, sentences, or paragraphs. Then select the right mouse button and select **Copy**. You can now paste the selected text where you want it.

- Pan the document
  
  You can move the visible area of the report in any direction to view other areas of the report. Panning is helpful when you zoom in to see details. Using your mouse, for example, select and hold the left mouse button anywhere in the report preview, and then move your mouse to select a section of the report.

- Download to a PDF file on your computer or network.
- Print

## Save a report to a file

You can save a report to a PDF document, Microsoft Word document, Microsoft Excel workbook, or XML document by choosing **Send to**, then making your selection. A file is downloaded to your computer.

If your organization configured OneDrive for system features, instead of being downloaded, Excel workbooks and Word documents are opened in your browser using either Excel or Word for the web.

> [!TIP]
> The **Microsoft Excel Document (data only)** and **XML Document** options are mostly for advanced purposes. You'd typically use these options to do detailed data analysis. Learn more at [Analyzing Report Data with Excel and XML](report-analyze-excel.md).
>
> You can also use **Microsoft Excel Document (data only)** to create new Excel layouts for a given report. Learn more at [Work with Excel Layouts](ui-excel-report-layouts.md).  

## <a name="ScheduleReport"></a> Schedule a report to run later or periodically

You can schedule a single or recurring report to run at a specific date and time. Scheduled reports are entered in the job queue and processed at the scheduled time, similar to other jobs. Select the **Schedule** option after selecting **Send to**, then enter information, such as the printer, and time and date. The report is added to the job queue and runs at the specified time. When the report is processed, the item is removed from the job queue. Learn more at [Use Job Queues to Schedule Tasks](admin-job-queues-schedule-tasks.md).  

When you schedule a report to run, you can specify, for example, that it must run every Thursday by setting the **Next Run Date Formula** field to *D4*. Learn more in the [Use Date Formulas](ui-enter-date-ranges.md#use-date-formulas) section.  

You can save the report to a file (such as Excel, Word, or PDF), print it, or only generate the report. If you save the report to a file, then the processed report is sent to the **Report Inbox** page on your Role Center for you to view it. Learn more at [Share and Export Reports with the Report Inbox](ui-work-report-inbox.md)

### Manage scheduled recurring reports

Batch jobs generate scheduled reports managed on the **Job Queue Entries** page. You can see each report's status and other information on the page, pause/resume the report batch job, and generate the report on demand.

From the **Job Queue Entries** page, you can also change some report parameters, such as the output file type, recurrence, run date, and starting and ending times. Before you edit an existing scheduled report, however, it's necessary to put the report job queue on hold:

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Job Queue Entries**, then select the related link.  
2. On the **Job Queue Entries** page, select the desired report.
3. Select the **Set On Hold** action.
4. Open and edit the scheduled report by selecting its status (*On Hold*).

After you edit the report options, repeat the first two steps and then select the **Set Status to Ready** action to resume generating the report.

Learn more about job queue management at [Use Job Queues to Schedule Tasks](admin-job-queues-schedule-tasks.md).  

## <a name="PrintReport"></a>Print a report

To print a report, select **Print** on the report request page or on the menu bar of the **Preview** page.

When a report uses an Excel layout, you don't have the **Printer** field or **Print** or **Preview** buttons. Instead, there's a **Download** option. To print, select **Download**, then open the downloaded file in Excel and print from there.

### <a name="Printer"></a>Printer

The **Printer** field on the request page shows the name of printer the report is sent to. To change a printer, just select the printer from the list.

> [!NOTE]
> The **(Handled by the browser)** option indicates there's no designated printer for the report. In this case, the browser handles the printout and displays the standard printing steps, where you can choose a local printer connected to your computer. The **(Handled by the browser)** option isn't available in the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] mobile app or app for Microsoft Teams.

> [!TIP]
> The printer selected for you by default is set up on the **Printer Selections** page. Learn more about how you can change the default printer in the [Set up default printers](ui-specify-printer-selection-reports.md#default) section.

### Print reports in Thai

Specifically for the Thai version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the **Print** button can't print reports correctly because of limitations in the service that generates the printable PDF file. Instead, you can open the report in Word and then save the report as a printable PDF.  

Or, you can ask your administrator to create a Word report layout for your most used reports. Learn more at [Managing Report and Document Layouts](ui-manage-report-layouts.md).  

## Switch the report layout

A report layout controls what is shown on a report, how it's arranged, and how it's styled. There are a few ways to change the layout:

- When you're setting up to run a report, you'll see the current layout in the **Report Layout** field on the request page. To temporarily switch to a different layout, select the **Report Layout** field, then select from a list of available layouts for the report.
- To change the default layout used by a report, go to either the **Report Layouts** or **Report Layout Selection** pages.

Learn more at [Set the Layout Used by a Report](ui-set-report-layout.md). Or, if you want to customize your own report layout, see [Get Started Creating Layouts](ui-get-started-layouts.md).

## Change language and format of numbers, dates, and times

By default, the language of text and format of numbers, dates, and times in a report are based on your working language and region settings, which are defined on the **My Settings** page. You can, however, change the language and format region on a case-by-case basis when you preview, print, or send a report. On the request page, set the **Language** and **Format Region** options to your preference. You can also specify the language and region format to use by default for customers and vendors on their card pages.

Depending on where you've specified the language and format settings, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] determines the settings to use in the following order:

1. The settings you specify when you generate a report.
2. The settings specified on the document, which come from the customer or vendor's settings.
3. The settings specified on the Report AL object.
4. The settings defined in My Settings.

For more information about the **My Settings** page, see [Change basic settings](ui-change-basic-settings.md#region).

## Advanced options

The fields under the **Advanced** FastTab set limitations on the generated report to control printer resources. You typically won't have to change these settings, unless you have a large report. If a report exceeds these limitations when you try to preview or print, a message indicates which limitation you've exceeded. You can then change the settings to suit your report. Each field, however, has a maximum value you should be aware of:

|Field|Maximum value|
|-----|-------------|
|Maximum rendering time|12:00:00|
|Maximum rows|1000000|
|Maximum documents|500|

> [!NOTE]
> The maximum values might be different for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, and an administrator can change them. Learn more in the [Configuring Business Central Server - Reports](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/configure-server-instance#Reports) section. For an overview of report limitations in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, see [Operational Limits](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/operational-limits-online).

## Get help for a report

You can get help using a report in two ways: teaching tips and help pane.

### Teaching tip for a report

Many reports in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] have a teaching tip to increase your chance of success with the report. The title and description of these teaching tips try to answer the following hypothetical questions:

- What is this report about?
- What can I do with this report?

With teaching tips, the report creator helps you understand the logic relevant to the report, allowing you to start your reporting task immediately without being blocked. After you dismiss a teaching tip, you can select or hover over the report title on the request page to reopen the teaching tip.

Learn more in [In-product tips](product-help-and-support.md#in-product-tips)

### Help pane for a report

When the report request page is open, select the **Help** question mark in the top-right corner of the role center to open the help pane. Here, you find the teaching tip text (if defined on the report). You also find relevant links to documentation articles that explain related topics in more depth.

Learn more in [Help pane](product-help-and-support.md#help-pane)

# Use XML Schemas to Prepare Data Exchange Definitions

To enable import/export of data in XML files through the data exchange framework in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can use XML schemas to define which data elements you want to exchange with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. You perform this work on the **XML Schema Viewer** page by loading the XML schema file, selecting the relevant data elements, and then initializing a data exchange definition.  

 When you have defined which data elements to include based on the XML schema, you can use the **Generate Data Exchange Definition** action to initialize a data exchange definition based on the selected data elements, which you then complete in the Data Exchange Framework. This creates a record on the **Posting Exchange Definition** page where you continue by defining which elements in the file map to which fields in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For more information, see [Set Up Data Exchange Definitions](across-how-to-set-up-data-exchange-definitions.md).  

 This topic contains the following procedures:  

- To load an XML schema file  

- To select or clear nodes in an XML schema  

- To generate a data exchange definition that is based on an XML schema  

## To load an XML schema file

1. Make sure that the relevant XML schema file is available. The file extension is .xsd.  

2. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **XML Schemas**, and then choose the related link.  

3. Choose the **New** action.  

4. Fill the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Code**|Specify a code to identify the XML schema.|  
    |**Description**|Specify a description of the XML schema.|  

     The **Target Namespace** field specifies any namespace in the XML schema file that has been loaded for the line.  

5. Choose the **Load Schema** action, and then select the XML schema file.  

     When the file is loaded, the rest of the fields on the line are filled with information from the file, and the **Schema is Loaded** check box is selected.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  The tree of the loaded XML schema is collapsed by default. You expand each node by choosing the **+** button on the node. To expand all nodes, choose **Expand All** on the ribbon.  

### To select or clear nodes in an XML schema  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **XML Schema Viewer**, and then choose the related link.  

2. Fill the fields on the header as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**XML Schema Code**|Specify the XML schema file that you loaded in step 5 in the "To load an XML schema file" section.|  
    |**New XMLport No.**|Specify the number of the XMLport that is created from this XML schema when you choose the **Generate XMLport** action.|  

     The lines are now filled with nodes representing all elements in the XML schema. Nodes for elements that are mandatory according to the XML schema are selected by default.  

3. On the first line, in the **Node Name** column, expand the **Document** node, and then gradually expand underlying nodes that you want to review.  

     Alternatively, right-click on a node and then choose **Expand All**.  

4. Choose either of the following actions to change which nodes are displayed.  

    |**Action**|Description|  
    |----------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Show All**|All nodes are shown.|  
    |**Hide Non-Mandatory**|Only nodes representing elements that are required according to the XML schema are shown. These nodes are typically indicated by a **1** in the **MinOccurs** field.<br /><br /> Choose **Show All** to reverse the view.|  
    |**Hide Non-Selected**|Only nodes where the **Selected** check box is selected are shown.<br /><br /> Choose **Show All** to reverse the view.|  

5. Choose the **Edit** action.  

6. In the **Selected** check box, specify for each node if you want the element to be supported in the data exchange definition for the related SEPA bank file.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  When you select a mandatory child node, all parent nodes above it are also selected.  

7. Choose the **Select All Mandatory Elements** action to reselect all nodes that represent elements that are mandatory according to the XML schema.  

8. Choose the **Deselect All** action to clear all selections.  

     The **Choice** field specifies that the node has two or more sibling nodes that function as options.  

### To generate a data exchange definition that is based on an XML schema  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter  **XML Schemas**, and then choose the related link.  

2. Select the relevant XML schema, and then choose the **Open XML Schema Viewer** action.  

3. Make sure the relevant nodes are selected. For more information, see the "To select or clear nodes in an XML schema" section.  

4. On the **XML Schema Viewer** page, choose the **Generate Data Exchange Definition** action.  

 A data exchange definition is created on the **Posting Exchange Definition** page, which you can complete by specifying which elements in the file map to which fields in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For more information, see [Set Up Data Exchange Definitions](across-how-to-set-up-data-exchange-definitions.md).  

> [!NOTE]  
> You can also use the **Get File Structure** function from the **Posting Exchange Definition** page, which uses the functionality of the **XML Schema Viewer** page to prefill the **Column Definitions** TastTab.  

> [!NOTE]
> In 2019 release wave 1 and earlier versions, you could generate an XMLport that was based on the schema and then import that into your solution. This is no longer supported.

# Setting up purchasing

Before you can manage purchase processes, you must configure the rules and values that define the company's purchase policies.

You must define the general setup on the **Purchases & Payables Setup** page, which is typically done once during the initial implementation. Learn more in the following section, [Purchases, and payables setup](#purchases-and-payables-setup).

A separate series of tasks related to registering new vendors is to record any special price or discount agreements you have with each vendor.

Finance-related purchase setup, such as payment methods and currencies, are covered in the finance setup section. Learn more at [Setting Up Finance](finance-setup-finance.md). Similarly, inventory-related purchase setup, such as units of measure and item tracking codes, can be found in the [Inventory Setup section](inventory-setup-inventory.md).

## Purchases and payables setup

Before working with purchases and payables, specify on the **Purchases & Payables Setup** page how purchase values are posted and the number series used for vendors and purchase documents.

### General settings

On the **General** FastTab, you specify options such as how you want to calculate and post discounts and whether you want to round invoices. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)].

Some fields require special attention, such as the **Calc. Inv. Disc. per VAT/Tax ID** field, which specifies whether the invoice discount is calculated according to the tax identifier or the invoice total. Learn more at [Combine VAT posting groups in VAT posting setups](finance-setup-vat.md#combine-vat-posting-groups-in-vat-posting-setups).

Similarly, the **Appln. between Currencies** field can result in small rounding differences when applying entries in different currencies to one another. Learn more at [Enable Application of Ledger Entries in Different Currencies](finance-how-enable-application-ledger-entries-different-currencies.md).

Also, some fields change their behavior or depend on how other fields are set. For example, the **Check Prepmt. when Posting** feature is influenced by how the **Prepmt. Auto Update** field is set to check for pending prepayments.

Read details about the [**Ext. Doc. No. Mandatory**](#external-document-number) and [**Exact Cost Reversing Mandatory**](#exact-cost-reversing) fields in sections later in this article.

### Number series settings

On the **Number Series** FastTab, you must specify unique identification codes to use for vendors, invoices, and other purchase documents. Numbering is important not only for internal processes, but might also need to follow local regulations. So it might be worth considering setting up all series in the **No. Series** page beforehand instead of creating new ones from the **Purchases & Payables Setup**. Learn more at [Create Number Series](ui-create-number-series.md).

## External document number

[!INCLUDE [ext-doc-no-purch](includes/ext-doc-no-purch.md)]

## Exact cost reversing

The **Exact Cost Reversing Mandatory** function helps ensure returned goods are valued at the same cost as when they were originally drawn from inventory, using a fixed application instead of following an average or first-in, first-out (FIFO) costing method. Learn more in the [Design Details: Fixed Application](design-details-item-application.md#fixed-application) section. If an extra cost is later added to the original purchase, the program updates the value of the respective purchase return.

With the feature enabled, a return transaction can only be posted by specifying the item ledger entry number in the **Appl.-to Item Entry** field on the purchase return order line. By default, the field isn't displayed on the **Lines** FastTab. To learn how to add fields to pages, go to [Personalize Your Workspace](ui-personalization-user.md#start-personalizing-by-using-the-personalization-mode) section.

# Synchronize Contacts in Business Central with Contacts in Microsoft Outlook

You can set up contact synchronization so that your contacts in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] have the same information as your contacts in Microsoft Outlook. For example, if you're a sales person, you might work in Outlook and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] at the same time. If the contacts are the same in both places, your work is more straightforward.  

By default, the contacts you're syncing are kept in a **Business Central** folder in your Favorites on the Folder Pane in Outlook. The Business Central folder can make it easier to identify which contacts you're syncing. You can set filters to sync only specific contacts from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to Outlook. After you've set up synchronization, you can synchronize manually or automate the process to synchronize on a scheduled basis.  

## Prerequisites

- You user profile in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] must specify your Microsoft 365 email account.

  You can check this setting in the **Microsoft 365 Authentication** section of your user profile in the **Users** list.
- With [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you've set up contact synchronization as described in [Set Up Contact Synchronization with Outlook for Business Central On-premises](admin-contact-sync-setup-onprem.md)

## Set Up Synchronization

You set up how you want to synchronize contacts with Outlook on the **Exchange Sync. Setup** page in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. 

On the **Exchange Sync. Setup** page, you can validate that the connection to Exchange is working and then set up contact synchronization. From the **Exchange Sync. Setup** page, you can open the **Contact Sync. Setup** page and start the synchronization. Optionally, set a filter to specify which contacts to synchronize. For example, you can filter on name, type, company, and so on. You can also change the default name of the folder in Outlook that the contacts will synchronize to.  

Each of your coworkers can also set up their own Exchange synchronization and set their own filters on which contacts to synchronize.  

After you set up synchronization, you can sync changes to the contact manually, or you can automate the process by setting up a job queue entry. For more information about automation, see the next section in this article.

### Automate synchronization

You can create a job queue entry that will synchronize contacts according to a schedule that you define. For more information, see [Use Job Queues to Schedule Tasks](admin-job-queues-schedule-tasks.md). 

The following table lists the settings on the **Job Queue Entry Card** page that are for synchronizing contacts:

|Field|Setting for Contact Sync|
|-----|-----|
|Object Type to Run|Codeunit|
|Object ID to Run|6700|

## Synchronize Contacts

If you're used to working with contacts in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you'll find it easy to sync manually from the **Contacts** list whenever it suits you. You can synchronize contacts in two ways:

* **Sync with Microsoft 365**

  Synchronize all changes from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to Microsoft 365 that were made after the last synchronization, based on the last modified date. Also, new contacts from Microsoft 365 will be synchronized to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Typically, this action is faster than a full sync. 

* **Full Sync with Microsoft 365**

  Synchronize all contacts in both directions, regardless of the last sync date and last modified date.  

In both cases, contacts are only synchronized from Outlook if they have the required fields filled in. The required fields to synchronize to Microsoft 365 are **Name**, **Email address** and the contact must be of the type **Person**. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is the source of the contact information, so the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] contact information will be saved if there are duplicates.  

> [!NOTE]
> If you delete a contact in Outlook, but keep it in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the contact will be recreated in Outlook the next time you sync.

# Block items or item variants from use in sales, purchasing, service, and production

You can block items and item variants from being entered on lines in sales or purchase documents, and service and production orders. You can also block them from being posted in any kind of transaction. For example, blocking for use in all transactions is useful when an item has a known defect. If you choose a blocked item or variant on a sales or purchase document, or a service or production order, a message lets you know that the item is blocked.

The following table describes what happens when items or variants are blocked.  

|Option|Description|  
|--------------------|------------|  
|**Sales Blocked**|You can't choose the item or variant on a sales document or a sales item journal.|  
|**Service Blocked**|You can't choose the item or variant on service management transactions. To learn more about blocking service items, go to [Block items, item variants, or specific service items](service-how-to-create-service-items.md#block-items-item-variants-or-specific-service-items).|
|**Purchasing Blocked**|You can't choose the item or variant on a purchase document, a purchase item journal, or in purchase planning processes.|  
|**Production Blocked**|You can't choose the item or variant on production orders. Also, you can't use the following actions:</br></br>* Post output in output journals or production journals.</br>* Refresh the production order.</br>* Replan the production order.</br>* Calculate subcontracts in the subcontracting worksheet skips the lines with blocked items or variants. |  

> [!NOTE]
> Customers can return blocked items, which means that these settings don't apply to return orders and credit memos.

When you use the **Copy from Document** action to create new documents based on existing documents, you're notified if items or variants on the source document lines are blocked. The blocked document lines are excluded from the new document, and a notification shows an overview of all document lines that are blocked in the source document.

## To block an item

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Depending on what you want to do, select the item, and then turn on one or more of the following toggles:

    * **Sales Blocked**
    * **Service Blocked**
    * **Purchasing Blocked**  
3. To block the item from use in production output, fill in the **Production Blocked** field.

## To block an item variant  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the item that has a variant you want to block, choose **Variants**, and then select one or more of the following checkboxes:  

    * **Blocked**
    * **Sales Blocked**
    * **Service Blocked**
    * **Purchasing Blocked**  

3. To block the variant from use in production output, fill in the **Production Blocked** field.

# Create users according to licenses

[!INCLUDE[azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id](~/../shared-content/shared/azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id.md)]

[!INCLUDE [2023rw1-sec-group-short](includes/2023rw1-sec-group-short.md)]

This article describes how administrators create users and define who can sign in to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. This article also describes how to assign permissions to different users according to your product licenses.

When you create users in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you grant permissions to them through permission sets. You can also organize users in user groups. User groups make it easier to manage permissions and other settings for multiple users at the same time. For more information, see [Assign Permissions to Users and Groups](ui-define-granular-permissions.md).  

For more information about the different types of licenses and how licensing works in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], [download the Dynamics 365 Licensing Guide](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=866544).

> [!NOTE]
> The process of managing users and licenses varies depending on whether [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is deployed online or on-premises. For [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, you must add users from Microsoft 365. In on-premises deployments, you can create, edit, and delete users directly.  

## Manage users and licenses in online tenants

User accounts in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] must be first created in the Microsoft 365 admin center. These user accounts aren't exclusive to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. If you subscribe to other plans, they can be used to sign in to other applications, such as Power BI. For information about creating users in the Microsoft 365 admin center, go to [Add users in Microsoft admin center](/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/add-users).

Your subscription to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online defines how many [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] user licenses you're allowed. Users are added to your tenant in the Microsoft Partner Center, typically by your Microsoft partner. For more information, see [Administration of Business Central Online](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/tenant-administration).

You assign licenses to users according to the work each user does in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. You can assign licenses in several ways:

- Your company's Microsoft 365 administrator can do it in the [Microsoft 365 Admin Center](https://admin.microsoft.com). For more information, see [Add users individually or in bulk to Microsoft 365](/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/add-users).  
- A Microsoft partner can assign licenses in the Microsoft 365 Admin Center or in the Microsoft Partner Center. For more information, see [User management tasks for customer accounts](/partner-center/assign-licenses-to-users) in the Microsoft Partner Center Help.

For more information, see [Administration of Business Central Online](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/tenant-administration) in the administration Help.

After user accounts are created in the Microsoft 365 admin center, there are two ways to import them to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]:

- A user account is imported automatically when the user signs in to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] the first time.

   > [!NOTE]
   > After a user signs in to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, you can't delete the user.

- The administrator can import users by choosing the **Update Users from Microsoft 365** action on the **Users* page.

Both approaches have their own advantages, and you can use them simultaneously. Each approach allows administrators to proactively configure [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to assign the starting permissions, user groups, and user profiles. Using the **Update Users from Microsoft 365** action gives administrators more control to adjust permissions, user groups, and profiles. It's an ideal approach when you're setting up [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] the first time, before any users sign in, or when adding a new team of users.

> [!NOTE]
> After you add users in the Microsoft 365 Admin Center, we recommend that you update the user information in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] as soon as possible. Keeping user information current is easy to do, and helps ensure that people can always sign in. For more information, see [To add users or update user information and license assignments in Business Central](#adduser).<br>
>
> Updating user information is especially important if you've customized permission sets for the license. If a new user tries to sign in to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] before you've added them, they might not be able to. For more information, see [Configure permissions based on licenses](#licensespermissions).
>
> However, users who experience this problem aren't actually blocked. They can either use the **Go back home** action, or simply sign in again to resolve the issue.

[!INCLUDE [admin-gdap-users](includes/admin-gdap-users.md)]

For more information, see [Delegated administrator access to Business Central Online](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/delegated-admin).  

### <a name="licensespermissions"></a>Configure permissions based on licenses

[!INCLUDE [2022_releasewave1](includes/2022_releasewave1.md)]

Admins can configure permissions sets and user groups for each license.<!--Note to translators: The names in *italics* or capitalized in this section must not be translated.-->  

For example, the commonly used license, *Dynamics 365 Business Central Team Member*, has the following permissions sets by default:

- D365 READ
- D365 TEAM MEMBER
- EDIT IN EXCEL - VIEW
- EXPORT REPORT EXCEL
- LOCAL

Other permission sets are added automatically based on the user groups assigned to the license. When you create a new user based on this license, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] assigns the permission sets originating from the user groups and the permission sets from the license. The same starting permissions are assigned to the user if their user account was created automatically in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] or if the administrator used the **Update Users from Microsoft 365** action in the **Users** page.

If this default configuration isn't the right setup for a particular environment, the admin can change that configuration. However, customized permissions affect only new users who are assigned that license. Permissions for existing users who are assigned the license aren't affected.  

1. Sign in to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] using an administrator account.  
2. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **License Configuration**, and then choose the related link.  

    <!--Alternatively, if you're already in the **Users** page, you can run the **Update Users from Microsoft 365** guide, and then, on the first page of the guide, choose the **Configure permissions per license** link.-->  
3. In the **License Configuration** page, choose the license that you want to customize, and then choose the **Configure** action.  
4. Choose the **Customize permissions** field to switch on customization, and then make the changes.  

    In our example, the admin wants to remove the permission to edit in Excel, so they remove the *Excel Export Action* user group from the Team Member license. Afterward, new users who are assigned the Team Member license can't export data to Excel. If the organization changes their minds on the subject, they can just go back to the **License Configuration** page and switch off the customization for that license type.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This customization of permissions only takes effect for new users that you assign the relevant license. Existing users are not updated. We recommend that you customize permissions before you start assigning users licenses in the Microsoft 365 admin center.

### <a name="adduser"></a>To add users or update user information and license assignments in Business Central

After you add users or change user information in the Microsoft 365 Admin Center, you can quickly import the user information to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The import includes license assignments.  

> [!TIP]
> If you need to update user information and you have a lot of users, you can use the filter pane to narrow down the list. You can filter on basic information such as the user name, or set more technical filters, such as the user's security ID.

1. Sign in to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] using an administrator account.
2. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Users**, and then choose the related link.  
3. Choose **Update Users from Microsoft 365**.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Running the synchronization of users from Microsoft 365 using the **Update Users from Microsoft 365** guide, requires the SUPER permission set.

> [!NOTE]
> The **Update Users from Microsoft 365** guide doesn't update users that are not assigned a license, such as someone who is a [Dynamics 365 administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#dynamics-365-administrator). Those users will update the next time they sign in to the environment.

The next step for newly created users is to assign user groups and permissions. Go to [Assign Permissions to Users and Groups](ui-define-granular-permissions.md) for information. If you update a user with a license change, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] assigns users to the appropriate user group and updates their permission sets. For more information, see [To manage permissions through user groups](ui-define-granular-permissions.md).  

> [!NOTE]
> With 2024 release wave 1, a Premium license user can sign in to a company where the **User Experience** field is set to **Essentials** on the **Company Information** page. However, the Premium user can't use any of the features that the Premium license provides. This doesn't work in the opposite direction. Users who have an Essentials license can't sign in to a company where the **User Experience** is set to **Premium** on the **Company Information** page. For more information about licensing, go to [Business Central](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/business-central/overview/) website.

If you use an external accountant to manage your books and financial reporting, you can invite them to your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] so they can work with you on your fiscal data. For more information, see [Inviting Your External Accountant to Your Business Central](finance-accounting.md#inviteaccountant).

For more information about synchronizing user information with Microsoft 365, go to the [Synchronization with Microsoft 365](#m365) section.

> [!NOTE]
> If you use an external accountant to manage your books and financial reporting, you can invite them to your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] so they can work with you on your fiscal data. For more information, see [Inviting Your External Accountant to Your Business Central](finance-accounting.md#inviteaccountant).

### To remove a user's access to the system

You can remove a user's access to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online. All references to the user are kept. However, the user can't sign in and active sessions for the user are stopped.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Users**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the **User Card** page for the relevant user, and then, in the **Status** field, select **Disabled**.
3. To give the user access again, set the **Status** field to **Enabled**.

You can also remove the license from a user in the Microsoft 365 Admin Center. The user is then unable to sign in. For more information, see [Remove licenses from users](/microsoft-365/admin/manage/remove-licenses-from-users).

### <a name="m365"></a>Synchronization with Microsoft 365

When you assign a license for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to a user in Microsoft 365, there are two ways to create the user in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

- The administrator can add the user by choosing the **Update Users from Microsoft 365** action on the **Users** page as described in the [To add a user or update user information in Business Central](#adduser) section.
- The license information updates automatically when the user signs in for the first time.

In both cases, several settings are applied automatically. These settings are listed in the second and third columns in the following table.

If you change user information in Microsoft 365, you can update [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to reflect the change. Depending on what you want to update, use one of the actions on the **Users** page. The actions are described in the last two columns in the following table.

|What happens when:|First user, first sign-in|Update Users from Microsoft 365|Restore User Default User Groups|
|-|-|-|-|
|Scope:|Current user|Multiple selected users|Single selected user (except current)|
|Create the new user and assign SUPER permission set.<br /><br /><!--Platform-->|**X**|**X** | | 
|Update the user based on information in Microsoft 365: Status, Full Name, Contact Email, Authentication Email.<!--<br /><br />Codeunit "Azure AD   Graph User".UpdateUserFromAzureGraph-->|**X**|**X**|**X**|
|Synchronize user plans (licenses) with licenses and roles assigned in Microsoft 365.<!--<br /><br />Codeunit "Azure AD   Graph User".UpdateUserPlans-->|**X**|**X**|**X**|
|Add the user to user groups according to the current user plans. Remove the SUPER permission set for all users other than the first user to sign in and [administrators](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/tenant-administration). At least one SUPER is required.<!--<br /><br />Codeunit "Permission Manager". AddUserToDefaultUserGroups-->|**X**|**X**|**X**<br /><br />Removes manually assigned user groups and permissions.|

Users can access [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] records in Teams using only their Microsoft 365 license. When access is enabled for an environment, synchronizing using the **Update users from Microsoft 365** action skips users that only have a Microsoft 365 license. To include these users in synchronization, you must first update environment settings by assigning a security group that contains users with a [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] license and users with only a Microsoft 365 license.

Learn about securing access to environments using security groups at [Manage access using Microsoft Entra groups](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/tenant-admin-center-manage-access#manage-access-using-azure-active-directory-groups).

Get an overview of accessing [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in Teams with Microsoft 365 licenses at [admin-access-with-m365-license](admin-access-with-m365-license.md).

## Manage users and licenses in on-premises deployments

For on-premises deployments, the number of user licenses is specified in the license file (.bclicense or .flf). When an administrator or Microsoft partner uploads the license file, they can specify which users can sign in to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

For on-premises deployments, the administrator creates, edits, and deletes users directly from the **Users** page.

### To edit or delete a user in an on-premises deployment

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Users**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the user that you want to edit, and then choose the **Edit** action.
3. On the **User Card** page, change the information as necessary.  
4. To delete a user, select the user that you want to delete, and then choose the **Delete** action.

> [!NOTE]
> For on-premises deployments an administrator can specify how to authenticate user credentials in the [!INCLUDE[server](includes/server.md)] instance. When you create a user, you provide the credential type that you are using.
>
> For more information, see the [Authentication and Credential Types](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/users-credential-types) in the administration Help for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## Analyze user status by license type

You can use the **Data Analysis** feature to analyze data on the [Users](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=9800&layout=analysis) page. You don't have to run a report or open another application, such as Excel. The feature provides an interactive and versatile way to calculate, summarize, and examine data. Instead of running reports using options and filters, you can add multiple tabs that represent different tasks or views on the data. Some examples are "Users by status" or "Users by license type," or any other view you can imagine. To learn more about how to use the **Data Analysis** feature, go to [Analyze list and query data with analysis mode](analysis-mode.md).

### User analysis scenarios

The following sections provide examples of scenarios where analyzing the user list can help you monitor the status of your users.

| Area | To... | Open this page in analysis mode | Using these fields |
| ---- | ----- | ------------------------------- |------------------- |
| [Users by status](#example-users-by-status) | See a list of users based on their status (enabled/disabled). | [Users](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=9800&layout=analysis) | **Status**, **User Name**, **Full Name**, **Authorization email**, and **License Type**. |
| [Users by license type](#example-users-by-license-type) | See a list of users based on their license type. | [Users](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=9800&layout=analysis) | **License Type**, **Status**,  **User Name**, **Full Name**, and **Authorization email**. |

### Example: Users by status

To analyze users by status, follow these steps:

1. Open the [Users](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=9800&layout=analysis) list, and choose the :::image type="content" source="media/analysis-mode-icon.png" alt-text="Enter analysis mode."::: icon to turn on analysis mode.
1. On the **Columns** menu, remove all columns (select the box next to the **Search** field on the right).
1. Drag the **Status** (user enabled/disabled) and **License Type** fields to the **Row Groups** area.
1. Choose the fields **User Name**, **Full Name**, and **Authorization email**.
1. Rename your analysis tab to **Users by status**, or something that describes this analysis.

The following image shows the result of these steps.

# Move items in advanced warehouse configurations that use directed put-away and pick

You can move items between bins without a demand from a source document. For example, you might want to do that as part of the following activities:

* Reorganize your warehouse.
* Bring items to an inspection area.
* Take items out of the warehouse pick bins temporarily, perhaps to serve as demonstration models in a sales presentation.
* Move extra items to production area for components configured with some flushing methods.
* Move produced or assembled items from production or assembly area to warehouse.
* Move items from bulk storage area to bins you use for picking.

How you move items depends on how your warehouse is set up as a location. Learn more at [Setting Up Warehouse Management](warehouse-setup-warehouse.md).

In warehouse configurations where the **Directed Pick and Put-away** toggle is turned on for locations, you can register unplanned movements on the following pages:  

* Movement Worksheet
* Warehouse Internal Pick
* Warehouse Internal Put-away
* Warehouse Reclassification Journal

The **Movement Worksheet** , **Warehouse Internal Pick**, and  **Warehouse Internal Put-away** pages work in the same way. Use the pages to prepare warehouse activities for warehouse employees. The difference is in the advanced functionality associated with each page, and the different types of warehouse activities that are probably performed by different employees:

* Movement worksheet lets you fill up high-ranking pick bins with items from other bins
* Put-aways use put-away templates
* Picking uses bin ranking and availability

## Warehouse movement worksheet

### To move items with the warehouse movement worksheet

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Movement Worksheet**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields on the worksheet lines manually, or use one of the following actions to automatically fill in the lines:

    * **Get Bin Content** fills in the worksheet lines with the contents of the bin or bins you specify.
    * **Calculate Bin Replenishment** uses the bin rankings to suggest replenishment for high-ranking bins from low-ranking bins.

    > [!NOTE]  
    > If the item meets the criteria in the list below, the **From Zone** and **From Bin** fields will be blank. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates from where to move the items only when you use the **Create Movement** action.  
    >  
    > * The item has an expiration date.  
    > * The **Pick According to FEFO** toggle is turned on for the location.  
    > * You're using the **Calculate Bin Replenishment** feature.  

3. Choose the **Create Movement** action to create the movement. When the move is complete, you can register it.  

### To register the warehouse movement

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Movements**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the movement document to register.  
3. On **Place** lines, specify where, which, and by when to move the item by choosing values in the **Zone Code**, **Bin Code**, **Qty. to Handle**, or **Due Date** fields.  
4. On **Take** lines, in the **Qty. to Handle** field, specify the quantity of the bin content that you want to move. You can only edit this field on **Take** lines. 

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you must pick or place the items for one line in more than one bin, for example because the designated bin is full, use the **Split Line** action on the **Lines** FastTab. The action creates a line for the remaining quantity to handle.
 
5. To register all suggested quantities as specified in the **Quantity** field, choose the **Autofill Qty. to Handle** action.  
6. Choose the **Register** action.  

> [!NOTE]  
> For locations that use directed put-away and pick, you can't manually move items in bins of the type **RECEIVE** because they aren't yet considered as available inventory. You must put away the items in these bins before they're available for movements.

## Internal pick  

### To create an internal pick  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Whse. Internal Pick**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.
3. Fill in the **No.** field, **Location Code** field, and the **To Bin Code** field on the **General** FastTab. The **To Bin Code** field specifies the bin where you want to place the picked items. For production purposes, this bin would be the inbound production bin or the open shop bin. For other purposes, choose a bin code of a bin type that is not used for picking, most likely a staging, shipping, or special purpose bin.  
4. Select an item in the **Item No.** field, and fill in the quantities you want to pick.  
5. Choose the **Create Pick** action. A warehouse pick instruction is now ready for a warehouse employee to perform. Alternatively, choose the **Release** action and create warehouse picks using the **Pick Worksheet** page. To learn more about pick worksheets, go to [Create pick documents in bulk with the pick worksheet](warehouse-how-to-pick-items-for-warehouse-shipment.md#to-create-pick-documents-in-bulk-with-the-pick-worksheet).
6. When the pick is complete, you can register it.  

### To register the warehouse pick

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Picks**, and then choose the related link.  

    To work on a particular pick, select the pick from the list, or filter the list to find the picks that are assigned to you.  
2. If the **Assigned User ID** field is blank, enter your ID to identify yourself, if needed.  
3. Pick the items.  

    Because the warehouse is set up to use directed put-away and pick, bin ranking determines the bins to pick from. The bins are suggested on the pick lines. The instructions contain at least two separate lines for Take and Place actions.  

4. After you pick and place the items in the shipping area or shipping bin, choose the **Register Pick** action.  

## Internal put-away  

### To create an internal put-away  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Warehouse Internal Put-aways**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.
3. Fill in the **No.** and **Location Code** fields.
4. Fill in a line for each item to move to the warehouse. The **Item No.** and the **Quantity** fields are required.

    > [!NOTE]  
    > When you choose an item in the **Item No.** field, the **Bin Contents** page opens instead of the **Items** page. This page opens because you're putting away an item that is assigned to a particular bin - *bin content* - not just an item, and you already know the bin the item should be taken from. If you filled in the **From Bin Code** field, the bin content will be filtered by that value.

5. To fill the lines with the entire bin content or the filtered content of bins in the location, choose the **Get Bin Content** action.  
6. Choose the **Create Put-away** action. A warehouse put-away instruction is now ready for a warehouse employee. Alternatively, choose the **Release** action to create warehouse put-aways using the **Put-away worksheet** page. To learn more about put-away worksheets, go to [Create put-away documents in bulk with the put-away worksheet](warehouse-how-to-put-items-away-with-warehouse-put-aways.md#to-create-put-away-documents-in-bulk-with-the-put-away-worksheet).
6. When the put-away is complete, you can register it.  

### To register the warehouse put away

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Put-aways**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the warehouse put-away that's ready to handle.  
3. If required, enter your user ID when you start work on a put-away.  

    To optimize the put-away process, you can sort the put-away lines by various criteria. For example, by item, shelf number, or due date.
   
    * If the Take and Place lines for each receipt line don't immediately follow one another, and you want them to, sort the lines by selecting **Item** in the **Sorting Method** field.  
    * If the bin rankings reflect the physical layout of the warehouse, use the **Bin Ranking** sorting method to organize the work around the bin locations.

  > [!NOTE]  
  > Lines are sorted in ascending order by the selected criteria. If you sort by document, sorting is done first by document type based on the **Warehouse Activity Source Document** enum. If you sort by ship-to, sorting is done by destination type based on the **Warehouse Destination Type** field.

4. Perform the put-away.

    Each internal put-away line has become at least two lines in the warehouse put-away.  

    * The first line, with **Take** in the **Action Type** field, indicates where the items are located in the receiving area. You can't change the zone and bin on this line.  
    * The next line, with **Place** in the **Action Type** field, shows where to place the items in the warehouse. If you receive a large number of items on one receipt line, you might have to put the items away in several bins, so there's a Place line for each bin.  

5. When you have placed all the items in bins as instructed, choose the **Register Put-away** action.  

## To register a movement that has already happened

If you must register the fact that items has been already moved to other bins without a put-away, pick, or movement, you can use the **Whse. Reclassification Journal** page to register the movement.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Whse. Reclassification Journal**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the **Item No.**, **From Zone Code**, **From Bin Code**, **To Zone Code**, and **To Bin Code** fields.  
3. Choose the **Register** action.

# Outbound Warehouse Processes

Outbound processes in warehouses start when you release a source document to take items out of a warehouse location. For example, either to ship the items somewhere or to move them to another company location. You can ship physical and non-inventory items. To learn more about receiving non-inventory items, go to [Post non-inventory items](#post-non-inventory-items). 

In principle, the process of shipping outbound orders consists of two activities:

* Picking items from the shelves.
* Shipping items out of the warehouse.

The source documents for outbound warehouse flow are:  

* Sales order  
* Outbound transfer order  
* Purchase return order  
* Service order  

> [!NOTE]
> Production and assembly orders with component needs also represent outbound source documents. Production and assembly orders are a little different because they're typically internal processes that don't involve shipping. Instead, they're used to put-away produced items or move the components needed to assemble an item to an assembly area. Learn more about these processes at [Design Details: Internal Warehouse Flows](design-details-internal-warehouse-flows.md).  

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you pick and ship items using one of four methods, as described in the following table.

|Method|Outbound Process|Require Pick|Require Shipment|Complexity Level (Learn more at [Warehouse Management Overview](design-details-warehouse-management.md))|  
|------|----------------|-----|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
|A|Post the pick and shipment from the order line|||No dedicated warehouse activity.|  
|B|Post the pick and shipment from an inventory pick document|Turned on||Basic: Order-by-order.|  
|C|Post the pick and shipment from a warehouse shipment document||Turned on|Basic: Consolidated receive/ship posting for multiple orders.|  
|D|Post the pick from a warehouse pick document, and post the shipment from a warehouse shipment document|Turned on|Turned on|Advanced|  

The approach to choose depends on your warehouse practices and level of organizational complexity. The following are some examples that might help you decide.

* In an order-by-order environment with straightforward processes and a simple bin structure, method A, picking and shipping from the order line is appropriate.
* If items for an order line come from more than one bin, or if warehouse workers can't work with order documents, the use of separate pick documents is appropriate, method B.
* If your picking and shipping processes involve multiple orders and require greater control and overview, you might choose to use a warehouse shipment document and warehouse pick document to separate the picking and shipping tasks, methods C and D.  

In methods A, B, and C, picking and shipping activities are combined in one step when posting the document as shipped. In method D, you first register the pick, and then post the shipment later from a different document.

> [!NOTE]
> While warehouse picks and inventory picks sound similar, they're different documents and are used in different processes.
> * The inventory pick used in method B, together with registering picking information, also posts the shipment of the source document.
> * The warehouse pick used in method D can't be posted and only registers the pick. The registration makes the items available for the warehouse shipment but doesn't post the shipment. In the outbound flow, the warehouse pick requires a warehouse shipment.

## No dedicated warehouse activity

The following articles provide information about how to process receipts for source documents if you don't have dedicated warehouse activities.

* [Process Purchase Returns or Cancellations](purchasing-how-process-purchase-returns-cancellations.md)
* [Create Service Orders](service-how-to-create-service-orders.md)

## Basic warehouse configurations

The following diagram illustrates the outbound warehouse processes for different types of documents in basic warehouse configurations. The numbers in the diagram correspond with the steps in the sections following the diagram.  

:::image type="content" source="media/design-details-warehouse-management-outbound-basic-flow.png" alt-text="Shows the steps in a basic outbound flow in a warehouse.":::

### 1: Release a source document

When you use the **Release** action on a source document, such as a sales or transfer order, the items on the document are ready to be handled in the warehouse. For example, picked and put in the bin specified on the document. Alternatively, you can create inventory pick documents for individual lines on orders, in a push fashion, based on specified bins and quantities to handle.  

### 2: Create an inventory pick

On the **Inventory Pick** page, the warehouse worker retrieves, in a pull fashion, the source document lines. Alternatively, the inventory pick lines are already created, in a push fashion, by the user who is responsible for the source document.  

### 3: Post an inventory pick

On each line for items that have been picked or moved, partially or fully, fill in the **Quantity** field, and then post the inventory pick. Source documents related to the inventory pick are posted as shipped or consumed.  

For inventory picks, negative item ledger entries are created, warehouse entries are created, and the pick request is deleted, if fully handled. For example, the **Quantity Shipped** field on the outbound source document line is updated. A posted shipment document is created  that reflects the sales order, for example, and the shipped items.  

## Advanced warehouse configurations

The following diagram illustrates the outbound warehouse processes for different types of documents in advanced warehouse configurations. The numbers in the diagram correspond with the steps in the sections following the diagram.  

:::image type="content" source="media/design_details_warehouse_management_outbound_advanced_flow.png" alt-text="Shows the steps in an advanced outbound warehouse flow.":::

### 1: Release a source document

Releasing a source document in advanced configurations does the same thing as for basic configurations. The items become available for handling in the warehouse. For example, they can be included in a shipment.  

### 2: Create a warehouse shipment

On the **Warehouse Shipment** page, get the lines from the released source document. You can combine lines from several source document in one warehouse shipment.  

### 3: Create a warehouse pick

On the **Warehouse Shipment** page, create warehouse pick activities for warehouse shipments in one of two ways:

- In a push fashion, where you use the **Create Pick** action. Select the lines to be picked and prepare the picks by specifying, for example, which bins to take from and place in, and how many units to handle. The bins can be predefined for the warehouse location or resource.
- In a pull fashion, where you use the **Release** action. On the **Pick Worksheet** page, warehouse workers can use the **Get Warehouse Documents** action to get their assigned picks. When the warehouse picks are fully registered, the lines in the **Pick Worksheet** are deleted.

### 4: Register a warehouse pick

On the **Warehouse Pick** page, a warehouse worker fills in the **Quantity** field for each line that they've fully or partially picked, and then registers the pick.

Warehouse entries are created, and the warehouse pick lines are deleted if the full quantity was picked. The warehouse pick document remains open until the full quantity of the warehouse shipment is registered. The **Qty. Picked** field on the warehouse shipment lines is updated accordingly.  

### 5: Post the warehouse shipment

When all items on the warehouse shipment document are registered as picked, the warehouse worker posts the shipment. Posting updates the item ledger entries to reflect the reduction in inventory. For example, the **Quantity Shipped** field on the outbound source document line is updated.

# Create G/L budgets

Budgets play an important role in business intelligence. Examples include a financial statement based on financial reports that include budget entries or when analyzing budgeted versus actual amounts in the chart of accounts. To learn more, go to [Financial Reporting](bi.md).

You can create budgets for any given time period. However, most often businesses set up budgets for their fiscal year. You can create multiple budgets for the same period so you can work with multiple budget versions or revisions. You can create budgets for dimensions too, so you can analyze budget variances per dimension. You can work with up to four dimensions in a budget. To learn more, go to [Work with Dimensions](finance-dimensions.md).

In cost accounting, you work with cost budgets in a similar way. To learn more, go to [Creating Cost Budgets](finance-create-cost-budgets.md).  

## To create a new G/L budget

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **G/L Budgets**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **Edit List** action, then fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  
3. Choose the **Edit Budget** action.
4. At the top of the **Budget** page, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  

   The page shows only entries that contain the budget name you entered in the **Budget Name** field. Because you just created the budget name, there are no entries that match the filter. Therefore, the page is empty.  
5. To enter an amount, choose the relevant cell in the matrix. The **G/L Budget Entries** page opens.  
6. Create a new line and fill in the **Amount** field. Close the **G/L Budget Entries** page.  
7. Repeat steps 5 and 6 for all amounts in the budget.  

> [!NOTE]  
> On the **Filters** FastTab, you can filter the budget information by the budget dimensions you set up under the budget name.

## Exporting and importing G/L budgets with Excel

You can export data on budget pages to Microsoft Excel for further processing or analysis and then import budget data back in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

### Exporting G/L budgets to Excel

Exporting a G/L budget to an Excel workbook lets you work offline and using Excel's powerful data manipulation features.

To export the budget to Excel, follow these steps:

1. Open the Budget: Select the budget you want to work on from the list of G/L budgets. Choose the **Edit Budget** action.
1. To export to Excel, on the **Budget** page, choose **Export to Excel**.
1. Choose the dimensions and filters you want to include in the export. For example, you might want to filter by specific departments or projects.
1. To generate the Excel file, choose **OK**.
1. Save the exported Excel file to your local drive for further editing.

### Editing G/L budgets in Excel

After you export the G/L budget to Excel, you can fill in your budget data. Here's a few tips to be more effective and reduce errors:

- Add budget amounts for each combination of dimensions and periods. Ensure that the data is accurate and adheres to the formatting requirements of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For example, your numbering shouldn't have special characters or formatting.
- Take advantage of Excel features such as formulas, data validation, and conditional formatting to streamline data entry and ensure accuracy.
- Save the Excel file after you enter the budget data.
- Make local copies of your budgets as backups.

### Importing G/L budgets to Excel

After you add your budget numbers in a local Excel workbook, the next step is to import it back into [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Do as follows to import the budget from Excel:

1. Open the Budget: Select the budget you want to work on from the list of G/L budgets. Choose the **Edit Budget** action.
1. To import from Excel, on the **Budget** page, choose **Import from Excel**.
1. Choose the Excel file from your local drive. You can choose which budget you're uploading to and whether to add or replace the entries. The **Add** action adds the entries from Excel to entries that already exist. The **Replace** action overwrites entries existing entries in the budget.
1. If everything looks correct, choose **OK** to complete the import process. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] updates the budget with the imported data.

### Scenario example: setting budget targets for payroll expenses

You know that the new budgeted salaries cost is going to be 1.200.000 in local currency (LCY). You want to enable the Salaries department to budget for the three specific lines (of the Posting account type) for full-time employees, part-time employees, and temp help. The three lines are grouped under a Salaries heading line.

You enter 1.200.000 on the Heading line, export the budget to Excel, then send it to the Salaries department, telling them to distribute the LCY 1.200.000.

The Salaries department distributes the amount on the three posting accounts. When you import back into the G/L budget, the three accounts are filled in with the new Excel data, summing to LCY 1.200.000, and the Heading line is blank.

> [!NOTE]
> The chart of accounts, which general ledger (G/L) budgets are based on, has lines of the account type Heading. These lines contain the total of the lines below it. When you export a G/L budget, you export data on all lines regardless of the account type. However, you can only import data on lines of the Posting account type. Similarly, when you import a G/L budget, any values on Heading lines are deleted. They're deleted to avoid incorrect totals after you import data that was created or edited in Excel.

## Tips for effective budget management

Here are some tips for effective budget management:

- Regular Updates: Periodically update your G/L budgets to reflect changes in your financial plans and business environment. You can copy any of the budgets and turn them into forecasts.
- Version Control: Maintain different versions of your budget to compare actual performance against various scenarios.
- Collaboration: Encourage collaboration by involving relevant stakeholders in the budgeting process, ensuring that the budget is comprehensive and realistic.

# Use a Power Automate flow to timely synchronize Dataverse entity changes

Administrators can create an automated flow in Power Automate that notifies your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] about changes to records in your [!INCLUDE [cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] organization.

> [!NOTE]
> This article assumes you've connected your online version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with [!INCLUDE [cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] and scheduled synchronization between the two applications.

## Import the Flow Template

> [!TIP]
> To make it easier to set up the flow, we've created a template that will define the flow trigger and flow condition for you. To use the template, follow the steps in this section. To create the flow yourself, skip this section and start with the steps in [Define the Flow Trigger](#define-the-flow-trigger).

1. Sign in to [Power Automate](https://powerautomate.microsoft.com).
2. Choose **Templates**, and then search for **Notify Business Central**.

:::image type="content" source="media/power-automate-import-template.png" alt-text="Keywords to find the flow template.":::
3. Choose the **Notify Business Central when an account changes** template.
4. Continue with the steps in the [Notify Business Central about a change](#notify-business-central-about-a-change) section.

## Define the Flow Trigger

1. Sign in to [Power Automate](https://flow.microsoft.com).
2. Create an automated cloud flow that starts when a row for a [!INCLUDE [cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] entity is added, modified, or deleted. For more information, see [Trigger flows when a row is added, modified, or deleted](/power-automate/dataverse/create-update-delete-trigger). This example uses the **Accounts** entity. The following image shows the settings for the first step in defining a flow trigger.

:::image type="content" source="media/power-automate-flow-dataverse-trigger.png" alt-text="Settings for the flow's trigger":::
3. Use the **AssistEdit (...)** button in the upper right corner to add the connection to your [!INCLUDE [cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] environment.
4. Choose **Show advanced options**, and in the **Filter Rows** field, enter **customertypecode eq 3** or **customertypecode eq 11** and **statecode eq 0**. These values mean that the trigger will react only when changes are made to active accounts of the type **customer** or **vendor**.

## Define the Flow Condition

Data is synchronized between [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and [!INCLUDE [cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] through an integration user account. To ignore the changes made by the synchronization, create a condition step in your flow that excludes changes made by the integration user account.  

1. Add a **Get a row by ID from Dataverse** step after the flow trigger with the following settings. For more information, see [Get a row by ID from Dataverse](/power-automate/dataverse/get-row-id).

    1. In the **Table name** field, choose **Users**
    2. In the **Row ID** field, choose the **Modified By (Value)** from the flow trigger.  

2. Add a condition step with the following **or** settings to identify the integration user account.
    1. The user's **Primary Email Address** contains **contoso.com**
    2. The user's **Full Name** contains **[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]**.

3. Add a Terminate control to stop the flow if the entity was changed by the integration user account.

The following image shows how to define the flow trigger and the flow condition.

:::image type="content" source="media/power-automate-flow-dataverse.png" alt-text="Overview of flow trigger and condition settings":::

## Notify Business Central About a Change

If the flow isn't stopped by the condition, you must notify [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] that a change occurred. Use the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Connector to do that.

1. In the **No** fork of the condition step, add an action and search for **Dynamics 365 [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]**. Choose the connector icon in the list.
2. Choose the **Create record (V3)** action.

:::image type="content" source="media/power-automate-flow-dataverse-connector.png" alt-text="Settings for the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Connector":::

3. Use the **assist edit (...)** button in the upper right corner to add the connection to your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].
4. When connected, fill in the **Environment name** and **Company name** fields.
5. In the **API category** field, enter **microsoft/dataverse/v1.0**.
6. In the **Table name** field, enter **dataverseEntityChanges**.
7. In the **entityName** field, enter **account**.
8. Save the flow.

The following image shows how your flow should look.

:::image type="content" source="media/power-automate-flow-dataverse-summary.png" alt-text="Overview of all settings for the flow":::

When you add, delete, or modify an account in your [!INCLUDE [cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] environment, this flow will do the following actions:

1. Call the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] environment that you specified in the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Connector.
2. Use the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] API to insert a record with the **entityName** set to **account** in the **Dataverse Entry Change** table. This parameter is the exact name of the Dataverse entity that you're creating the flow for.
3. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will start the job queue entry that synchronizes customers with accounts.

# Post the Year-End Closing entry

After you use the **Close Income Statement** batch job to generate the year-end closing entry or entries, you must open the journal you specified in the batch job, and then review and post the entries.  

> [!TIP]
> Depending on your organizations work processes, you can choose to close or not close accounting periods and fiscal years in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The following procedure assumes that you have closed the fiscal year using the *Accounting Periods* option, generated a year-end closing entry using the **Close Income Statement** batch job, and are now ready to post the year-end closing entry along with the offsetting equity account entries. Your organization can choose to work differently, such as post the year-end closing entry as part of closing the fiscal year.

## To post the year end closing entry

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **General Journals** page, in the **Batch Name** field, select the batch that contains the closing entries.
3. Review the entries.
4. To post the journal, choose the **Post** action.

> [!NOTE]  
> If an error is detected, an error message is displayed. If the posting is successful, the posted entries are removed from the journal. After posting is complete, an entry is posted to each income statement account so that its balance becomes zero and the year's result is transferred to the balance sheet.

# Design Details: Posting Date on Adjustment Value Entry

This article provides guidance for users of the Inventory Costing functionality in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], and in particular for how the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job identifies and assigns a posting date to the value entries that the batch job is about to create.

## How posting dates are assigned

The **Adjust Cost – Item Entries** batch job assigns a posting date to the value entry it is about to create in the following steps:  

1. Initially the Posting Date of the entry to be created is the same date as the entry it adjusts.  

2. The Posting Date is validated against Inventory Periods and/or General Ledger Setup.  

3. Assignment of Posting Date; If the initial Posting Date is not within allowed posting date range the batch job will assign an allowed Posting Date from either General Ledger Setup or Inventory Period. If both Inventory Periods and allowed posting dates in General Ledger Setup are defined, the later date of the two will be assigned to the Adjustment Value Entry.  

Let’s review this process more in practice. Assume we have an Item Ledger Entry of Sale. The item was shipped on September 5, 2020 and it was invoiced the day after.  

#### Item Ledger Entry

|Entry No.  |Item No.  |Posting Date  |Entry Type  | Document No. |Location Code  |Quantity  |Cost Amount (Actual)  |Invoiced Quantity  |Remaining Quantity  |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|319     |A         |2020-09-05     |  Sale       |102033     |  Blue       | -1    |    -11     |-1     |    0     |

Below are the related value entries:

- **Entry No. 379** represents the shipment and carry the same Posting Date as the parent Item ledger Entry.  
- **Entry No. 381** represents the invoice.  
- **Entry No. 391** is an Adjustment of the invoicing Value Entry (Entry No. 381 above).  

|Entry No.  |Item No.  |Posting Date  |Item Ledger Entry Type  |Entry Type  |Document No.  |Item Ledger Entry No.  |Location Code  |Item Ledger Entry Quantity  |Invoiced Quantity  |Cost Amount (Actual)  |Cost Amount (Expected)  |Adjustment  |Applies-to Entry  |Source Code  |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|--------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|379     |  A       |    2020-09-05     |    Sale     | Direct Cost   | 102033        |319     | Blue        | -1       |0         |  0       |     -10   |No   |0    |Sales          |
|381     |  A       |    2020-09-06     |    Sale     | Direct Cost   | 103022        |319     | Blue        |  0       |-1        |-10       |    10     | No  |0      |       Sales   |
|391     |  A       |    2020-09-10     |    Sale     | Direct Cost   | 103022        |319     | Blue        |  0       |0         |-1        |    0     |Yes   |    181   | INVTADJMT   |

To assign the posting date for **Entry No. 391** the following steps were applied:

1. The **Adjustment Value Entry** to be created (**Entry No. 391**) is assigned same **Posting Date** as the entry it adjusts.

2. The **Adjust Cost – Item Entries** batch job determines if the initial Posting Date of the Adjustment Value Entry is within allowed posting date range based upon Inventory Periods and/or General Ledger Setup.  

Let’s review the above mentioned Sale by adding setup of allowed posting date ranges.  
  
#### Inventory Periods

|Ending Date  |Name  |Closed  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|2020-01-31     |January 2020      |  Yes    |
|2020-02-28     |February 2020     |  Yes    |
|2020-03-31     |March 2020        |  Yes    |
|2020-04-30     |April 2020        |  Yes    |
|2020-05-31     |May   2020        |  Yes    |
|2020-06-30     |June   2020       |  Yes    |
|2020-07-31     |July  2020        |  Yes    |
|2020-08-31     |August   2020     |  Yes    |
|2020-09-30     |September   2020  |         |
|2020-10-31     |October   2020    |         |
|2020-11-30     |November   2020   |         |
|2020-12-31     |December   2020   |         |

The first allowed posting date is the first day in the first open period, which is September 1, 2020.  

#### General Ledger Setup

|Field|Value  |
|---------|---------|
|Allow Posting From:  |  2020-09-10      |
|Allow Posting To:    |  2020-09-30      |
|Register Time:       |         |
|Local Address Format:|   Post Code      |  

The first allowed posting date is the date stated in field **Allow Posting From**: September 10, 2020. If both Inventory Periods and allowed posting dates in **General Ledger Setup** are defined, the later date of the two will define the allowed posting date range.  

**Assignment of an allowed posting date**  

The initial assigned Posting Date was September 6 as illustrated in step 1. However, in the second step the Adjust Cost – Item entries batch job identifies that earliest allowed Posting Date is September 10 and thereby assigns September 10 to the Adjustment Value Entry (**Entry No. 391**), below.  


|Entry No.  |Item No.  |Posting Date  |Item Ledger Entry Type  |Entry Type  |Document No.  |Item Ledger Entry No.  |Location Code  |Item Ledger Entry Quantity  |Invoiced Quantity  |Cost Amount (Actual)  |Cost Amount (Expected)  |Adjustment  |Applies-to Entry  |Source Code  |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|379     |  A       |    2020-09-05     |    Sale     | Direct Cost   | 102033        |319     | Blue        | -1       |0         |  0       |     -10   |No   |0    |Sales          |
|381     |  A       |    2020-09-06     |    Sale     | Direct Cost   | 103022        |319     | Blue        |  0       |-1        |-10       |    10     | No  |0      |       Sales   |
|391     |  A       |    **2020-09-10**     |    Sale     | Direct Cost   | 103022        |319     | Blue        |  0       |0         |-1        |    0     |Yes   |    181   | INVTADJMT   |

## Common problems with the "Adjust Cost - Item entries"-batch job

There are two scenarios that the support team encounters frequently enough for them to warrant their own problem resolution articles.

### Error message: "Posting Date is not within your range of allowed posting dates…"

If you encounter this error you need to adjust the dates for which the user is allowed to post entries. To learn more, see [Error Message "Posting Date is not within your range of allowed posting dates"](design-details-inventory-adjustment-value-entry-allowed-posting-dates.md).

### Posting Date on Adjustment Value Entry versus Posting Date on entry causing the adjustment such as Revaluation or Item charge

To learn more, see [Posting Date on Adjustment Value Entry Compared to the Source Entry](design-details-inventory-adjustment-value-entry-source-entry.md).

# About planning functionality

The planning system takes all demand and supply data into account, nets the results, and creates suggestions for balancing supply to meet demand. To learn more, go to [Design Details: Supply Planning](design-details-supply-planning.md).  

> [!TIP]  
> To understand the fields that this article mentions, read their tooltip in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

## Supply and demand

Planning has two elements, supply and demand. These must balance to ensure that the demand is met.  

- Demand is any kind of gross requirement, such as a sales order, service order, or a component need for assembly or production orders, outbound transfer, blanket order, or forecast. Additionally, there other technical types of demand, such as a negative production or purchase order, negative inventory, and purchase return.  
- Supply refers to any kind of replenishment such as inventory, a purchase order, assembly order, production order, or inbound transfer. Correspondingly, there can be a negative sales or service order, negative component need or sales return that also represent supply.  

Another goal of the planning system is to ensure that the inventory does not grow unnecessarily. In the case of decreasing demand, the planning system will suggest that you postpone, decrease in quantity, or cancel existing replenishment orders.  

## Planning calculation

The planning system is driven by anticipated and actual customer demand, as well as inventory reordering parameters. Running the planning calculation will result in application suggesting specific actions ([Action Messages](production-how-to-run-mps-and-mrp.md#action-messages)) to take concerning possible replenishment from vendors, transfers between warehouses, or production. If replenishment orders already exist, the suggested actions could be to increase or expedite the orders to meet the changes in demand.  

The basis of the planning routine is in the gross-to-net calculation. Net requirements drive planned order releases, which are scheduled based on the routing information (manufactured items) or the item card lead time (purchased items). Planned order release quantities are based on the planning calculation, and are affected by the parameters set on the individual item cards.  

> [!TIP]
> The planning system relies on how your organization uses locations. To learn more, go to [Planning With or Without Locations](production-planning-with-without-locations.md).

## Planning with manual transfer orders

In the **Replenishment System** field on a SKU card, you can set up the planning system to create transfer orders to balance supply and demand across locations.  

In addition to such automatic transfer orders, you may sometimes need to perform a general move of inventory quantities to another location, irrespective of existing demand. For this purpose you would manually create a transfer order for the quantity to move. To ensure that the planning system does not try to manipulate this manual transfer order, you must set the **Planning Flexibility** on the transfer line(s) to None.  

Contrarily, if you do want the planning system to adjust the transfer order quantities and dates to existing demand, you must set the **Planning Flexibility** field to the default value, Unlimited.

## Planning parameters

The planning parameters control when, how much, and how to replenish based on the various settings on the item card (or stockkeeping unit - SKU), and the manufacturing setup.  

The following planning parameters exist on the item or SKU card:  

- Dampener Period  
- Dampener Quantity  
- Reordering Policy  
- Reorder Point
- Maximum Inventory  
- Overflow Level  
- Time Bucket  
- Lot Accumulation Period  
- Rescheduling Period  
- Reorder Quantity  
- Safety Lead Time  
- Safety Stock Quantity  
- Assembly Policy  
- Manufacturing Policy  

The following order modifiers exist on the item or SKU card:  

- Minimum Order Quantity  
- Maximum Order Quantity  
- Order Multiple  

Global planning setup fields on the **Manufacturing Setup** page include:  

- Dynamic Low-Level Code  
- Current Demand Forecast  
- Use Forecast on Locations  
- Default Safety Lead Time  
- Blank Overflow Level  
- Combined MPS/MRP Calculation
- Components at Location  
- Default Dampener Period  
- Default Dampener Quantity  
- Default General Business Posting Group

To learn more, go to [Design Details: Planning Parameters](design-details-planning-parameters.md)  

## Other important planning fields

### Planning Flexibility

On most supply orders, such as production orders, you can select **Unlimited** or **None** in the **Planning Flexibility** field on the lines.

This specifies whether the supply represented by the production order line is considered by the planning system when calculating action messages.
If the field contains **Unlimited**, then the planning system includes the line when calculating action messages. If the field contains **None**, then the line is firm and unchangeable, and the planning system does not include the line when calculating action messages.

### Warnings

The **Warning** information field on the **Planning Worksheet** page informs you of any planning line created for an unusual situation with a text, which the user can choose to read additional information. The following warning types exist:

- Emergency
- Exception
- Attention

#### Emergency

The emergency warning displays in two situations:

- The inventory is negative on the planning starting date.
- Back-dated supply or demand events exist.

If an item's inventory is negative on the planning starting date, the planning system suggests an emergency supply order for the negative quantity to arrive on the planning starting date. The warning text states the starting date and the quantity of the emergency order.

Any document lines with due dates before the planning starting date are consolidated into one emergency supply order for the item to arrive on the planning starting date.

#### Exception

The exception warning displays if the projected available inventory drops below the safety stock quantity.

The planning system will suggest a supply order to meet the demand on its due date. The warning text states the item's safety stock quantity and the date on which it is violated.

Violating the safety stock level is considered an exception because it shouldn't occur if the reorder point has been set correctly.

> [!NOTE]
> Supply on planning lines with Exception warnings is normally not modified according to planning parameters. Instead, the planning system only suggests a supply to cover the exact demand quantity. However, you can set the planning run up to respect certain planning parameters for planning lines with certain warnings. To learn more, go to the description for the **Respect Planning Parameters for Exception Warnings** field in the [Run Full Planning, MPS or MRP](production-how-to-run-mps-and-mrp.md) article.

#### Attention

The attention warning displays in two situations:

- The planning starting date is earlier than the work date.
- The planning line suggests to change a released purchase or production order.

> [!NOTE]
> In planning lines with warnings, the **Accept Action Message** field is not selected, because the planner is expected to further investigate these lines before carrying out the plan.

## Planning worksheets and requisition worksheets

As described in [Planning](production-planning.md), you can choose between two worksheets for most planning activities, the planning worksheet and the requisition worksheet. Most processes are described based on the planning worksheet, but there are a couple of scenarios where the requisition worksheet is preferred.

[!INCLUDE [edit-in-excel](includes/edit-in-excel.md)]

> [!TIP]
> When you process lines in a planning worksheet, you can print more than one firm planned orders. The **Prod. Order** option in the **Report Selection - Production Order** page determines which report to print. The default report is **99000762 Prod. Order - Job Card**. If your production orders lack routing lines or you prefer a more compact report, consider switching to the **5500 Prod. Order Comp. and Routing** report.

### Requisition worksheet

The **Requisition Worksheet** page lists items that you want to order. You can enter items in the worksheet in the following ways:

- Enter the items manually in the worksheet and fill in the relevant fields.
- Use the **Calculate Plan** batch job. This calculates a replenishment plan for items and stockkeeping units that have been set up with a replenishment system of **Purchase** or **Transfer**. When you use this batch job, the program automatically fills in the **Action Message** field with a suggestion for an action you can take to replenish the item. This could be increasing the item quantity on an existing order or creating a new order, for example.
- If you have used the **Calculate Plan** batch job from the **Planning Worksheet** page to calculate a replenishment plan, you can use the **Carry Out Action Message** batch job to copy purchase and transfer order proposals from the planning worksheet to the requisition worksheet. This is practical if separate users are responsible for handling production orders and purchase/transfer orders.
- You can use the **Drop Shipment** action to fill in the requisition worksheet lines. This action uses the **Get Sales Orders** batch job to determine the sales order lines that you want to designate for a drop shipment.
- You can use the **Special Order** action to fill in the requisition worksheet lines. This action uses the **Get Sales Orders** batch job to determine the sales order lines that you want to designate for a special order.

Requisition worksheet lines contain detailed information about the items that need to be reordered. You can edit and delete the lines to adjust your replenishment plan, and you can further process the lines by using the **Carry Out Action Message** batch job.

To learn more about planning with locations and transfers, go to [Planning With or Without Locations](production-planning-with-without-locations.md).

> [!TIP]
> When you're working on the **Requisition Worksheet** or **Planning Worksheet** pages, you can organize the lines by sorting on a column name. This is especially useful on the Planning Worksheet page because they it can be used for multilevel production orders. By default, lines are sorted by the **Item No.** field. To group lines for a multilevel order, sort by the **Ref. Order No.** field. Also, the **MPS Order** and **Planning Level** fields can help show the hierarchy of the lines.

# The C5 data migration extension

This extension makes it easy to migrate customers, vendors, items, and your general ledger accounts from Microsoft Dynamics C5 2012 to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. You can also migrate historical entries for general ledger accounts.

> [!NOTE]
> The company in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] must not contain any data. Additionally, after you start a migration, do not create customers, vendors, items, or accounts until the migration finishes.

## What data is migrated?

The following data is migrated for each entity:

### Customers

* Contacts  
* Location
* Country
* Customer dimensions (department, center, purpose)
* Shipment method
* Sales Person
* Payment terms
* Payment method
* Customer price group
* Customer invoice discount

If you migrate accounts, the following data is also migrated:

* Customer posting setup
* General journal batch
* Open transactions (customer ledger entries)

### Vendors

* Contacts
* Location
* Country
* Vendor dimensions (department, center, purpose)
* Invoice discount
* Shipment method
* Purchaser
* Payment terms
* Payment method
* Vendor invoice discount

If you migrate accounts, the following data is also migrated:

* Vendor posting setup
* General journal batch
* Open transactions (vendor ledger entries)

### Items

* Location
* Country
* Item dimensions (department, center, purpose)
* Sales line discounts
* Customer discount groups
* Item discount groups
* Sales price
* Tariff number
* Units of measure
* Item tracking code
* Customer price group
* Assembly BOMs

If you migrate accounts, the following data is also migrated:

* Inventory posting setup
* General posting setup
* Item journal batch
* Open transactions (item ledger entries)

> [!NOTE]
> If there are open transactions that use foreign currencies, the exchange rates for those currencies are also migrated. Other exchange rates are not migrated.

### Chart of accounts

* Standard dimensions: Department, Cost Center, Purpose  
* Historical G/L transactions  

> [!NOTE]
> Historical G/L transactions are treated a little differently. When you migrate data you set a **Current Period** parameter. This parameter specifies how to process G/L transactions. Transactions after this date are migrated individually. Transactions before this date are aggregated per account and migrated as a single amount. For example, let's say there are transactions in 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, and you specify January 01, 2017 in the Current Period field. For each account, amounts for transactions on or before December 31, 2016, will be aggregated in a single general journal line for each G/L account. All transactions after this date will be migrated individually.

## File size requirements

The largest file size you can upload to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is 150 MB. If the file you export from C5 is larger than that, consider migrating data in multiple files. For example, export one or two types of entities from C5, such as customers and vendors, to a file, and then export items to another file, and so on. You can import files individually in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## To migrate data

There are just a few steps to export data from C5, and import it in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]:  

1. In C5, use the **Export Database** feature to export the data. Then send the export folder to a compressed (zipped) folder.  
2. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Data Migration**, and then choose **Data Migration**.  
3. Complete the steps in the assisted setup guide. Make sure to choose **Import from Microsoft Dynamics C5 2012** as the data source.  

## Viewing the status of the migration

Use the **Data Migration Overview** page to monitor the success of the migration. The page shows information such as the number of entities that the migration includes, the status of the migration, and the number of items that have been migrated and whether they were successful. It also shows the number of errors, lets you investigate what went wrong and, when possible, makes it easy to go to the entity to fix the issues. For more information, see the next section in this article.  

> [!NOTE]
> While you are waiting for the results of the migration, you must refresh the page to display the results.

## How to avoid double-posting

To help avoid double-posting to the general ledger, the following balance accounts are used for open transactions:  

* For vendors, we use the A/P account from the vendor posting group.  
* For customers, we use the A/R account from the customer posting group.  
* For items, we create a general posting setup where the adjustment account is the account specified as the inventory account on the inventory posting setup.  

## Correcting errors

If something goes wrong and an error occurs, the **Status** field shows **Completed with Errors**, and the **Error Count** field will show how many. To view a list of the errors, you can open the **Data Migration Errors** page by choosing:  

* The number in the **Error Count** field for the entity.  
* The entity, and then the **Show Errors** action.  

On the **Data Migration Errors** page, to fix an error you can choose an error message, and then choose **Edit Record** to view the migrated data for the entity. If you have several errors to fix, you can choose **Bulk-Fix Errors** to edit the entities in a list. You still need to open individual records if the error was caused by a related entry, though. For example, a vendor won't be migrated if an email address one of their contacts has an invalid format.

After you fix one or more errors, you can choose **Migrate** to migrate only the entities you fixed, without having to completely restart the migration.  

> [!TIP]
> If you have fixed more than one error, you can use the **Select More** feature to select multiple lines to migrate. Alternatively, if there are errors that are not important to fix, you can choose them and then choose **Skip Selections**.

> [!NOTE]
> If you have items that are included in a BOM, you might need to migrate more than once if the original item is not created before the variants that reference it. If an item variant is created first, the reference to the original item can cause an error message.  

## Verifying data after migrating

One way to verify that your data migrated correctly is to look at the following pages in C5 and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

|Microsoft Dynamics C5 2012 | Dynamics 365 Business Central| Batch Job to Use |
|---------------------------|------------------------------|------------------|
|Customer Entries| General Journals| CUSTMIGR |
|Vendor Entries| General Journals| VENDMIGR|
|Item Entries| Item Journals| ITEMMIGR |
|G/L Entries| General Journals| GLACMIGR |

## Stopping data migration

You can stop migrating data by choosing **Stop All Migrations**. If you do, all pending migrations are also stopped.

# Set Up Warehouse Employees

You must set up each user who performs warehouse activities as a warehouse employee and assign them to a default location. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] filters warehouse activities to the employee's default location. They can only perform the warehouse activities at the location. You can also assign a user to other locations. They can access but not perform activities at those locations.

## To set up warehouse employees  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Warehouse Employees**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. Select the **User ID** field, and then select the user to be added as a warehouse employee. Choose the **OK** button.  
4. In the **Location Code** field, enter the code of the location where the user will be working.  
5. Turn on the **Default** toggle to specify that this is the only location where the employee can perform warehouse activities.  
6. Repeat these steps to assign other employees to locations or assign other locations to existing warehouse employees.  

> [!TIP]
> You can also use the **Add me as warehouse employee** action to quickly add yourself to the list of warehouse employees. For example, this is useful when you're testing the capabilities.

# Enable Customer Payments Through Payment Services

As an alternative to collecting payments through bank transfer or credit cards, your customers can pay you through their account with payment services, such as PayPal or WorldPay.  

After you enable a payment service in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], a link to the service is available on sales documents that you send by email to your customers. Customers can use the link to go to the payment service and pay the bill, directly from the sales document. If you don't want to include the link, for example, if a customer will pay with cash, you can remove the payment service from the invoice before posting.  

The PayPal Payments Standard and WorldPay Payments Standard extensions are installed in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], and are ready for you to enable.  

> [!CAUTION]
> The WorldPay Payments Standard extension will be deprecated. The code is market as obsolete starting in 2023 release wave 2. The app will be active for the next three major releases and then it will be removed.   

## To enable a payment service in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Payment Services**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Payment Services** page, choose the **New** action.  
3. Select the payment service, and then close the page.  
4. On the **Payment Services** page, choose the **Setup** action.  
5. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  
6. Close the page.  

## To select a payment service on a sales invoice

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Invoices**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the sales invoice that you want to pay by using the payment service.  
3. In the **Payment Service** field, choose the payment service.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > The **Payment Service** field is available only if you've enabled the payment service.

# Create Bin Contents

After you have set up your bins, you can set up the bin contents. In other words, you can set up the items you want to store in any given bin and set the rules that govern filling the bin with a particular item. You can do this manually on the **Bin Contents** page or automatically with the **Create Bin Content Worksheet** page.

## To create bin content manually

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Locations**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the location where you want to set up bin contents,  and then choose the **Bins** action.  
3. Select the bin where you want to set up contents, and then choose the **Contents** action.  
4. For each item that you want to store in the bin, fill in a line on the **Bin Contents** page with the appropriate information. Some of the fields are filled in already with information about the bin.  
5. First fill in the **Item No.** field, and then, if you are using directed put-away and pick, fill in the other fields such as the **Unit of Measure Code**, **Max. Qty.**, and **Min. Qty.** fields.  

Select the **Fixed** field if necessary. If the bin is to be used as the default bin for the item, select the **Default Bin** field.  

If you are using directed put-away and pick, and if you have entered the correct dimensional information on the item card about each item's units of measure, the maximum quantity that you enter on the **Bin Contents** page is verified against the physical capabilities of the bin. The minimum and maximum quantities are used when calculating bin replenishment and suggested put-aways.  

If you select the **Fixed** field, you are fixing the item to the bin, meaning that [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will try to put this item in the bin if there is space for it, and it will preserve the record fixing the item to the bin even when the quantity in the bin is 0. Other items can be put into the bin, even though a particular item has been fixed to the bin.  

> [!NOTE]  
> You can set up several bin contents at the same time on the **Bin Content Creation Worksheet** page.  

## To create bin content with a worksheet

When you have created your bins, you can create the bin content that you want for each bin in the bin content creation worksheet.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Bin Content Creation Worksheet**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the worksheet header, in the **Name** field, select the worksheet of the location where you want to create bin contents.  
3. In the **Bin Code** field, select the code of the bin for which you want to define bin content.  

    If you are using directed put-away and pick in this location, the fields relating to that particular bin, such as **Bin Type**, **Warehouse Class Code**, and **Bin Ranking**, will be filled in automatically. This is information that you need to consider as you define the bin content.  
4. Select the item that you want to assign to the bin, and fill in the fields related to the bin content. If you are using directed put-away and pick, and you want to use the **Calculate Bin Replenishment** function, fill in the **Max. Qty.** and **Min. Qty.** fields.  

    To set this bin as the preferred bin for the item even if the bin quantity is **0** and all other put-away criteria equal, select the **Fixed** field.  
5. Repeat steps 3 through 4 for each item you want to assign to a bin.  
6. Choose the **Print** action to preview and print the bin content you have entered in the worksheet. Continue to revise the bin content until you are satisfied.  
7. When you are ready, choose the **Create Bin Content** action.  

In this worksheet, you can work with a number of bin content lines for a number of bins and thereby obtain a good overview of what you are putting into various bins in a given zone, aisle, or rack.

# Set up cost accounting

Before you start working with cost accounting, you must perform setup tasks.

## Balances between Cost Type, Cost Center, and Cost Object

When you set up cost accounting, you must make sure that all entries are assigned to a cost type as well as a cost center or a cost object. The means that each cost entry must have a cost type assigned and a cost center code or a cost object assigned. This rule ensures that each cost entry appears in either the cost centers or the cost objects, but never in both places.  

By doing this, you create the following accounting equation:  

*Cost Type Balance* = *Cost Center Balance* + *Cost Object Balance*  

When you print the chart of cost type, the chart of cost centers, and the chart of cost objects reports, you can analyze this relationship.

## Set up Cost Types

The chart of cost types is similar to the chart of accounts in the general ledger. You can set up the chart of cost types in the following ways:  

- Structure the chart of cost types similar to the income statement accounts in the general ledger chart of accounts. Then, you can transfer the general ledger chart of accounts to the chart of cost types. You can make any necessary adjustments after the transfer.  
- Create new chart of cost types or add new cost types to existing chart of cost types. You must create each new cost type individually.  

### To transfer the general ledger chart of accounts to the chart of cost types

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Chart of Cost Types**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **Get Cost Types from Chart of Accounts** action. In the dialog box, choose the **Yes** button to confirm the transfer. The function uses the chart of accounts to create a chart of cost types.  

    The chart of cost types now contain all income statement accounts in the general ledger and include headings and subtotals. You can change the chart of cost types, as necessary. For example, you can delete duplicate existing cost types.  

    > [!IMPORTANT]  
    >  The **Register Cost Types in Chart of Accounts** function updates the relationship between the chart of accounts and the chart of cost types. The **No.** field is filled and verified to make sure that each general ledger account is related to only one cost type. The function runs automatically before transferring general ledger entries to cost accounting.  

### To set up new cost types in the Chart of Cost Types page

1. Open the **Chart of Cost Types** page in edit mode.  
2. Fill in the fields as described as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  You can set up and maintain cost types in either the **Cost Type Card** page or on the **Chart of Cost Types** page. In this procedure, you set up cost types on the **Chart of Cost Types** page.

3. After you have created all cost types, choose the **Indent Cost Types** action. In the dialog box, choose the **Yes** button.  
4. Link the new cost type to the corresponding general ledger account.  

    > [!IMPORTANT]  
    >  If you have entered definitions in the **Totaling** fields for the line type of **End-Total** before you run the **Indent Cost Types** function, then you must enter the definitions again because the function overwrites the values in all **End-Total** fields.  

### To update cost types

1. On the **Cost Accounting Setup** page, select if you want the chart of cost types to be automatically updated when the chart of accounts is changed.  
2. In the **Align G/L Account** field, you can choose from the following options.  

- **No Alignment** - There is no corresponding change in the chart of cost types when you change the chart of accounts.  
- **Automatic** - A corresponding change is made in the chart of cost types when you change the chart of accounts.  
- **Prompt** - A message is displayed asking if you want to make a corresponding change in the chart of cost types when you change the chart of accounts.

## Defining the Relationship Between Cost Types and General Ledger Accounts

The relationship between the cost type and the general ledger account is created in the cost type and in the general ledger account.  

- The **G/L Account Range** field in the **Cost Type** table establishes which general ledger accounts belong to a cost type.  
- The **Cost Type No.** field in the chart of accounts establishes which cost type a general ledger account belongs to.  

These two fields are filled automatically when you use the **Get Cost Types from Chart of Accounts** function.  

### Relationship Between General Ledger Accounts and Cost Types

There is an n:1 relationship between general ledger accounts and cost types. Several general ledger accounts can belong to one cost type, but each general ledger account belongs to only one cost type. The following table describes the details in the relationship.  

|Relationship|**G/L Account Range**|**Cost Type No.**|  
|------------------|------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|  
|One general ledger account for each cost type|One general ledger account|One cost type|  
|Several general ledger accounts for one cost type|General ledger account range, for example, 7110..7193 for each general ledger account|For each general ledger account in the range, there is only one cost type|  
|Cost types without corresponding general ledger accounts|\<Empty\>||  
|General ledger accounts whose entries will not be transferred||\<Empty\>|  

### Cost Types Without a Relationship to the General Ledger

A cost type may not have a relationship to general ledger accounts if one of the following conditions is true:  

- Accounts for operational accounting, such as Calc. Interest and Depreciation, only take costs from the operational accounting.  
- Helping cost types, such as cost types 9901, 9902, and 9903 in the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] database, are used as credit and debit accounts for allocations.  
- The helping account, 9920 in the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] database, contains actual accruals that show the difference between costs and the expense from the general ledger.

## Setting Up Cost Centers

Cost centers are departments that are responsible for costs and income. The chart of cost centers is similar to the dimension information for the general ledger. You can set up the chart of cost centers in the following ways:  

- Transfer dimension values in the general ledger to the chart of cost centers. You can make any necessary adjustments after the transfer.  
- Create a new chart of cost center that is independent of the general ledger or add a new cost center to an existing chart of cost center. You must create each cost center individually.  

### To transfer dimension values in the general ledger to the chart of cost centers

1. Set up a dimension to be the cost center dimension on the **Cost Accounting Setup** page. Only the values from this dimension are transferred.
You can choose **Update Cost Acctg. Dimensions** action to update cost accounting dimensions.
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 2.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Chart of Cost Centers**, and then choose the related link.  
1. On the **Actions** tab, in the **Functions** group, choose **Get Cost Centers from Dimension** to transfer dimension values to the chart of cost centers. The function transfers the dimension values that you defined in step 1.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  You can set up the **Align Cost Center Dimension**  field to define a one-way synchronization of dimension values from the general ledger to the chart of cost centers. You cannot define a synchronization of the chart of cost centers to dimension values from the general ledger.  

The chart of cost centers now contains all specified dimension values from the general ledger and includes titles and subtotals.  

### To create new cost centers in the Chart of Cost Centers page

You can set up and maintain cost centers in either the **Cost Center Card** card or on the **Chart of Cost Centers** page. In this procedure, you set up cost centers on the **Chart of Cost Centers** page.  

1. Open the **Chart of Cost Centers** page in edit mode.  
2. In the **Code** field, enter the cost center code. All cost centers must have a code.  
3. In the **Name** field, enter the cost center name.  
4. Choose the drop-down arrow in the **Line Type** field to specify the purpose of the cost center.  

    - For cost centers of the **Total** type, you must fill in the **Totaling** field. Use the **or** operator, which is a vertical line (**&#124;**) to set ranges of cost centers.  
    - For cost centers of the **End-Total** line type, this field is filled in automatically when you use the indent function.  
5. Fill in the **Sorting Order** and **Cost Subtype** fields.  
6. Choose the next empty line to create a new cost center, and then repeat steps 2 through 5.  
7. After you have set up all the cost centers, choose the **Indent Cost Centers** action. Choose the **Yes** button.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> If you have entered definitions in the **Totaling** fields for **End-Total** cost centers before you run the indent function, then you must enter them again. The function overwrites the values in all **End-Total** fields.

## Setting Up Cost Objects

Cost objects are projects, products, or services of a company. The chart of cost objects is similar to the dimension information for the general ledger. You can set up the chart of cost objects in the following ways:  

* Transfer dimension values in the general ledger to the chart of cost objects. You can make any necessary adjustments after the transfer.  
* Create a new chart of cost object that is independent of the general ledger or add a new cost object to an existing chart of cost objects. You must create each cost object individually.  

### To transfer dimension values from the general ledger to the chart of cost objects

1.  Set a dimension to be the cost object dimension on the **Update CA Dimensions** page. Only the values from this dimension are transferred.  
2.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 3.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Chart of Cost Objects**, and then choose the related link.  
3.  Choose the **Get Cost Objects from Dimension** action to transfer dimension values to the chart of cost objects. The function transfers the dimension values that you defined in step 1.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  You can set up the **Align Cost Object Dimension**  field to define a one-way synchronization of dimension values from the general ledger to the chart of cost objects. You cannot define a synchronization of the chart of cost objects to dimension values from the general ledger.  

The chart of cost objects now contains all specified dimension values from the general ledger and includes titles and subtotals.  

### To create new cost objects in the Chart of Cost Objects page

You can set up and maintain cost objects in either the **Cost Object Card** card or on the **Chart of Cost Objects** page. In this procedure, you set up cost objects on the **Chart of Cost Objects** page.  

1.  Open the **Chart of Cost Objects** page in edit mode.  
2.  In the **Code** field, enter the cost object code. All cost objects must have a code.  
3.  In the **Name** field, enter the cost object name.  
4.  Choose the drop-down arrow in the **Line Type** field to specify the purpose of the cost object.  

    * For cost objects of the **Total** line type, fill in the **Total From/To** field. Use the **or** operator, which is a vertical line (**&#124;**), to set ranges of cost objects.  
    * For cost objects of the **End-Total** line type, this field is filled in automatically when you use  the indent function.  
5.  Fill in the **Sorting Order** field.  
6.  Chose the next empty line to create a new cost object, and then repeat steps 2 through 5.  
7.  After you have set up all the cost objects, choose the **Indent Cost Objects** action. Choose the **Yes** button.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  If you have entered definitions in the **Total From/To** fields for **End-Total** cost objects before you run the indent function, then you must enter them again. The function overwrites the values in all **End-Total** fields.

## Defining Cost Centers and Cost Objects for Chart of Accounts

You can automatically transfer the expense and income entries from the general ledger to cost accounting either for each general ledger posting or with a batch job. When you do the transfer, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] only transfers the entries that are already linked to a cost center or a cost object. To establish a meaningful transfer, you must ensure that the cost centers and cost objects are correctly defined.  

### Defining Default Dimension Values for General Ledger Accounts

For each general ledger account, you can define default dimension values in the **Default Dimension** table. The following example shows how to define that there should always be a DEPARTMENT cost center, but never be a PROJECT cost object when posting to a general ledger account.  

|**Dimension Code**|**Value Posting**|  
|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|  
|Department|Code Mandatory|  
|Project|No Code|  

### Defining Dimension Values for Overhead Costs and Direct Costs

 You can transfer overhead costs to a cost center and direct costs to a cost object. The following table shows the optimal combination of the dimension setup values.  

|Transfer To|Cost Center Posting|Cost Object Posting|  
|-----------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|  
|Cost Center|Code Mandatory|No Code|  
|Cost Object|No Code|Code Mandatory|  

> [!NOTE]  
>  To make sure that the predefined cost center and cost object that you set up in the general ledger are automatically carried over to cost accounting, select the **Check G/L Postings** check box on the **Cost Accounting Setup** page.

# Set Up Electronic Document Sending and Receiving

> [!NOTE]
> The content in this article is only applicable for versions of Dynamics 365 Business Central that were released before 2023 release wave 2. In 2023 release wave 2, new functionality for E-Documents is included. To learn more, see [Set up e-documents](finance-how-setup-edocuments.md). 


As an alternative to emailing as file attachments, you can send and receive business documents electronically. By electronic document is meant a standard\-compliant file representing a business document, such as an invoice from a vendor that can be received and converted to a purchase invoice in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The exchange of electronic documents between two trading partners is performed by an external provider of document exchange services. The generic version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports sending and receiving electronic invoices and credit memos in the PEPPOL format, which is supported by the largest providers of document exchange services. A major provider of document exchange services is preconfigured and ready to be set up for your company.  

From PDF or image files representing incoming documents, you can have an external OCR service (Optical Character Recognition) create electronic documents that you can then convert to document records in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], like for electronic PEPPOL documents. For example, when you receive an invoice in PDF format from your vendor, you can send it to the OCR service from the **Incoming Documents** page. After a few seconds, you receive the file back as an electronic invoice that can be converted to a purchase invoice for the vendor. If you send the file to the OCR service by email, then a new incoming document record is automatically created when you receive the electronic document back.  

The **PEPPOL** electronic document format is preconfigured to enable you to send electronic invoices and credit memos in the PEPPOL format. First, you must set up various master data, such as company information, customers, items, and units of measure. These are used to identify the business partners and items when converting data in fields in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to elements in the outgoing document file. Last, you must select the format on the **Electronic Document Format** page for each customer who you will send electronic PEPPOL documents to. For more information, see [Send Electronic Documents](sales-how-to-send-electronic-documents.md).  

The **PEPPOL – Invoice** and **PEPPOL – Credit Memo** data exchange definitions are preconfigured to enable you to receive electronic invoices and credit memos in the PEPPOL format. First, you must set up various master data, such as company information, vendors, items, and units of measure. These are used to identify the business partners and items when converting data in elements in the incoming document file to fields in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Last, you must select the data exchange definition on the **Incoming Documents** page for each incoming electronic document that you want to convert to a purchase document in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

The **OCR – Invoice** data exchange definition is preconfigured to enable you to receive electronic documents that are generated by the OCR service. To receive, for example, an invoice as an electronic OCR document, you set up master date and then process the document just as when receiving an electronic PEPPOL document. For more information, see [Use OCR to Turn PDF and Image Files into Electronic Documents](across-how-use-ocr-pdf-images-files.md).  

The preconfigured services for document exchange and OCR must be enabled before you send or receive. For more information, see [Set Up a Document Exchange Service](across-how-to-set-up-a-document-exchange-service.md).  

The topic contains the following procedures:  

* To set up the company for electronic document sending and receiving

# Database Wait Statistics in [!INCLUDE[prod_long](includes/prod_long.md)]

The administrators and developers can have insights into the database performance by looking at **Database Wait Statistics** in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The information presented by **Database Wait Statistics** can help to check the kind of resources that are being used and the kind of delays that are being faced by the database processes. By analyzing these wait statistics, you can find the root cause of the slow performance by your database and can eventually make better decisions for the application performance.

For more information about the database wait statistics, see [Database Wait Statistics in Dynamics 365 Business Central](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/database-wait-statistics).

# Control add-in resiliency in Business Central

From update 20.0 of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], control add-ins that perform slowly are automatically detected and a dialog similar to the following is displayed.

![Busy control add-in.](media/controladdin-resiliency.png "Busy control add-in.")

An unhealthy control add-in might affect your Business Central experience and cause the page you're working on to start slowly. It has no impact on data and your changes are always saved. If you see the warning as shown above, you can hide it, but it might come back and if the problem persists, you should contact your administrator.

# Multi-language [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] apps for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]

This article describes how to test and use multi-language capabilities in the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] apps for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## Try a [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] app in your language/locale

To try an app in a language, add `language = <culture name>` to the url parameters. For example, this URL shows an app in German:

``` link
https://<your domain>.powerbi.com/groups/a1d27337-134a-4326-99ed-9e68a1485679/reports/3173137b-a485-42e2-a3df-8f3acd7640a6/ReportSection2fa580b0181e8c981cdc?experience=power-bi&language=de-DE
```

## Languages and locales

A culture name is usually a lower-case language identifier and an upper-case locale identifier separated by a hyphen. Here are some examples of culture names:

- **en-US** identifies a user in the United States who speaks English.
- **es-ES** identifies a user in Spain who speaks Spanish.
- **fr-FR** identifies a user in France who speaks French.
- **de-DE** identifies a user in Germany who speaks German.

| language parameter | Language | Locale        |
|--------------------|----------|---------------|
| en-US              | English  | United States |
| es-ES              | Spanish  | Spain         |
| fr-FR              | French   | France        |
| de-DE              | German   | Germany       |

# Cancel production orders that have consumption

Even when production doesn't go as planned, it's important to keep your inventory, cost, and financial records accurate. You can revert consumption or output transactions, return unused raw materials, and correct mistakes in your reported operations. For actual scrap occurrences, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides a process that lets you close orders and write off accumulated WIP.

When you post production transactions by mistake, you probably want to cancel (undo the transactions) and in some cases close the order. To do that, from the **Released Production Order** page, you can open the **Item Ledger entries** or **Capacity Ledger entries** pages and use the **Reverse Production Order Transaction** action.

- For item ledger entries of the type **Consumption**, the action creates item journal lines of the type **Consumption**. For the lines, it copies values from the original transaction, uses the opposite sign in the **Quantity** field, applies to the original entry, and posts the item journal.
- For item ledger entries of the types **Output** or **Capacity**, the action creates item journal lines of the type **Output**. For the lines, it copies values from original transaction, uses the opposite sign in the **Quantity**, **Scrap Quantity**, **Setup Time**, and **Run time** fields, applies to the original entry (only for item ledger entries), and posts the item journal. It also removes the **Finished** status from the related production routing line.

The **Reverse Production Order Transaction** action is only enabled for entries that are related to the production order. It uses the original posting date.

The action isn't supported under the following conditions:

- If the output entry was already applied to an outbound transaction.
- If consumption/output involve warehouse handling. Bins are supported.
- Entries were created through subcontracting purchase orders. You can undo receipt in the Posted Purchase Receipt page.

## Undo subcontracting receipts

You can undo subcontracting receipts before you post them as invoiced. To do so, go to the posted purchase receipt, select the line, and choose the **Undo** action. As a result, an identical line with an opposite sign in the **Quantity** field is created along with the capacity ledger entry. And, if the canceled receipt line is linked to the last routing operation, an item ledger entry of the type **Output**. You can't reverse a receipt if it's invoiced or if the production order is finished.

> [!NOTE]
> If posting a subcontracting receipt caused consumption of components due to the flushing method, the consumption transactions aren't reverted. You must reverse them separately by using an output journal or the **Reverse Production Order Transaction** action.

After you revert and correct the records, you can change the status of the production order to **Finished**. The steps and settings are the same for a scenario where there is no output to allocate accumulated WIP because of actual scrap. To set this up, turn on the **Finish Order Without Output** toggle on the **Manufacturing Setup** page.

> [!NOTE]
> After you turn on the toggle, you can't turn it off again. However, you can decide whether to write-off WIP for each order individually.

When you change the status of a released production order that has consumption or capacity ledger entries but no output, you can turn on the **Allow Finishing Prod. Order with no output** toggle on the **Change production order status** page.

The accumulated WIP amounts are posted to your inventory adjustment account. Remember to fill in the **Inventory Adjustment Account** on the **General Posting Setup** page for the entry defined by:

- The **Gen. Bus. Posting Group** field on the production order.
- The **Gen. Prod. Posting Group** field on the produced item.

## Reopen a finished production order to make corrections

After you complete a production order and set its status to **Finished**, you might discover a mistake. For example, you might find that consumption is missing or the item tracking information is incorrect. To make sure that your inventory and cost transactions are correct, use the **Reopen** action on the **Finished Production Orders** page to make adjustments. However, to protect your data there are a few restrictions:

- You can only reopen an order one time.
- You can't reopen an order that has no output and cost was written off to an adjustment account.

# Put away production or assembly output

How you put away your output from production depends on how your warehouse is set up as a location. Learn more at [Setting Up Warehouse Management](warehouse-setup-warehouse.md).  

In a basic warehouse configuration for the inbound flow (put-away), on the **Location Card** page for the location, activate following settings:

* For production, in the **Prod. Output Whse. Handling** field, select **Inventory Put-away**.
* Assembly processes don't support inventory put-aways. You post an assembly order to register output. If you use bins, you can move items between the bins later. Learn more at [Move Items Ad Hoc in Basic Warehouse Configurations](warehouse-how-to-move-items-ad-hoc-in-basic-warehousing.md).  
* For projects, put-away isn't applicable.

In advanced warehouse configurations where a location requires put-away, create an internal put-away, a movement, or a warehouse put-away to put away the output.  

## Put away production output with an inventory put-away

The first step to put away output is to create the inbound warehouse request. This request informs the warehouse that the production or assembly order output is ready to be put away.

### To create the inbound warehouse request  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Released Production Order**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the production order that's ready for put-away, and then choose the **Create Inbound Whse. Request** action.  

> [!NOTE]  
> You can also create the inbound warehouse request by choosing the **Create Inbound Request** field when you refresh the production order. Learn more at [Refresh or Replan Production Orders](production-how-to-replan-refresh-production-orders.md).  

### To put away output with an inventory put-away  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Inventory Put-away**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Create a new inventory put-away. Learn more at [Put Items Away with Inventory Put-aways](warehouse-how-to-put-items-away-with-inventory-put-aways.md).
3. To access the production order output, choose the **Get Source Documents** action, and then select the released production order.  
4. Fill in the put-away lines as needed.
5. When the lines are ready for posting, choose the **Post** action. Posting creates the warehouse entries and posts the output of the items.  

    [!INCLUDE [preview-posting-warehouse](includes/preview-posting-warehouse.md)]

You can also create an **Inventory Put-away** directly from the released production order. Learn more at [Put Items Away with Inventory Put-aways](warehouse-how-to-put-items-away-with-inventory-put-aways.md).  

When you post an inventory put-away, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] assumes that all the operations are posted according to the standard routing. That is, the output quantity is posted according to the last operation. You can use the output journal to post variances in the output quantity and the setup and run times. If you must post partially after you created the inventory put-away, you can do so on set-up times and quantities for all operations except the last one. The inventory put-away controls the last operation.  

If you only need to post the set-up or run time on the last operation, set the output quantity on the last operation to 0. You can choose not to post the last line at all by deleting it.

## To put away assembly and production output in advanced warehouse configurations

When you post output for a production or assembly order in advanced warehouse configurations, the output goes to the bin defined in the production or assembly order. To learn more about different ways to move items in the warehouse with advanced configurations, go to [Move Items in Advanced Warehouse Configurations](warehouse-how-to-move-items-in-advanced-warehousing.md#to-move-items-with-the-warehouse-movement-worksheet).

> [!NOTE]  
> You can't enter the number of the source document, such as the production order number, in internal put-away or movement documents for assembly or production output.  

You can also use warehouse put-aways for production outputs, which means you can use the same warehouse process for production outputs as you use for other receipts. Using the same process makes things easier because you don't have to switch between different types of document. Also, it's especially valuable for advanced configurations where Directed Put-Away and Pick is enabled because inventory put-away documents aren't available.

To use warehouse put-aways, on the **Location Card** page, in the **Prod. Output Whse. Handling** field, choose **Warehouse Put-away**.

> [!NOTE]
> For locations where Directed Put-away and Pick is enabled, make the field editable and allow the selection of **No warehouse handling** or **Warehouse put-away**. You can't select the **Inventory Put-away** option.
>
> You can't activate warehouse put-away if there are released production orders for the selected location.

When you post production output for a location where the **Prod. Output Whse. Handling** field is set to **Warehouse Put-away** on the **Location Card** page, the warehouse put-away document is either created automatically or you must use the **Warehouse Put-Away Worksheet** page.

If you delete a warehouse put-away, you can manually create a new one using the **Create warehouse put-away** action on the **Release Production Order** or **Finished Prod Order** pages.

> [!NOTE]
> You can't have production order lines with different locations with **Prod. Output Whse. Handling** set to **Warehouse Put-away**. To resolve this issue, use different production orders.
>
> You can't cancel output if there are outstanding or completed put-aways.

# FAQ for bank account reconciliation assist with Copilot

These frequently asked questions (FAQ) describe the AI impact of Microsoft Copilot assistance with bank account reconciliation in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## What is bank reconciliation assist?

Bank reconciliation is a common accounting task where organizations review their bank account statements to identify transactions that should be registered in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For example, this task is used to identify periodic bank fees or small employee expenses.

Bank reconciliation is typically a multi-step process. First, bank statements are imported into [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Next, transactions are matched with ledger entries. Finally, new ledger entries are posted to reflect any residual transactions that weren't previously known to your ledgers.

Copilot in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] reduces the manual effort by matching more transactions and suggesting general ledger (G/L) accounts that you can post to.

## What are the capabilities of bank reconciliation assist?

Copilot provides AI-powered assistance with two distinct tasks:

- Improved matching of transactions with ledger entries

    [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers automated rules that automatically match many bank transactions with ledger entries. However, these rules are inflexible and often result in many unmatched transactions, each of which requires manual inspection and comparison. Copilot uses AI technology to inspect those unmatched transactions and identify more matches, based on the dates, amounts, and descriptions. For example, if a customer paid multiple invoices in one lump sum, Copilot reconciles the single bank statement line with the multiple invoice ledger entries.

- Suggested G/L accounts

    For residual bank transactions that can't be matched to any ledger entries, Copilot uses AI technology to compare the transaction description with G/L account names and then suggest the most likely G/L account to post to. For example, if unmatched transactions have the narrative *Fuel Stop 24*, Copilot might suggest that you post them to the *Transportation* account.

Copilot doesn't connect to your bank to retrieve or send transactions. This task remains fully within your control. It's a prerequisite for using Copilot's assistance, regardless of whether the transactions are added to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] by using a digital bank connection, imported from a bank statement file, or manually entered.

## What is the intended use of bank reconciliation assist?

Bank account reconciliation assist is designed to improve the accuracy of ledgers by helping customers identify new transactions that they should account for in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. It isn't intended for fraud detection or to identify whether customers paid on time.

## How was bank reconciliation assist evaluated? What metrics are used to measure performance?

Bank account reconciliation assist was tested by using combinations of synthetic bank transaction data and similar G/L accounts and ledger entries that cover the typical variations and data limits for each field and in different languages. Test data represents both typical usage and usage by bad actors. Performance was measured in comparison to manual reconciliation of the same data.

## What are the limitations of bank reconciliation assist? How can users minimize the impact of these limitations when they use the system?

Bank account reconciliation assist performs best when G/L account names, ledger entry descriptions, and bank transaction descriptions are all in the same language. Mixed languages or mixed languages for transaction descriptions often result in fewer matches and suggestions.

Suggested ledger accounts performs best in one of the supported languages (see the next section for a list of languages). Users might experience fewer transaction matches and fewer suggested ledger accounts in other languages.

## In which geographies and languages is bank reconciliation assist available? 

[!INCLUDE[copilot-geo-and-language-availability](includes/copilot-geo-and-language-availability.md)]

## What is expected of system users when they operate bank account reconciliation assist?

### During bank account reconciliation

AI-powered matches and suggestions might sometimes be incorrect or incomplete. Users of bank account reconciliation assist must review the accuracy of the matches and suggestions that Copilot provides before they choose to keep them. Copilot's matches and suggestions aren't saved to the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] database until you select the **Keep it** button and close the Copilot window. You can edit and correct any matches or suggestions before you choose to keep them.

### After bank account reconciliation is completed

We recommend that users also verify accuracy and correct any discrepancies after they close the Copilot window. This process should include the following activities:

- Review the reconciliation test report.
- Ensure that your organization has the appropriate review and audit processes in place.
- Reopen any posted reconciliations by using the **Undo** function.
- Correct any erroneous ledger entries through reverse posting of entries.

## What is expected of administrators and system users when they operate bank account reconciliation assist?

System users, such as accountants, treasurers, or other people who work on business accounting, should always review the accuracy of matches and suggestions that Copilot provides before they choose to keep them. After reconciliation with Copilot, we recommend that these users review the reconciliation test report to verify accuracy and identify any discrepancies.

Administrators should ensure that the appropriate accounting users are granted access to this capability.

## Is Copilot the only means of completing bank account reconciliation?

No. Use of Copilot is optional. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers traditional, non-AI-powered means of importing bank statements, running predefined matching rules, and manually applying matches and posting to appropriate ledger accounts. Both the traditional approach and Copilot can be used simultaneously in an organization.

## How do I give feedback about AI-generated content?

Each time that Copilot provides matches or suggestions, you can provide feedback to Microsoft directly from the Copilot window by using the like (thumbs up) and dislike (thumbs down) controls. Your feedback remains anonymous, and we use this data to improve the quality of the service.

# Service Order Status and Repair Status

The **Status** field on the **Service Order** page and the service item repair status, which is represented by the **Repair Status Code** field on the **Service Order** page have a certain relationship in Service Management. The service order status reflects the repair status of all the service items in the service order.  

> [!NOTE]  
> These two status field are not related to the **Release Status** field on the service order header, which determines how the warehouse handles service items.  

Each time the repair status of a service item is changed in a service order, the status of the order is updated. To display the status that reflects the overall repair status of the individual service items, you must specify the following:  

* The service order status that each repair status is linked to.  
* The level of priority of each service order status option.  

When you convert a service quote to a service order, the repair status of each service item is changed in the order to **Initial** and the service order status is changed to **Pending**.  

> [!NOTE]
> Before you can create service orders, you must set up repair statuses and service status priorities. For more information, see [Set Up Statuses for Service Orders and Repairs](service-order-repair-status.md).

## Specifying Service Order Status for Repair Status

Each repair status is linked to a particular service order status. The options for the service order status are as follows:

* **Pending**
* **In Process**
* **On Hold**
* **Finished**

The repair status options are as follows:

* **Initial**
* **In Process**
* **Referred**
* **Partly Serviced**
* **Quote Finished**
* **Waiting for Customer**
* **Spare Part Ordered**
* **Spare Part Received**
* **Finished**  

### Pending

The service order status **Pending** indicates that the service can start or continue at any time. Therefore, the repair status options of **Initial**, **Referred**, **Partly Serviced**, and **Spare Part Received** can be linked to this service order status.  

### In Process

The service order status **In Process** indicates that the service is in process. Therefore, the repair status options **In Process** and **Spare Part Ordered** can both be linked to this service order status. If you link the **Spare Part Ordered** status to an **In Process** service order status, you must also link the **Spare Part Received** status to this service order status.  

### On Hold

The service order status **On Hold** indicates that the service is temporarily on hold because you are waiting for a customer response or spare parts before the service can start. Therefore, the repair status options of **Quote Finished**, **Spare Part Ordered**, and **Waiting for Customer** can be linked to this service order status.  

### Finished

The service order status **Finished** indicates that the service has been completed. Therefore, the **Finished** repair status is linked to this status.  

## Assigning Priority to Service Order Status

When a repair status of a service item is changed, the service order status options linked to the different repair status options of all the service items in the order are identified. If the service items are linked to two or more service order status options, the service order status option with the highest priority is selected.  

You must decide which service order status contains the most important information about the status of the service order and assign that status the highest priority, and so on.  

Then, when you create a new service order and you add service items to it, the **Priority** field on the service order header is updated based on the priorities on the service items.  

### Example

A typical priority level assignment could be as follows:  

* In Process - High  
* Pending - Medium high  
* On Hold - Medium low  
* Finished - Low  

For example, if one service item has the repair status **Initial**, linked to the service order status **Pending**, another has the repair status **In Process**, linked to the service order status **In Process**, and a third has the repair status **Spare Part Ordered**, linked to the service order status **On Hold**, the resulting service order status will be **In Process** because this has the highest priority.

# Work with Intrastat reporting

All companies in the European Union (EU) must report their trade with other EU countries/regions. You must report the movement of goods to the statistics authorities in your country/region every month, and the report must be delivered to the tax authorities. Intrastat is the system for collecting trade statistics of goods within these countries/regions. You use **Intrastat Report** to complete periodic Intrastat reporting (typically monthly), collecting, recording, and reporting trade of goods as per local government legislation.

Intrastat reporting is based on basic EU regulations that apply to all countries/regions; however, in practice, there are some differences within the individual countries/regions. Each country/region has its rules of what exactly and how to report.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This article describes the new Intrastat experience available in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] starting in the 2022 release wave 2, which includes extended features, but if you didn't upgrade your solution, read the previous version's Intrastat setup and usage article at [Set Up and Report Intrastat](finance-how-setup-report-intrastat-v20.md).

> [!NOTE]  
> Intrastat information doesn't apply to the movement of services between countries/regions, but only goods (Items and Fixed Assets). If the local government requires registering  the movement of services between countries/regions, it can be done using the **Service Declaration** feature.
>
> This features is available as an app at [AppSource](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2081646). At that time, to use it, you must first install it on the **Extension Management** page. Learn more about this functionality [here](finance-how-setup-use-service-declaration.md).  

## Fill in the Intrastat report

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Intrastat Report List**, and choose the related link.
2. Choose **New** action to create a new **Intrastat Report**.
3. If you need to enter some internal information about the **Intrastat Report**, fill in this information in the **Description** field.
4. In the **Statistic Period** field, specify the month to report data for. Enter the period as a four-digit number with no spaces or symbols. Depending on your country/region, enter either the month first and then the year, or vice versa. For example, enter either *2206* or *0622* for June 2022.
5. Choose the **Suggest Lines** action. The **Starting Date** and **Ending Date** fields will already contain the dates specified for the statistics period on the Intrastat report header.
6. In the **Cost Regulation %** field, you can enter a percentage to cover transport and insurance. If you enter a percentage, the content of the **Statistical Value** field in the journal is proportionally higher. But if you want to use this feature, you must switch the **Amount incl. Item Charges** field to **Yes**.
7. You can eventually set up extra configurations on the **Additional** FastTab:
   1. **Skip Recalculation for Zero Amounts** to specify that lines without amounts won't be recalculated during the batch job.
   2. **Skip Zero Amounts** to specify that item ledger entries without amounts won't be included in the batch job.
   3. **Skip Non-Invoiced Entries** to specify if item ledger entries that are shipped or received but not yet invoiced must be excluded from the process.
8. Choose **OK** to start the batch job.

The batch job retrieves all the item entries in the statistics period and inserts them as lines in the **Intrastat Report** lines. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

## Modify the Intrastat report

If needed, you can modify the lines, but whenever you change a value in the Intrastat report line, the **Correction** field will be automatically marked as **Yes**. Eventually, you can add a new line manually if there's a reason for that. To add a new line manually:

1. On the **Intrastat Report** page, choose the **New Line** action in the **Lines** FastTab.
2. Choose the **Receipt** or **Shipment** option in the **Type** field.
3. In the **Source Type** field, choose one of the sources: **Item Entry**, **FA Entry**, or **Job Entry**.
4. Based on the **Source Type** in the **Item No.** field, you can choose an **Item** (in both cases, **Item Entry** or **Job Entry**) or **Fixed Assets**.
5. Fill in other fields as you need for the Intrastat reporting.

> [!NOTE]  
> When you manually add a new line to the Intrastat report, the **Date** field in the line must be inside the **Statistic Period** range you added on the header.

## Validate Intrastat lines

After you fill in the **Intrastat Report**, you can run the **Checklist Report** action to ensure that all information in the **Intrastat Report** is correct. Mandatory fields you have set on Intrastat Report Checklist page that is missing values will be shown in **Errors and warning** FactBox on the **Intrastat Report** page.

Run the **Intrastat Report Checklist** report to check Intrastat lines before they're exported to the required format. The check is run inside the **Intrastat Report**.

## Recalculate weight or supplementary unit of measure

If you got the error message *'Total Weight' in Intrastat Report Line must not be blank*, it's probably because you didn't set the **Net Weight** field on the used source, item, or fixed asset. In this case, search for the item or fixed asset card and add the required value. After that, you just need to reopen the **Intrastat Report** and follow these steps:

1. Choose the **Recalc. Weight/Suppl. UOM** action to recalculate the **Total Weight** and/or **Supplementary Quantity**.
2. Choose one of the options:

    1. **Weight** – to recalculate only the **Total Weight**, based on the current information about **Net Weight** on the item and fixed asset cards.
    2. **Supplemental UOM Qty** – to recalculate only the **Supplementary Quantity** on the **Intrastat Report** line if it exists, based on the current information about **Supplementary UOM** on the item and fixed asset cards.
    3. **Both** – to recalculate both **Total Weight** and **Supplementary Quantity**, based on the current information on the item and fixed asset cards.
3. Choose **OK** to start the batch job.

## Report Intrastat in a file

You can submit the Intrastat report as a file based on different local authorities' requirements. Before creating the file, you should run the **Checklist Report** to check if all lines contain all necessary and valid information. To create a file:

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Intrastat List**, then choose the related link.
2. Choose **Intrastat Report** you want to report as a file.
3. If you haven't already done this, fill in the **Intrastat Report** manually or choose the **Suggest Lines** action.
4. Choose the **Create File** action.
5. The Intrastat file will be saved in the required format.

Once you create the file, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will automatically fill in the following details about reporting:

* The **Export Date** to specify the date when the report has been exported.
* The **Export Time** to specify the time when the report has been exported.

> [!NOTE]  
> Next time you create a file, the **Export Date** and **Export Time** fields will only keep information about the last file you created.

## Intrastat rules

### Grouping lines

In **Intrastat Report** lines, there's no grouping by any fields. All entries are copied from the original source, so you can quickly locate them based on the combination of **Source Type** and **Source Entry No**.

Grouping required by authorities will be provided in the exported file. You need to configure this in the **Data Exchange Definition**, which is fully configurable. Learn more at [Set Up Data Exchange Definitions](across-how-to-set-up-data-exchange-definitions.md).

### Fixed assets reporting

Fixed assets will be shown in the Intrastat lines only if:

* The **FA Posting Type** in the **FA Ledger Entry** field is **Acquisition Cost** and if the **Document Type** is **Invoice** in the case of purchases, and
* The **FA Posting Type** in the **FA Ledger Entry** field is **Proceeds on Disposal** and if the **Document Type** is **Invoice** in the case of sales.

### Intrastat report statuses

When you work with the **Intrastat Report** you'll see a **Status** field on the document header. You can find the following statuses together with related rules:

* **Open**: This status is created automatically when you create a new Intrastat report and you can make all operations in this status.
* **Released**: [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically changes the status to *Released* when you create a file. From that moment, you can't modify your **Intrastat Report**. If you need to change something and report again, you can use the **Reopen** action to reopen the Intrastat report. Once the document is reopened, you can use the **Release** action to release the document again.
* **Reported**: Specifies whether the entry has already been reported to the tax authorities. This isn't a regular status but an independent field, and even if you reopened the Intrastat report, it would still show that the file is already created for this report.

### Locations in Intrastat reporting 

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] always uses the information in the **Country/Region Code** field on the **Location Card** page as the country for **send from** or for **receive to** goods. When this information doesn't exist or location wasn't used, the system uses the information from the **Company Information** page.   

> [!NOTE]  
> If the company operates from more than one country, Intrastat reporting desn't work for all countries where locations are configured. Reporting is based only for the main country, as it's not currently possible to use multi-country reporting.  

### Triangular trade in Intrastat

Triangular trade involves trade between three countries or regions where goods bypass the reporting company's country. In Business Central, this can be facilitated through the [Drop Shipment](sales-how-drop-shipment.md) functionality. To enable this option, activate the **Include Drop Shipment** field in the **Intrastat Report Setup**.  

When you enable this option, the system uses the following rules, but only if you have the **Drop Shipment** marked in the **Sales Order**: 

| Receiving from | Delivering to | Expected Intrastat Result |
|----------|------------|----------------------|
| Country as in the **Company Information** | Country as in the **Company Information** | No Intrastat lines |  
| Country as in the **Company Information** | EU country different from the country in the **Company Information** | Intrastat shipping line | 
| Country as in the **Company Information** | Non-EU country | No Intrastat lines |   
| EU country different from the country in the **Company Information** | Country as in the **Company Information** | Intrastat receiving line | 
| EU country different from the country in the **Company Information** | EU country different from the country in the **Company Information** | No Intrastat lines |
| EU country different from the country in the **Company Information** | Non-EU country | No Intrastat lines | 
| Non-EU country | Country as in the **Company Information** | No Intrastat lines |  
| Non-EU country | EU country different from the country in the **Company Information** | No Intrastat lines |
| Non-EU country | Non-EU country | No Intrastat lines |

# Track Relations Between Demand and Supply

From any supply or demand document in the so-called order network, you can track the order demand (tracked quantity), forecast, blanket sales order, or planning parameter (untracked quantity) that has given rise to the planning line in question.

The planning worksheets also offers supporting planning information about non-order entities to help the planner obtain an optimal supply plan. For more information, see [Untracked Planning Elements](production-how-track-demand-supply.md#untracked-planning-elements).

## To track linked items
Order tracking shows how sales orders, production orders, and purchase orders are related to the manufacturing order through the planning and reservation systems.

The following describes how to track linked items on a firm planned production order. The steps are similar for all other order types, and from planning worksheet lines.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Firm Planned Prod. Order**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the relevant firm planned production order from the list.
3. On the **Lines** FastTab, choose the **Functions** action, and then choose the **Order Tracking** action.

The lines in the **Order Tracking** display the documents that are related to the current production order line.

## Untracked Planning Elements
The **Untracked Planning Elements** page opens when you choose the **Untracked Qty.** field on the **order Planning** page. It serves two purposes:

1. To hold information about untracked quantities displayed when the user looks up from the Order Tracking page to see untracked quantities.
2. To hold warning messages displayed when the user chooses the **Warning** icon on the **Planning Worksheet** page.

The page contains entries which account for an untracked surplus quantity in order tracking network. These entries are generated during the planning run and explain where the untracked surplus quantity in the order tracking lines came from. This untracked surplus can come from:

- Production forecast
- Blanket orders
- Safety stock quantity
- Reorder point
- Maximum inventory
- Reorder quantity
- Maximum order quantity
- Minimum order quantity
- Order multiple
- Dampener (% of lot size)

# Plan for New Demand Order by Order

This planning task can be performed on the **Order Planning** page, which displays all new demand along with availability information and suggestions for supply. It provides the visibility and tools needed to effectively plan demand from sales lines and component lines and then create different types of supply orders directly.  

You can enter the **Order Planning** page in two ways depending on your focus: From an order that you want to plan for specifically or in batch mode because you want to plan for all and any new demand.  


## To plan for new production order demand

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Planned Production Orders**, and then choose the related link. (You can perform these steps for planned, firm planned, or released production orders).
2. Open the production order you want to plan for, and then choose the **Planning** action.  
3. On the **Order Planning** page, choose the **Calculate Plan** action.  

The page displays planning lines according to the view filter **Production Demand**, meaning unfulfilled component lines of all existing production orders. Demand for only the one production order is not shown because it is necessary to plan for one production order with an overview of demand for potentially earlier components lines. Planning lines for the production order in context are expanded.  

## To plan for any new demand

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Order Planning**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Order Planning** page, choose the **Calculate Plan** action.
3. Choose the **Expand (+)** button in front of the date in the **Demand Date** field to see the underlying planning lines that represent demand lines with insufficient availability.  
4. For each expanded planning line, that is, demand line, you can see values in information fields at the bottom of the page.  

    |Option|Description|  
    |----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Qty. on Other Locations**|Shows if the item exists on another location. You can then look up and select it.|  
    |**Substitutes Exist**|Shows if a substitute item is created for the item. You can then look up and select it. Note that this feature only applies to components, that is, from demand lines of type **Production**.|  
    |**Quantity Available**|Shows the total availability of the item, that is, the Projected Available Balance.|  
    |**Earliest Date Available**|Shows the arrival date of an inbound supply order that can cover the needed quantity on a date later than the demand date.|  

5. In the **Replenishment System** field, select which type of supply order to create.  

    The default value is that of the item card, or SKU card, but you can change it to one of three options:  

    |Option|Description|  
    |----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Purchase**|Creates a purchase order.|  
    |**Transfer**|Creates a transfer order.|  
    |**Prod. Order**|Creates a production order.|  

    In the **Supply From** field you must select a value according to the selected replenishment system.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  If the field is not filled in, the system will display an error message when you use the **Make Supply Order** function, and no supply order will be created for the planning line in question. This, however, is not the case if the replenishment system is **Prod. Order**.  

6. From the **Supply From** field, you can look up in the relevant list and select where the supply should come from:  

    - If replenishment system is **Purchase**, the look-up button in this field looks up on the **Item Vendor Catalog** page.  
    - If replenishment system is **Transfer**, the look-up button in this field looks up on the **Location List** page.  

    In case the item exists in another location, the **Qty. on Other Location** field at the bottom shows a value and you can then look up and select the location from which the item should be supplied when you make the transfer order.  

    If a substitute exists for the demanded item, the **Substitute Exists** field is set to **Yes**, and you can then look up to the **Item Substitution Entries** page and select the substitute.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > Be aware that item substitutions will not automatically cause an item to be replaced by another item, for example when creating a sales order or in a BOM. Instead, you will be alerted to the fact that a substitution is available to you.

7. Select the **Reserve** check box if you want to make a reservation between the supply order you are creating and the demand line that it is created for. It is empty by default.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  You can only select this check box if the item has **Optional** or **Always** in the **Reserve** field on its item card.  

8. In the **Qty. to Order** field, you can enter the quantity that will go on the supply order you are creating.   
    The default value is the same quantity as that in the **Needed Quantity** field. But you may decide to order more or less than this quantity based on your knowledge of the demand situation. If, for example, you see on the **Order Planning** page that several unrelated demand lines are for the same purchased item, and they are due around the same date, you can consolidate these by entering the total needed quantity in the **Qty. to Order** field of one line, and then delete the other, obsolete planning lines for that item.  

9. In the **Due Date** and **Order Date** fields, you can enter the dates that should apply to the created supply orders.  

    These two fields are interrelated according to the **Default Safety Lead Time** field, which can be found on the **Manufacturing Setup** page. By default, the due date is the same as the demand date, but you can change this as you like.  

> [!NOTE]  
> If you enter a date later than the demand date, you will receive a warning message.  

## To make supply orders

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Planned Production Orders**, and then choose the related link. You can perform these steps for a planned, firm planned, or released production order.  
2. Open the production order you want to plan for, and then choose the **Planning** action.  
3. Place the cursor on a relevant planning line, and then choose the **Make Orders** action.  
4. On the **Make Supply Orders** page, on the **Order Planning** FastTab, in the **Make Orders for** field, select one of the following options.  

    |Option|Description|  
    |----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**The Active Line**|Make a supply order only for the line where the cursor is placed.|  
    |**The Active Order**|Make supply orders for all lines in the order where the cursor is placed.|  
    |**All Lines**|Make supply orders for all lines on the **Order Planning** page.|  

5. On the **Options** FastTab, define what kind of supply orders, or requisition worksheet lines, should be made.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  The settings you last made on the **Make Supply Orders** page will be saved under your user ID so that they are the same the next time you use the page.  

6. Choose the **OK** button to make the suggested supply orders or requisition worksheet lines.  

You have now planned for the unfulfilled demand by making respective supply orders. Details about specific work flows when using the **Order Planning** page would depend on a company’s internal policies.  

When you have finished your planning work on the **Order Planning** page, for example defined an alternative way to supply the quantity, you can proceed to create supply orders for one or more of the planning lines.  

> [!NOTE]  
> The supply orders you create may introduce new dependent demand, for example for underlying production orders, and you should therefore choose **Calculate Plan** again to find and resolve this before moving down the list.

# The QuickBooks Payroll file import extension
Use the QuickBooks Payroll File Import extension to import payroll transactions from QuickBooks to general ledger accounts in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For example, this is useful when you're transitioning from QuickBooks to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], or if you outsource your payroll but also want to keep track of it in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## Steps to import payroll data
The first step is for you, or maybe your accountant, to use the export features in QuickBooks to export the payroll data to an .IIF file. The second step is to open the **General Journals** page in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and use the **Import Payroll Transactions** action to import the file. During the import process, you map the general ledger accounts from QuickBooks to corresponding accounts in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The final step is to post the payroll transactions in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] according to the account mapping. 

For more information, see [Import Payroll Transactions](finance-how-import-payroll-transactions.md).

# Azure OpenAI Service and Business Central data 

Copilot in Business Central uses AI from the Azure OpenAI Service, hosted and operated by Microsoft and built with enterprise-grade security, privacy, and compliance controls. This article explains the data that the service processes when you use Copilot.

## How Business Central communicates with Azure OpenAI Service

Each time you use Copilot, your inputs (prompts) and outputs (results), including any data needed for Copilot to perform the task, are sent to the Azure OpenAI Service endpoint.

- Each request to Copilot, such as a chat message or a request to match records, is converted to one or more service calls to the endpoint.
- Prompts, results, and data from any one call is never shared or accessible to other calls by other users of the service. Including business data with prompts improves the quality of Copilot responses by grounding them in the latest information from the Business Central database. Business Central selects this data and retrieves it using Business Central's standard mechanisms for data access, ensuring that Copilot can only access the same data as the user operating Copilot. Copilot has no way to circumvent Business Central’s security, privacy, and compliance controls.  
- User input and business data might include personal information, depending on the task.
- Prompt and output data might be stored for up to 24 hours to monitor for abuse, but Microsoft only reviews the data if the automated systems flag it for review.
- Microsoft doesn't use your data to train, retrain, or improve Azure OpenAI Service foundation models.

> [!NOTE]
> When administrators activate a Copilot feature or enable data movement to Azure OpenAI Service, the entire company database remains in its location:
>
> - It isn't transferred to the Azure OpenAI Service.
> - It isn't moved to another geographic region.
> - AI isn't trained on that data.  

## Example Copilot features and their data flow

For a high-level understanding of the data sent to Azure OpenAI Service, the following table provides three examples of how Business Central sends prompts and data to the service.

The table isn't an exhaustive list of features and doesn't provide a complete and accurate picture of every data point sent to the service.

|Copilot feature|Example of user interaction|Example of data sent to Azure OpenAI Service|
|-|-|-|
|Chat|User asks Copilot to "show customer Adatum" |<ul><li>System instructions to interpret and act on the user's message, including system-defined constraints and AI safeguards.</li><li>The list of most likely table and page names, the list of available field names for those objects, along with descriptive information such as teaching tips and tooltips.</li></ul>| 
|Analysis assist|While viewing the Items list, the user asks Copilot to display "items by category" |<ul><li>System instructions to generate an analysis tab, constraints, and AI safeguards.</li><li>The list of column captions from the Items list, along with tooltips and similar descriptive information.</li><li>If the list includes option fields with predefined values, the possible values are included</li></ul>|
|Bank account reconciliation assist|User activates the **Reconcile** Copilot action on the details page |<ul><li>System instructions to compare records, constraints, and AI safeguards.</li><li>The list of bank statement lines (transaction descriptions, dates, and amounts) that the user requested Copilot to process. Additionally, the minimal list of bank account ledger entry records or G/L account names they're compared with.</li></ul>|

# Set up approval users

Before you can create workflows that involve approval steps, you must set up the users who are involved in approval processes on the **Approval User Setup** page. You can also set amount limits for different types of requests, define substitute approvers, and set up notifications.  

After you set up approval users, you can create workflow responses for approval workflows. Learn more at [Create Approval Workflows](across-how-to-create-workflows.md).  

> [!TIP]
> You can require that multiple approvers react to an approval request by creating a group of approvers on the **Workflow User Group** page. Learn more at [Set Up Workflow User Groups](across-how-to-set-up-workflow-users.md).  

## To set up an approval user

[!INCLUDE [workflow-requestor-approver](includes/workflow-requestor-approver.md)]

# Adjust item costs

The cost of an item (inventory value) that you purchase and later sell might change during its lifetime, for example because a freight cost is added to its purchase cost after you sell the item. Cost adjustment is especially relevant in situations where you sell goods before you invoice the purchase of those goods. To always know the correct inventory value, you should regularly adjust item costs. Correct costs help ensure that sales and profit statistics are up to date and that financial KPIs are correct. To learn more, go to [Design Details: Cost Adjustment](design-details-cost-adjustment.md).

The value in the **Unit Cost** field on the item card is based on the standard cost for items with the Standard costing method. For items with any other costing method, the value is based on the calculation of available inventory (invoiced costs and expected costs) divided by the quantity on hand.

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], item costs are automatically adjusted every time that an inventory transaction occurs, such as when posting a purchase invoice for an item. However, you can also manually adjust the costs of one or more items if needed. For example, manual adjustments are useful when you know that item costs are changed for reasons other than item transactions.

For both automatic and manual adjustments, item costs are adjusted by the FIFO or the Average costing method, depending on your selection in the **Set Up My Company** assisted setup guide or in the **Costing Method** field on the item card. To learn more, go to [Register New Items](inventory-how-register-new-items.md).  

For the FIFO costing method, an item’s unit cost is the actual value of any receipt of the item. Inventory is valued with the assumption that the first items placed in inventory are sold first.

If you use the Average costing method, then an item’s unit cost is calculated as the average unit cost at each point in time after a purchase. Inventory is valuated with the assumption that all inventories are sold simultaneously. For items that use this costing method, you can choose the **Unit Cost** field on the item card to view the history of transactions that the average cost is calculated from

Cost adjustment processes only value entries that aren't adjusted. In a situation where changed inbound costs need to be forwarded to related outbound entries, it creates new adjustment value entries. The adjustment value entries are based on the information in the original value entries but contain the adjustment amount. The cost adjustment function uses the posting date of the original value entry in the adjustment entry, unless that date is in a closed inventory period. In that case, application uses the starting date of the next open inventory period. If inventory periods aren't used, then the date in the **Allow Posting From** field on the **General Ledger Setup** page defines when the adjustment entry is posted.

## To adjust item costs manually

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Adjust Cost - Item Entries**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** page, specify which items to adjust costs for.
3. Choose the **OK** button.

## Track item cost adjustments

Item costs can change for many reasons, so it's important that you can keep track of cost adjustments. Use the **Inventory Cost Adjustment** page to manage and monitor the cost adjustment process. This page displays items along with their costing parameters and cost adjustment status. You can filter the list to focus on items that require adjustment or that are excluded from the cost adjustment process. To learn more about tracking cost adjustments, go to [Track item cost adjustments](finance-track-inventory-costs.md).

# Set up calculations and posting methods for value-added tax

Consumers and businesses pay value-added tax (VAT) when they purchase goods or services. The amount of VAT to pay can vary, depending on several factors. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you set up VAT to specify the rates used to calculate tax amounts based on the following parameters:

* Who you sell to  
* Who you buy from  
* What you sell  
* What you buy  

You can set up VAT calculations manually, but that can be tricky and time-consuming. It's easy to use different VAT rates by mistake and create inaccurate VAT-related reports. To make VAT set up easier, we recommend you use the **VAT Setup** assisted setup guide.

However, if you want to set up the VAT calculations yourself, or just want to learn about each step, this article contains descriptions of each step.

> You can use the **VAT Setup** guide only if you have created a *My Company* and haven't posted transactions that include VAT. To learn more about a My Company, go to [Create new companies in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]](about-new-company.md).

To start the assisted setup guide, follow these steps:

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon and enter **Assisted Setup**. 
2. Choose **Set up Value-Added Tax (VAT)** and complete the steps.
3. After you complete the assisted setup, go to the **VAT Posting Setup** page to check whether you need to fill in more fields according to the local requirements in your version of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Learn more at [Local functionality in Business Central](about-localization.md).  

### Check the VAT posting setup

To support your fast start, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] notifies you of missing general ledger (G/L) accounts in posting groups or posting setups, such as on the **VAT Posting Setup** page. You can turn this type of notification on or off using the **G/L Account is missing in posting group or setup** notification in the **My Notifications** page. Just go to the **My settings** page, and then choose the **Change when I receive notifications** link.  

If you choose the notification, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates posting setups based on the posting groups in the document or journal you're currently working on.  

At this point, you can just fill in the missing G/L accounts. But, when you further refine your setup later, you might realize your initial setup is wrong. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't allow you to delete a VAT posting setup and general posting setup after they're used to create entries. To prevent people from mistakenly using a setup that's no longer relevant for new postings, you can use the **Blocked** field on the **General Posting Setup** page.

## Set up a default VAT date for documents and journals

VAT reporting in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is based on the **VAT Date** to include VAT entries on VAT reports in a VAT period. The VAT date can be changed on all documents and journals, but you must specify a default value for VAT date.

> [!NOTE]
> After posting the document or journal, the **VAT Date** will appear on **VAT Entries** and **G/L Entries** as well as on the posted document if exists.

To set up a default value for a VAT date, follow these steps:

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon and enter **General Ledger Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **General** FastTab, in the **Default VAT Date** field, choose either **Posting Date** or **Document Date**.
3. Close the page.  

> [!NOTE]
> By default, the **Default VAT Date** is the **Posting Date**.

### Enable or disable the VAT Date feature

Some countries/regions require that businesses use a specific VAT date, but other countries/regions don't. Some countries/regions also require businesses to change the VAT date in specific situations after they post documents, but other countries/regions don't allow changes to VAT dates. To allow for different contexts, you can choose whether you want to use this functionality and, if so, to what degree.

To set up the level of VAT date usage, follow these steps:

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon and enter **General Ledger Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **General** FastTab, in the **VAT Date Usage** field, specify the degree to which you want to use the VAT date feature. You can choose one of the following options:

   | Type | Description |
   |--------------------|-----------------------------------------|
   | **Use full VAT Date functionality** | Everything related to **VAT Date** works by default, giving you the maximum **VAT Date** functionality. You can set up the date, change it in documents, report based on it, and modify the date after posting as long as the period isn't closed or protected with allowed dates for posting. |
   | **Use but do not allow modifications** | Everything related to **VAT Date** works by default with one exception. You can't modify the **VAT Date** in **VAT Entries**. |
   | **Not using VAT Date functionality** | [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] hides and makes the **VAT Date** fields unavailable on documents, journals, and entries. The **Default VAT Date** is configured as the **Posting Date**. |

3. Close the page.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Even if you choose the **Not using VAT Date functionality** option, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will use the **VAT Date** in the background. Because the **Default VAT Date** is configured as the **Posting Date**, and you can't change it in this case, you'll get the same experience as without this feature. **VAT Date** fields will be removed from all pages, but this field will still exist in tables and reports will work based on it.

### Limiting periods for posting and changing the VAT date

You can prevent people from posting or changing VAT entries in specific date ranges. You set the restriction using two settings:

* Based on closed **VAT Return Period**
* Based on the **Allow Posting From** and **Allow Posting To** fields.

#### To limit posting based on VAT return period

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the TellF Me feature 1.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Ledger Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **General** FastTab, in the **Control VAT Period** field, specify the degree of VAT Return Period control. The following table describes the options.

| Type | Description |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **Block posting within closed and warn for released period** | Prevent people from posting a document or journal, or changing VAT entries that have a VAT date within a closed **VAT Return Period**. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] also shows a warning if your **VAT Return Period** is open, but the status of **VAT Return** is **Released** or **Submitted**. |
| **Block posting within closed period** | Prevent people from posting a document or journal, or changing vat entries that have a VAT date within the closed **VAT Return Period**. |
| **Warn when posting in closed period** | Show a warning, but don't block posting, if you want to post a document or journal that has a VAT date within a closed **VAT Return Period**. |
| **Disabled** | Take no action based on a closed **VAT Return Period**. |

#### Limit posting based on Allow from/to period

> [!NOTE]
> As of Business Central version 23.1, this control is changed. In earlier versions, there was only one control on the **General Ledger Setup** page for both Posting Date and VAT Date. Now, these controls are split, so control in the **General Ledger Setup** page is for the **Posting Date** only and control in the **VAT Setup** page is for the **VAT Date** only. There are also new date controls in the **User Setup** page.  

##### Version 23.1 or newer

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When you upgrade to a newversion, be aware that values are upgraded in the new **Allow VAT Date From/To** in the **VAT Setup** page based on the values in **Allow Posting From/To** in the **General Ledger Setup**. If you want to use different date controls, open the **VAT Setup** page and make changes.  

You can set up limitations on the company or at specific user levels.

To limit all postings for the whole company:

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Setup**, and then select the related link.  
2. On the **VAT Date** FastTab, in the **Allow VAT Date From** field, specify the VAT date from which you allow posting. Posting a document or journal with a VAT date before this date isn't allowed.  
3. On the **VAT Date** FastTab, in the **Allow VAT Date To** field, specify the VAT date until which you allow posting. Posting a document or journal with a VAT date after this date isn't allowed. 

To limit postings for the specific user:  

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **User Setup**, and then select the related link.  
2. In the **User ID** field, specify the user allowed to post in a specific period.  
3. In the **Allow VAT Date From** field, specify the VAT date from which you allow posting. Posting a document or journal with a VAT date before this date isn't allowed. 
4. In the **Allow VAT Date To** field, specify the VAT date until which you allow posting. Posting a document or journal with a VAT date after this date isn't allowed.  

##### Versions before 23.1 

You can set up limitation on the company or specific user levels.

To limit all postings for the whole company:

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Ledger Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **General** FastTab, in the **Allow Posting From** field, specify the VAT date from which you allow posting. Posting a document or journal with a VAT date before this date isn't allowed.  
3. On the **General** FastTab, in the **Allow Posting To** field, specify the VAT date until which you allow posting. Posting a document or journal with a VAT date after this date isn't allowed.

To limit postings for the specific user:

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **User Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. In the **User ID** field, specify the user allowed to post in specific period.  
3. In the **Allow Posting From** field, specify the VAT date from which you allow posting. Posting a document or journal with a VAT date before this date isn't allowed.
4. In the **Allow Posting To** field, specify the VAT date until which you allow posting. Posting a document or journal with a VAT date after this date isn't allowed.

## Set up VAT registration numbers for your country/region

To help ensure people enter valid VAT registration numbers, you can define formats for the VAT registration numbers that are used in the countries/regions in which you do business. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] displays an error message if someone makes a mistake or uses a format that is incorrect for the country/region.

To set up VAT registration numbers, follow these steps:

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 2.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Countries/Regions**.
2. Choose the country or region, and then choose the **VAT Reg. No. Formats** action.
3. In the **Formats** field, define the format by entering one or more of the following characters:  

* **#** Requires a single-digit number.  
* **@** Requires a letter. This format isn't case-sensitive.  
* **?** Allows any character.  

    > [!TIP]
    > You can use other characters as long as they are always present in the country or region format. So, if you need to include a period or a hyphen between sets of numbers, you can define the format as ##.####.### or @@-###-###.  

## Set up VAT business posting groups

VAT business posting groups should represent the markets in which you do business with customers and vendors, and define how to calculate and post VAT in each market. Examples of VAT business posting groups are **Domestic** and **European Union (EU)**.  

Use codes that are easy to remember and describe the business posting group, such as **EU**, **Non-EU**, or **Domestic**. Each code must be unique, meaning you can set up as many codes as you need, but you can't have the same code more than once in a table.

To set up a VAT business posting group, follow these steps:

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 3.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Business Posting Groups**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary.

You can set up default VAT business posting groups by linking them to general business posting groups. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically assigns the VAT business posting group when you assign the business posting group to a customer, vendor, or general ledger account.

## Set up VAT product posting groups

VAT product posting groups represent the items and resources you buy or sell, and determine how to calculate and post VAT according to the type of item or resource.

It's a good idea to use codes that are easy to remember and describe the rate, such as **NO-VAT** or **Zero**, **VAT10** or **Reduced** for 10 percent VAT, and **VAT25** or **Standard** for 25 percent.

To set up a VAT business posting group, follow these steps:

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 4.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Product Posting Groups**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary.

## Combine VAT posting groups in VAT posting setups

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates VAT amounts on sales and purchases based on VAT posting setups, which are combinations of VAT business and product posting groups. For each combination, you can specify the VAT percent, VAT calculation type, and general ledger accounts for posting VAT for sales, purchases, and reverse charges. You can also specify whether to recalculate VAT when a payment discount is applied or received.  

Set up as many combinations as you need. To group VAT posting setup combinations with similar attributes, define a **VAT Identifier** for each group, and assign the identifier to the group members.  

> [!NOTE]
> A **VAT Identifier** is a code you can use to group similar attributes. We recommend you use different VAT identifiers for different VAT percentages.  

To combine VAT posting setups, follow these steps:

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 5.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Posting Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

## Assign VAT posting groups by default to multiple entities

If you want to apply the same VAT posting groups to multiple entities, you can set up [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to do so by default.

* You can assign VAT business posting groups to general business posting groups, or customer or vendor templates.
* You can assign VAT product posting groups on general product posting groups.  

The VAT business or product posting group is assigned when you choose a business or product posting group for a customer, vendor, item, or resource.

## Assign VAT posting groups to accounts, customers, vendors, items, and resources

The following sections describe how to assign VAT posting groups to individual entities.

### To assign VAT posting groups to individual general ledger accounts

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 6.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Chart of Accounts**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the **G/L Account Card** for the account.  
3. On the **Posting** FastTab, in the **Gen. Posting Type** field, choose either **Sale** or **Purchase**.  
4. Choose the VAT posting groups to use for the sales or purchase account.  

### To assign VAT business posting groups to customers and vendors

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 7.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customer** or **Vendor**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Customer** or **Vendor** card, expand the **Invoicing** FastTab.  
3. Choose the **VAT Bus. Posting Group**.  

### To assign VAT product posting groups to individual items and resources

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 8.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Item** or **Resource**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Do one of the following steps:  

    * On the **Item** card, expand the **Price & Posting** FastTab, and then choose **Show more** to display the **VAT Prod. Posting Group** field.  
    * On the **Resource** card, expand the **Invoicing** FastTab.  
3. Choose the VAT product posting group.  

## Set up clauses to explain VAT exemption or nonstandard VAT rates

You set up a VAT clause to describe information about the type of VAT that is being applied. Government regulations might require this information. After you set up a VAT clause and associate it with a VAT posting setup, the VAT clause displays on printed sales documents that use the VAT posting group setup.

If needed, you can also specify how to translate VAT clauses to other languages. When you create and print a sales document that contains a VAT identifier, the document includes the translated VAT clause. The language code specified on the customer card determines the language.

When you use nonstandard VAT rates in different types of documents, such as invoices or credit memos, you might have to include an exemption text (VAT clause). The exemption text states why you calculated a reduced VAT or zero VAT rate. You can define different VAT clauses to include on business documents for each type of document on the **VAT Clauses by Document Type** page.

You can modify or delete a VAT clause, and your modifications are reflected in a generated report. However, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't keep a history of the change. On the report, the VAT clause descriptions are printed and displayed for all lines in the report alongside the VAT amount and the VAT base amount. If a VAT clause isn't defined for any lines on the sales document, the whole section is omitted when you print the report.

### To set up VAT clauses

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 9.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Clauses**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **VAT Clauses** page, create a new line.  
3. In the **Code** field, enter an identifier for the clause. You use this code to assign the clause to VAT posting groups.  
4. In the **Description** field, enter the VAT exemption text that you want to display on documents that can include VAT. In the **Description 2** field, enter more text, if needed. The text is displayed on new document lines.
5. Choose the **Description by document type** action.
6. On the **VAT Clauses by Document Type** page, fill in the fields to set up which VAT exemption text to display for which document type.  
7. Optional: To assign the VAT clause to a VAT posting setup right away, choose **Setup**, and then choose the clause. If you want to wait, you can assign the clause later on the **VAT Posting Setup** page.  
8. Optional: To specify how to translate the VAT clause, choose the **Translations** action.

### To assign a VAT clause to a VAT posting setup

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 10.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Posting Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. In the **VAT Clause Code** column, choose the clause to use for each VAT posting setup it applies to.  

### To specify translations for VAT clauses

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 11.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Clauses**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **Translations** action.  
3. In the **Language Code** field, choose the language you're translating to.  
4. In the **Description** and **Description 2** fields, enter the translations of the descriptions. This text displays in the translated VAT report documents.  

### To specify extended text for VAT clauses

> [!NOTE]  
> If your country or region requires longer text for the VAT clauses than the default version supports, you can specify the longer text for the VAT clauses as *extended text* so that it prints on the sales and purchase reports.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 11.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Clauses**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **Extended Texts** action.  
3. Choose the **New** action.  
4. Fill in the **Language Code** and **Description** fields.  
5. Optionally, select the **All Language Codes** field, or specify the relevant language in the **Language Code** field if you use language codes.  
6. Fill in the **Starting Date** and **Ending Date** fields if you want to limit the dates on which the extended text is used.  
7. In the **Text** lines, write the extended text for your VAT clauses.  
8. Select the relevant fields for the document types where you want the extended text printed.  
9. Close the page.  

## Create a VAT posting setup to handle Import VAT

Use the *Import VAT* feature when you need to post a document where the entire amount is VAT. You use this feature if you receive an invoice from the tax authorities for VAT for imported goods.  

To set up codes for import VAT, follow these steps:  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 12.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Product Posting Groups**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the VAT Product Posting Groups page, set up a new VAT product posting group for import VAT.  
3. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 13.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Posting Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
4. On the VAT Posting Setup page, create a new line, or use an existing VAT business posting groups in combination with the new VAT product posting group for import VAT.  
5. In the **VAT Calculation Type** field, choose **Full VAT**.  
6. In the **Purchase VAT Account** field, enter the general ledger account to use for posting import VAT. All other accounts are optional.  

## Use reverse charge VAT for trade between EU countries/regions

Some companies must use reverse charge VAT when trading with other companies. For example, this rule applies to purchases from EU countries/regions and sales to EU countries/regions.  

> [!NOTE]  
> This rule applies when trading with companies that are registered as VAT liable in another EU country/region. If you do business directly with consumers in other EU countries/regions, then you should contact your tax authority for applicable VAT rules.  

> [!TIP]  
> You can verify that a company is registered as VAT liable in another EU country/region by using the EU VAT Registration Number Validation service. The service is available for free in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For more information, see [Verify VAT registration numbers](finance-how-validate-vat-registration-number.md).

### Sales to EU countries/regions

VAT isn't calculated on sales to VAT-liable companies in other EU countries/regions. You must report the value of these sales to EU countries/regions separately on your VAT statement.  

To correctly calculate VAT on sales to EU countries/regions, you should:  

* Set up a line for sales with the same information for purchases. If you set up lines on the **VAT Posting Setup** page for purchases from EU countries/regions, you can also use these lines for sales.  
* Assign the VAT business posting groups in the **VAT Bus. Posting Group** field on the **Invoicing** FastTab of the customer card of each EU customer. You should also enter the customer's VAT registration number in the **VAT Registration No.** field on the **Foreign Trade** FastTab.  

When you post a sale to a customer in another EU country/region, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates the VAT amount and creates a VAT entry based on information about the reverse charge VAT and the VAT base. This amount is used to calculate the VAT amount. No entries are posted to the VAT accounts in the general ledger.

If you want to use combination of VAT business posting group and VAT product posting group for reporting as services in the periodic VAT reports, mark the **EU Service** field.

> [!NOTE]  
> The **EU Service** field is only applicable for VAT reports. The field isn't related to the **Service Declaration** or **Intrastat for Services** features.

## VAT rounding for documents

Amounts in documents that aren't posted are rounded and displayed to correspond with the final rounding of amounts that are posted. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates VAT for a complete document. The VAT calculation is based on the sum of all lines with the same VAT identifier in the document.  

## Set up VAT reporting

You must set up information about how the tax authorities in your country or region require you to submit VAT reports. The following steps illustrate the most commonly used information. However, your country or region might require other steps. For more information, see the relevant article in the *Local functionality* section in the panel to the left.

# Archive documents

You can archive sales, purchase, and service orders, quotes, return orders, and blanket orders. If you're using Project Management features, you can also archive your projects. You can archive documents and projects several times. A different archived version saves each time.

For sales documents, if the original still exists and isn't posted, you can use the **Restore** action to overwrite it with an archived version.

> [!NOTE]
> You can only restore sales documents and projects. The action isn't available for archived purchase documents.

For archived documents where the original is deleted, you can reuse the content by copying the data, for example, by using the **Copy from Document** action.  

To explore archived documents, choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Archive**, and then choose the related link. If the archive you're interested in doesn't display right away in the **Go to Reports and Analysis** section, you might need to choose **Show more**.

## To set up automatic document archiving

You can automate archiving to create a new version of the archived document when someone does the following things:

* Changes the status or deletes a document or project.
* Prints, downloads, or sends a document by email.
* Converts a quote to an order or invoice.
* Posts an order.

The following steps describe how to set up automatic archiving of sales documents from the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page. The steps are similar for purchase documents and projects.

* For purchase documents, use the **Purchase & Payables** page.
* For projects, use the **Project Setup** page.
* For services, use the **Service Management Setup** page.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales & Receivables Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Archiving** FastTab, specify whether to turn on automatic archiving for the various types of sales documents. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

The following table describes the options for the **Archive Quotes** field.

|Option|Description|
|------|-----------|
|**Never**| Don't archive sales quotes when they're deleted.|
|**Question**|Prompt the user to choose whether to archive sales quotes when they're deleted.|
|**Always**|Archive a sales quote automatically when you delete it.|

## To manually archive a sales order

The following procedure describes how to manually archive a sales order. The steps are similar for all documents and projects that you can archive.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open a sales order that you want to archive.  
3. Choose the **Archive Document** action.

The sales order is archived. You can view it on the **Archived Sales Orders** page.

## To restore a nonposted sales document or a project from the archive

You can restore documents only if the original document isn't posted.

The following procedure describes how to restore an archived sales order to the original sales order. The steps are similar for all orders, blanket orders, return orders, and quotes.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Order Archives**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the archived sales order, or version of it, that you want to restore, and then choose the **Restore** action.  

The contents of the original sales order or project are replaced with the archived version.

## To delete archived versions

Use a retention policy to clean up archived versions that you no longer need. Retention policies let administrators define how long they want to store data. For example, they can set up a policy that deletes data after an expiration date. To learn more, go to [Define Retention Policies](admin-data-retention-policies.md).

There are a few things to note about creating retention policies for archived documents and projects:

* If the original document isn’t deleted, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] you can’t delete the archived versions. Archived versions don’t expire as long as the original exists.
* When you set up the retention policy, you can specify that you want the policy to delete all archived versions except the most recent. For example, you might have 10 versions and want to keep a copy of the latest. 
* [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates the expiration date for documents based on the date of the most recent archived version.

# Sandbox Environments in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]

With [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, you can easily get a safe environment where you can test, train, or troubleshoot without disturbing your company's work processes or business data. Such a non-production environment is called a *sandbox*. Isolated from production, a sandbox environment is the place to safely explore, learn, demo, develop, and test the service without the risk of affecting the data and settings of your production environment.  

> [!TIP]
> Did you land on this article after you chose the name of your [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] environment in the top bar? Currently, you cannot change the name or the environment that way. Instead, you must ask your admin to change the name, or ask them to share the link to another environment.

Your administrator manages sandbox environments in the [administration center](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/tenant-admin-center-environments?toc=/dynamics365/business-central/toc.json).  

For example, if you want to create a sandbox for benchmarking, your administrator can create a dedicated environment in the administration center. For more information, see [Production and Sandbox Environments](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/environment-types) in the developer and administration content.  

You can also safely use sandboxes for training, such as for following a learning path from [Microsoft training](/training/dynamics365/business-central?WT.mc_id=dyn365bc_landingpage-docs), because it's a safe environment to experiment with. If anything goes wrong, you just delete the sandbox and start over.  

Once you're done, you can remove the sandbox, using the administration center.  

> [!NOTE]
> Technically, sandbox environments are very different from production environments. Your administrator can create a sandbox that includes production data, but it is still a sandbox, and you cannot request a database export, for example. For more information, see [Sandbox environments](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/environment-types#sandbox-environments) in the developer and administration content.

The sandbox environment is not least useful because it includes a couple of handy features:

* [Advanced user experience](#advanced-user-experience)  
<!--* [Complete sample data](#complete-sample-data)  -->
* [Designer](#designer)  

## Advanced user experience

It is possible to enable and try the full functionality of the standard version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in a sandbox tenant by setting the **Experience** field on the **Company Information** page to *Premium*. Find the **Company Information** page in the :::image type="content" source="media/ui-experience/settings_icon_small.png" alt-text="Settings icon."::: menu.  

After you have enabled the *Premium* user experience, you get access to all the standard profiles (roles) and Role Centers in the standard version. Alternatively, contact a reselling partner for a demonstration of the capabilities. For more information, see [How do I find a reselling partner?](across-faq.yml#how-do-i-find-a-reselling-partner).  

### Complete sample data

For situations where you need additional sample data, please talk to your reselling partner.
<!-- In the sandbox environment, you can also create a new company with the **Advanced Evaluation - Complete Sample Data** option so that you can take training or step through walkthroughs that require additional sample data, such as [Walkthrough: Receiving and Putting Away in Basic Warehouse Configurations](walkthrough-receiving-and-putting-away-in-basic-warehousing.md).   -->

<!--#### To create a company with complete sample data in a sandbox

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Companies**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action, and then choose **Create New Company**.  
3. In the **Assisted Setup for Creating a Company** page, choose **Next**.  
4. Specify a name for the new company, and then, in the **Select the data and setup to get started** field, choose **Advanced Evaluation - Complete Sample Data**.  
5. Complete the rest of the assisted setup guide.  

When the assisted setup guide completes, you can start exploring the new company with the complete sample data. For more information, see [Creating New Companies in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]](about-new-company.md).  -->

## Designer

In a sandbox environment, you will find the **Designer** enabled. You can activate Designer by selecting the design icon ![Designer.](./media/across-sandbox/sandbox-inclient-design-icon.png) on a page, or by choosing the **Design** menu item in the ![Settings](media/ui-experience/settings_icon_small.png) Settings menu.  

For more information, see [Use Designer](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-inclient-designer) in the developer and admin content (in English only).

# The QuickBooks Data Migration Extension

This extension makes it easy to migrate customers, vendors, items, and accounts from QuickBooks to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. If your business uses QuickBooks today, you can export the relevant information and then open an assisted setup guide to upload the data to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  
For more information, see [Importing Business Data from Other Finance Systems](across-import-data-configuration-packages.md).

## Data from QuickBooks desktop

You can import the following data from QuickBooks Online to Business Central:

- Customers  
- Vendors  
- Items  
- Chart of Accounts  
- Beginning Balance transactions in General Ledger  
- On-hand Quantities for Inventory Items  
- Open documents for customers and vendors, such as invoices, credit memos and payments  

We migrate only full amounts on sales and purchase documents. We do not update partially paid amounts. For example, if a customer has paid 300 of a total of 500 dollars on a sales invoice, we migrate the full 500. If you have received partial payments, you must update these manually, either before or after you migrate data. We recommend that you apply outstanding transactions before you migrate, just to make things easier afterward.

> [!NOTE]
> We do not migrate purchase orders or sales orders.

## Before you start

An important part of the migration process is to specify the accounts to migrate transactions to. It's a good idea to plan this mapping before you migrate data. For example, the accounts where you post transactions for:

- The sale of items or services to customers  
- The purchase of items or services from vendors  
- Adjustments in the general ledger  

Business Central requires that general ledger accounts have account numbers assigned to them. Make sure that account numbers are assigned to your accounts in QuickBooks.
If transactions in QuickBooks have tax amounts, you must set up a tax account for your tax jurisdictions in Business Central before you can post transactions.

In order to get your data out of the QuickBooks desktop application you will need to download the Microsoft Data Exporter Tool.  The instructions for the tool are in the Data Migration Wizard in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The tool will connect to your QuickBooks application and export the applicable data to a .zip file.  

> [!NOTE]
> Currently the data exporter tool only works with QuickBooks 2017 and 2018.

## Finding the QuickBooks data migration extension

The QuickBooks Data Migration extension is installed and ready to go as an integrated part of the Data Migration assisted setup guide. If you are ready to get started now, and have exported your data from QuickBooks, choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Assisted Setup**, and then choose the related link. Choose **Migrate business data**, and then follow the steps in the guide.  

## What do I do after I migrate data?

After you migrate data, transactions have the status Unposted, so you can review them and make adjustments. To review the transactions, go to the page where you would normally find them. For example, to review unposted sales invoices, go to the Sales Invoices page. To review payment journals, go to the Payment Journals page.
There are a few things in particular that you should do:
If the transactions in QuickBooks had markup or discount amounts, you must manually add the amounts to the related transactions in Business Central before you post them.
If you are using value added tax (VAT), you may need to add a business posting group and a product posting group to the posting setup so that you can post VAT amounts.
Verify the beginning balances for accounts in the general ledger. QuickBooks does not store the current balance for all accounts, so you might need to correct beginning balances.

# The Service Declaration Extension

In some EU countries/regions, authorities require that businesses report the export of services to other EU countries/regions. The **Service Declaration** extension lets you collect information about service trade in the EU and report it to the authorities. Although its name is **Service Declaration**, you can also use it as **Intrastat for Services**. This extension is available for all EU countries/regions as a W1 version, and it can be used as-is in Belgium. For other countries/regions, an extension based on the country/region is required. If a country/region only needs a different format, you can use the report configuration in the **Data Exchange Framework** to change the format.

## Enable the Service Declaration extension

After you install the extension in your environment, you need to enable it.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Set up an IRS 1096 feature**, and then choose the related link.
2. Follow steps in the assisted setup guide. The most of fields are configured by default.
3. Add only **Service Transaction Types** in the second step by choosing the **Open the service transaction types page to specify the list of codes** option.
4. Before you start, check the **Total number of codes** to understand how many service transaction types are already specified.
5. Choose **Finish** in the last step to finish the configuration.

## Set up the Service Declaration extension

You can set up the extension manually, or by using a reporting file on the **Data Exchange Definitions** page.

2. Choose the service declaration you want to report as a file.
3. Fill in the service declaration manually, or choose the **Suggest Lines** action.
4. Choose the **Create File** action.
5. The service declaration file is saved in the required format.

## Other considerations

When you're using the **Service Declaration** extension, there are a few more things to consider. For example, it's important that your groups match requirements from authorities. It's also important that services are included correctly on sales and purchase documents.

### Grouping lines

On service declaration lines, there's no grouping by any field. All entries are copied from the original document as a source.

Grouping required by authorities is provided in the exported file. You must configure the groups in the **Data Exchange Definition**, which is fully configurable. Learn more at [Set Up Data Exchange Definitions](across-how-to-set-up-data-exchange-definitions.md).

### Using services in document lines

When you create a purchase, sales, or service  invoice, there are two fields related to service declarations on their lines. Both fields are filled in with the default values from your item, resource, or item charge set ups.

- **Service Transaction Type Code** - Specifies the code for a service transaction type.
- **Applicable For Service Declaration** - Specifies whether an item or resource is applicable for a service declaration.

You can change the values in these fields, but if you select the **Applicable For Service Declaration** field, you must specify a value in the **Service Transaction Type Code** field. If you don't, you can't post the document.

If you specify a value in the **Service Transaction Type Code** field but don’t select the **Applicable For Service Declaration** field, you can post the document, but the line isn't calculated.

# Transferring and posting cost entries

Before you define cost allocations, you must understand how cost entries come from the following sources:  

- Automatic transfer of general ledger entries.  
- Manual cost posting for pure cost entries, internal charges, and manual allocations.  
- Automatic allocation postings for actual costs.  
- Transfer of budget entries to actual.

## Criteria for transferring general ledger entries to cost entries

It's important to understand the criteria for transferring general ledger entries to cost entries. During the transfer, the **Transfer GL Entries to CA** batch job uses the following criteria to determine if and how the general ledger entries are transferred.  

General ledger entries are transferred if:  

- The entries have dimension values corresponding to either a cost center or a cost object.  
- The entries have dimension values that correspond to a cost center and a cost object. For these entries, the cost center takes precedence. This helps avoid a situation where a cost type appears in both a cost object and a cost center and is therefore counted twice in the statistics.  
- The document number in the entries is empty, so it will appear with a document number of 0000 in the cost entries.  
- The entries are transferred to a cost type that allows for combined entries and these entries are transferred as a combined entry either monthly or daily.  

General ledger entries aren't transferred if:  

- The entries have dimension values that don't correspond to a cost center or a cost object.  
- The entries have an amount of zero.  
- The entries have a general ledger account that has been deleted.  
- The entries have a general ledger account that isn't of the type **Income Statement**.  
- The entries have a general ledger account that isn't assigned a cost type.  
- The entries have a posting date before the **Starting Date for G/L Transfer**.  
- The entries have been posted with a closing date. These are typically entries that set back the balance of the income statement at the end of the year.

## Transferring general ledger entries to cost entries

You can transfer general ledger entries to cost entries.  

Before you run the process for transferring general ledger entries to cost entries, you must prepare the transfer to avoid manual correction posting.  

### To prepare the transfer  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Cost Accounting Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  On the **Cost Accounting Setup** page, verify that the **Starting Date for G/L Transfer** field is set to the correct value.  
3.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Chart of Cost Types**, and then choose the related link.  
4.  On the **Cost Type Card** page, verify that the **G/L Account Range** field is linked correctly for each cost type to take entries from the general ledger.  
5.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Chart of Accounts**, and then choose the related link.  
6.  For each relevant general ledger account, on the **G/L Account Card** page, verify that the **Cost Type No.** field is linked correctly to a cost type. For more information, see [Setting Up Cost Accounting](finance-set-up-cost-accounting.md).  
7.  Verify that all relevant general ledger entries have dimension values that correspond to a cost center and a cost object.  

### To transfer general ledger entries to cost entries

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Transfer GL Entries to CA**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Choose the **Yes** button to start the transfer. The process transfers all general ledger entries that haven't already been transferred.  

During the transfer, the process creates connections in the entries in the **Cost Entry** table and the **Cost Register** table. This makes it possible to trace the source of cost entries.

## Automatic transfer and combined entries

In cost accounting, you can transfer general ledger entries to a cost type by using a combined posting. You can specify if a cost type receives combined entries in the **Combine Entries** field in the cost type definition. The following table describes the different options.  

|Combine Entries|Description|  
|---------------------|-----------------|  
|None|Each general ledger entry is transferred individually to the corresponding cost type.|  
|Day|General ledger entries with the same posting date are transferred as one entry to the corresponding cost type.|  
|Month|All general ledger entries in the same calendar month are transferred as one entry to the corresponding cost type.|  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  If you have selected the **Auto Transfer from G/L** check box on the **Cost Accounting Setup** page, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] updates the cost accounting after every posting in the general ledger. Combined entries are not possible.

## Results of transferring general ledger entries to cost entries

During the transfer of general ledger entries to cost entries, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates connections in the entries in the **G/L Entry** table, the **Cost Entry** table, and the **Cost Register** table to make it possible to trace the connections between cost entries and general ledger entries.  

### General ledger entries

For each general ledger entry that is transferred to cost accounting, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] fills the cost **Entry No.** field.  

### Cost entries

For each cost entry, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] saves the entry number of the corresponding general ledger entry in the **G/L Entry No.** field in the **Cost Entry** table.  

For combined cost entries, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] saves the entry number of the last general ledger entry, which is the entry with the highest entry number.  

The **G/L Account** field in the **Cost Entry** table contains the number of the general ledger account that the cost entry came from.  

For single cost entries, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] transfers the posting text from the general ledger entry to the **Description** text field. For combined entries, the text field shows these entries are transferred as combined entries. For example, for a combined entry for the month of October in 2013, the text can be **Combined Entries, October 2013**.  

### Cost register

In the **Cost Register** table, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates an entry with the source transfer from general ledger. The entry records the first and last entry numbers of the general ledger entries that are transferred, in addition to the first, and last entry numbers of the cost entries that are created.

# Manage Notifications

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can help you work smarter by notifying you about certain events or changes in status, such as when you are about to invoice a customer who has an overdue balance, or the available inventory is lower than the quantity you are about to sell, for example. These notifications are shown as discreet tips in the context of the task you are doing, and you can choose to ignore the notification or to see details about the issue.  

If you choose to see details for a notification, you can take action to resolve the issue, such as contacting the customer, buying more inventory, and so on. It's your choice what to do, and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] gives you advice and recommendations.  

Notifications can help untrained users complete unfamiliar tasks, and do not reduce productivity for the more trained user.  

## To turn notifications on or off, and control when they are sent

When you first start with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] all notifications are turned on, but you can turn them on or off, for example, if you aren't interested in a certain event or status.  

Additionally, some notifications let you specify the conditions under which they are sent. For example, if you want to be notified when inventory is running low, but only for items you buy from a certain vendor.  

Turning notifications on or off, and specifying conditions, applies only to you.  

1. In the top right corner, choose the **Settings** icon ![Settings.](media/ui-experience/settings_icon_small.png "Settings icon for role center"), and then choose the **My Settings** action.  
2. On the **My Settings** page, in the **Notifications** field, choose the *Change when I receive notifications.* link.  
3. In the page that appears, turn on or turn off a notification by selecting or clearing the **Enabled** check box.  
4. To specify conditions that trigger a notification, choose the **View filter details** link, and then fill in the fields.

# Design details: reservation, order tracking, and action messaging

The comprehensive reservation system includes the interrelated and parallel features of Order Tracking and Action Messaging.  

At the core of the reservation system, is the linking of a demand entry and a corresponding supply entry, either through reservation or order tracking. A reservation is a user-generated link, and an order tracking record is a system-generated link. An item quantity entered in the reservation system is either reserved or order tracked, but not both at the same time. How the systems handle an item depends on how the item is setup.  

The reservation system interacts with the planning system by creating action messages on planning lines during planning runs. An action message can be considered an appendage to an order tracking record. Action messages, whether created dynamically in order tracking or during the planning run, provide a convenient tool for efficient supply planning.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Reserved quantities are ignored by the planning system, that is, the hard link that is made between supply and demand cannot be changed through planning.  

 The reservations system also forms the structural foundation for the item tracking system. For more information, go to [Design Details: Item Tracking](design-details-item-tracking.md).  

 <!--For more detailed information about how the reservation system works, see the _Reservation Entry Table_ white paper on [PartnerSource](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=258348).  -->
<!--
> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE [locations-cronus](includes/locations-cronus.md)]
-->

## Reservation  

 A reservation is a firm link that connects a specific demand and a specific supply to each other. This link directly affects the subsequent inventory transaction and ensures the proper application of item entries for costing purposes. A reservation overrides the default costing method of an item. For more information, go to [Design Details: Item Tracking](design-details-item-tracking.md).  

 The **Reservation** page is accessible from all order lines of both demand and supply types. On this page, the user can specify which demand or supply entry to create a reservation link towards. The reservation consists of a pair of records that share the same entry number. One record has a negative sign and points to the demand. The other record has a positive sign and points to the supply. These records are stored in the *Reservation Entry* table with the status value *Reservation*. The user can view all reservations on the **Reservation Entries** page.  

### Offsetting in reservations  

 Reservations are made against available item quantities. Item availability is calculated in basic terms as follows:  

 `available quantity = inventory + scheduled receipts - gross requirements`

 The following table shows the details of the order network entities that are part of the availability calculation.  

||Field in T27 Item|Source table|Table filter|Source field|  
|-|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|  
|**Inventory**|Inventory|Item Ledger Entry|N/A|Quantity|  
|**Scheduled receipts**|FP Order Receipt (Qty.)|Prod. Order Line|=Firm Planned|Remaining Qty. (Base)|  
|**Scheduled receipts**|Rel. Order Receipt (Qty.)|Prod. Order Line|=Released|Remaining Qty. (Base)|  
|**Scheduled receipts**|Qty. on Assembly Order|Assembly Header|=Order|Remaining Qty. (Base)|  
|**Scheduled receipts**|Qty. on Purch. Order|Purchase Line|=Order|Outstanding Qty. (Base)|  
|**Scheduled receipts**|Trans. Ord. Receipt (Qty.)|Transfer Line|N/A|Outstanding Quantity|  
|**Gross requirements**|Qty. On Sales Order|Sales Line|=Order|Outstanding Qty. (Base)|  
|**Gross requirements**|Scheduled Need (Qty.)|Prod. Order Component|<>Simulated|Remaining Qty. (Base)|  
|**Gross requirements**|Qty. on Asm. Component|Assembly Line|=Order|Remaining Qty. (Base)|  
|**Gross requirements**|Trans. Ord. Shipment (Qty.)|Transfer Line|N/A|Outstanding Quantity|  

 For more information, go to [Design Details: Availability in the Warehouse](design-details-availability-in-the-warehouse.md).  

### Manual reservation  

When a user intentionally creates a reservation, the user gains full ownership of and responsibility for these items. This means that the user must also manually change or cancel a reservation. Such manual changes might cause automatic modification of the involved reservations.  

The following table shows when and which modifications might occur:  

|User Action|System Reaction|  
|-----------------|---------------------|  
|Decreasing the reserved quantity|The related quantity fields are updated.|  
|Changing date fields|The related date fields are updated.<br /><br /> **Note:** If the due date on a demand is changed to precede the shipment date or due date of the supply, then the reservation is canceled.|  
|Deleting the order|The reservation is canceled.|  
|Changing location, bin, variant, serial number, or lot number|The reservation is canceled.|  

> [!NOTE]  
> The Late Binding functionality may also change reservations without informing the user, by reshuffling nonspecific reservations of serial or lot numbers. For more information, go to [Design Details: Item Tracking and Reservations](design-details-item-tracking-and-reservations.md).  

### Automatic reservations  

The item card can be set up to automatically reserve items based on demand, such as sales orders. In that case, reservation is made against inventory, purchase orders, assembly orders, and production orders. A warning is issued if the supply is insufficient.  

In addition, various planning functions automatically reserve items to keep a demand linked to a specific supply. The order tracking entries for such planning links contain **Reservation** in the **Reservation Status** field in the *Reservation Entry* table. Automatic reservations are created in the following situations:  

- A multilevel production order where the **Manufacturing Policy** field of the involved parent and child items is set to **Make-to-Order**. The planning system creates reservations between the parent production order and the underlying production order to ensure they process together. This reservation binding overrides the item's default costing and application method.  

- A production, assembly, or purchase order where the **Reordering Policy** field of the involved item is set to **Order**. The planning system creates reservations between the demand and the planned supply to ensure that the specific supply is created. For more information, go to [Order](design-details-handling-reordering-policies.md#order).  

- A production order created from a sales order with the **Sales Order Planning** function is linked to the sales order with an automatic reservation.  

- An assembly order created automatically for a sales order line to fulfill the quantity in the **Qty. to Assemble to Order** field. This automatic reservation links the sales demand and the assembly supply so that sales order processors can customize and promise the assembly item to the customer directly. In addition, the reservation links the assembly output to the sales order line through to the shipping activity that fulfills the customer order.  

For supply or demand that isn't allocated, the planning system automatically assigns a reservation status **Surplus**. This could result from demand that is due to forecasted quantities or user-entered planning parameters. This is a legitimate surplus, which the system recognizes, and it doesn't give rise to action messages. The surplus could also be genuine, excess supply or demand that remains untracked. This is an indication of an imbalance in the order network, which causes the system to issue action messages. Note that an action message that suggests a change in quantity always refers to type **Surplus**. For more information, go to [Example: Order Tracking in Sales, Production, and Transfers](#example-order-tracking-in-sales-production-and-transfers) section in this article.  

Automatic reservations created during the planned run are handled in the following ways:  

- They apply to item quantities included in the availability calculation, just like manual reservations. For more information, go to the "Offsetting in Reservations" section in this article.  

- They're included and potentially changed in subsequent planning runs, unlike manually reserved items.  

## Order tracking  

Order Tracking helps the planner maintain a valid supply plan by providing an overview of the offsetting between demand and supply in the order network. The order tracking records serve as the foundation for creating dynamic action messages and planning line suggestions during planning runs.  

> [!NOTE]  
> The order tracking system offsets available stock as orders are entered into the order network. This implies that the system does not prioritize orders that may be more urgent in terms of their due date. It is therefore up to the logic of the planning system or the wisdom of the planner to rearrange these priorities in a meaningful way.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Order tracking policy and the Get Action Messages function are not integrated with Projects. That means that demand related to a project is not automatically tracked. Because it is not tracked, it could cause the use of an existing replenishment with project information to be tracked to another demand, for example, a sales order. Consequently, you may encounter a situation in which your information about available inventory is out of sync.  

### The order network  

The order tracking system is based on the principle that the order network must always remain balanced, ensuring every demand that enters the system is offset by a corresponding supply and vice versa. The system provides this by identifying logical links between all demand and supply entries in the order network.  

This principle implies that a change in demand results in a corresponding imbalance on the supply side of the order network. Conversely, a change in supply results in a corresponding imbalance on the demand side of the order network. In reality, the order network is in a state of constant flux as users enter, amend, and delete orders. Order Tracking processes orders dynamically, reacting to each change at the time that it enters the system and becomes a part of the order network. As soon as new order tracking records are created, the order network is in balance, but only until the next change occurs.  

To increase the transparency of calculations in the planning system, the **Untracked Planning Elements** page displays untracked quantities, which represent the difference in quantity between known demand and suggested supply. Each line on the page refers to the cause of the excess quantity, such as **Blanket Order**, **Safety Stock Level**, **Fixed Reorder Quantity**, **Minimum Order Qty.**, **Rounding**, or **Dampener**.  

### Offsetting in order tracking  

In contrast to reservations, which can only be made against available item quantities, order tracking is possible against all order network entities that are part of  the net requirements calculation of the planning system. The net requirements are calculated as follows:  

`net requirements = gross requirements + reorder point - scheduled receipts - planned receipts - projected available balance`  

> [!NOTE]  
> Demand that is related to forecasts or planning parameters is not order tracked.  

### Example: Order tracking in sales, production, and transfers  

The following scenario shows which order tracking entries are created in the *Reservation Entry* table as results of various order network changes.  

Assume the following data for two items that are set up for order tracking.  

|Item|Parameter|Detail|
|-|-|-|
|Item 1|Name|Component|
||Availability|100 units in EAST location<br /><br />- 30 units of LOTA<br />- 70 units of LOTB|  
|Item 2|Name|Produced Item|
||Production BOM|1 qty. per of Component|  
||Demand|Sale for 100 units at WEST location|  
||Supply|Released production order (generated with the *Sales Order Planning* function for the sale of 100 units)|  

On the **Manufacturing Setup** page, the **Components at Location** field is set to *EAST*.

The following order tracking entries exist in the *Reservation Entry* table based on the data in the table.  

<!--![First example of order tracking entries in Reservation Entry table.](media/supply_planning_RTAM_1.png "supply_planning_RTAM_1")  -->
**Reservation entries**

|Entry No.|Positive|Item No.|Location Code|Quantity|Reservation Status|Description|Lot No.|Source Type|Source ID|Binding|  
|--------|--------|--------|-------------|--------|------------------|-----------|-------|-----------|---------|-------| 
|8|-|COMPONENT|EAST|-70|Tracking|Component|-|5407|101004|-|
|8|Yes|COMPONENT|EAST|70|Tracking|Component|LOTB|32|-|-| 
|9|-|COMPONENT|EAST|-30|Tracking|Component|-|5407|1001004|-| 
|9|Yes|COMPONENT|EAST|30|Tracking|Component|LOTA|32|-|-| 
|10|-|PRODUCED ITEM|WEST|-100|Reservation|Produced Item|-|37|1001|Order-to-Order|
|10|Yes|PRODUCED ITEM|WEST|100|Reservation|Produced Item|-|5406|101004|Order-to-Order|


#### Entry numbers 8 and 9  

For the component need for LOTA and LOTB respectively, order tracking links are created from the demand in table 5407, *Prod. Order Component*, to the supply in table 32, *Item Ledger Entry*. The **Reservation Status** field contains *Tracking* to indicate that these entries are dynamic order tracking links between supply and demand.  

> [!NOTE]  
> The **Lot No.** field is empty on the demand lines because the lot numbers are not specified on the component lines of the released production order.  

#### Entry number 10  

From the sales demand in table 37, *Sales Lines*, an order tracking link is created to the supply in table 5406, *Prod. Order Line*. The **Reservation Status** field contains *Reservation*, and the **Binding** field contains *Order-to-Order*. This is because the released production order was generated specifically for the sales order and must remain linked, unlike order tracking links with a reservation status of Tracking, which is created and changed dynamically. For more information, go to the [Automatic Reservations](#automatic-reservations) section in this article.  

 At this point in the scenario, the 100 units of LOTA and LOTB are transferred to WEST location by a transfer order.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Only the transfer order shipment is posted at this point, not the receipt.  

 Now the following order tracking entries exist in the *Reservation Entry* table.  

<!-- ![Second example of order tracking entries in Reservation Entry table.](media/supply_planning_RTAM_2.png "supply_planning_RTAM_2")  -->
**Reservation entries**

|Entry No.|Positive|Item No.|Location Code|Quantity|Reservation Status|Description|Lot No.|Source Type|Source ID|Binding|  
|---------|--------|--------|-------------|--------|------------------|-----------|-------|-----------|---------|-------| 
|9|-|COMPONENT|EAST|-30|Surplus|Component|-|5407|1001004|-| 
|10|-|PRODUCED ITEM|WEST|-100|Reservation|Produced Item|-|37|1001|Order-to-Order|
|10|Yes|PRODUCED ITEM|WEST|100|Reservation|Produced Item|-|5406|101004|Order-to-Order|
|12|Yes|COMPONENT|WEST|70|Surplus|Component|LOTB|5741|1011|-| 
|14|Yes|COMPONENT|WEST|30|Surplus|Component|LOTA|5741|1011|-| 
|15|Yes|COMPONENT|OUT.LOG.|70|Surplus|Component|LOTB|32|-|-| 
|16|Yes|COMPONENT|OUT.LOG.|30|Surplus|Component|LOTA|32|-|-| 

#### Entry numbers 8 and 9  

Order tracking entries for the two lots of the component reflecting demand in table 5407 are changed from a reservation status of *Tracking* to *Surplus*. The reason is that the supplies that were linked to before, in table 32, are used by the shipment of the transfer order.  

Genuine surplus, as in this case, reflects excess supply or demand that remains untracked. It's an indication of an imbalance in the order network, which generates an action message by the planning system unless it's resolved dynamically.  

#### Entry numbers 12 to 16  

Because the two lots of the component are posted on the transfer order as shipped but not received, all related positive order tracking entries are of reservation type *Surplus*, indicating that they aren't allocated to any demands. For each lot number, one entry relates to table 5741, *Transfer Line*, and one entry relates to the item ledger entry at the in-transit location where the items now exist.  

At this point in the scenario, the transfer order of the components from *EAST* to *WEST* location is posted as received.  

Now the following order tracking entries exist in the *Reservation Entry* table.  

<!-- ![Third example of order tracking entries in Reservation Entry table.](media/supply_planning_RTAM_3.png "supply_planning_RTAM_3") -->
 **Reservation entries**

|Entry No.|Positive|Item No.|Location Code|Quantity|Reservation Status|Description|Lot No.|Source Type|Source ID|Binding|  
|---------|--------|--------|-------------|--------|------------------|-----------|-------|-----------|---------|-------| 
|8|-|COMPONENT|EAST|-70|Surplus|Component|-|5407|101004|-| 
|9|-|COMPONENT|EAST|-30|Surplus|Component|-|5407|1001004|-|
|10|-|PRODUCED ITEM|WEST|-100|Reservation|Produced Item|-|37|1001|Order-to-Order|
|10|Yes|PRODUCED ITEM|WEST|100|Reservation|Produced Item|-|5406|101004|Order-to-Order|
|17|Yes|COMPONENT|WEST|70|Surplus|Component|LOTB|32|-|-| 
|18|Yes|COMPONENT|WEST|30|Surplus|Component|LOTA|32|-|-| 

The order tracking entries are now similar to the first point in the scenario before the transfer order was posted as shipped only, except entries for the component are now of reservation status *Surplus*. This is because the component need is still at *EAST* location, reflecting that the **Location Code** field on the production order component line contains *EAST* as setup in the **Components at Location** field. The supply that was allocated to this demand before was transferred to *WEST* location and can't be fully tracked unless the component need on the production order line is changed to *WEST* location.  

At this point in the scenario, the **Location Code** on the production order component line is set to *WEST*. In addition, on the **Item Tracking Lines** page, the 30 units of LOTA and the 70 units of LOTB are assigned to the production order component line.  

Now the following order tracking entries exist in the *Reservation Entry* table.  

<!-- ![Fourth example of order tracking entries in Reservation Entry table.](media/supply_planning_RTAM_4.png "supply_planning_RTAM_4")   -->
 **Reservation entries**

|Entry No.|Positive|Item No.|Location Code|Quantity|Reservation Status|Description|Lot No.|Source Type|Source ID|Binding|  
|---------|--------|--------|-------------|--------|------------------|-----------|-------|-----------|---------|-------| 
|10|-|PRODUCED ITEM|WEST|-100|Reservation|Produced Item|-|37|1001|Order-to-Order|
|10|Yes|PRODUCED ITEM|WEST|100|Reservation|Produced Item|-|5406|101004|Order-to-Order|
|21|-|COMPONENT|WEST|-70|Tracking|Component|LOTB|5407|101004|-| 
|21|Yes|COMPONENT|WEST|70|Tracking|Component|LOTB|32|-|-| 
|22|-|COMPONENT|WEST|-30|Tracking|Component|LOTA|5407|1001004|-| 
|22|Yes|COMPONENT|WEST|30|Tracking|Component|LOTA|32|-|-| 

#### Entry numbers 21 and 22  

Since the component need changed to *WEST* location, and the supply is available as item ledger entries at *WEST* location, all order tracking entries for the two lot numbers are now fully tracked, indicated by the reservation status of *Tracking*.  

The **Lot No.** field is now filled in the order tracking entry for table 5407 because the lot numbers were assigned to the production order component lines.  

## Action messaging  

When the order tracking system detects an imbalance in the order network, it automatically creates an action message to notify the user. Action messages are system-generated calls for user action that specify the details of the imbalance and suggestions on how to restore balance to the order network. They display as planning lines on the **Planning Worksheets** page when you choose **Get Action Messages** action. In addition, action messages on planning lines are generated during the planning run to reflect the planning system's suggestions to restore balance to the order network. In both cases, the suggestions are run on the order network, when you choose **Carry Out Action Message** action.  

An action message addresses one BOM level at a time. If the user accepts the action message, this might give rise to additional action messages at the next BOM level.  

The following table shows the action messages that exist.  

|Action message|Description|  
|--------------------|---------------------------------------|  
|**Change Qty.**|Changes the quantity on an existing supply order to cover a changed or new demand.|  
|**Reschedule**|Reschedules the due date on an existing order.|  
|**Resched. & Chg. Qty.**|Reschedules the due date and changes the quantity on an existing order.|  
|**New**|Creates a new order if demand can't be fulfilled by either of the previous action messages.|  
|**Cancel**|Cancels an existing order.|  

The order tracking system always attempts to resolve an imbalance in the existing order network. If this isn't possible, it issues an action message to create a new order. Following is the prioritized list that the order tracking system uses when it determines how to restore balance. If an additional demand enters the order network, the system seeks to order track through the following checks:  

1. Check for any excess supply in the existing order tracking record for this demand.  
1. Check for planned and scheduled receipts in order of receipt date. The latest possible date is selected.  
1. Check for available stock.  
1. Check if a supply order exists in the current order tracking record. If so, the system issues an action message of type *Change* to increase the order.  
1. Check that no supply order exists in the current order tracking record. If so, the system issues an action message of type *New* to create a new order.  

An open demand passes through the list and offsets the available supply at each point. Any remaining demand is always covered by check 4 or check 5.  

If a decrease in demand quantity occurs, the order tracking system attempts to resolve the imbalance by performing the previous checks in reverse order. This means that existing action messages could be modified or even deleted, if necessary. The order tracking system always presents the net result of its calculations to the user.  

## Order tracking and planning  

When the planning system runs, it deletes all existing order tracking records and action message entries and recreates them as planning line suggestions according to supply/demand pairs and priorities. When the planning run finishes, the order network is in balance.  

### Planning system versus order tracking and action messaging  

 The following comparison shows the differences between the methods that are used by the planning system to create planning line suggestions and the methods that are used by the order tracking system to create order tracking records and action messages.  

- The planning system deals with the entire supply and demand pattern of a particular item, whereas order tracking deals with the order that activated it.  

- The planning system deals with all levels of the BOM hierarchy, whereas order tracking deals with one BOM level at a time.  

- The planning system establishes links between demand and supply according to the prioritized due date. Order tracking establishes links between demand and supply according to the order entry sequence.  

- The planning system takes planning parameters into account, whereas order tracking doesn't.  

- The planning system creates links in a user-activated batch mode when it balances demand and supply, whereas order tracking creates the links automatically and dynamically as the user enters orders.

# Troubleshoot connectivity for Business Central

> **APPLIES TO:** [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Online
>
> This feature is currently in preview. The functionality and documentation may change in later releases. If you would like to contribute to the documentation based on your own findings, please select ![Edit article in GitHub.](media/github-edit-pencil.png) **Edit**, and propose changes. Then we'll take a look!

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Online includes the **Troubleshooting Connectivity** page that you can use to identify problems with your connection to the online service. There are several things that affect connectivity to Business Central, like the firewall settings of your network or domain name service configuration. The page lets you run a list of checks that diagnose common Business Central connectivity issues. You can use the information to try to fix the problems yourself, or pass it on to your support representative.

> [!NOTE]
> The **Troubleshooting Connectivity** page doesn't test network performance or reliability, like the speed of your connection. It only verifies connectivity to different resources.

## Start the connectivity check 

1. Open an Internet browser.
2. In the address, enter the URL that you use to open Business Central and add `/connectivity` at the end. 

    For example, if you use `https://businesscentral.dynamics.com`, then enter:

    ```http
    https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/connectivity
    ```

    Or, if the URL includes the tenant ID, like `https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/aaaabbbb-0000-cccc-1111-dddd2222eeee`, then you'd enter:

    ```http
    https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/aaaabbbb-0000-cccc-1111-dddd2222eeee/connectivity
    ```
 
3. On the **Troubleshooting Connectivity** page, choose **Start check**.

    A series of checks is run, and the result of each check is shown:

    - ![Connectivity check succeeded.](media/connectivity-check.png) indicates the check succeeded.

# Bulk Invoicing for Microsoft Bookings in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]

If your company uses the Bookings app in Microsoft 365, you can do bulk invoicing for appointments. The **Bookings Not Invoiced** page in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides a list of the company's completed bookings. In this page you can quickly select the appointments that you want to invoice and create draft invoices for the services provided.  

## Connect to Bookings

To connect your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with Bookings, you must specify your Bookings company, what to synchronize with Bookings, how often to synchronize, and which templates to use. You set up this information on the **Booking Sync. Setup** page, which you can launch from the **Exchange Sync. Setup** page, which you can find through [Search](ui-search.md).  

For example, if you want to synchronize customers between Bookings and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you must specify the default template to use to add new customers in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] based on the customers in your Bookings company.  

> [!NOTE]
> The Bookings app is designed to book appointments for individual customers rather than companies. The synchronization with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will, therefore, only synchronize customer contacts with a Type of *Person*. An email address is also required for the contact to synchronize.  

Similarly, if you want to synchronize service items between Bookings and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you must specify the default template to use to add new service items in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] based on the services in our Bookings company.  

> [!NOTE]
> Only items of type *Service* will synchronize between Bookings and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The template that you set up in the **Configuration Templates** page so it can be used for the item synchronization must define the type as *Service*.

## Invoice Appointments

When it is time to send invoices for the completed bookings, you go to the **Bookings Not Invoiced** page. Depending on how often the information is synchronized, the list is long or short. You can create invoices for all bookings in the list or one booking at a time. You can select one or more entries in the list and invoice those only.  

The support for invoicing appointments from Bookings is simpler than the fuller workflow of working with sales quotes, sales orders, and sales invoices. For more information, see [Invoice Sales](sales-how-invoice-sales.md). You can choose to sell your services using [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] or choose to use Bookings, depending on your business needs.  

> [!NOTE]
> In May 2022, we discovered an issue in the integration with Bookings. Currently, the sync from Bookings to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] requires you to manually associate the invoices with customers in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

# Scheduling a Synchronization between Business Central and Dataverse

You can synchronize [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] on scheduled intervals by setting up jobs in the job queue. The synchronization jobs synchronize data in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] records and [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] records that are coupled. For records that are not already coupled, depending on the synchronization direction and rules, the synchronization jobs can create and couple new records in the destination system.

There are several synchronization jobs that are available out-of-the-box. The jobs are run in the following order to avoid coupling dependencies between tables. For more information, see [Use Job Queues to Schedule Tasks](admin-job-queues-schedule-tasks.md).

1. CURRENCY - Common Data Service synchronization job.
2. VENDOR - Common Data Service synchronization job.
3. CONTACT - Common Data Service synchronization job.
4. CUSTOMER - Common Data Service synchronization job.
5. SALESPEOPLE - Common Data Service synchronization job.

You can view the jobs on the **Job Queue Entries** page. For more information, see [Use Job Queues to Schedule Tasks](admin-job-queues-schedule-tasks.md).

## Default synchronization job queue entries

The following table describes the default synchronization jobs for [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)].  

| Job Queue Entry | Description | Direction | Integration Table Mapping | Default Synchronization Frequency (mins) | Default inactivity sleep time (mins) |
|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|
| CONTACT - Common Data Service synchronization job | Synchronizes [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] contacts with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] contacts. | Bidirectional | CONTACT | 30 | 720 <br>(12 hours) |
| CURRENCY - Common Data Service synchronization job | Synchronizes [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] transaction currencies with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] currencies. | From [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] | CURRENCY | 30 | 720 <br> (12 hrs) |
| CUSTOMER - Common Data Service synchronization job | Synchronizes [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] accounts with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] customers. | Bidirectional | CUSTOMER | 30 | 720<br> (12 hrs) |
| VENDOR - Common Data Service synchronization job | Synchronizes [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] accounts with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] customers. | Bidirectional | VENDOR | 30 | 720<br> (12 hrs) |
| SALESPEOPLE - Common Data Service synchronization job | Synchronizes [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] salespeople with [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] users. | From [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] | SALESPEOPLE | 30 | 1440<br> (24 hrs) |

## Synchronization process

Each synchronization job queue entry uses a specific integration table mapping that specifies which [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] table and [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] table to synchronize. The table mappings also include some settings that control which records in the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] table and [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] table to synchronize.  

To synchronize data, [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] table records must be coupled to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] records. For example, a [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] customer must be coupled to a [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] account. You can set up couplings manually, before running the synchronization jobs, or let the synchronization jobs set up couplings automatically. The following list describes how data is synchronized between [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] when you are using the synchronization job queue entries. For more information, see [Couple and Synchronize Records Manually](admin-how-to-couple-and-synchronize-records-manually.md).

- The **Sync. Only Coupled Records** check box controls whether new records are created when you synchronize. By default, the check box is selected, which means that only records that are coupled will be synchronized. In the integration table mapping, you can change the table mapping between a [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] table and a [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] table so that the integration synchronization jobs will create new records in the destination database for each row in the source database that is not coupled. For more information, see [Creating New Records](admin-how-to-modify-table-mappings-for-synchronization.md#create-new-records).

    **Example**
    If you clear the **Sync. Only Coupled Records** check box, when you synchronize customers in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with accounts in [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)], a new account is created for each customer in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and automatically coupled. Additionally, because the synchronization is bidirectional in this case, a new customer is created and coupled for each [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] account that is not already coupled.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > There are rules and filters that determine what data is synchronized. For more information, go to [Synchronization Rules](admin-synchronizing-business-central-and-sales.md).

- When new records are created in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the records use the either the template that is defined for the integration table mapping or the default template that is available for the row type. Fields are populated with data from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] or [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] depending on the synchronization direction. For more information, see [Modify Table Mappings for Synchronization](admin-how-to-modify-table-mappings-for-synchronization.md).  

- With subsequent synchronizations, only records that have been modified or added after the last successful synchronization job for the table will be updated.  

     New records in [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] are added in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. If data in fields in [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] records has changed, the data is copied to the corresponding field in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

- With bidirectional synchronization, the job synchronizes from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)], and then from [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## About inactivity timeouts

Some job queue entries, such as those that schedule synchronization between [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)], use the **Inactivity Timeout** field on the **Job Queue Entry** page to prevent the job queue entry from running unnecessarily.  

:::image type="content" source="media/on-hold-with-inactivity-timeout.png" alt-text="Flowchart for when job queue entries are put on hold due to inactivity.":::

When the value in this field is not zero, and the job queue did not find any changes during the last run, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] puts the job queue entry on hold. When that happens, the **Status of Job Queue** field will show **On Hold Due to Inactivity**, and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will wait for the period of time specified in **Inactivity Timeout** field before it runs the job queue entry again.  

For example, by default, the CURRENCY job queue entry, which synchronizes currencies in [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] with exchange rates in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], will look for changes to exchange rates every 30 minutes. If no changes are found, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] puts the CURRENCY job queue entry on hold for 720 minutes (twelve hours). If an exchange rate is changed in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] while the job queue entry is on hold, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will automatically reactivate the job queue entry and restart the job queue. 

> [!Note]
> [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will automatically activate job queue entries that are on hold only when changes happen in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Changes in [!INCLUDE[cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] will not activate job queue entries.

# Suggest substitute items with Copilot

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](includes/preview-banner.md)]

This article explains how to find and assign substitute items faster by letting Copilot suggest the items to add.

[!INCLUDE [production-ready-preview-dynamics365](includes/production-ready-preview-dynamics365.md)]

## About item substitution suggestions

To ensure they can fulfill orders quickly, businesses often assign similar items to each other so they can use them as substitutes. For example, substitutes are good to have when the item that was originally requested is out of stock. Finding and assigning the right items to use as substitutes can be time consuming, and that's where Copilot can help. The suggest item substitutions capability for Copilot can speed up the process of finding similar items.

Information about products is stored in multiple places in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For example, item numbers and descriptions are stored in the Item table, multiple barcodes are stored in the Item Reference table, and item properties are stored in the Item Attributes table. Copilot uses a large language model combined with embedded search to comb through this information and suggest items that might be good substitutes. While you might prompt for *Red bicycle*, the actual product might be *Crimson Tourer**, where *Bicycle* is an item category and *Red* is an attribute.

## Available languages

[!INCLUDE [copilot-geo-and-language-availability](includes/copilot-geo-and-language-availability.md)]

## Prerequisites

- Your administrator must activate the **Create product information** capability on the **Copilot & agent capabilities** page. [Learn more about how to configure Copilot and agent capabilities](enable-ai.md).
- You're familiar with creating and managing product (item) information.

## Suggest item substitutions on item substitution entries

This process describes how to get Copilot to suggest substitute items.

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, and then select the related link.
2. Select the item you want Copilot to find substitutes for.
3. Choose the **Substitutions** action.
4. On the **Item Substitution Entry** page, choose **Suggest with Copilot**.
5. Review the suggestions. To learn more, go to [Review, save, discard, or regenerate suggestions](#review-save-discard-or-regenerate-suggestions).

## Adjust the search

By default, the capability uses the item description as search criteria, which you can adjust if you want to fine-tune the search results. To edit the prompt, select the :::image type="content" source="media/edit-pencil.png" alt-text="Edit the prompt."::: icon in the Copilot window. For example, you can add more details to the prompt such as colors, sizes, or other item attributes.

## Review, save, discard, or regenerate suggestions

After Copilot suggests the items to add, review the suggestions and decide whether they're what you want:

- To discard a single proposed line, select it in the list, and then choose the **Delete Line** action.
- To discard all proposed lines and close the Copilot window, choose **Discard** (trash can).
- To transfer the lines shown in the Copilot window, choose **Insert all**. This step confirms that you want to transfer the lines to the **Item Substitution Entry** page. You can delete or edit the transferred lines there as well. The **Score** field that displays **High (85+)**, **Medium (83-85)**, and **Low (79-83)** scores and points you to lines that need attention.

# Reconcile customer payments with a cash receipt journal or from customer ledger entries

When you receive a cash payment from a customer or give a cash refund, you can apply the payment or refund to close open debits or credits. You can specify the amount to apply. For example, you can apply partial payments to customer ledger entries. Closing customer ledger entries keeps customer statistics, account statements, finance charges, and so on, up-to-date.

> [!TIP]  
> On the **Customer Ledger Entries** page, red font means that the related payment is past its due date. If overdue payments are becoming a problem, we can help you reduce their frequency. You can enable the **Late Payment Prediction Setup** extension, which uses a predictive model that we built in Azure Machine Learning to predict the timing of payments. These predictions help you reduce outstanding receivables and fine-tune your collections strategy. For example, if a payment is predicted to be late, you can adjust the terms of payment or the payment method for the customer. For more information, see [Late Payment Predictions](ui-extensions-late-payment-prediction.md).  

You can apply customer ledger entries in several ways:

* Enter information on the following pages:
   * The **Payment Reconciliation Journals** page. For more information, see [Applying Payments Automatically and Reconciling Bank Accounts](receivables-apply-payments-auto-reconcile-bank-accounts.md).
   * The **Payment Registration Setup** page. For more information, see [Reconcile Customer Payments from a List of Unpaid Sales Documents](receivables-how-reconcile-customer-payments-list-unpaid-sales-documents.md).

If you select **Apply to Oldest** in the **Application Method** field on the customer card, the application occurs automatically.

## To apply customer ledger entries in different currencies to one another

If you sell to a customer in one currency and receive payment in another currency, you can still apply the invoice to the payment.  

Here's an example. You apply Entry A in one currency to Entry B in another currency. The posting date on Entry A is used to find the exchange rate to use to convert amounts on Entry B. The exchange rate is found on the **Currency Exchange Rates** page.  

Applying customer ledger entries in different currencies must be enabled. For more information, see [Enable Application of Ledger Entries in Different Currencies](finance-how-enable-application-ledger-entries-different-currencies.md).  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Cash Receipts Journal**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the journal you want, and fill in the first empty journal line using a currency code.
3. Choose the **Apply Entries** action.
4. Select the line with the entry you want to apply to the entry in the cash receipt journal, choose the **Set Applies-to ID** action, and then select the entry you want to apply to.
5. Choose the **OK** button to return to the cash receipt journal.
6. Post the sales journal.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>   When you apply entries in different currencies, the entries are converted to USD. Although the exchange rates for the two currencies are fixed, for example between USD and EUR, there may be a small residual amount when they are converted to USD. These small residual amounts are posted as gains and losses to the account specified in the **Realized Gains Account** or **Realized Losses Account** fields on the **Currencies** page. The **Amount (USD)** field is also adjusted on the vendor ledger entries.  

## To correct an application of customer entries
When you correct an application, correcting entries are created and posted for all entries. The correcting entries are the same as the originals but have an opposite sign in the **Amount** field. The correcting entries include all general ledger entries derived from the application. For example, the payment discount and currency gains/losses. The entries that the application closed are reopened.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customers**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the relevant customer card.
3. Choose the **Ledger Entries** action.
4. Select the relevant ledger entry, and then choose the **Unapply Entries** action.
5. Alternatively, choose the **Detailed Ledger Entry** action.
6. Select the application entry, and then choose the **Unapply Entries** action.
7. Fill in the fields in the header, and then choose the **Unapply** action.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>   If an entry has been applied by more than one application entry, you must unapply the latest application entry first.

# Reverse Output Posting

There are times when output posting must be reversed. An example of this would be if a data entry error occurred and an incorrect amount of output is posted to a production order.  

## To reverse an output posting

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Output Journal**, and then choose the related link. Select your batch.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. For more information, see [Batch Post Output and Run Times](production-how-to-post-output-quantity.md).
3. In the **Applies-To Entry** field, select the associated item ledger entry. This reverses the capacity and item ledger entries.  
4. Post the reversal by posting the journal.  

The output journal entries are posted to the item ledger as a positive adjustment.

# Set Up Incoming Documents

If you create general journal lines from incoming document records, you must specify on the **Incoming Documents Setup** page which journal template and batch to use.

When the **Incoming Documents** feature is set up, you can use different functions to review expense receipts, manage OCR tasks, and convert incoming document files, manually or automatically, to the relevant documents or journal lines. The external files can be attached at any process stage, including to posted documents and to the resulting vendor, customer, and general ledger entries. For more information, see [Create Incoming Documents Records](across-how-create-income-document-records.md).

## To set up the Incoming Documents feature

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Incoming Document Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

As part of the setup, you must decide if you want to require approval of incoming documents. To require approval, you must [set up approvers and approval workflows](#to-set-up-approvers-of-incoming-document-records). If your organization doesn't intend to require approval, you can skip the next section.

Finally, if you use an OCR service to convert PDF or image files representing incoming documents, [you must it set up](#to-set-up-an-ocr-service). Otherwise, you can also skip that section.

## To set up approvers of incoming document records

If you don't want users to create invoices or general journal lines from incoming document records unless the documents are first approved, set up an approval process for the incoming documents. Approvers of incoming documents must be set up as approval workflow users.

Before you can create workflows that involve approval steps, you must set up the workflow users who are involved in approval processes. On the **Approval User Setup** page, you also set amount limits for specific types of requests and define substitute approvers to whom approval requests are delegated when the original approver is absent. For more information, see [Set Up Approval Users](across-how-to-set-up-approval-users.md).

## To set up an OCR service

To turn PDF and image files into electronic documents that you can convert to invoices, credit memos, or journal lines, set up the OCR feature. Alternatively, you can create entries manually to represent the external documents.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **OCR Service Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

# Analyze general ledger (G/L) transactions

When a transaction is posted to the general ledger, the following data is stored in the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] database: a single row in the G/L register table and one or more rows in the G/L Entry table.

## Analyzing the G/L register

You can use the G/L Registers page for financial reporting and transaction tracking. The page gives you an overview of all transactions to the general ledger with the ability to navigate to related entries in subledgers, such as VAT entries or Customer Ledger Entries. You can also see which type of transaction that occured, the user who did the transaction and when it was recorded in the database.

The G/L Registers page is particularly useful during audits, as it provides auditors with easy access to related detailed transaction information. It helps identify any discrepancies, errors, or unusual entries that may require further investigation. 

## Example: use analysis mode to get an overview of G/L transaction types and volume

[!INCLUDE [gl-register-analysis-example](includes/gl-register-analysis-example.md)]


## Analyzing general ledger (G/L) entries

Depending on your need for details or aggregation when analyzing general ledger (G/L) entries, you have several options:

- use the G/L entries page in analysis mode. To learn more, go to [Ad-hoc analysis on finance data](ad-hoc-analysis-finance.md)  
- use the Chart of Accounts page to get a summary across all your G/L accounts. To learn more, go to [Analyze finance data from the Chart of Accounts](finance-general-ledger.md).
- run or define a financial report. To learn more, go to [Primary capabilities of financial reporting](finance-financial-reporting-capabilities.md).

# Year-Over-Year (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Year-Over-Year** report helps business leaders analyze purchasing performance and track spending trends over time. By comparing purchase amounts in the current year with amounts from the previous year, this report provides valuable insights into the efficiency and effectiveness of purchasing activities.

In addition to identifying trends and changes, the report helps leaders make informed decisions about future purchasing strategies. It's an important indicator of growth and spending patterns, providing an overview of the money you spend to make products and generate revenues.

Together with year-over-year financial figures, the report gives a comprehensive view of an organization's financial health. Tracking these figures helps leaders make informed decisions about resource allocation, budgeting, and forecasting.

:::image type="content" source="media/purchases/purchases-year-over-year.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Year-over-Year Power BI report" lightbox="media/purchases/purchases-year-over-year.png":::

## Use the report

The report is intended for business leaders and managers.

COOs ensure that the purchasing department operates efficiently and effectively. One of the key metrics you monitor is the year-over-year growth in purchases. This report lets you quickly explore purchase trends over time, and identify areas of concern. For example, you might notice that purchases are increasing rapidly in a particular item category. You can use this information to discuss how to manage costs with the head of purchasing.

Purchasing managers ensure that the company sources goods at the best price without compromising quality. Use this report to track purchasing trends across different categories and identify areas where you can save. For example, you might notice a rapid increase in purchases of a category of products. With this information in mind, you can work with the manufacturing team to identify whether to change item planning or supplier selection to optimize product cost and quality.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The *Year-Over-Year* report includes the following KPIs and measures: 

- [**Current Year**](purchases-powerbi-kpis.md#purchase-amount)
- [**Previous Year (Fiscal)**](purchases-powerbi-kpis.md#purchase-amount-py-fiscal)
- [**Current Year YOY (Fiscal)**](purchases-powerbi-kpis.md#purchase-amount-yoy-fiscal)

[!INCLUDE[click-on-a-kpi-link](includes/click-on-a-kpi-link.md)] 

[!INCLUDE[powerbi-tip-track-kpis](includes/powerbi-tip-track-kpis.md)]

## Data used in the report

The report uses data from the following tables in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]:

- Value Entry
- Purchase Line
- Item
- Item Category

## To select a check layout

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Report Selections Bank Account**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Report Selection - Bank Acc.** page, in the **Usage** field, select **Check**.
3. Select one of the following report IDs.

| Report ID | Report Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1401 |Check |This report is the default report. |
| 10411 |Check (Stub/Stub/Check) |This report is designed to print checks in a stub/stub/check format. |
| 10412 |Check (Stub/Check/Stub) |This report is designed to print checks in a stub/check/stub format. |
| 10413 |Three Checks per Page |This report is designed to print three checks on each page. |

After you set up check layouts, you can print checks from the **Payment Journal** page. Learn more in [Work with Checks](payables-how-work-checks.md).

To change one of these default check layouts, use either the Word or the RDLC integration to do so. Learn more in [Create and Modify Custom Report Layouts](ui-how-create-custom-report-layout.md).

## Use MICR and security fonts

The online version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] contains preinstalled fonts on the servers that can be used when defining check layouts. The following outlines which fonts are available and have links to detailed information by the 3rd-party suppliers of the fonts.

> [!Important]
> MICR and check security fonts in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] are licensed in a font package from IDAutomation.com, Inc. These products may only be used as part of and in connection with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

In update 15.3 and later, Magnetic Ink Character Recognition (MICR) fonts are installed and available to use. Both the E-13B and the CMC-7 standards are supported. Special security fonts are also available to generate text, names, amounts, and the currency symbols such as Dollar, Euro, Pound, and Yen, which are hard to tamper with once a check is printed.

> [!NOTE]
> - For security and legal reasons, you cannot upload custom fonts to the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online environment.
> - With [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, the MICR and check security fonts from IDAutomation.com aren't available by default. You must purchase them from IDAutomation.com or another supplier. Once you have the fonts, install them on the computer that runs the [!INCLUDE[server](includes/server.md)]. As a minimum, install the fonts for the user that runs the [!INCLUDE[server](includes/server.md)] instance, that is, the service account. To install the fonts, follow the instructions from the font supplier or refer to [Add a Font](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/add-a-font-b7c5f17c-4426-4b53-967f-455339c564c1).

# Troubleshooting: Accessing Camera and Location

You might come across some issues when trying to access the camera and location information of a device from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. You can find the possible causes behind these problems and how to work around them listed below.

## Device must have Camera and Location Capabilities

In order to access the camera or a user's location from a device, the device must have a physical camera or the capability to retrieve location information, respectively.

If your device has camera and location capabilities but you still encounter problems, it is possible that some drivers need updating or reinstalling. Even if you are unsure, we always recommend you update your device operating system, drivers, and browser to the latest version for the best experience.

## Access Permissions not Enabled

You must enable general access to camera and location from your device's privacy settings and explicitly give permission to  [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to access them. For example, to see or change permissions for a device running on Windows, go to **Settings**, choose **Privacy**, and then **App permissions**. 

For mobile devices, you must give camera and location access permissions to the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Mobile App. To do so for an iOS device, go to **Settings**, choose **Privacy**, and then **Camera** or **Location**. For Android devices go to **Settings**, choose **Apps & Notifications**, **Advanced**, **Permission Manager**, and then **Camera** or **Location**.

In addition, if you are using [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in a browser, you must also grant the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] site permission to access the camera or location information. To see or change a site's permissions in the Microsoft Edge browser, go to **Settings**, choose **Site Permissions**, and then **Camera** or **Location**. Note that this might be different for other browsers.

By default, the device or browser will pop up a request to access these capabilities when the user activates them for the first time.

> [!NOTE]  
> Some old browsers do not grant access to camera and location. For example, camera is not available in Internet Explorer or the legacy Edge browser.

## Web Client Connection not Secure

The camera and location capabilities are only available when accessing the Web Client through SSL secured HTTP connections, using the `https://` URI scheme. 

The only exception is connecting to `http://localhost`, used for development and test purposes.


## Work with Virtualization Technologies

When connecting to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] through Remote Desktop or another virtualization, the access to camera or location might not be available. If this is the case, use the physical system instead.

## Antivirus Software
Some antivirus software block access to camera and location by default. Remember to check your antivirus software settings.

# Warnings and error messages

During your work day, you might see notifications in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] that something went wrong, or that it wasn't possible to post something, for example. In many cases, the notification makes it easy to resolve the matter, or to roll back any changes that you made. In other cases, you might not have the information that you need to get unblocked. This article provides tips on how to make progress.  

## In-product user assistance

The default version of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes descriptions for most fields, columns, and actions that can be accessed when you choose the name. In combination with teaching tips for important pages, descriptive captions, and instructional text, these tooltips, or callouts, are our current implementation of *embedded user assistance*, which is an important principle in today's world of software design.  

If you have a question about a field or another element of the user interface, choose the name to read a short description. Choose the **Ask Copilot** link if that isn't enough. You can also use the in-product Help pane to find answers to your questions.  

For more information, see [Dynamics 365 Business Central User Assistance Model](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/user-assistance) in the administration content for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

## Help and Support page

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the Help menu item (the question mark in the top right corner) gives you access to the **Help and Support** page, where you can find links to resources that can help you find answers to your questions. For more information, see [Resources for Help and Support](product-help-and-support.md).  

## Help others

If you're an administrator or superuser, you can help others by looking up error messages in the **Error Message Register** page or in the administration center. In many cases, the warning or error message is about setup or lack of permission and similar issues that the superuser or administrator can easily help with. In other cases, you might have to inspect pages to identify the cause. For more information, see [Finding technical information](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/manage-technical-support#finding-technical-information) in the administration content for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

## Share error details for faster assistance

To overcome obstacles and minimize downtime, apply the expertise of colleagues or subject matter experts. When an error blocks you, you can easily share the error details when you get assistance.

The details include the error message, error code, and other information that's helpful when troubleshooting an error. By sharing the error details, you can effectively communicate the specific issue you're facing, which helps your colleagues help you.  

You can copy details by choosing the **Share icon** in in-line validation dialogs, or the **Share details** menu in error dialogs.  

In addition to copying error details, you can also choose to share details through Microsoft Teams by choosing **Share details to Teams** to do the following:

* Copy the error details.
* Open the **Share to Teams** window, where you can paste the error details you copied and specify who you want to ask for help. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] adds a link to the page where you experienced the error to make troubleshooting easier.

You can also choose to share details by email by choosing **Share details via email** to do the following:

* Copy the error details.
* Open your default email editor, where you can paste the error details you copied and specify who you want to ask for help. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] adds a link to the page where you experienced.

## Help yourself

Error messages provide information and actions that make it easier to understand, go to, and resolve errors that come from the platform.

The error messages that the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] platform generates contain the full technical details, including field names, in the **Detailed error message** section. Select the **Copy details** icon on inline validation errors or in an error message to access the technical information.

Actions on error messages take you directly to the page where a field is causing the error. You don't have to take time to find the page or field yourself. To resolve the error, just choose the action in the error message and [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] takes you to the appropriate location.

The following video shows how to use actionable error messages to get unblocked.

### Tip for developers

If you're a developer, when you call the [TestField](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/methods-auto/record/record-testfield-joker-joker-errorinfo-method) method, but don't pass in the |`ErrorInfo` object, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically generates the link to a page where a user can correct the issue. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] first gets the lookup or drill-down page for the record, and then finds the card page or lookup page and adds a navigation link to that card page. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't add a link in the following situations:

* If the error is on the page that's currently open.
* If the user doesn't have permission to modify the underlying record.

# Create routings

Manufacturing companies use routings to visualize and direct the manufacturing process.

The routing is the basis of process scheduling, capacity scheduling, scheduled assignment of material needs, and manufacturing documents.  

As for production bills of material (BOMs), the routings are assigned to the manufacturing end item. A routing holds master data that captures the process requirements of a given produced item. After a production order is created for an item, its routing governs the scheduling of operations as represented on the **Prod. Order Routing** page under the production order.  

Before you can set up a routing, the following setups must be in place:  

- Item cards are created for parent items that take part in manufacturing. To learn more, go to [Register New Items](inventory-how-register-new-items.md).
- Production resources are set up. To learn more, go to [Set Up Work Centers and Machine Centers](production-how-to-set-up-work-and-machine-centers.md).

## To create a routing

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Routings**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
4. In the **Type** field, select one of the following options:
   - **Serial** to calculate the production routing according to the value in the **Operation No.** field.  
   - Select **Parallel** to calculate the operations according to the value in the **Next Operation No.** field.  
5. To edit the routing, set the **Status** field to **New** or **Under Development**.  

    Proceed to fill in the routing lines.
6. In the **Operation No.** field, enter the number of the first operation, for example,  **10**.  
7. In the **Type** field, specify which kind of resource is used, for example, **Work Center**.  
8. In the **No.** field, select the resource to be used, or type it in the field.  
9. In the **Routing Link Code** field, enter a code to connect the component to a specific operation. For more information, see [To create routing links](production-how-to-create-routings.md#to-create-routing-links).
10. In the **Run Time** and **Setup Time** fields, enter the process times needed to perform the operation.

     > [!NOTE]
     > Setup time is calculated per production order, whereas run time is calculated per produced item.  

11. In the **Concurrent Capacities** field, specify how many units of the selected resource are used to perform the operation. For example, allocating two people to one packing operation halves the run time.  
12. Continue to fill in lines for all operations involved in producing the item in question.  
13. To copy lines from an existing routing, choose the **Copy Routing** action to select existing lines.  
14. To activate the routing, in the **Status** field, choose **Certified**.  
15. You can now attach the new routing to the card of the production item in question, by filling in the **Routing No.** field. To learn more, go to [Register New Items](inventory-how-register-new-items.md).  

> [!NOTE]  
> Remember to recalculate the item's standard cost from the **Item** card. Choose the **Production** action, the **Calc. Production Std. Cost** action, and then choose the **All Levels** action.  You can also calculate and update the standard cost for one or many items on the **Standard Cost Worksheet** page. Learn more at [Update Standard Costs](finance-about-calculating-standard-cost.md#updating-standard-costs-with-standard-cost-worksheet).  


## To create routing links

You can create routing links to connect components to specific operations to retain their relationship even though the production BOM or routing is modified. Routing links also facilitate just-in-time flushing of components, namely when the specific linked operation starts, not when the complete production order is released. To learn more, go to [Flush Components According to Operation Output](production-how-to-flush-components-according-to-operation-output.md).  

Another important benefit is that linked components and operations display in a logical process structure when you use the **Production Journal** page to post output and consumption.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Routings**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the routing that contains the operations that you want to link.  

    Make sure the routing status is **Under Development**.  

3. On the relevant routing line, in the **Routing Link Code** field, select a code.  
4. Add different routing link codes to other operations in the routing, if relevant.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > You shouldn't use the same routing link code in different operations on a routing because you might incorrectly link a component to two different operations, so that it is consumed two times.  
    >
    > It's a good idea to name the routing link code after the operation to ensure operation-specific routing links.

5. Set the routing status to **Certified**.  

    Routing link codes are now assigned to operations. Next, you must create the actual link by assigning the same codes to specific components in the relevant production BOM.  

6. Open the **Production BOM** that contains the components that you want to link to the above operations. To learn more, go to [Create Production BOMs](production-how-to-create-production-boms.md).
7. Make sure the BOM status is **Under Development**.  
8. On the relevant production BOM line, in the **Routing Link Code** field, select the code that you assigned to the operation.  
9. Proceed to add routing link codes to other components according to the unique operations where they're used.  
10. Set the production BOM status to **Certified**.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > To enable the routing links on an existing production order, you must refresh the production order. To learn more, go to [Create Production Orders](production-how-to-create-production-orders.md).  

The selected components are now linked to the selected operations when you create or refresh a production order using the production BOM and routing. This link is visible on the **Prod. Order Components** page under the production order. You can remove and add the routing link codes at any time.

## To assign personnel, tools, and quality measures to routing operations

If you require personnel with qualifications, special knowledge, or special authorization for an operation, you can assign these personnel to the operation. In addition, you can assign tools and quality requirements to the operation. This procedure describes how to assign personnel. The steps are similar for other types of operation information.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Routings**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the relevant routing.  
3. On the **Lines** FastTab, select the line that you want to process, choose the **Operations** action, and then choose the **Personnel** action.  
4. Fill in the fields on the **Routing Personnel** page.  
5. Choose the **OK** button to exit the page. The entered values are copied and assigned to the operation.  

## To create a new version of a routing

The version principle enables you to manage several versions of a routing. The structure of the routing version corresponds to the structure of the routing consisting of the routing version header and the routing version lines. The starting date defines the basic difference.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Routings**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the routing to copy, and then choose the **Versions** action.  
3. On the **Routing Versions** page, choose the **New** action.
4. In the **Version Code** field, enter the unique identification of the version. You can use any combination of numbers and letters.  

    The newly created version is automatically assigned the status **New**.  
5. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](../archive/SetupAndAdministration/includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
6. To create operation lines, select the first blank line, and then fill in the **Operation No.** field according to the sequence of operations.

    The operation lines are in ascending order by operation numbers. To be able to make changes later, we recommend that you select adequate step widths. The **Next Operation No.** field refers to the next operation in the routing.

7. When you're done setting up the routing version, in the **Status** field, choose **Certified**.

# Make payments with the AMC banking 365 fundamentals extension or SEPA credit transfer

On the **Payment Journals** page, you can process payments to your vendors by exporting a file together with the payment information from the journal lines. You can then upload the file to your electronic bank where the related money transfers are processed. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports the SEPA Credit Transfer format, but in your country/region, other formats for electronic payments might be available.

> [!NOTE]
> In the generic version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], a global provider of services to convert bank data to any file format that your bank requires is set up and connected. In North American versions, the same service can be used to send payment files as electronic funds transfer (EFT), for example the commonly used Automated Clearing House (ACH) network, however with a slightly different process. See step 6 in [To export payments to a bank file](finance-make-payments-with-bank-data-conversion-service-or-sepa-credit-transfer.md#to-export-payments-to-a-bank-file).  

 To enable SEPA credit transfers, you must first set up a bank account, a vendor, and the general journal batch that the payment journal is based on. You then prepare payments to vendors by automatically filling the **Payment Journals** page with due payments with specified posting dates.  

After you verify that the bank processed the payments, you can post the payment journal lines.  

## Setting up the AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals extension

Activate the AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals extension to:

* Convert bank statement files to a format that you can import.
* Convert your exported payment files to the format that your bank requires.

For more information, see [Use the AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals extension](ui-extensions-amc-banking.md).

## Setting up SEPA credit transfer

From the **Payment Journals** page, you can export payments to a file for upload to your electronic bank for processing of the related money transfers. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports the SEPA Credit Transfer format, but in your country/region, other formats for electronic payments might be available.  

To be able export of a bank file format that isn't supported out of the box in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can set up a data exchange definition. For more information, see [Set Up Data Exchange Definitions](across-how-to-set-up-data-exchange-definitions.md).  

Before you can process payment electronically by exporting payment files in the SEPA Credit Transfer format, you must perform the following setup steps:  

* Set up the bank account in question to handle the SEPA Credit Transfer format  
* Set up vendor cards to process payments by exporting files in the SEPA Credit Transfer format  
* Set up the related general journal batch to enable payment export from the **Payment Journals** page  
* Connect the data exchange definition for one or more payment types with the relevant payment method or methods  

> [!NOTE]
> Business Central supports both SEPA format CT pain.001.001.03 and CT pain.001.001.09. You can choose any format on the **Bank Account Card** page.  

> [!TIP]
> This article applies to the generic version of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. In your country or region, additional required fields may have been added to the various pages. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

### To set up a bank account for SEPA Credit Transfer

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Bank Accounts**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the bank account from which you export payment files in the SEPA Credit Transfer format.

5. On the **Posting** FastTab, in the **Currency Code** field, specify the currency for the bank account.  

   > [!NOTE]  
   > The **Currency Code** field must be set to **EUR**, because SEPA credit transfers can only be made in the EURO currency.  

6. On the **Transfer** FastTab, in the **Payment Export Format** field, choose the SEPA format you want to use.  
7. In the **IBAN** field, specify the international bank account number for the account.  

### To set up a vendor card for SEPA Credit Transfer

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Vendors**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the card of the vendor you pay electronically using export payment files in the SEPA Credit Transfer format.  
3. On the **Payments** FastTab, in the **Payment Method Code** field, choose **BANK**.  
4. In the **Preferred Bank Account** field, choose the bank to which the money transfers when it's processed by your electronic bank.  

    If you don't have a bank account set up for this vendor, you can do so now. For more information, see [To set up vendor bank accounts for export of bank files](bank-how-setup-bank-accounts.md#to-set-up-vendor-bank-accounts-for-export-of-bank-files). The value in the **Preferred Bank Account** field is copied to the **Recipient Bank Account** field on the **Payment Journal** page.  

### To set the payment journal up to export payment files

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Payment Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
2. In the **Batch Name** field, choose the drop\-down button.  
3. On the **General Journal Batches** page, choose the **Edit List** action.  
4. On the line for the payment journal that you use to export payments, select the **Allow Payment Export** checkbox.  

### To connect the data exchange definition for one or more payment types with the relevant payment method or methods

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Payment Methods**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Payment Methods** page, select the payment method that is used to export payments from, and then choose the **Pmt. Export Line Definition** field.  
3. On the **Pmt. Export Line Definitions** page, select the code that you specified in the **Code** field on the **Line Definitions** FastTab in step 4 in the "To describe the formatting of lines and columns in the file" section in the [Set Up Data Exchange Definitions](across-how-to-set-up-data-exchange-definitions.md) procedure.  

## Preparing the payment journal

Fill the payment journal with lines for due payments to vendors, with the option to insert posting dates based on the due date of the related purchase documents. For more information, see [Managing Payables](payables-manage-payables.md).

## Exporting payments to a bank file

When you're ready to make payments to your vendors, or reimbursements to your employees, you can export a file with the payment information on the lines on the **Payment Journals** page. You can then upload the file to your bank to process the related money transfers.

In the generic version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals extension is available. In North American versions, the same extension can be used to send payment files as electronic funds transfer (EFT), however with a slightly different process. See step 6 in [To export payments to a bank file](finance-make-payments-with-bank-data-conversion-service-or-sepa-credit-transfer.md#to-export-payments-to-a-bank-file).

> [!NOTE]  
> Before you can export payment files from the payment journal, you must specify the electronic format for the involved bank account, and you must enable the AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals extension. For more information, see [Set Up Bank Accounts](bank-how-setup-bank-accounts.md) and [Use the AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals extension](ui-extensions-amc-banking.md). In addition, you must select the **Allow Payment Export** check box on the **General Journal Batches** page. For more information, see [Work with General Journals](ui-work-general-journals.md).  

Use the **Credit Transfer Registers** page to view the payment files that exported from the payment journal. From this page, you can also re-export payment files if there were technical errors or file changes. Note, however, that exported EFT files aren't shown in this page and can't be re-exported.  

### To export payments to a bank file

The following steps describe how to pay a vendor by check. The steps are similar to refund a customer by check.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Payment Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. Fill in the payment journal lines. For more information, see [Record Payments and Refunds](payables-how-post-payments-refunds.md).

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you are using EFT, you must select either **Electronic Payment** or **Electronic Payment–IAT** in the **Bank Payment Type** field. Different file export services and their formats require different setup values on the **Bank Account Card** and **Vendor Bank Account Card** pages. You will be informed about wrong or missing setup values as you try to export the file.
    >
    > The EFT feature can only be used for bank accounts in the local currency. It cannot be used with a foreign currency, indicated by a value in the **Currency Code** field. (Blank field value means local currency.)

3. After you fill in all payment journal lines, choose the **Export** action.
4. On the **Export Electronic Payments** page, fill in the fields as necessary.

    Error messages show in the **Payment File Errors** FactBox, where you can also choose an error message to access more details. You must resolve all errors before you can export the payment file.

    > [!TIP]  
    > When you use the AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals extension, a common error message states that the bank account number does not have the length that your bank requires. To avoid or resolve the error, you must remove the value in the **IBAN** field on the **Bank Account Card** page and then, in the **Bank Account No.** field, enter a bank account number in the format that your bank requires.

5. On the **Save As** page, specify the location that the file is exported to, and then choose **Save**.

    > [!NOTE]  
    > If you are using EFT, save the resulting vendor remittance form as a Word document or select to have it emailed directly to the vendor. The payments are now added to the **Generate EFT File** page from where you can generate multiple payment orders together to save transmission cost. For more information, see the following steps.
6. On the **Payment Journals** page, choose the **Generate EFT File** action.

    On the **Generate EFT File** page, the **Lines** FastTab shows all EFT payments that you exported from the payment journal for a bank account but aren't yet generated.
7. Choose the **Generate EFT File** action to export one file for all the EFT payments.
8. On the **Save As** page, specify the location that the file is exported to, and then choose **Save**.

The bank payment file is exported to the location you specified. You can upload it to your electronic bank account and make the actual payments. Then you can post the exported payment journal lines.

### To plan when to post exported payments

If you don't want to post a payment journal line for an exported payment, you can just delete the journal line. For example, because you're waiting for confirmation that the bank processed the transaction. Later, when you create a payment journal line to pay the remaining amount, the **Total Exported Amount** field shows how much of the payment amount was already exported. Also, you can find detailed information about the exported total by choosing the **Credit Transfer Reg. Entries** button to see details about exported payment files.

If you don't want to post payments until the bank confirms they're processed, you can:

* In a payment journal with suggested payment lines, you can sort on either the **Exported to Payment File** column or the **Total Exported Amount** and then delete payment suggestions for open invoices for which payments were already made.
* On the **Suggest Vendor Payments** page, where you specify which payments to insert in the payment journal, you can select the **Skip Exported Payments** checkbox if you don't want to insert journal lines for payments that were already exported.

To see information about exported payments, choose the **Payment Export History** action.

### To re-export payments to a bank file

You can re-export payment files from the **Credit Transfer Registers** page. Before you delete or post payment journal lines, you can also re-export the payment file from the **Payment Journals** page by exporting it again. If you delete or post the payment journal lines after your export, you can re-export the same payment file from the **Credit Transfer Registers** page. Select the line for the batch of credit transfers that you want to re-export, and then use the **Reexport Payments to File** action.

> [!NOTE]  
> Exported EFT files are not shown on the **Credit Transfer Registers** page and cannot be re-exported.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Credit Transfer Registers**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select a payment export that you want to re-export, and then choose the **Reexport Payment to File** action.

## Posting the payments

After your bank processes the electronic payment, post the payments. For more information, see [Making Payments](payables-make-payments.md).

# Get the Business Central add-in for Excel

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes an add-in for Excel that lets users select the **Edit in Excel** action on certain pages to open the data in an Excel worksheet. This action is different than the **Open in Excel** action because it lets users make changes in Excel, then publish the changes back to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]

## Overview

### About the add-in

The add-in is called **Microsoft Dynamics Office Add-in** and it's available for installation from the [Office Store (AppSource)](https://appsource.microsoft.com/). With the add-in installed, the **Edit in Excel** action is available on most list and list part pages from the **Share** icon ![Share a page in another app.](media/share-icon.png). For more information about using the add-in, see [View and Edit in Excel From Business Central](across-work-with-excel.md).

> [!NOTE]
> The add-in works on Windows only.

### About deployment as an admin

With [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, there are a few deployment options for getting the add-in to users. One option is *individual acquisition*, where users install the add-in themselves. With this option, users must have access to downloading files from the Office Store. Another option is to set up *Centralized Deployment* in the Microsoft 365 admin center to automatically deploy the add-in to your entire organization, groups, or specific users. Centralized Deployment provides a way to get the add-in to users if your organization doesn't give users access to the Office Store.

For the user, the installation experience is different for the two deployment scenarios:

- With individual acquisition, the first time users choose the **Edit in Excel** action, the **New Office Add-in** pane opens in Excel. To install the add-in, the user chooses **Trust this add-in**, which in turn installs the add-in directly from the Office Store. Users then sign in to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] using their user name and password.

- With Centralized Deployment, the first time users choose the **Edit in Excel** action, the add-in is automatically installed in Excel from Centralized Deployment; not the Office Store. The only thing users have to do is sign in to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

With both these deployment options, the add-in is automatically configured to connect to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. A third deployment option is a manual installation of the add-in directly from Excel. With this option, users need to configure the add-in to connect to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

### <a name="switch"></a>Switching from individual acquisition to Centralized Deployment or the other way around

When you change from individual acquisition of the add-in to Centralized Deployment, or vice versa, it affects Excel files that users created before the transition. After the transition, users can still open any Excel worksheets previously created using the **Edit in Excel** action or created manually by configuring the Excel add-in. But they can't update the data in the file from Business Central or push updates to Business Central.

This situation happens because each Excel file gets assigned an "add-in" identifier. In the transition to or from Centralized Deployment, a different ID is assigned, so the earlier ID becomes blocked.

## Preparation (on-premises only)

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises requires that your environment is configured for the add-in. If not, the **Edit in Excel** action isn't available to users. Learn more in [Setting up the Business Central add-in for Excel in Business Central on-premises](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/configuring-excel-addin) in the Developer and IT Pro help.

## Deploy the add-in by using Centralized Deployment

Centralized Deployment is a feature in the Microsoft 365 admin center that you use to automatically install add-ins in users' Office apps, like Excel. To help you with Centralized Deployment, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes the **Excel Add-in Centralized Deployment** assisted setup.

### Before you begin

- Learn more about preventing users from downloading from the Office store at [Manage add-ins in the admin center](/microsoft-365/admin/manage/manage-addins-in-the-admin-center).
- Verify that Centralized Deployment works for your organization. Learn more at [Determine if Centralized Deployment of add-ins works for your organization](/microsoft-365/admin/manage/centralized-deployment-of-add-ins).
- Learn more about transitioning from individual acquisition at [Switching from individual acquisition to Centralized Deployment](#switch).

> [!NOTE]
> Enabling Centralized Deployment affects features that use the Excel add-in, such as the **Edit in Excel** action. It has no effect on other Excel-related features or permissions assigned to users in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

### Set up Centralized Deployment of the add-in

In this task, you work in both [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and the Microsoft 365 admin center.

1. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Excel Add-in Centralized Deployment**, and then choose the related link.
2. Read the information on the **Business Central Excel add-in setup** page and choose **Next**.
3. Sign in to the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2163967) and go to **Integrated Apps**<!--**Add-ins**-->.

    Complete the following steps to configure the add-in to deploy from the Office Store: 
    1. Choose **Get apps** to open Office Store (AppSource). <!--**Deploy Add-in** 5. In the **Deploy a new add-in**, select **Choose from the store**.-->
    2. Search for **Microsoft Dynamics Office Add-in**, then select **Get it now**. <!--On the **Select add-in** page, search for and select **Microsoft Dynamics Office Add-in** > **Add** > **Continue**.-->
    3. On the **Add Users** page, specify the users that you want to deploy the add-in for, then choose **Next**.<!--On the **Configure add-in**, specify the users that you want to deploy the add-in for.-->
    4. Review the **Accept permissions requests**, then choose **Next** > **Finish Deployment**.
    5. Wait for the green check mark next to **Deployed** appears for the add-in, then choose **Done**. <!--Select **Deploy** and wait til successful, then **Next** > **Continue**.-->

       The add-in appears on the **Add-ins** page. For more information about deploying add-ins in the Microsoft 365 admin center, see [Deploy add-ins in the admin center](/power-platform/admin/use-service-admin-role-manage-tenant?azure-portal=true).
4. Go back to **Excel Add-in Centralized Deployment** assisted setup in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], and choose **Next**.
5. Turn on **Use Centralized Deployment**, and choose **Finish**.

    If you don't turn on this switch, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] gets the add-in directly from the Office Store.

When finished, you can always change the deployment in the Microsoft 365 admin center, like assigning more users. For more information about deploying add-ins in the admin center, see [Deploy add-ins in the admin center](/power-platform/admin/use-service-admin-role-manage-tenant?azure-portal=true).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you have more than one environment, you must run the **Excel Add-in Centralized Deployment** assisted setup on each environment that you want to use Centralized Deployment. However, you don't have to configure the Centralized Deployment in Microsoft 365 again. The only thing you have to do is turn on the **Use Centralized Deployment** switch in the assisted setup. 

> [!NOTE]
> It can take up to 24 hours before the add-in deploys automatically in Excel for users.

## <a name="install"></a>Individual acquisition: Install the add-in manually for your own use

In most cases, when you open Excel from Business Central, the add-in is either installed automatically for you or you're prompted to install it. There might be cases, however, where you have to manually install the add-in.

1. Open Excel, then open any Excel workbook.
1. On the **Home** tab, select **Add-ins** > **More Add-ins**.
1. Go to **Admin managed** and look for **Microsoft Dynamics Office Add-In**. If you see it there, select it, and then choose **Add**. If you don't see it, go to **Store**, and then search for *Microsoft Dynamics Office add-In* and follow the instructions to add it.

When the add-in is installed, it shows up as a panel in Excel. Next, configure the connection.

### Configure the Business Central connection

If a user can't connect automatically, you can unblock them by asking them to follow these steps:

1. In the **Microsoft Dynamics** add-in pane in Excel, choose **Add server information**. If you don't see it, choose the ![More option button in Excel.](media/cogwheel.png) icon at the top to open the options dialog. 
2. For [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, set **Server URL** to `https://exceladdinprovider.smb.dynamics.com`. For [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, set it to the URL of the web client, like `https://myBCserver/240`.
3. Choose **OK**, and then confirm that the app reloads.
4. When prompted, sign in with your Business Central user name and password.
5. Optionally, choose the environment and company that you want to connect to.

The add-in is now connected to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], and you can edit data and publish the changes to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

## Prepare devices and network for the Excel add-in

Network services such as proxies or firewalls must allow routing between each client device on which the add-in is installed and many service endpoints. For a list of endpoints, go to [Preparing your network for the Excel add-In](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/configuring-network-for-addins).

## Troubleshooting

Sometimes, users run into problems with the Excel add-in. This section gives tips for how to unblock users in certain circumstances.

|Problem  |Solution or workaround  |Comments  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|The add-in doesn't start. <br><br>For example, the user gets the message "Add-in Warning: This add-in is no longer available" when trying to use the add-in. This particular problem can happen if Centralized Deployment is configured correctly, but the user wasn't assigned access.|Check whether the add-in is deployed centrally. Or, check whether the user is blocked from installing it locally. | The admin can configure Office so that users can't acquire add-ins. In that case, the admin must deploy the add-in centrally. For more information, see [Deploy add-ins in the admin center](/microsoft-365/admin/manage/manage-deployment-of-add-ins?view=o365-worldwide&preserve-view=true).|
|Data doesn't load into Excel.|Test the connection by opening another list in Excel from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Or, open the workbook in Excel in a browser.|If the user specified a company name that contains special characters, the add-in can't connect. |
|Data can't publish back to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].|Test the connection by opening the workbook in Excel in a browser. |Sometimes an extension can block the publishing job. If the page is extended or customized, remove the extensions, and then try again.|
|The dates are wrong.  |Excel might show times and dates in a different format than [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. This condition doesn't make them wrong, and the data in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't get messed up.|         |
|For some list pages, editing multiple lines in Excel consistently causes errors. This condition can occur if OData calls include FlowFields and fields outside of the repeater control.|On the **Web Services** page, select the **Exclude Non-Editable FlowFields** and **Exclude Fields Outside of the Repeater** checkboxes for the published page. Selecting these checkboxes excludes noneditable FlowFields and fields from the eTag calculation. |These checkboxes are hidden by default. To show them on the **Web Services** page, use [personalization](/dynamics365/business-central/ui-personalization-user). |
|Users can no longer sign in to the add-in. When they try to sign in, the process stops without completing.| This problem might happen because of an update that we made to the add-in, sometime in July 2022. For more information and a fix, see [Modify the Excel Add-in Configuration to Support July 2022 Update](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/update-excel-addin-configuration).|Applies to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises only.|
| The add-in communicates using the API v2.0 for Dynamics 365 Business Central, and any limitations of this API are automatically inherited. An example limitation is if you try to edit a list and the underlying card uses a confirmation dialog in its AL logic, for example, as its validation logic. | Sometimes there's nothing to do because it's a design choice that the user must explicitly confirm the change. If the confirmation is negligible when using **Edit in Excel**, then you can wrap the confirmation dialog call in an if-conditional statement that checks whether the client type is different from ODataV4, for example, `if SESSION.CurrentClientType() <> ClientType::ODataV4 then`. | There might be other clients that you want to remove the confirmation dialog from, such as OData and SOAP. |

## Known limitations in business logic

## Known limitations in metadata generation

When using **Edit in Excel** in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], either by selecting the **Edit in Excel** action on a page or when the Excel add-in loads after opening an Excel workbook, you might encounter the following error: _Metadata was unable to be retrieved for entity \<entity name\> as it was not found_.

This error occurs when the page you're attempting to modify becomes too complex for **Edit in Excel** to process effectively. The primary cause is the installation of multiple extensions that add fields with identical field names to the same parent page, leading to conflicts. It's also possible for a single extension to block the metadata generation.

### Single extension blocking metadata creation

Consider the following scenario involving extension _A_, which includes the page extension _CustomerCardExtA_ and the page _WebViewerA_ where _PageType = CardPart_.

When metadata is generated for the _Customer Card_ page, the algorithm evaluates each individual field, including those fields added by extensions. However, if extension _A_ is installed, this process fails because _WebViewerA_ doesn't share the same source table as the _Customer Card_ page.

To resolve this issue, you should add a _Customer_ `SourceTable` property to the _WebViewerA_ page. An example of this modification can be observed in the code snippets containing _CustomerCardExtB_ and _WebViewerB_.

In some cases, you might need to embed the `CardPart` on multiple pages without referencing a specific source table. For such scenarios, we recommend creating a separate `CardPart` for each page where you also need to generate metadata and refactoring the shared logic into a codeunit.

```AL
pageextension 50120 CustomerCardExtA extends "Customer Card"
{
    layout
    {
        addlast(content)
        {
            part("Bing WebViewer"; "WebViewer")
            {
                ApplicationArea = All;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

```AL
page 50120 "WebViewerA"
{
    ApplicationArea = All;
    Caption = 'WebViewer', Locked = true;
    PageType = CardPart;

    layout
    {
        area(Content)
        {
            usercontrol(WebViewer; WebPageViewer)
            {
                #region ControlAddInReady
                trigger ControlAddInReady(callbackUrl: Text)
                begin
                    CurrPage.WebViewer.Navigate('https://www.bing.com')
                end;
                #endregion ControlAddInReady
            }
        }
    }
}
```

```AL
pageextension 50120 CustomerCardExtB extends "Customer Card"
{
    layout
    {
        addlast(content)
        {
            part("Bing WebViewer"; "WebViewer")
            {
                ApplicationArea = All;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

```AL
page 50120 "WebViewerB"
{
    ApplicationArea = All;
    Caption = 'WebViewer', Locked = true;
    PageType = CardPart;
    SourceTable = Customer;

    layout
    {
        area(Content)
        {
            usercontrol(WebViewer; WebPageViewer)
            {
                #region ControlAddInReady
                trigger ControlAddInReady(callbackUrl: Text)
                begin
                    CurrPage.WebViewer.Navigate('https://www.bing.com')
                end;
                #endregion ControlAddInReady
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Multiple extensions causing collisions

To resolve this issue, there are two potential solutions:

1. **Disable extensions**: To identify which extension is causing the conflict, you can disable extensions that affect the page one at a time. However, this approach might not be ideal if the extensions in question are necessary for your business processes.

2. **Modify extension code**: This solution involves analyzing the root cause of the issue and addressing it by modifying the code of the conflicting extensions.

To better understand this issue, consider the following example involving the **Customer Card** page (ID 21). When you are on the **Customer List** page (ID 22) and select **Edit in Excel**, a web service is generated in the background that exposes the fields from the **Customer Card** page. This web service includes all page fields defined on the **Customer Card** page, while table fields are only exposed if they correspond to a page field or are part of the primary key.

When an extension is installed that extends the **Customer Card** page, the fields added by the extension are also exposed in the web service. While extensions can't create page fields with the same names as those fields already existing on the **Customer Card** page, conflicts can still arise when multiple extensions add fields with identical names.

For example, suppose the following extension, referred to as _A_, is installed:

```AL
using Microsoft.Sales.Customer;

// Extension A
pageextension 50101 CustomerCardExtA extends "Customer Card"
{
    layout
    {
        addLast(General)
        {
            field("ShoeSize"; Rec.ShoeSize)
            {
                ApplicationArea = ALL;
                Caption = 'ShoeSize';
            }
        }
    }
}

tableextension 50101 CustomerTableExtension extends Customer
{
    fields
    {
        field(50100; ShoeSize; Integer) { }
    }
}
```

Now, consider that another extension, referred to as _B_, is installed, which also modifies the **Customer Card** page:

```AL
using Microsoft.Sales.Customer;

// Extension B
pageextension 50102 CustomerCardExtB extends "Customer Card"
{
    layout
    {
        addLast(General)
        {
            field("ShoeSize"; Rec.ShoeSizeField)
            {
                ApplicationArea = ALL;
                Caption = 'ShoeSize';
            }
        }
    }
}

tableextension 50102 CustomerTableExtension extends Customer
{
    fields
    {
        field(50105; ShoeSizeField; Integer) { }
    }
}
```

In this scenario, both extensions A and B add a page field named `ShoeSize` to the **Customer Card** page. This condition results in a conflict, which leads to a metadata generation failure for the **Customer Card** page.

To resolve this issue, you need access to the code of at least one of the extensions, and then to modify the conflicting page field names to avoid collisions.

# Sell Items Assembled to Order

Items that are set up for assemble-to-order aren't expected to be in inventory and will be assembled when it's included on a sales order. An item is set up for assemble-to-order when the **Assembly Policy** field on the item card contains **Assemble-to-Order**. When you enter the item on a sales order line, an assembly order is automatically created and linked to the sales order.  

> [!NOTE]  
> If assemble-to-order items are already in inventory, you can deduct that quantity from the assembly order and reserve it from inventory. Learn more at [Sell Inventory Items in Assemble-to-Order Flows](assembly-how-to-sell-assemble-to-order-items-and-inventory-items-together.md).  

In this procedure, you process the sale of an item that will be assembled according to specifications that are requested by the customer. The steps include: 

* Creating a sales order line.
* Customizing the assembly item by editing its components and resources.
* Checking availability to establish a delivery date.
* Releasing the sales order to be assembled and immediately shipped.  

> [!NOTE]  
> The following procedure does not include the steps for creating a standard sales order that happen before the step where you enter the assemble-to-order item on a sales order line. Learn more about creating sales orders at [Sell Products with a Customer Sales Order](sales-how-sell-products.md).  

## To sell an item that is assembled to order

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Create a sales order. 
3. In the **No.** field, enter an item that is set up to be assembled to order.  
4. In the **Location Code** field, define which location the item will be sold from. The assembly process will occur at that location.  
5. In the **Quantity** field, enter how many units to sell.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  If one or more components of the requested assembly item quantity aren't available, an availability warning page opens. <!-- Check whether the field help would be useful. For more information, see Assembly Availability.  -->

    An assembly order is created and linked to the sales order line. The due date of the assembly order is the shipment date of the sales order line.  

    The quantity to sell is copied to the **Qty. to Assemble to Order** field, which indicates that the item setup expects you'll assemble the full quantity on the sales line. You can decrease the quantity to assemble, for example, if you know that some items are already available. Learn more at [Sell Inventory Items in Assemble-to-Order Flows](assembly-how-to-sell-inventory-items-in-assemble-to-order-flows.md).  

6. If the customer wants an additional item in a kit, on the **Lines** FastTab, choose the **Line** action, choose the **Assemble to Order** action, and then choose the **Assemble-to-Order Lines** action to view and change the standard assembly components. Alternatively, choose the **Qty. to Assemble to Order** field.  
7. On the **Assemble-to-Order Lines** page, create a new line of type **Item** for the additional assembly component.  

    You can also customize the order by increasing the quantity of one standard item in the kit. You can do this by increasing the value in the **Quantity Per** field on the specific assembly order line.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  The **Assemble-to-Order Lines** page only contains the basic fields for customizing the component list, adding item tracking numbers, or solving component availability issues. To add more assembly order information, such as the assembly order starting date, choose the **Show Documents** action. This opens a full view of the assembly order that is linked to the sales order line. You can't change the contents of most fields on the assembly order header, and you can't post assembly output from it. You must post the shipment of the sales order line.  
    >
    >  On the linked assembly orders, only the **Starting Date** field can be changed. Changing the starting date lets assembly workers specify that they're starting assembly earlier than the due date. All fields on the lines of the linked assembly order can be changed so that warehouse workers can enter consumption figures during the process.  

8. Review or react to component availability issues. For example, select a substitute item.  
9. Close the **Assemble-to-Order Lines** page. The linked assembly order is ready, and workers can start to assemble the customized items.  
10. On the sales order, choose the **Release** action to notify the assembly department that the assembly process can start. Learn more at [Assemble Items](assembly-how-to-assemble-items.md).  

> [!NOTE]  
> Item substitutions don't automatically replace an item with another item, for example, when creating a sales order or in a BOM. Instead, you'll be alerted to the fact that a substitution is available.

# Design Details: Warehouse Setup

Warehouse functionality in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] contains different levels of complexity, as defined by license permissions in the offered granules. The level of complexity in a warehouse solution is largely defined by the bin setup on location cards, which in turn is license-controlled so that access to bin setup fields is defined by the license. In addition, the application objects in the license govern which UI document to use for the supported warehouse activities.  
<!--
The following warehouse-related granules exist:  

- Basic Inventory (4010)  
- Bin (4170)  
- Put Away (4180)  
- Warehouse Receipt (4190)  
- Pick (4200)  
- Warehouse Shipment (4210)  
- Warehouse Management Systems (4620)  
- Internal Picks and Put-aways (4630)  
- Automated Data Capture System (4640)
- Bin Setup (4660)  

For more information about each granule, see [[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Price Sheets](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=238341) (requires PartnerSource account). -->

The following table shows which granules are required to define different warehouse complexity levels, which UI documents support each level, and which location codes reflect these levels in the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] demonstration database.

## Bin and Bin Content

A bin is a storage device designed to contain discrete parts. It is the smallest container unit in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Item quantities in bins are referred to as bin content. A lookup from the **Item** field or **Bin Code** field on any warehouse-related document line displays the calculated availability of the item in the bin.  

A bin content can be given a property of Fixed, Dedicated, or Default to define how the bin content can be used. Bins with none of these properties are referred to as floating bins.  

A fixed bin holds items that are assigned to the bin code in question. The Fixed bin property ensures that even if the bin content is momentarily emptied, the bin content does not disappear, and the bin is therefore selected again as soon as it has been replenished.  

A dedicated bin holds bin content that can only be picked for the dedicated resource, such as a machine center, that uses the bin in question. Other non-pick content, such as quantities outbound on a shipment posting, can still be consumed from a dedicated bin. Only bin content considered by the **Create Pick** algorithm is protected in a dedicated bin.  

The Default bin property is used by the system to suggest bins for warehouse activities. At WMS locations, the Default bin property is not used. At locations where bins are required, the property is used in inbound flows to specify where to place items. In outbound flows, the property is used to specify where to take items from.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  If the outbound items are placed in several bins, then items are first taken from the non-default bins, to empty that bin content, and then the remaining items are taken from the default bin.  

There can only be one default bin per item per location.  

## Bin Type

In WMS installations, you can restrict the warehouse activities that are allowed for a bin by assigning a bin type to it. The following bin types exist:  

|Bin Type|Description|  
|------------------|---------------------------------------|  
|RECEIVE|Items posted as received but not yet put away.|  
|SHIP|Items picked for warehouse shipment lines but not yet posted as shipped.|  
|PUT AWAY|Typically, items to be stored in large units of measure but that you do not want to access for picking purposes. Because these bins are not used for picking, either for production orders or shipments, your use of a Put Away type bin might be limited, but this bin type could be useful if you have purchased a large quantity of items. Bins of this type should always have a low bin-ranking, so that when received items are put away, other higher-ranking PUTPICK bins fixed to the item are put away first. If you are using this type of bin, you must regularly perform bin replenishment so that the items stored in these bins are also available in PUTPICK or PICK type bins.|  
|PICK|Items to be used for picking only. The replenishment of these bins can only be made by movement, not by put-away.|  
|PUTPICK|Items in bins that are suggested for both the put-away and pick functions. Bins of this type probably have different bin rankings. You can set up your bulk storage bins as this type of bin with low bin rankings compared to your ordinary pick bins or forward picking area bins.|  
|QC|This bin is used for inventory adjustments if you specify this bin on the location card in the **Adjustment Bin Code** field. You can also set up bins of this type for defective items and items being inspected. You can move items to this type of bin if you want to make them inaccessible to the usual item flow. **Note:**  Unlike all other bin types, the **QC** bin type has none of the item handling check boxes selected by default. This indicates that any content you place in a QC bin is excluded from item flows.|  

For all bin types, except PICK, PUTPICK, and PUTAWAY, no other activity is allowed for the bin than what is defined by its bin type. For example, a bin of type **Receive** can only be used to receive items into or pick items from.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Only movement can be made to bins of type RECEIVE and QC. Similarly, only movements can be made from bins of type SHIP and QC.  

## Bin Ranking

In advanced warehousing, you can automate and optimize how items are collected in put-away and pick worksheets by ranking bins so that items are suggested taken or placed according to rank criteria to use warehouse space optimally.  

Put-away processes are optimized according to bin ranking by suggesting higher-ranking bins before lower-ranking bins. Similarly, pick processes are optimized by first suggesting items from bin content with high bin ranking. Furthermore, bin replenishments are suggested from lower-ranking bins to higher-ranking bins.  

Bin ranking together with bin content information are the basic properties that allow users to slot items in the warehouse.  

## Bin Setup  
In advanced warehousing, bins can be set up with capacity values, such as quantity, total cubage, and weight to control which and how items are stored in the bin.  

On each item card, you can assign a unit of measure (UOM) for the item, such as pieces, pallets, liters, grams, or boxes. You can also have a base UOM for an item and specify larger UOMs that are based on it. For example, you can define a pallet to equal 16 pieces, the latter being the base UOM.  

If you want to set a maximum quantity of a specific item to be stored in an individual bin and the item has more than one UOM, then you must set the maximum quantity for every UOM that exists on the item card. Accordingly, if an item has been set up to be handled in pieces and pallets, then the **Max. Qty.** field on the **Bin Content** page for that item must also be in pieces and pallets. Otherwise, the allowed quantity for that bin is not calculated correctly.  

Before you set capacity restrictions for bin contents on a bin, you must first make sure that the UOM and dimensions of the item have been set up on the item card.  

> [!NOTE]  
> It is only possible to operate with multiple UOMs in WMS installations. I all other configurations, bin contents can only be in the base UOM. In all transactions with a UOM higher than the item's base UOM, the quantity is converted to the base UOM.  

## Zone

In advanced warehousing, bins can be grouped in zones to manage how the workflow of warehouse activities is directed.  

A zone could be a receiving zone or a stocking zone, and each zone can consist of one or several bins.  

Most properties assigned to a zone will by default be assigned to the bin that is created from that zone.  

## Class  
In advanced warehousing, you can assign warehouse class codes to items, bins, and zones to control where different item classes are stored, such as frozen goods. You can divide a zone into several warehouse classes. For example, items in the receiving zone can be stored as frozen, hazardous, or other class.  

When you work with warehouse classes and a default receiving/shipping bin, you must manually fill in the appropriate bins in the warehouse receipt and shipment lines.  

In inbound flows, the class code is only highlighted on inbound lines where the item class code does not match the default receiving bin. If the correct default bins are not assigned, then the quantity cannot be received.  

## Location

A location is a physical structure or place where inventory is received, stored, and shipped, potentially organized in bins. A location can be a warehouse, service car, showroom, plant, or an area in a plant.  

## First Expired First Out

If you select the **Pick According to FEFO** check box on the **Bin Policies** FastTab on the location card, then item-tracked items are picked according to their expiration date. The items with the earliest expiration dates are picked first.  

Warehouse activities in all pick and movement documents are sorted according to FEFO, unless the items in question already have serial/lot numbers assigned. If only a part of the quantity on the line already has serial/lot numbers assigned, then the remaining quantity to be picked is sorted according to FEFO.  

When picking by FEFO, the available items that expire first are gathered in a temporary item tracking list based on the expiration date. If two items have the same expiration date, then the item with the lowest lot or serial number is picked first. If the lot or serial numbers are the same, then the item that was registered first is selected first. Standard criteria for selecting items in pick bins, such as Bin Ranking and Break Bulk, are applied to this temporary FEFO item tracking list.  

## Put-away Template

The put-away template can be assigned to an item and to a location. The put-away template specifies a set of prioritized rules that must be respected when creating put-aways. For example, a put-away template may require that the item is placed in a bin with bin content that matches the UOM, and if a similar bin with enough capacity cannot be found, then the item must be placed in an empty bin.

# Viewing Service Statistics
You can use statistics to analyze service documents and determine how well you are managing your service processes. You can analyze service contracts, items, quotes, orders, invoices, and credit memos by choosing the **Statistics** action. For service items and contracts, you can also use the **Service Item Trendscape** or **Contract Trendscape** to view a summary of service ledger entries for a specific service item.   

## Viewing Statistics for Service Orders
The service order statistics feature gives you a quick overview of the contents of the entire service order, the details on the specific service lines, and information related to invoicing, shipping and consuming, and the customer's balance.  

The statistical data is displayed for a service order on the **Service Order Statistics** page for the relevant order. You can open the relevant statistics page from a service order. On the **Service Orders** page, choose **Statistics**. The FastTabs in this page show information such as quantity, amount, VAT, cost, profit, and customer credit limit. The amounts on the page are in the currency of the service order, unless otherwise indicated.  

### View totals for a service order  
You can view the total amount on the service lines, including and excluding VAT, VAT part, cost, and profit on the service lines. The page also displays item-specific information, such as weight, volume, and the quantity of parcels.  

### View shipping information  
You can see information about the items, resources, or costs to be shipped. To provide the information, the values specified in the **Qty. to Ship** field are used on each service line in the order.  

### View order details  
You can view information about the items, resource hours, and costs to be invoiced and consumed. The following table describes this information.  

|Column | Description|  
|------------|---------------------------------------|  
|**Invoicing**|Displays amounts that are to be posted as invoiced from the service order.|  
|**Consuming**|Displays the quantity and cost of items, or resources that will be posted as consumed.|  
|**Total**|Displays the total amounts on the service order that result from adding the invoicing amounts to the consuming amounts.|  

### Analyze service order lines  
You can analyze the information by the types of service lines included in the service order. The amounts are shown separately for:  

* Items  
* Resources  
* Costs and general ledger accounts  

### View customer information  
See the balance on the customer's account, in addition to the maximum credit that can be endued to the customer who you created the service document for.

## Viewing Service Item Statistics
On the **Service Item Statistics** page, you can see up-to-date information about a service item based the following service ledger entry types:  

* Resources  
* Items  
* Service cost  
* Service contracts  
* Total  

For each entry type, you can see the invoiced amount, usage (amount), cost amount, quantity, quantity invoiced and quantity consumed, profit amount and profit percentage. The profit percentage is calculated according to the following formula:  

* (Invoiced Amount - Usage (Cost)) x 100 / Invoiced Amount  

## Use Trendscapes
For service items and service contracts, the **Service Item Trendscape** or **Service Contract Trendscape** pages provides a scrollable summary of service ledger entries in a period of time for a specific service item or contract. To view the trendscape, open the service item or service contract, choose the **Statistics** action, and then choose **Trendscape**.

When you scroll the list, the amounts are calculated in the local currency according to the specified time interval. All amounts are calculated from service ledger entries, which are entries that are created when you post service orders or service invoices.

You can filter the list by specifing the service items to include.  

> [!Tip]  
>  If you have set the time interval to **Day** and you want to scroll over a long period, you can do it faster by shifting to a larger interval such as **Quarter**. When you have found the desired period, you can shift back to the original interval to see the data in more detail.   

## Viewing Gains and Losses on Contracts  
A contract gain or loss entry is generated when a contract quote is converted to a service contract, when contract lines are added or removed from a service contract, or when a contract is canceled. You can view contract gains or losses on the following pages.  

|Page | Description|  
|----------------|---------------------------------------|  
|**Contract Gain/Loss (Contracts)**|To view the contract gain/loss by service contract.|  
|**Contract Gain/Loss (Groups)**|To view the contract gain/loss by service contract group.|  
|**Contract Gain/Loss (Customers)**|To view the contract gain/loss by customer.|  
|**Contract Gain/Loss (Reasons)**|To view the contract gain/loss by reason code.|  
|**Contract Gain/Loss (Resp.Ctr)**|To view the contract gain/loss by responsibility center.|  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter the name of the page to display, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the filter criteria you want to apply. For example, on the **Contract Gain/Loss (Reasons)** page, choose a value for **Reason Code Filter**.  
3. Choose the **Show Matrix** action.

## Viewing Statistics for Posted Service Documents
The service statistics feature lets you gain a statistical overview of the contents of posted service documents, such as a posted shipment, posted invoice, and posted credit memo.  

The statistical information is displayed in the statistics page for the corresponding posted service document. You can open the relevant statistics page from posted service shipment, posted service invoice, or posted service credit memo documents. For each of these document types, choose the **Statistics** action. For example, from the **Posted Service Invoices** page, choose the **Statistics** action.  

### Posted Service Shipment Statistics  
The **Service Shipment Statistics** page provides an overview of a posted service shipment. This includes information about the physical contents of the shipment, such as quantity of the shipped items, resource hours or costs, and weight and volume of the shipped items.  

### Posted Service Invoice Statistics  
You can see a statistical summary on a posted service invoice on the **Service Invoice Statistics** page. You can view the totals of the posted service invoice. The data includes total amount on the service lines (including and excluding VAT) that has been posted as invoiced, VAT part, cost, and profit on the posted invoice. The page also displays information about the following:  

* The items on the service invoice lines, such as weight, volume, and the quantity of parcels.  
* The balance on the customer's account, and the maximum credit that you can extend the customer.  

### Posted Service Credit Memo Statistics  
You can use the **Service Credit Memo Statistics** page to get a statistical overview of the lines in a posted service credit memo. The overview can include:

* The total amounts on the posted credit memo, displayed as quantity, amount, VAT, cost and profit. There is also information about the items on the service lines of the posted credit memo, such as quantity, weight, and volume.  
* General information about the customer, such as the customer's credit limit and balance on the account.

# Move Items Internally in Basic Warehouse Configurations

You might want to move items between bins without a demand from a source document. For example, as part of the following activities:

* Reorganize your warehouse.
* Bring items to an inspection area.
* Move extra items to and from a production area. 

How you move items depends on how your warehouse is set up as a location. Learn more at [Setting Up Warehouse Management](warehouse-setup-warehouse.md).

In warehouse configurations where the **Bin Mandatory** setup toggle is turned on, but not **Directed Pick and Put-away** you can register unplanned movements on the following pages:  

* On the **Internal Movement** page.
* On the **Item Reclassification Journal** page.  

## Internal movements

The **Internal Movements** page lets you specify Take and Place lines when there isn't a demand from a source document. The Internal Movement page is like a worksheet for organizing things. You can't process the actual movement directly from it. When a line is filled in, use the **Create Inventory Movement** action to send the line to the **Inventory Movement** page, which is where you process and register the movement.

### To move items as an internal movement

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Internal Movements**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose **New** action. Make sure that the **No.** field on the **General** FastTab is filled in.
3. In the **Location Code** field, enter the location where the movement takes place.  

    If the location is your default location as a warehouse employee, the location code is added automatically.  
4. In the **To Bin Code** field, enter the code for the bin that you want to move the items to.

    For example, in production, the bin could be the open shop floor bin defined on the location card or work center.  
5. In the **Due Date** field, enter the date by which to complete the movement.  
6. On each line, fill in the fields as necessary. Internal movement documents have one line per movement. The line contains both the take and the place actions.
7. Choose the **Item No.** field to open the **Bin Contents List** page. Select the item to move based on its availability in bins. You can also choose the **Get Bin Contents** action to fill the internal movement lines based on your filters.  

    After you select the item, the **From Bin Code** field is automatically filled in according to the selected bin content. You can choose any bin where the item is available. The **Item No.** and **From Bin Code** fields are related. Changing the value in one field might change the value in the other.  

    The **To Bin Code** field is filled in with the value you entered on the header. You can change it on the line to any other bin code that isn’t blocked or dedicated for special purposes. Learn more at [The Dedicated field](warehouse-how-to-create-individual-bins.md#the-dedicated-field).  

8. After you define which bins you want to move the items from and to, enter the quantity to move in the **Quantity** field.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > The quantity must be available in the bin specified in the **From Bin Code** field.  

9. When you're ready to process the movement, choose the **Create Inventory Movement** action.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  After you create the movement, the internal movement lines are deleted.  

Perform the rest of the unplanned movement on the **Inventory Movement** page in the same way as you would for a movement based on source documents.

### To record the inventory movement

1. On the **Inventory Movement** page, open the document to record the movement for.  
2. In the **Bin Code** field on the movement lines, the bin where the items must be picked from is where the item is available. You can change the bin if needed.
3. Perform the move and enter the information for the moved quantity in the **Qty. to Handle** field. The value on the Take and the Place lines must be the same. Otherwise, you can't register the movement.

    If you must take the items for a line from more than one bin, for example because the full quantity isn't in the bin, use the **Split Line** action on the **Lines** FastTab. The action creates a line for the remaining quantity to handle.  
4. Choose the **Register Invt. Movement** action.  

The following happens during the posting process:

* Warehouse entries indicate that the quantity is transferred from the take bins to the place bins.

## To move items with the item reclassification journal

Instead of using movement documents, you can record movements by reclassifying bin codes on items. Learn more at [Count, Adjust, and Reclassify Inventory Using Journals](inventory-how-count-adjust-reclassify.md).

> [!NOTE]  
> Movements posted with reclassification journals don't make the movement documents ready to move.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Item Reclass. Journal**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On each journal line, define the bins to move the items from and to by filling in the **Bin Code** and the **New Bin Code** fields.  

    1. To move a bin's entire contents to another bin, choose the **Get Bin Contents** action.  
    2. Use the filters to find the bin that contains the items you'd like to move, and then choose **OK**. The journal lines are filled with the contents of the bin.  
3. Fill in the remaining fields on each journal line.
4. Post the reclassification journal.

# Design Details: Known Item Application Issue
This article addresses an issue where the inventory level is zero although open item ledger entries exist in  [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

The article starts by listing typical symptoms of the issue, followed by the basics of item application to support the described reasons for this issue. At the end of the article is a workaround to address such open item ledger entries.  

## Symptoms of the Issue  
 Typical symptoms of the issue with zero inventory although open item ledger entries exist are the following:  

-   The following message when you try to close an inventory period: “The inventory cannot be closed because there is negative inventory for one or more items.”  

-   An item ledger entry situation where both an outbound item ledger entry and its related inbound item ledger entry are open.  

     See the following example of an item ledger entry situation.  

     |Entry No.|Posting Date|Entry Type|Document Type|Document No.|Item No.|Location Code|Quantity|Cost Amount (Actual)|Invoiced Quantity|Remaining Quantity|Open|  
     |---------|------------|----------|-------------|------------|--------|-------------|--------|------------------------|-----------------|------------------|----|  
     |333|01/28/2018|Sale|Sales Shipment|102043|TEST|BLUE|-1|-10|-1|-1|Yes|  
     |334|01/28/2018|Sale|Sales Shipment|102043|TEST|BLUE|1|10|1|1|Yes|  

## Basics of Item Application  
 An item application entry is created for every inventory transaction to link the cost recipient to its cost source so that the cost can be forwarded according to the costing method. For more information, see [Design Details: Item Application](design-details-item-application.md).  

-   For an inbound item ledger entry, the item application entry is created when the item ledger entry is created.  

-   For an outbound item ledger entry, the item application entry is created when the item ledger entry is posted, IF there is an open inbound item ledger entry with available quantity that it can apply to. If there is no open inbound item ledger entry that it can apply to, then the outbound item ledger entry remains open until an inbound item ledger entry that it can apply to is posted.  

 There are two types of item application:  

-   Quantity Application  

-   Cost Application  

### Quantity Application  
 Quantity applications are made for all inventory transactions and are created automatically, or manually in special processes. When made manually, quantity applications are referred to as fixed application.  

 The following diagram shows how quantity applications are made.  

![Flow of cost adjustment from purchase to sale.](media/helene/TechArticleInventoryZero2.png "Flow of cost adjustment from purchase to sale")

 Notice above that item ledger entry 1 (Purchase) is both the supplier of the item and the cost source to the applied item ledger entry, item ledger entry 2 (Sale).  

> [!NOTE]  
>  If the outbound item ledger entry is valued by average cost, then the applied inbound item ledger entry is not the unique cost source. It merely plays a part in the calculation of the average cost of the period.  

### Cost Application  
Cost applications are only created for inbound transactions where the **Appl.-from Item Entry** field is filled to provide a fixed application. This typically happens in connection with a sales credit memo or an undo shipment scenario. The cost application ensures that the item re-enters inventory with the same cost as when it was shipped.  

The following diagram shows how cost applications are made.  

|Entry No.|Posting Date|Entry Type|Document Type|Document No.|Item No.|Location Code|Quantity|Cost Amount (Actual)|Invoiced Quantity|Remaining Quantity|Open|  
|---------|------------|----------|-------------|------------|--------|-------------|--------|------------------------|-----------------|------------------|----|  
|333|01/28/2018|Sale|Sales Shipment|102043|TEST|BLUE|-1|-10|-1|-1|Yes|  
|334|01/28/2018|Sale|Sales Shipment|102043|TEST|BLUE|1|10|1|1|Yes|  

 Notice above that inbound item ledger 3 (Sales Return) is a cost recipient for the original outbound item ledger entry 2 (Sale).  

## Illustration of a Basic Cost Flow  
 Assume a complete cost flow where an item is received, is shipped and invoiced, is returned with exact\-cost reversal, and is shipped again.  

 The following diagram illustrates the cost flow.  

![Flow of cost adjustment from sale to sales return.](media/helene/TechArticleInventoryZero4.png "Flow of cost adjustment from sale to sales return")

 Notice above that the cost is forwarded to item ledger entry 2 (Sale), then to item ledger entry 3 (Sales Return), and finally to item ledger entry 4 (Sale 2).  

## Reasons for the Issue  
 The issue with zero inventory although open item ledger entries exist can be caused by the following scenarios:  

-   Scenario 1: A shipment and invoice is posted although the item is not available. The posting is then exact-cost reversed with a sales credit memo.  

-   Scenario 2: A shipment is posted although the item is not available. The posting is then undone with the Undo Shipment function.  

 The following diagram illustrates how item applications are made in both scenarios.  

![Flow of cost adjustment goes in both directions.](media/helene/TechArticleInventoryZero6.png "Flow of cost adjustment goes in both directions")  

 Notice above that a cost application is made (represented by the blue arrows) to ensure that item ledger entry 2 (Sales Return) is assigned the same costs as the item ledger entry that it reverses, item ledger entry 1 (Sale 1). However, a quantity application (represented by the red arrows) is not made.  

 Item ledger entry 2 (Sales Return) cannot be both a cost recipient of the original item ledger entry and at the same time be a supplier of items and their source of costs. Therefore, the original item ledger entry 1 (Sale 1) remains open until a valid source appears.  

## Identifying the Issue  
 To find out if the open item ledger entries are created, do as follows for the respective scenario:  

 For scenario 1, identify the issue as follows:  

-   In the **Posted Sales Credit Memo** or **Posted Return Receipt** page, look up from the **Appl.\-from Item Entry** field to see if the field is populated, and in that case to which item ledger entry the return receipt is cost applied.  

 For scenario 2, identify the issue in either of the following ways:  

-   Look for an open outbound item ledger entry and an inbound item ledger entry with same number in the **Document No.** field, and Yes in the **Correction** field. See the following example of such an item ledger entry situation.  

|Entry No.|Posting Date|Entry Type|Document Type|Document No.|Item No.|Location Code|Quantity|Cost Amount (Actual)|Invoiced Quantity|Remaining Quantity|Open|Correction|  
|---------|------------|----------|-------------|------------|--------|-------------|--------|------------------------|-----------------|------------------|----|---------|
|333|01/28/2018|Sale|Sales Shipment|102043|TEST|BLUE|-1|-10|-1|-1|Yes|No|  
|334|01/28/2018|Sale|Sales Shipment|102043|TEST|BLUE|1|10|1|1|Yes|**Yes**|  

-   On the **Posted Sales Shipment** page, look up from the **Appl.-from Item Entry** field to see if the field is populated, and in that case to which item ledger entry the return receipt is cost applied.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  Cost applications cannot be identified on the **Applied Item Entries** page because that page only shows quantity applications.  

 For both scenarios, identify the involved cost application as follows:  

1.  Open the **Item Application Entry** table.  

2.  Filter on the **Item Ledger Entry No.** field using the number of the Sales Return item ledger entry.  

3.  Analyze the item application entry, taking note of the following:  

     If the **Outbound Item Entry No.** field is populated for an inbound item ledger entry (positive quantity), then it means that the inbound item ledger entry is the cost recipient of the outbound item ledger entry.  

     See the following example of an item application entry.  

     |Entry No.|Item Ledger Entry No.|Inbound Item Entry No.|Outbound Item Entry No.|Quantity|Posting Date|Cost Application|  
     |---------|---------------------|----------------------|-----------------------|--------|------------|----------------|  
     |299|334|334|333|1|01/28/2018|Yes|  
<!--![Why is inventory zero 8.](media/helene/TechArticleInventoryZero8.png "Whyisinventoryzero\_8")  -->

 Notice above that inbound item ledger entry 334 is cost applied to outbound item ledger entry 333.  

## Workaround for the Issue  
 On the **Item Journal** page, post the following lines for the item in question:  

-   A positive adjustment to close the open outbound item ledger entry.  

-   A negative adjustment with the same quantity.  

     This adjustment balances the inventory increase caused by the positive adjustment and closes the open inbound item ledger entry.  

 The result is that inventory is zero and all item ledger entries are closed.

# Assign permissions to users and groups

[!INCLUDE [2023rw1-sec-group-long](includes/2023rw1-sec-group-long.md)]

The [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] security system controls which objects a user can access within each database or environment, in combination with the user's license. For each user you can specify whether they're able to read, modify, or enter data in database objects. For more information, see [Data Security](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/security/data-security?tabs=object-level) in the developer and administration content for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

Before you assign permissions to users and user groups, you must define who can sign in by creating users according to their license. For more information, see [Create Users According to Licenses](ui-how-users-permissions.md).

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], there are two levels of permissions to database objects:

- Overall permissions according to the license, also referred to as the entitlement.

  The licenses include default permission sets. Starting in 2022 release wave 1, admins can customize these default permissions for the relevant license types. For more information, see [Configure permissions based on licenses](ui-how-users-permissions.md#licensespermissions).  

- Detailed permissions that you assign in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

This article describes how to define, use, and apply permissions in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to change the default configuration.  

[!INCLUDE [admin-gdap-users](includes/admin-gdap-users.md)]  
For more information, see [Delegated administrator access to Business Central Online](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/delegated-admin).  

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online includes default user groups that are assigned to users automatically based on their license. You can change the default configuration by modifying or adding security groups, permission sets, and permissions. The following table outlines key scenarios for modifying the default permissions.

> [!NOTE]
> An broader way to define which features users have access to is by setting the **Experience** field on the **Company Information** page. For more information, see [Change Which Features are Displayed](ui-experiences.md).
>
> You can also define the features that are available to users in the user interface and how they interact with them through pages. You do this through profiles that you assign to different types of users according to their job role or department. For more information, see [Manage Profiles](admin-users-profiles-roles.md) and [Customizing [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]](ui-customizing-overview.md).

## Create a permission set

> [!NOTE]
> In 2022 release wave 2 we made it easier to add permissions to permission sets. Rather than adding permissions individually, you can add entire permission sets. If needed, you can then exclude individual permissions in them. For more information, see [To add other permission sets](#to-add-other-permission-sets). To make that possible, we replaced the Permission Set page with a new one. The key differences are the new **Permission Sets** and **Results** panes, and the **Included permissions** FactBox. To continue using the replaced Permissions page, on the **Permission Sets** page, choose the **Permissions (legacy)** action.

Maintenance is also easier. When you add a system permission, your user-defined permission set will be automatically updated with any changes that Microsoft makes to those permissions.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Permission Sets**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action.
3. On the new line, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
4. Choose the **Permissions** action.
5. On the **Permission Set** page, in the **Type** field, include or exclude permissions to the object as follows:

  To include the permission, choose **Include**, and then choose level of access to give in the **Read Permission**, **Insert Permission**, **Modify Permission**, **Delete Permission**, and **Execute Permission** fields. The following table describes the options.

  |Option|Description|Ranking|
  |------|-----------|-------|
  |**Blank**|The user can't perform the action on the object.|Lowest|  
  |**Yes**|The user can perform the action on the object.|Highest|
  |**Indirect**|The user can perform the action on the object, but only through another related object that the user has full access to. For more information, see [Example - Indirect Permission](#example---indirect-permission) in this article, and [Permissions Property](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/properties/devenv-permissions-property#example---indirect-permission) in Developer and IT-Pro Help.|Second highest|
  
  To exclude the permission, or one or more access levels, choose **Exclude**, and then choose the level of access to give. The following table describes the options.

  |Option|Description|
  |------|-----------|-------|
  |**Blank**|Use the access level based on the hierarchy of permissions in the set.  |
  |**Exclude**|Remove the specific access level for the object.|
  |**Reduce to indirect**|Change the access level to Indirect if any permission sets give Direct access to the object. For example, choose this option if the permission set gives Direct access to G/L entries but you don't want users to have full access to the entries.|
  
  > [!NOTE]
  > If a permission is in a permission set that is included, and is also in a permission set that is excluded, the permission will be excluded.

6. Use the **Object Type** and **Object ID** fields to specify the object you're giving access to.

  > [!TIP]
  > New lines show default values. For example, the **Object Type** field contains **Table Data**, and the **Object ID** field contains **0**. The default values are just placeholders, and aren't used. You must choose a type of object and an object in the **Object ID** field before you can create another new line.

7. Optional: If you're defining permissions for a Table Data object type, in the **Security Filter** field you can filter the data that a user can access in fields on the selected table. For example, you might want to let a user access only records that contain information about a particular customer. For more information, see [Security filters limit a user's access to specific records in a table](#security-filters-limit-a-users-access-to-specific-records-in-a-table) and [Using Security Filters](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/security/security-filters).
8. Optional: On the **Permission Sets** pane, add one or more other permission sets. For more information, see [To add other permission sets](#to-add-other-permission-sets).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Use caution when assigning **Insert Permission** or **Modify Permission** to the **9001 User Group Member** or **9003 User Group Permission Set** table. Any users assigned to the permission set could potentially assign themselves to other user groups, which in turn might give them unintended permissions.

### Example - Indirect Permission

You can assign Indirect permission to allow a user to use an object, but only through another object. For example, a user has permission to run codeunit 80, Sales-Post. The Sales-Post codeunit performs many tasks, including modifying table 37, Sales Line. When the user posts a sales document using the Sales-Post codeunit, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] checks whether the user has permission to modify the Sales Line table. If not, the codeunit can't complete its tasks, and the user receives an error message. If so, the codeunit runs successfully.

However, the user doesn't need to have full access to the Sales Line table to run the codeunit. If the user has Indirect permission for the Sales Line table, the Sales-Post codeunit runs successfully. When a user has Indirect permission, they can only modify the Sales Line table by running the Sales-Post codeunit or another object that has permission to modify the Sales Line table. The user can only modify the Sales Line table when doing so from supported application areas. The user can't run the feature inadvertently or maliciously by other methods.

### To add other permission sets

Expand a permission set by adding other permission sets to it. Afterward, you can include or exclude specific permissions, or entire permission sets, in each set you add. This includes permissions in the Extension and System type permission sets, which otherwise isn't allowed. Exclusions apply only to the permission set you're expanding. The original set isn't affected.

On the **Permission Set** page, add a permission set on the **Permission Sets** pane. The **Result** pane lists all added permission sets. To explore the permissions that are included in a set you've added, choose the set on the Result pane and the **Included permissions** FactBox will show the permissions.

On the **Result** pane, use the **Inclusion Status** field to identify the permission sets in which you've excluded permissions or permission sets. If something's been excluded, the status will be **Partial**.

For an overall view of permissions in the permission set, choose the **View all permissions** action. The **Expanded Permissions** page shows all permissions that were already assigned to the permission set and the permissions in the added permission sets.

To fully exclude all permissions from a permission set, on the **Result** pane, select the line, choose **Show more options**, and then choose **Exclude**. When you exclude a permission set, a line is created on the **Permission Sets** pane of the type Excluded. If you've excluded a permission set, but want to include it again, delete the line on the **Permission Sets** pane.

To fully or partially exclude a specific permission in a set you've added, under **Permissions**, create a line for the object. The access level fields, Insert Permission, Modify Permission, and so on, will all contain **Exclude**. To allow a certain access level, choose the appropriate option.

Excluding a permission set excludes all of the permissions in the set. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates permissions as follows:

1. Calculate the full list of included permissions
2. Calculate the full list of excluded permissions
3. Remove excluded permissions from the list of included permissions (removing an indirect permission is the same as Reduce to Indirect)

## Copy a permission set

Create a new permission set by copying another. The new set will include all of the permissions and permission sets from the set you copied. How the permissions and permission sets are arranged in the new permission set differs, depending on your choice in the **Copy operation** field. The following table describes the options.

|Option  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|**Copy by reference**     | The original permission set and all of the permission sets that were added to it are listed on the **Results** pane.       |
|**Flat permission copy**  | All permissions from all permission sets are included in a flat list on the **Permissions pane**. Permissions are not organized by permission set.        |
|**Clone**     | Create an exact copy of the original permission set.        |

1. On the **Permission Sets** page, select the line for a permission set that you want to copy, and then choose the **Copy Permission Set** action.
2. On the **Copy Permission Set** page, specify the name of the new permission set.
3. In the **Copy operation** field, specify how to arrange permission in the new permission set.
4. Optional: If you're adding a System permission set, you might want to be notified if the name or content of the original permission set changes in a future version. This lets you consider whether to update your user-defined permission set. To receive a notification, turn on the **Notify on Changed Permission Set** toggle.

> [!NOTE]
> The notification requires that the **Original System permission set changed** notification is enabled on the **My Notifications** page.

## Create or modify permissions by recording your actions

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Permission Sets**, and then choose the related link.

    Alternatively, on the **Users** page, choose the **Permission Sets** action.
2. On the **Permission Sets** page, choose the **New** Action.
3. On a new line, fill in the fields as necessary.
4. Choose the **Permissions** action.
5. On the **Permissions** page, choose the **Record Permissions** action, and then choose the **Start** action.  
    Recording must be done either by using the **Open this page in a new windows** (pop-out) feature to have the **Permissions** recording window side-by-side, or by working within the same tab.  
    A recording process now starts and captures all of your actions in the user interface.
6. Go to the various pages and activities in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] that you want users with this permission set to access. You must carry out the tasks that you want to record permissions for.
7. When you want to finish the recording, return to the **Permissions** page, and then choose the **Stop** action.
8. Choose the **Yes** button to add the recorded permissions to the new permission set.
9. For each object in the recorded list, specify whether users are able to insert, modify, or delete records in the recorded tables.

### To export and import a permission set

To quickly set up permissions, you can import permission sets that you exported from another [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] tenant.

In multi-tenant environments, a permission set will be imported into a specific tenant. In other words, the scope of the import is *Tenant*.

1. In tenant 1, on the **Permission Sets** page, select the line or lines for the permission sets to export, and then choose the **Export Permission Sets** action.

    An XML file is created in the download folder on your machine. By default, the name is *Export Permission Sets.xml*.

2. In tenant 2, on the **Permission Sets** page, select the **Import Permission Sets** action.
3. On the **Import Permission Sets** dialog page, consider if you want to merge existing permission sets with any new permission sets in the XML file.

    If you select the **Update existing permissions** checkbox, existing permission sets that match names in the XML file will be merged with the imported permission sets.

    If you don't select the **Update existing permissions** checkbox, permission sets that match names in the XML file will be skipped during import. In that case, you'll be notified about permission sets that are skipped.

4. From the **Import** dialog page, find and select the XML file to be imported, and then choose the **Open** action.

The permission sets are imported.

## Remove obsolete permissions from all permission sets

On the **Permission Sets** page, choose the **Remove Obsolete Permissions** action.

## Set up time constraints for users

Administrators can define periods of time during which specified users are able to post. Administrators can also specify if the system logs how much time users are signed in. Similarly, administrators can assign responsibility centers to users. For more information, see [Work with Responsibility Centers](inventory-responsibility-centers.md).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **User Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **User Setup** page opens, choose the **New** action.
3. In the **User ID** field, enter the ID of a user, or choose the field to see all current Windows users in the system.
4. Fill in the fields as necessary.

## Control access to specific companies

When you have multiple companies in Business Central, managing permissions across companies requires extra consideration. You might not want users to have identical access rights to all companies. Instead, you may need to grant users' permissions based on their company affiliations. To support this scenario, when you assign permission sets to individual users or security groups, you have the option to select a specific company to which the permission set applies. The company isn't explicitly specified within the permission set, but rather when the permission set is assigned to the user or security group.

If you don't specify the company when assigning a permission set, the permission set then applies to all companies. If you want a permission set to apply to more than one company, but not all companies, add the permission set specifically for each company separately.

Learn how at [Assign permission sets to users](#assign-permission-sets-to-users) or [Assign permissions to a security group](ui-security-groups.md#assign-permissions-to-a-security-group).

## Manage permissions through user groups

User groups help you manage permission sets across the company. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online includes default user groups that are assigned to users automatically based on their license. You can add users manually to a user group, and you can create new user groups as copies of existing ones.  

You start by creating a user group. Then you assign permission sets to the group to define which object users of the group can access. When you add user to the group, the permission sets defined for the group will apply to the user.

Permission sets assigned to a user through a user group stay synchronized. A change to the user group permissions is automatically propagated to the users. If you remove a user from a user group, the involved permissions are automatically revoked.

### To add users to a user group

The following procedure explains how to create user groups manually. To create user groups automatically, see [To copy a user group and all its permission sets](#to-copy-a-user-group-and-all-its-permission-sets).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **User Groups**, and then choose the related link.

    1. Alternatively, on the **Users** page, choose the **User Groups** action.
2. On the **User Group** page, choose the **User Group Members** action.
3. On the **User Group Members** page, choose the **Add Users** action.

### To copy a user group and all its permission sets

To quickly define a new user group, you can copy all permission sets from an existing user group to your new user group.

> [!NOTE]
> The user group members are not copied to the new user group. You must add them manually afterwards. For more information, see the [To add users to a user group](#to-add-users-to-a-user-group) section.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **User Groups**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the user group that you want to copy, and then choose the **Copy User Group** action.
3. In the **New User Group Code** field, enter a name for the group, and then choose the **OK** button.

The new user group is added to the **User Groups** page. Proceed to add users. For more information, see the [To add users to a user group](#to-add-users-to-a-user-group) section.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You'll get a validation error if you're trying to assign a user group to the user that refers to a permission set which was defined in an uninstalled extension. It's because the App ID of the extension is validated whenever it's referenced. To assign that user group to a user, you can either re-install the extension, remove the reference of the uninstalled extension from the permission set, or remove that permission set from the user group.

### To assign permission sets to user groups

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **User Groups**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the user group that you want to assign permission to.  

    Any permission sets that are already assigned to the user are displayed in the **Permission Sets** FactBox.
3. Choose the **User Permission Sets** action to open the **User Permission Sets** page.
4. On the **User Permission Sets** page, on a new line, fill in the fields as necessary.

### To assign a permission set on the Permission Set by User Group page

The following procedure explains how to assign permission sets to a user group on the **Permission Set by User Group** page.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Users**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Users** page, select the relevant user, and then choose the **Permission Set by User Group** action.
3. On the **Permission Set by User Group** page, select the **[user group name]** field on a line for the relevant permission set to assign the set to the user group.
4. Select the **All User Groups** checkbox to assign the permission set to all user groups.

You can also assign permissions sets directly to a user.

## Assign permission sets to users

A permission set is a collection of permissions for specific database objects. All users must be assigned one or more permission sets before they can access [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

A [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] solution contains predefined permission sets that are added by Microsoft or by your solution provider. You can also add new permission sets tailored to meet the needs of your organization. For more information, see the [Create a permission set](#create-a-permission-set) section.

> [!NOTE]
> If you do not want to restrict a user's access more than already defined by the license, you can assign a special permission set called SUPER to the user. This permission set ensures that the user can access all objects specified in the license.
>
> A user with the Essential license and the SUPER permission set has access to more functionality than users with the Team Member license and the SUPER permission set.

You can assign permissions sets to users in two ways:

- From the **User Card** page by selecting permission sets to assign to the user.
- From the **Permission Set by User** page by selecting users that a permission set is assigned to.

### To assign a permission set on a user card

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Users**, and then choose the related link.
1. Select the user that you want to assign permission to.

   Any permission sets that are already assigned to the user are displayed in the **Permission Sets** FactBox.
1. Choose the **Edit** action to open the **User Card** page.
1. On the **User Permission Sets** FastTab, on a new line, fill in the fields as necessary. For more information, see [Create or edit a permission set](ui-define-granular-permissions.md#create-a-permission-set).

   If you want the permission set to apply to a specific company, set the **Company** field to that company. If you want the permission set to apply to all companies, leave the **Company** field blank. [Learn more](#control-access-to-specific-companies).

## To assign a permission set on the Permission Set by User page

This method makes it easier for you to assign different permission sets to multiple users. 

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Users**, and then choose the related link.
1. On the **Users** page, choose the **Permission Set by User** action.
1. If you want the permission sets to apply only to a specific company, set the **Company name** field to that company. If you want the permission set to apply to all companies, leave the **Company name** field blank. [Learn more](#control-access-to-specific-companies).
1. On the **Permission Set by User** page, select the **[user name]** checkbox on a line for the relevant permission set to assign the set to the user.

    Select the **All Users** checkbox to assign the permission set to all users.

## Get an overview of a user's permissions

You can view other users' effective permissions only if you're assigned to the SECURITY or SUPER permissions. 

The **Effective Permissions** page offers additional information about the source of each permission. For example, whether the source is a security group, or a permission is inherited. The page also contains a column where administrators can review the security filters that are applied. To learn more about security filters, go to [Security filters limit a user's access to specific records in a table](#security-filters-limit-a-users-access-to-specific-records-in-a-table).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Users**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the card of the relevant user.
3. Choose the **Effective Permissions** action.

    The **Permissions** part lists all the database objects that the user has access to. You can't edit this section.

    The **By Permission Set** part shows the assigned permission sets through which the permissions are granted to the user, the source and type of the permission set, and to which extent the different access types are permitted.

    For each row that you select in the **Permissions** section, the **By Permission Set** section shows which permission set or sets that the permission is granted through. In this section, you can edit the value in each of the five access type fields, **Read Permission**, **Insert Permission**, **Modify Permission**, **Delete Permission**, **Execute Permission**.

    > [!NOTE]  
    > Only permission sets of type **User-Defined** can be edited.
    >
    > Rows of source Entitlement originate from the subscription license. The permission values of the entitlement overrule values in other permission sets if they have a higher ranking. A value in a non-entitlement permission set that has a higher ranking than the related value in the entitlement will be surrounded by brackets to indicate that it is not effective as it is overruled by the entitlement.
    >
    > For an explanation of ranking, see [Create a permission set](ui-define-granular-permissions.md#create-a-permission-set).  

4. To edit a permission set, in the **By Permission Set** part, on the line for a relevant permission set of type **User-Defined**, choose one of the five access type fields and select a different value.

5. To edit individual permissions within the permission set, choose the value in the **Permission Set** field to open the **Permissions** page.

> [!NOTE]  
> When you edit a permission set, the changes will also apply to other users that have the permission set assigned.

### Security filters limit a user's access to specific records in a table

For record-level security in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], use security filters to limit a user's access to data in a table. You create security filters on table data. A security filter describes a set of records in a table that a user has permission to access. You can specify, for example, that a user can only read the records that contain information about a particular customer. In this way, the user can't access the records that contain information about other customers. For more information, see [Using Security Filters](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/security/security-filters) in the administration content.


## View permission changes telemetry

You can set up [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to send changes that are done to permission to an Application Insights resource in Microsoft Azure. Then, using Azure Monitor, you create reports and set up alerts on the gathered data. For more information, see the following articles in the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Developer and admin help:

- [Monitoring and Analyzing Telemetry - Enabling Application Insights](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/telemetry-overview#enable)

# Export your business data to Excel

Excel is a powerful tool to work with data. From inside [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can open any list in Excel. You can even modify data in Excel and then submit it back to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The same capability makes it easy for you to take your data with you if you decide to cancel your subscription.

## Opening and exporting lists in Excel

You can open data in Excel from any journal, list, or worksheet. You just open the page that you want, and then choose **Open in Excel**. For example, open the list of customers (search for **Customers**), and then choose **Open in Excel**. Your browser prompts you to open or save the generated Excel workbook.  

> [!NOTE]
> Use this option when you don't want to publish your changes back to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

Each list includes some columns. The export to Excel includes any columns that are in your current view. Change the columns by opening the shortcut menu for any column, and then specifying which columns that you want to see. The list of columns is different for most lists. The columns reflect the structure in the database that stores your data. If you aren't sure what type of data a certain column contains, add it to your view. You can always remove it again.  

Learn more in [View and edit in Excel from Business Central](across-work-with-excel.md).

### Edit data in Excel

Your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] experience includes an add-in for Excel so you can edit data in Excel. Learn more in [Analyzing Financial Statements in Microsoft Excel](finance-analyze-excel.md).  

## Exporting data to other finance systems

If you decide to cancel your subscription for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can export your data to Excel and take it with you to your next finance system.  

You can export all pages, but that might be more than you really need. Consider exporting the following essential pages, and remember to add all columns:  

* Chart of Accounts  
* Customers  
* Vendors  
* Banks  
* Items  

If you want to export all your financial transactions, it's a large amount of data, so the export often takes more than a few minutes. The financial transactions are shown on the **General Ledger Entries** page.  

We recommend that you also consider exporting data from the following pages:  

* Customer Ledger Entries  
* Vendor Ledger Entries  
* Bank Account Ledger Entries  
* Item Ledger Entries  
* General Posting Setup  
* Customer Posting Groups  
* Vendor Posting Groups  
* Item Posting Groups  
* Bank Posting Group  
* G/L Budgets  
* G/L Budget Entries  
* Sales Quotes  
* Sales Invoices  
* Purchase Invoices  
* Contacts  
* Salespeople  

> [!NOTE]  
> If you have set up more than one company in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you must export the relevant data from each company.

> [!NOTE]
> You must have at least one of the following permissions to open or edit data in Excel:
>
> * Permission set *D365 Excel Export Action*  
> * System permission 6110 *Allow Action Export To Excel*.  

For more information, see [Get an overview of a user's permissions](ui-define-granular-permissions.md#get-an-overview-of-a-users-permissions).

# The Payments and Reconciliations (DK) Extension

Make fast, error-free payments by exporting files that are formatted specifically for exchanges with your vendor or bank. These files speed up the payment and reconciliation processes, and eliminate errors that can happen when you manually enter the information on a bank website.  

This extension supports file formats for several Danish banks. When you export payment information to a file, the extension packages the data into the format that your bank requires. For example, the formats include Bankdata-V3, BEC, SDC, and FIK, which many different banks use, and some that are more specialized for certain banks, for example, Danske Bank and Nordea. The extension also includes some formats for importing and reconciling bank statements.  

> [!Note]
> To use the extension, you must know the format that your bank or vendor requires. Some banks or vendors provide this information on their websites; however, you might need to contact their customer service to get the information.  

## Supported Bank Formats
This extension can apply the following file formats for payment files:  

* BANKDATA-V3  
* BEC-INDLAND  
* BEC-CSV  
* DANSKEBANK-CMKV  
* DANSKEBANK-CMKXKSX  
* DANSKEBANK  
* FIK71  
* NORDEA-ERHVERV-CSV  
* NORDEA  
* NORDEA-UNITEL-V3  
* SDC  
* SDC-CSV  

## To set up the extension

There are a few steps to get started.  

* Allow payment data exports. To help protect your data, this is not readily available.  
* Set up purchase and payables so that you do not require external document numbers on invoices. If needed, you can use the reference number to refer to a specific invoice.  
* Specify the payment method for each vendor. Payment methods define how you pay invoices from the vendor. For example, Bank, Cash, Check, or Account.  
* Specify the type of format to use for each of your bank accounts. For example, NORDEA, DANSKEBANK, SDC, and so on.  

Additionally, you must assign vendors to a domestic **Gen. Bus. Posting Group** and a **Vendor Posting Group**. The Country/Region setting for the vendor must be Denmark (DK). For more information, see [Setting Up Posting Groups](finance-posting-groups.md).

# Split Warehouse Activity Lines

In warehouse put-aways, movements, or picks, and in inventory put-aways and inventory picks, bins are suggested for picking or putting away items. The quantity that's actually in the suggested bin may not be sufficient, or there isn't enough room in the bin to put away the required quantity. In these cases, you can split the line so that the items for one line are either taken from or placed in more than one bin.  

The following procedure applies to the following warehouse documents:

* Warehouse put-aways
* Warehouse movements
* Warehouse picks
* Inventory put-aways
* Inventory movements
* Inventory picks  

## To split warehouse activity lines  

1. Open a warehouse activity line where you are trying to handle an insufficient quantity.  
2. In the **Qty. to Handle** field, enter the reduced quantity that you're able to handle.  
3. On the **Lines** FastTab, choose the **Actions** action, choose the **Functions** action, and then choose the **Split Line** action. A new line appears. The line is a copy of the original line except that the **Qty. to Handle** field contains the quantity that you removed from the original line.  
4. Assign a bin and, if you're using directed put-away and pick, a zone, or continue splitting the line as necessary until you find appropriate bins for all of the quantity.  

> [!NOTE]  
> If the location uses directed put-away and pick and you split the lines, you must be familiar with the warehouse and be able to choose a bin that matches the storage requirements of the item and that fulfills the general requirements of the warehouse document. For example, you would not split a line on a pick document and place some items in bulk storage.

# Troubleshooting Your Company Hub

Adding companies to the company hub dashboard is easy enough, but this article addresses issues that you may have on the way.  

## Check errors

Use the **Check Errors** action to view a list of recent errors. You can see additional details for each error, and you can clean up the log by deleting older entries.  

## Connection failed

There can be a couple of reasons why you cannot connect to a company, including the following:

- The URL in the **Environment Link** field is not valid  

  Go to the **Environment Links** page, open the environment that you cannot connect to, and then choose the **Test the connection** action.  
- The client's company is currently offline, for example if it being upgraded

  In your dashboard, choose the **Tools** menu item, and then choose **Check Errors**. This opens a list with technical details, so you might want to contact your administrator if you're seeing errors. For example, the error message "*The server has rejected the client credentials*" suggests that you do not have access.  
- You do not have access to all companies in the environment that you are trying to connect to

  In [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], an organization can have multiple business units called companies, and you might not have access to all companies. Work with your administrator or client to make sure that you have access to the companies that you have to work in.  

## Data does not refresh

When you add a company or request a refresh of the data, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] fetches the data. But you must refresh the page yourself, such as choosing the **Reload all companies** action, refresh the browser page, navigate away from the dashboard and then back again, or similar.  

If you've added a company but it is not displaying in the list, you can also use the **Reload all companies** action to update the list.

# Understanding the Chart of Accounts

A chart of accounts (COA) serves as a comprehensive directory of financial accounts and their corresponding reference numbers. A COA typically has of two main categories of accounts:

* Balance sheet accounts: These accounts track your company’s assets, debts, and net worth.
* Income statement accounts: These accounts record income from various sources and also track expenses.

Balance sheet accounts are further categorized into three groups:

* Asset accounts: These accounts track all the valuable resources owned by your company.
* Liability accounts: They record your company’s debts.
* Equity accounts: Represent the residual value in the business after subtracting liabilities from assets.

Income accounts are divided into two groups:

* Revenue accounts: These accounts capture your company’s income from various sources.
* Expense accounts: These accounts capture all your company’s expenses.

Use the COA to record transactions in your organization’s general ledger. Each account typically has an identifier (account number) and a descriptive caption or header, and they're systematically coded based on their account type.

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes a standard chart of accounts that is ready to support your business.

The composition of your company’s chart of accounts is a strategic decision made by your management (or by country-specific regulation). It varies based on your company’s industry, business model, and financial structure. For instance, depending on your industry, you might have specific asset accounts tailored to your company's unique operations and needs:

* A retail business might emphasize inventory and accounts receivable.
* A technology company might focus on intangible assets like patents and software.
* A manufacturing plant would track fixed assets and supplies.

## The chart of accounts page

The chart of accounts shows all general ledger accounts. From the chart of accounts, you can do things like:  

* View reports that show general ledger entries and balances.  
* Close your income statement.  
* Open the General Ledger Account Card, where you can add or change settings.  
* See a list of posting groups for that account.
* View separate debit and credit balances for a single account.

You can add, change, or delete general ledger accounts. However, to prevent discrepancies, you can't delete a general ledger account if its data is used in the chart of accounts. Also, you can block the accidental deletion of accounts in sensitive periods. To learn more about protecting accounts from deletion, go to [Deleting accounts](finance-setup-chart-accounts.md#delete-accounts).  

## The code hierarchy in G/L accounts

Businesses typically create a hierarchical structure in G/L account codes to reflect where they belong in the chart of accounts. For instance, in some implementations, G/L account codes that start with **1** denotes asset accounts, whereas G/L account codes that start with 3 denotes equity accounts. In some regions, there are local regulations for using a standard chart of accounts. To help users understand this hierarchy without the need to know the internal code structure, you can define headers and subtotals in your chart of accounts that encapsulate these internal structures.

## Designing your chart of accounts

Each line in the chart of accounts is a G/L account of one of the types:

* Posting (journals can post lines to these accounts)
* Heading (defines an overall heading in the chart of accounts)
* Total (defines a formula for a subtotal in the chart of accounts)
* Begin-Total (defines a beginning heading for a subtotal in the chart of accounts. All subsequent lines until an End-Total line are indented)
* End-Total (defines an ending heading for a subtotal and the formula for it in the chart of accounts. All subsequent lines after this End-Total line are outdented)

A minimalist chart of accounts can consist of only lines of posting accounts. You use the other four types to define how the chart of accounts also shows a financial statement with headers and subtotals. Totaling accounts are frequently used in financial reporting.

> [!TIP]
> If you use account types other than **Posting** in your chart of accounts, you can define different views to show the "raw" posting accounts without the reporting-type account types for totalling and headings. For example, Show only posting accounts and Hide blocked accounts.

## Use dimensions to simplify your chart of accounts

Dimensions are values that categorize entries so you can track and analyze them on documents, such as sales orders. Dimensions can, for example, indicate the project or department an entry came from. So, instead of setting up separate general ledger accounts for each department and project, you can use dimensions as a basis for analysis and avoid having to create a complicated chart of accounts.

To learn more about dimensions, go to [Work with Dimensions](finance-dimensions.md).

## Organize general ledger (G/L) data using account categories

The **G/L Account Categories** page lets you create simple financial reports based on your chart of accounts.  

By providing categories, subcategories, and account mapping to your chart of accounts, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes basic financial reporting out of the box. If you're just getting started with financial reporting, the standard reports are excellent options until you become more experienced.

For more information, see [Organize general ledger (G/L) data using account categories](bi-account-categories.md).

## Get a quick overview of your finances

The **Chart of Accounts** page displays accounts in a hierarchical list that offers fast access to the key information for each account. However, the list is static, and if you have many accounts, you might have to scroll to view different accounts. If you just want a quick overview of the basics, such as net changes and balances, the **Chart of Accounts Overview** page is a useful alternative. The column layout on the page is the same as the **Chart of Accounts** page (though with fewer columns), so it's easy to understand. You can expand or collapse the hierarchical levels. To make it easy to switch between the pages, the **Chart of Accounts Overview** page is available from the **Chart of Accounts** page.

## Access to create and edit the chart of accounts

In a small organization, such as the CRONUS demonstration company, most users can edit the chart of accounts, except those users with a TEAM MEMBER license. However, larger organizations typically use roles and permissions to limit access to editing the chart of accounts. If you're an administrator, or have the Business Manager or Accountant role, you can control user permissions to give the right people access to the relevant tables. To learn more, go to [Get an overview of a user's permissions](ui-define-granular-permissions.md#get-an-overview-of-a-users-permissions).  

## Audit changes to G/L accounts setup

You can use the Change Log feature to capture changes users make to your G/L accounts. [!INCLUDE [include-audit-what-who-when](includes/include-audit-what-who-when.md)] 

The following table lists the table for G/L accounts and its ID.

| Table | Table ID |
| ----- | -------- |
| G/L Account | 15 |

[!INCLUDE [include-audit-changes-to-setup-learn-more-link](includes/include-audit-changes-to-setup-learn-more-link.md)]



<!-- ## Standard chart of accounts in different regions
Uncomment when we have more examples added to our localization documentation

Some regions have defined standards for the chart of accounts structure you should use in your company. 

Here are some examples of such standards that have been implemented in localized versions of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]:

* [Standard chart of accounts in Denmark](localfunctionality/denmark/how-to-set-up-standard-coa.md)
-->

## Chart of accounts best practices

Here are some best practices that you might consider when you develop and maintaining your charts of accounts:

* Compose your company’s chart of accounts to support the financial reporting needs for your management to take strategic decisions.
* Consider starting simple with fewer G/L accounts. You can always add more detailed accounts if needed.
* Define headers and subtotals in your chart of accounts that summarize the internal structures in G/L accounts.
* Use dimensions to simplify your chart of accounts. Don't have specific G/L accounts for each product or department.
* Add new G/L accounts as they come in, but remove accounts from your chart of accounts only during period-end of your finance period.

# Planning

The production operations required to transform inputs into finished goods must be planned daily or weekly depending on the volume and nature of the products. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers features to supply for anticipated and actual demand from sale, assembly, and production as well as features for distribution planning using stockkeeping units and location transfers.

> [!NOTE]
> This topic mainly describes planning for companies involved in manufacturing or assembly management where the resulting supply orders can be either production, assembly, transfer, or purchase orders. The main interface for this planning work is the **Planning Worksheet** page.
>
> [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] also supports supply planning for wholesale companies where the resulting supply orders can only be transfer and purchase orders. The main interface for this planning work is the **Requisition Worksheet** page, which is described indirectly in this topic as most planning functionality applies to both worksheets.

Planning can be seen as the preparation of required supply orders in the purchasing, assembly, or manufacturing departments to fulfill sales or end-item demand. For more information, see [Purchasing](purchasing-manage-purchasing.md), [Assembly Management](assembly-assemble-items.md), and [Manufacturing](production-manage-manufacturing.md).

# Configure API Templates

The API library for [!INCLUDE[prod_short_md](includes/prod_short.md)] provides a simplified representation of the underlying entities. All the properties in the application are not exposed through the associated API. The **API Setup** page allows you to define templates that are used to populate empty properties on an entity when you create a POST action through the API. 

For example, if a configuration template is defined for the item entity, when a new item record is created through the items API, any properties for the new item that are not defined in the API call will be populated from the selected template. If, for example, no value is defined for the **Gen. Prod. Posting Group** field through the API, but a value is defined in the selected template, then the posting group value defined in the template will be applied to the new item. 

## Setting up the Entity Template

To use templates with the API library, you must first set up and define properties for the templates. You can set up these templates on the **Configuration Templates** page. For more information, see [Migrate On-Premises Data to Business Central Online](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/migrate-data) (in English only) in the administration content.  

## Assign the template to an API

To assign a template to an API, you must go through the following steps.

> [!NOTE]  
> API templates can only be set up with the following API pages: contacts, countriesRegions, currencies, customers, employees, itemCategories, paymentMethods, paymentTerms, shipmentMethods, unitsOfMeasure, and vendors.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **API Setup**, and choose the related link.
2. Choose **New**, and then choose the **Order** value for the record.  

    If there is more than one template selected for an API (Page ID), the templates are applied in the order defined in the **Order** column.  

    When each template is applied, field values defined in the template are only applied to fields that have not already had a value defined, either explicitly in the API, or in a previously applied template in the order.  
3. Select a **Page ID** value.  

    This is the page for the API to which the template will be applied. The **Page ID** lookup provides a list of all APIs available in the library.
4. Select a value in the **Template Code** field.  

    The template code is the code for the template that was defined on the **Configuration Templates** page. The template values defined are applied to the API.  
5. In the **Conditions** field, specify which template should be applied.  

    The defined template is applied to a new record created through the API if, and only if, the conditions defined in the **Conditions** field are met by the values already defined for the new instance of the entity.

# Purchases by Vendor (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Purchases by Vendor** report provides an overview of purchasing activities by vendor. This report you find out which vendors supply the most frequently purchased item categories and items. It also shows how much you spend on these purchases.

:::image type="content" source="media/purchases/purchases-by-vendor.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Purchases by Vendor Power BI report" lightbox="media/purchases/purchases-by-vendor.png":::

## Use the report

The report is especially useful for purchasing managers and purchasers.

Purchasing managers can use the report to analyze vendor performance. You can identify the vendors who supply the most frequently purchased item categories and items. This information can help you optimize purchasing strategies, negotiate better prices, and improve overall vendor management.

Purchasers can use this report to monitor purchasing activities and identify the suppliers of specific products. For example, if you need a list of suppliers for the components of dining chair assemblies, you can view the purchase quantities and amounts spent on each vendor. The report can help you select the best vendor to buy from.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The *Purchases by Vendor* report includes the following KPIs and measures: 

- [**Purchase Amount**](purchases-powerbi-kpis.md#purchase-amount)
- [**Purchase Quantity**](purchases-powerbi-kpis.md#purchase-quantity)
- [**% GT Purchase Amount**](purchases-powerbi-kpis.md#-gt-purchase-amount)
- [**% GT Purchase Amount PY (Fiscal)**](purchases-powerbi-kpis.md#-gt-purchase-amount-py-fiscal)

[!INCLUDE[click-on-a-kpi-link](includes/click-on-a-kpi-link.md)] 

[!INCLUDE[powerbi-tip-track-kpis](includes/powerbi-tip-track-kpis.md)]

## Data used in the report

The report uses data from the following tables in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]:

- Vendor
- Item
- Value Entry
- Purchase Line

## Try the report

# Work with Word Layouts

A Word report layout determines the content and format of a report when it is previewed and printed from Business Central. You create and modify these layouts using Microsoft Word.

[![Example of a word report layout document for Business Central.](media/word-layout.png)](media/word-layout.png#lightbox) 

When you modify a Word report layout, you specify the fields of the report dataset to include on report and how the fields are arranged. You also define the general format of the report, such as text font and size, margins, and background images. You will typically arrange the content of the report by adding tables to the layout.

To make general formatting and layout changes, such as changing text font, adding and modifying a table, or removing a data field, just use the basic editing features of Word, like you do with any Word document.

If you're designing a Word report layout from scratch or adding new data fields, then start by adding a table that includes rows and columns that will eventually hold the data fields.

> [!TIP]  
> Show the table gridlines so that you see the boundaries of table cells. Remember to hide the gridlines when you're done editing. To show or hide table gridlines, select the table, and then under **Layout** on the **Table** tab, choose **View Gridlines**.

## Embedding Fonts in Word Layouts for Consistency

To ensure that reports always display and print with the intended fonts, wherever users open or print the reports, you can embed the fonts in the Word document. However, embedding fonts can significantly increase the size of the Word files. Learn more about embedding fonts in Word at [Embed fonts in Word, PowerPoint, or Excel](https://support.office.com/article/Embed-fonts-in-Word-PowerPoint-or-Excel-cb3982aa-ea76-4323-b008-86670f222dbc).

## Adding data fields

A report dataset can consist of fields that display labels, data, and images. This topic describes the procedure for adding fields of a report dataset to an existing Word report layout for a report. You add fields by using the Word custom XML part for the report and adding content controls that map to the fields of the report dataset. Adding fields requires that you have some knowledge of the report's dataset so that you can identify the fields that you want to add to the layout.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
> You cannot modify built-in report layouts<!--Onprem. Built-in layouts can only be modified by using the development environment-->.  

###  <a name="OpenXMLPart"></a> To open the Custom XML part for the Report in Word  
  
1. If it's not already open, then open the Word report layout document in Word.  
  
     For more information, see [Create and Modify a Custom Report Layout](ui-how-create-custom-report-layout.md).  
  
2. Display the **Developer** tab in the ribbon of Microsoft Word.  
  
     By default, the **Developer** tab is not shown in the ribbon. Learn more at [Show the Developer Tab on the Ribbon](/visualstudio/vsto/how-to-show-the-developer-tab-on-the-ribbon).  
  
3. On the **Developer** tab, select **XML Mapping Pane**.  
  
4. In the **XML Mapping** pane, in the **Custom XML Part** dropdown list, choose the custom XML part for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] report, which is typically last in the list. The name of the custom XML part has the following format:  
  
     `urn:microsoft-dynamics-nav/reports/<report_name>/<ID>`  

     `<report_name>` is the name that is assigned to the report 

     `<ID>` is the identification number of the report.  
  
     After you select the custom XML part, the XML Mapping pane displays the labels and field controls that are available for the report.  
  
### To add a label or data field  
  
1. Place your cursor in the document where you want to add the control.  
  
2. In the **XML Mapping** pane, right-click the control that you want to add, choose **Insert Content Control**, and then choose **Plain Text**.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    > You cannot add a field by manually typing the dataset field name in the content control. You must use the **XML Mapping** pane to map the fields.  
  
### To add repeating rows of data fields to create a list  
  
1. In a table, add a table row that includes a column for each field that you want repeated.  
  
   This row will act as a placeholder for the repeating fields.  
  
2. Select the entire row.  
  
3. In the **XML Mapping** pane, right-click the control that corresponds to the report data item that contains the fields that you want repeated, choose **Insert Content Control**, and then choose **Repeating**.  
  
4. Add the repeating fields to the row as follows:  
  
    1. Place your pointer in a column.  
  
    2. In the **XML Mapping** pane, right-click the control that you want to add, choose **Insert Content Control**, and then choose **Plain Text**.  
  
    3. For each field, repeat steps a and b.  
  
## Adding image fields

A report dataset can include a field that contains an image, such as a company logo or a picture of an item. To add an image from the report dataset, you insert a **Picture** content control.  
  
Images align in the top-left corner of the content control and resize automatically in proportion to fit the boundary of the content control.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
> You can only add images that have a format that is supported by Word, such as .bmp, .jpeg, and .png file types. If you add an image that has a format that is not supported by Word, you will get an error when you run the report from the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] client.  
  
### To add an image  
  
1. Place your pointer in the document where you want to add the control.  
  
2. In the **XML Mapping** pane, right-click the control that you want to add, choose **Insert Content Control**, and then choose **Picture**.  
  
3. To increase or decrease the image size, drag a sizing handle away from or towards the center of the content control.  

##  <a name="RemoveField"></a> Removing label and data fields

Label and data fields of a report are contained in content controls in Word. The following figure illustrates a content control when it's selected in the Word document.  

![Content control for field in Word report layout.](media/nav_wordreportlayouts_contentcontrol.png "NAV_WordReportLayouts_ContentControl")  

The name of the label or data field name displays in the content control. In the example, the field name is CompanyAddr1.  

### To remove a label or data field  

1. Right-click the field that you want to delete, and then choose **Remove Content Control**.  

     The content control is removed, but the field name remains as text.  

2. Delete the remaining text as needed.

## Custom XML Part Overview

Word report layouts are built on *custom XML parts*. A custom XML part for a report consists of elements that correspond to the data items, columns, and labels that comprise the report's dataset. <!--OnPrem The data as defined in the Report Dataset Designer in Microsoft Dynamics NAV Development Environment. -->The custom XML part is used to map the data into a report when the report is run.

### XML structure of custom XML part

The following table provides a simplified overview of the XML of a custom XML part.  
  
|XML Elements|Description|  
|------------------|-----------------|  
|`<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?>`|Header|  
|`<WordReportXmlPart xmlns="urn:microsoft-dynamics-365/report/<reportname>/<id>/"`|XML namespace specification. `<reportname>` is the name that is assigned to the report. `<id>` is the ID that is assigned to the report.|  
|`..<Labels>`<br /><br /> `....<ColumnNameCaption>ColumnNameCaption</ColumnNameCaption>`<br /><br /> `....<LabelName>LabelCaption</LabelName>`<br /><br /> `..</Labels>`|Contains all the labels for the report.<!--OnPren The element includes labels that are related to columns that have the IncludeCaption Property.--><br />-   Label elements that are related to columns have the format `<ColumnNameCaption>ColumnNameCaption</ColumnNameCaption>`<!--OnPrem where `ColumnName` is determined by the column's Name Property.-->.<br />-  Label elements have the format `<LabelName>LabelName</LabelName`<!--OnPrem where LabelName is determined by the label's Name Property.-->.<br />-   Labels are listed in alphabetical order.|  
|`..<DataItem1>`<br /><br /> `....<DataItem1Column1>DataItem1Column1</DataItem1Column1>`|Top-level data item and columns. Columns are listed in alphabetical order.<!--OnPrem <br /><br /> The element names and values are determined by the Name Property of the data item or column.-->|  
|`....<DataItem2>`<br /><br /> `......<DataItem2Column1>DataItem2Column1</DataItem2Column1>`<br /><br /> `....</DataItem2>`<br /><br /> `....<DataItem3>`<br /><br /> `......<DataItem3Column1>DataItem3Column1</DataItem3Column1>`<br /><br /> `....</DataItem3>`|Data items and columns that are nested in the top-level data item. Columns are listed in alphabetical order under the respective data item.|  
|`..</DataItem1>`<br /><br /> `</WordReportXmlPart>`|Closing element.|  
  
### Custom XML part in Word

 In Word, you open the custom XML part in the **XML Mapping** pane, and then use the pane to map elements to content controls in the Word document. The **XML Mapping** pane is accessible from the **Developer** tab (learn more at [Show the Developer Tab on the Ribbon](/visualstudio/vsto/how-to-show-the-developer-tab-on-the-ribbon)).  
  
 The elements in the **XML Mapping** pane appear in a structure that is similar to the XML source. Label fields are grouped under a common **Labels** element and data item and columns are arranged in a hierarchal structure that corresponds to the XML source, with columns listed in alphabetical order. Elements are identified by their column name as defined in the report's dataset in AL code. Learn more in [Defining a Report Dataset](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-report-dataset).  
  
 The following figure illustrates the simple custom XML part from the previous section in the **XML Mapping** pane of a Word document.  
  
 ![Clip of the XML Mapping pane in word.](media/nav_reportlayout_xmlmappingpane.png "NAV_ReportLayout_XMLMappingPane")  
  
* To add a label or field to the layout, you insert a content control that maps to the element in the **XML Mapping** pane.  
  
* To create repeating rows of columns, insert a **Repeating** content control for the parent data item element, and then add content control for the columns.  
  
* For labels, the actual text that appears in the generated report is the value of the **Caption** property for the field in the data item table (if the label is related to the column in the report dataset) or a label in the Report Label Designer (if the label is not related to a column in the dataset).  
  
* The language of the label that is displayed when you run the report depends on the language setting of the report object.

# Entering Data

There are many general features that help you enter data easier, faster, and more precise. The basic principles and advanced features for entering data are described in this article.  

[!INCLUDE [about-ui-learn](includes/about-ui-learn.md)]

The examples in this article use the demonstration data.

## Work with editable fields

Fields in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] may contain different editable data, such as text or currency amounts. Editable fields typically display an input box where you can type or choose a value. Non-editable fields are typically displayed with a gray background.

Some editable fields provide a picker to help you specify a value.  

<!-- TODO: Add illustrations or images of each picker -->
|**Picker**        |**How it helps you specify a value**|
|------------------|------------------------------------|
|Date picker       |This picker displays a calendar that is based on your current regional settings. It helps you choose a single date.|
|Dropdown          |Dropdowns provide a choice of fixed values or reference records from another table|
|Switch or Checkbox|Some fields provide a simple choice of *Yes* or *No* values. The switch is used to specify this value, and is always displayed as a checkbox in lists|
|Assist edit       |Some fields provide custom pickers that are suited to looking up and choosing the best value for that field, such as popup window|

### Modifying a field value

To modify the value of a field, you must first set focus to that field. You set focus by doing the following actions:

- Use the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key. The action selects the entire value.
- Left-click your mouse or similar input device. This action will only select the entire field value if the field is in a list.  

When you interact with fields in the user interface, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] typically favors selecting the entire field value to make it easier for you to replace that value.

When the entire field value is selected:

- Replace the value by just typing to specify a new value. If the field offers a picker, you can activate it using the <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Down Arrow</kbd> keyboard shortcut.
- Use the <kbd>Delete</kbd> or <kbd>Backspace</kbd> key to clear the value.

select the <kbd>F2</kbd> key to toggle between selecting the entire field value or placing the cursor after the field's value. Placing the cursor at the end of the value makes it easier for you to append to the existing value.

When the cursor is shown at the end of the field value:
- Add to the value by just typing.
- Use the <kbd>Home</kbd>, <kbd>End</kbd>, <kbd>Left Arrow</kbd>, and <kbd>Right Arrow</kbd> keys to move the cursor within the value. If you're editing a field in a list, selecting the <kbd>Left Arrow</kbd> key again when the cursor is at the beginning of the value will set focus to the previous field. Similarly, selecting the <kbd>Right Arrow</kbd> key again when the cursor is at the end of the value will set focus to the next field.

> [!NOTE]
> After you specify a value, Business Central will only check that it's valid after you click outside the field or set focus to another element, such as the next field.  

[!INCLUDE [background_doc_journal_check](includes/background_doc_journal_check.md)]

## Use Copilot's autofill feature to assist in filling in fields (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner-section.md)]

When drafting a new record or editing an existing record, Copilot can suggest values for editable fields on the page. Learn more in [Autofill fields with Copilot (preview)](autofill-fields-with-copilot.md).

## Keyboard Shortcuts

There are several keyboard shortcuts that let you work "mouse-free" and speed up your data entry. These keyboard shortcuts are especially useful with large-scale entries and repetitive typing tasks.

For more information about shortcuts, see [Keyboard Shortcuts](keyboard-shortcuts.md). A few of the keyboard shortcuts are discussed in this article.

## <a name="QuickEntry"></a>Accelerating Data Entry Using Quick Entry

Quick Entry is a feature designed for data entry when using the keyboard. Quick Entry works on fields (like on card pages) and in lists (rows and columns). It's beneficial when doing repetitive typing tasks that require creating multiple records in sequence. Examples include a batch of sales orders or registering new items.

You can use the Tab key to navigate from one field on a page to the next editable field. A disadvantage of using Tab is that it always goes sequentially to the next field. <!-- even if the field is non-editable or seldom filled it in.-->Quick Entry lets you change this path. With Quick Entry, you use the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key to navigate through only those fields that you're interested in. Quick Entry skips non-editable fields and fields that you typically don't fill in. You might have already noticed this behavior on some pages. This behavior is because the fields to include when pressing Enter and which ones to skip have been predefined. You can customize Quick Entry by personalizing your workspace and optimizing how you enter data on each page.

### How Quick Entry Works

Every field can be marked as either *included in Quick Entry* or *excluded from Quick Entry*. Fields that are included in Quick Entry will be included in the path when you select <kbd>Enter</kbd>. Fields that are excluded from Quick Entry won't.

When you're finished entering data in a field, you simply select <kbd>Enter</kbd> to confirm the changes and go to the next field. If you want to reverse direction, and go the previous field, select <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd>. For more information about shortcuts, see [Quick Entry Shortcuts for Fields](keyboard-shortcuts.md#QuickEntry).

#### Tips and Tricks

The following list provides some useful information about using Quick Entry.

- It's available for any editable fields.
- It also works across columns and rows.
- It doesn't prevent accessing other elements of a page, such as actions. These elements are still accessible by using <kbd>Tab</kbd> and <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd>.  
- It's not required that FastTabs are expanded for Quick Entry to work. If the next Quick Entry field is located in a collapsed FastTab, that FastTab will automatically expand and focus on the chosen field. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will remember that the FastTab should be expanded next time you visit the page.  
- Quick Entry works no matter whether fields are mandatory. So it's a good idea to ensure that mandatory fields are included in Quick Entry.
- By default, most fields are automatically included in Quick Entry. So initially your task will most likely be excluding fields from Quick Entry.

### To change Quick Entry fields

To set up Quick Entry on fields, you use personalization.

1. Start personalization by selecting the ![Settings.](media/ui-experience/settings_icon_small.png "Settings icon for role center") icon, and then the **Personalize** action.
2. Select a field that you want change. In lists, select the corresponding column heading. Then, choose either **Include in Quick Entry** or **Exclude from Quick Entry**.

For more information about personalization, see [Personalize Your Workspace](ui-personalization-user.md).

## Mandatory Fields

When you enter data on pages, certain fields are marked with a red asterisk. The red asterisk means that the field must be filled to complete a certain process. An example is when you post a transaction that uses the value in the field.  

Although a field is mandatory, you aren't forced to fill the field before you continue to other fields or close the page. The red asterisk only serves as a reminder that you'll be blocked from completing a certain process.  

## Finding Data As You Type

 When you start to type characters in a field, a drop-down list is displayed and shows possible field values. The list changes as you type more characters, and you can select the correct value when it's displayed.  

 Many fields have a down arrow button that you can choose. You choose the arrow to get a list of data that is available to enter in the field. The button has two functions depending on the type of field:  

- Lookup - Displays information from another table that you can enter in the field. You can select one piece of data at a time.  

- Drop-down - Displays the set of options that exist for the field. You can select only one of the options.  

## Copying and Pasting FAQ Fields and Lines

You can copy one or more rows from a list or a single field on a page. Then paste what you copied into the same page, another page, or an external document. You could, for example, paste to Microsoft Excel or Outlook email. In short, to copy, select <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> (cmd+C in macOS) on your keyboard. To paste, select <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>V</kbd> or <kbd>cmd+V</kbd> in macOS.

In a list, to copy the field in the same column of the row above, and paste it into the current row, just select <kbd>F8</kbd>.

For more information, see [Copying and Pasting FAQ](faq-copy-paste.yml).

## Filtering Line Items

To start filtering, select ![Filter pane icon](media/open-filter-pane-icon.png "Filter pane icon") at the top of the list or select <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>F3</kbd> to open the filter pane. You work with the filter pane as you do on any other list. For more information, see [Filtering](ui-enter-criteria-filters.md#filtering).

Filtering is especially helpful when viewing and analyzing longer documents. Imagine you open a posted sales invoice. Then, you filter the line items to display all line items that have an individual discount above 5%. Or, you filter to display only bike accessories with 'pro' in the name.

## <a name="Focus"></a>Focusing on Line Items

When working on documents that include a line items part, you can switch your view to focus only on the line items. Example documents are sales order or invoice page. The line items part expands so that it occupies almost the entire workspace. It hides other parts of the page except the actions area at the top. This layout gives you a better overview of the lines items, and provides more room to work on them.

You'll benefit particularly when you work with large line item lists and you want to enter data fast. This feature also provides advanced filtering capability. Like on other lists, browsing and searching through line items becomes even easier.

### Switching the Focus On and Off

To focus on lines items, select anywhere in the line item part, and then choose ![Focus Mode icon.](media/focus-mode.png "Focus mode icon") in the upper right corner, or select <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>F12</kbd>.

To switch back to the normal view, choose ![Focus Mode icon.](media/focus-mode.png "Focus mode icon") or select <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>F12</kbd> again.

## Multitasking Across Multiple Pages

You can open a card or document page in a new window. Opening a new window lets you:

- Work on multiple tasks at the same time
- Manage interruptions to the current task, such as taking an incoming call.
- Keep a window open for an ongoing task while you start or complete another task in windows.

To open the current card or document in a new window, choose ![Open New Window.](media/open-new-window-icon.png "Open new window icon") in the upper right corner, or select <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>W</kbd>.

<!--
When working on multiple tasks at a time or when managing interruptions to the current task, such as taking an incoming call, you can open a card or document page in a new window. This allows you to keep a window open for an ongoing task while you start or complete another task in one or more other windows.
-->

> [!NOTE]
> When you open other pages from a card or document that is opened in a new window, those pages will open in a new window even though you don't choose ![Open New Window.](media/open-new-window-icon.png "Open new window icon").

> [!NOTE]
> If you work in the Safari browser, a pop-up blocker may cause the new window to not open. If this is the case, specify the product URL as an allowed website. For information see, [Change preferences in Safari](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=2102965).<br /><br />
> The same may happen in other browsers, such as Firefox. For more information, see [Pop-up blocker settings in Firefox](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=2116400).  

Another way to multitask is to open [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on two or more browser tabs. When you do it this way, you should create a new tab and then copy/paste the URL of the original tab into the new tab. This way creates a new session.   

> [!NOTE]
> Don't use the **Duplicate** function of the browser to create the new tab as this may cause actions on one tab to block actions on other tabs because they are part of the same session.

## Entering Quantities by Calculation

When entering numbers into quantity fields, such as the **Quantity** field on an item journal line, you can enter the formula instead of the sum quantity.  

### Examples  

- If you enter 19+19, the field is calculated to 38.  

- If you enter 41-9, the field is calculated to 32.  

- If you enter 12*4, the field is calculated to 48.  

- If you enter 12/4, the field is calculated to 3.  

## Entering Negative Numbers

You can enter negative numbers in two ways. The number -20.5 can be entered as:  

- -20.5  

  or
- 20.5-  

In both cases, the amount will be recorded in as -20.5.  

If the last character of the expression is a **+** or a **-**, the entire expression will be recorded with that sign. An example, **10-20+** will result in 10 and not -10.  

## Entering Dates and Times

You can enter dates and times in all the fields that are assigned to dates (date fields). You can enter dates with or without separators.

> [!NOTE]  
> How you enter dates and times depends on your **Region** settings. For more information, see [Change Basic Settings](ui-change-basic-settings.md).  

### Entering Dates

You can either use the data picker to select a date from a calendar, or you can enter dates manually. This section provides a brief overview of how to enter dates. For more information, see [Work with Calendar Dates and Times](ui-enter-date-ranges.md).

For manually date entry, you can enter two, four, six, or eight digits:  

- Two digits are interpreted as the day. It will add the month and the year of the work date.  

- Four digits are interpreted as the day and the month. It will add the year of the work date.  

- If the date you want is in the range 01/01/1950 through 12/31/2049, enter the year with two digits. Otherwise, enter the year with four digits.

  > [!NOTE]
  > If you're using [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, the two-digit year range may be different. Administrators can change the range by modifying the **CalendarTwoDigitYearMax** setting of the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] server. For more information, see [Configuring Business Central Server](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/configure-server-instance#General).

You can also enter a date as a weekday followed by a week number. Or, you can enter a year. For example, Mon25 or mon25 means Monday in week 25.  

Instead of entering a specific date, you can enter one of these codes.  

|Code|Result|  
|--------------|----------------|  
|t|Specifies today's date (the system date for the computer).|  
|p|Specifies an accounting period, where p means the first accounting period, p2 means the second accounting period, and so on. |
|w|Specifies the work date that is set up in the application. To change the work date, see [Changing Basic Settings](ui-change-basic-settings.md). You may want to use a work date if you have many transactions with a date other than today's date.|
|c|Specifies that the date after c is a closing date, for example C123101.|  

## Entering Times

When you enter times, you can insert any separator sign that you want between the units, but it isn't required. You don't have to write minutes, seconds, or AM/PM.  

The following table lists the various ways in which times can be entered and how they're interpreted.  

|Entry|Interpretation|  
|---------------|------------------------|  
|5|05:00:00|  
|5:30|05:30:00|  
|0530|05:30:00|  
|5:30:5|05:30:05|  
|053005|05:30:05|  
|5:30:5,50|05:30:05.5|  
|053005050|05:30:05.05|  

 You enter two digits for each unit of time if you don't enter a separator.  

## Entering Combined Datetimes

[!INCLUDE [datetimes](includes/datetimes.md)]

## Entering Duration

You enter a duration as a number followed by its unit of measure.  

Here are some examples.  

|Duration|Unit of measure**|  
|------------------|-------------------------|  
|2h|2 hrs|  
|6h 30 m|6 hrs 30 mins|  
|6.5h|6 hrs 30 mins|  
|90m|1 hr 30 mins|  
|2d 6h 30m|2 days 6 hrs 30 mins|  
|2d 6h 30m 56s 600ms|2 days 6 hrs 30 mins 56 secs 600 msecs|  

 You can also enter a number and it's automatically converted to a duration. The number you enter is converted according to the default unit of measure that has been specified for the duration field.  

 To see the unit of measure used in a duration field, enter a number and see which unit of measure it's converted to.  

 The number 5 is converted to 5 hrs, if the unit of measure is hours.  

## <a name="decimal"></a>Setting the decimal separator used by numeric keyboards

When using the <kbd>Decimal Separator</kbd> key on a numeric keypad to enter data, the actual decimal separator that's entered in the field is determined by your region setting in Business Central. Most regions use the period (.) or comma (,) symbol as a separator for decimal values, as you would typically see in currency amounts. The decimal key on your keypad adapts to your region. It's often different to the period or comma keys on the rest of your keyboard. You set the region in Business Central on the **My Settings**  page.

For example, suppose you're using a numeric keyboard that uses a period (.) as the <kbd>Decimal Separator</kbd> key. But you're entering data for a regional language that uses a comma (**,**) for the decimal separator, like French (France). So, you want decimals like "1.23" to be entered as "1,23". In this case, you can go to the **My Settings** page and set the **Region** to the target regional language to **French (France)**. For more information, see [Change Basic Settings](ui-change-basic-settings.md#region).

> [!TIP]
> There may be occasions when you want to use the decimal separator to enter a period (.). For example, suppose you were entering a date range in a filter, like `01/01/2022..04/01/2022`, or anything that requires a period. To accommodate this case, select the <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Decimal Separator</kbd> keys on the numeric keyboard. This key combination switches the decimal separator between outputting a period and the decimal separator as determined by the **Region** setting.

# Ad-hoc analysis of finance data

This article explains how to use the **Data Analysis** feature to analyze finance data directly from list pages and queries. You don't have to run a report or switch to another application, such as Excel. The feature provides an interactive and versatile way to calculate, summarize, and examine data. Instead of running reports using options and filters, you can add multiple tabs that represent different tasks or views on the data. Some examples are "Total assets over time", "Accounts Receivable", "Accounts Payable," or any other view you can imagine. To learn more about how to use the **Data Analysis** feature, go to [Analyze list and query data with analysis mode](analysis-mode.md).

Use the following list pages to start doing ad-hoc analysis of finance processes:

- [General Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=20&layout=analysis)
- [G/L Registers](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=116&layout=analysis)
- [Customer Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=25&layout=analysis)
- [Vendor Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=29&layout=analysis)

## Ad-hoc analysis scenarios in finance

Use the **Data Analysis** feature for quick fact checking and ad-hoc analysis:

- If you don't want to run a report.
- If a report for your specific need doesn't exist.
- If you want to quickly iterate to get a good overview on a part of your business.

The following sections provide examples of finance scenarios in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## Data foundation for ad-hoc analysis on finance

When you post journals, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates entries in the **G/L Entry** table. Therefore, ad-hoc analysis on general finance is typically done on the [General Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=20) page. For accounts receivable and payable, you can analyze [Customer Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=25) and [Vendor Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=29), respectively.

# Make payments

You pay vendors or customers, or reimburse your employees, by posting payment lines on the **Payment Journal** page. The payment journal is a general journal that's optimized for making payments, and offers lots of powerful actions. For example, the **Suggest Vendor Payments** action that finds vendor payments that are due, and the **Vendor - Summary Aging** report that shows an overview of due vendor payments.  

You can start the payment process from the lists, cards, and ledger entries for vendors, customers, and employees. Each of these pages has a button that starts the payment flow and helps you fill in the payment journal.  

From the payment journal, you can print computer checks or record when checks are written. If you select **Computer Check** in the **Bank Payment Type** field, you must print lines that represent checks before you can post the payment journal.

After you post payments, you can export them to a bank file you can upload to your bank for processing.

After the payments are made at your bank, you must apply them to their related open vendor or employee ledger entries. You can apply them manually or by importing a bank statement file and applying the payments automatically. For more information, see [Applying Payments Automatically and Reconciling Bank Accounts](receivables-apply-payments-auto-reconcile-bank-accounts.md).

# FAQ for Sales Order Agent (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]

These frequently asked questions (FAQ) describe the AI impact of Sales Order Agent feature in Business Central.

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/production-ready-preview-dynamics365.md)]
<!--[!INCLUDE [limited-public-preview](includes/limited-public-preview.md)]-->

## What is the Sales Order Agent?

The Sales Order Agent is an integrated AI agent that automates the task of handling requests for sales quotes and sales orders from customers. The agent can manage the entire sales order capturing process, from receiving a customer's order by email, locating the customer among the registered customers in Business Central, checking items availability, preparing a quote with the requested items, following up with the customer on any changes needed to finalize the quote, receiving quote approval, and converting it to a sales order.

Learn more in [Process sales quotes and orders with Sales Order Agent](sales-order-agent-process.md).

## What are the capabilities of the Sales Order Agent?

The agent supports handling requests for sales quotes and sales orders from customers with the following capabilities:

- Agent configuration

  The agent is available directly within Business Central. You can configure and activate the agent to help your team or organization improve the sales process. For example, you can specify the users who can participate in the process of reviewing and approving the sales documents created by the agent. You can also specify the mailbox for receiving the customer requests and settings for searching your items and involving the users to review the agent's work.

  Learn more in [Set up Sales Order Agent](sales-order-agent-setup.md).

- Task execution and interaction

  The agent operates based on its instructions and user configuration. The instructions describe its purpose, tasks, and high level considerations for how to perform the flow. These instructions are defined in the agent code and aren't visible to users. The agent uses AI to identify and carry out the steps needed to complete its task within the Business Central environment. Learn more in [Sales Order Agent overview](sales-order-agent.md).

  The agent is invoked by a built-in email dispatcher that runs as a scheduled task and monitors the company mailbox specified in the agent's configuration. The dispatcher hands over emails received from the customers to the Sales Order Agent and sends results of the agent's work, such as prepared sales quote with requested items, in response.
  
- Access and permissions

  The agent runs as its own user in Business Central and is granted access only to the necessary parts of the product. It comes with a predefined permission set and UI role (profile) that limits the parts of the product and UI elements (such as pages, fields, actions) it can access.

- Transparency and change control

  The agent seeks user intervention in specific situations, such as preparing outbound communications or providing business review and approval for key operations.

  Business Central maintains full transparency and provides control over changes made by the agent. The agent brings humans in the loop when their attention is required by issuing in-product notifications that are displayed on the role center. For example, a notification occurs before any outbound email communications to a customer, when the agent needs more details to get unblocked, or when approval for important changes.  

  For each task performed by the agent, users get a detailed timeline that shows the key steps taken by the agent and human users, including the email conversation. Users can review this information and update the values and actions the agent suggested if needed. Business Central can also display the reasoning used by the agent and citations that led to a suggested value.

## What is the intended use of the Sales Order Agent?

The Sales Order Agent is intended to handle the end-to-end sales order capturing process. This process includes:

- Taking the customer’s order by email
- Iterating on the details with the customer via email
- Checking the availability of the items
- Preparing the sales quote with the requested items
- Sending the quote to the customer for approval
- Converting the quote to a sales order upon receiving customer confirmation.

## How was the Sales Order Agent evaluated? What metrics are used to measure performance?

We defined a set of categories and scenarios and created test cases for each as described in the following table. In total, we have a suite of 50 test cases.

|Category|Scenario|
|-|-|
|Quotes<br><br>Precise request for a quote with variations (delivery dates or not, terse/verbose request, complete or incomplete email signature) |<ul><li>Single/multi-turn with approval by customer. Up to three items.</li><li>Quote request for four or more items</li><li>Request for quote by item reference. Up to three lines.</li><li>Quote sent but not approved by customer.</li><li>Quote request from unknown customer.</li><li>Quote request for unknown item.</li></ul>|
|Information<br><br>Requests for information about items followed by a quote request|<ul><li>Single and multi-turn with quote based on information.</li><li>Request for information about unknown items.</li></ul>|

## What are the limitations of Sales Order Agent? How can users minimize the impact of the Sales Order Agent limitations when using the system?

- Languages

  - [!INCLUDE[soa-language-support](includes/soa-language-support.md)]
  - Mixed language input might result in lower-quality output because the system relies on pure string similarity, and the semantic part of the matching might not work properly.

- Emailing

  - The agent reads inbound emails via a shared inbox on Microsoft Exchange. Learn more in [Set up email](admin-how-setup-email.md). Other ways to receive email aren't supported.
  - The agent only uses the email body to get the details of the request, it doesn't process files attached to emails.  
  - Large emails might exceed the number of tokens that can be processed in one request. This condition leads the agent to trigger a request for a human to investigate (similar to how a human is requested to approve whether the agent approves an email). 
  - Email messages generated by the agent might contain incorrect information. The agent is designed to ask a human user to review and edit every outbound message if necessary.  

- Entities and data the agent can work with

  - The agent is designed to work with sales quotes and sales orders. It can't create or work with the other sales documents (such as blank orders, invoices, or credit memos) or documents in other areas of the product (such as purchase or service orders).
  - The agent doesn't create new items, contacts, or customers. It only works with the entities that are already registered in Business Central. The agent is designed to ask a human user to provide additional information or perform the task manually, when it can't find this data in Business Central.
  - The agent doesn't post documents.
  - Based on more customer requests, the agent can make changes to the sales quotes, but not to the sales orders.
  - The agent is designed to work with sales lines of type "Item", other sales line types, such as Resource, Charge (Item), Allocation Account, Fixed Asset aren't supported.
  - At this stage, the agent supports the creation of up to 15 item lines per sales document. Increasing the number of lines might result in lower-quality output.
  - How you name your products can affect agent output. For example, using cryptic abbreviations versus friendly names can reduce output quality.

- When adding items to a sales document, the use of the item's **Variant Code** isn't currently supported. It leaves the **Variant Code** field empty.

- Pricing and discounts requests

   Business Central has an advanced price/discount calculation logic, often extended by ISV solutions. Therefore, the most reliable way to get the item price is to create a sales document, for example, a quote. For this reason, the agent is designed *not* to provide or update any pricing and discount information by email. Prices and default discounts are calculated by the Business Central own business logic and included with a sales quote document. Requests for changing discounts and pricing aren't accepted by the agent. Instead, they're surfaced to the users for applying them manually. 

- Other considerations

  - Delegated administrators can't activate the agent.  
  - It's only possible to configure and use one Sales Order Agent per Business Central company.
  - The agent uses the regional settings specified by its user account.
  - While the agent can recognize and interact with the custom fields and actions introduced by customizations and ISV solutions, which are added to the agent's profile and permissions, the results might vary in quality and should be thoroughly tested. Improving reliability of working with the custom elements might require adjustments to the agent's instructions, which is currently not supported. 
  
## What operational factors and settings allow for effective and responsible use of the feature?

- Access control and permissions

  Like any other user in Business Central, the Sales Order Agent can be granted access exclusively to the specific parts of the product required to perform its designated tasks. The agent comes with predefined permissions and a user interface (UI) role, also known as a profile, that an administrator or configuring user can assign to the agent. This assignment restricts the agent's access to certain areas of the product. It defines the type of access (for example, whether the agent is only allowed to read specific data or also update or delete it) and determines which UI elements—such as pages, fields, actions, and FactBoxes—it can interact with.  

  We strongly encourage using the permission sets and the profile included with the Sales Order Agent, which can be assigned on the Agent card. This practice ensures that the agent only has access to the functionalities necessary for its role, enhancing both security and efficiency within the system.

  Learn more in [Set up Sales Order Agent](sales-order-agent-setup.md).

- Transparency and notifications

  Business Central users can maintain full transparency and control over the changes made by the Sales Order Agent by using other experiences that enable them to:

  - Receive notifications on the role center that come from the agent when it requires help or when the process demands human review. For example, review is required for all inbound and outbound messages, approvals, adding missing data, and similar reasons.
  - Get a better understanding of the specific task context and history (“timeline” view), including key steps involved in it.
  - Get a detailed review of each entity created by the agent (for example, a sales quote or sales order that surfaces all changes and suggestions made by the agent within a specific task. This behavior allows humans to review and adjust changes, and then sign out on proceeding with the task.
  - Get an overview of the agent's KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) that summarize the impact of the agent's work. For example, you can get an overview of the number of sales quotes or orders created by the agent and the total number of these orders.

    Make sure you attend to the notifications raised by the agent to review and approve its work.  
- All actions done by the agent, including creating and modifying records and calling actions, carry the agent's user ID. This user ID appears in the same places and in the same way as it does with other users, such as in list views, history, posted documents, notifications, and more.  
- Approval workflows can be used to add an extra layer of control to the tasks done by the agent, as they do with other users. You can set up approval workflows to make the agent create a request for approval for a specific change, for example, to mark the quote as released. The change isn't allowed until another user approves the request. Learn more in [Use Approval Workflows](across-how-use-approval-workflows.md).

## Is this capability extensible?

Currently, this capability isn't extensible by partners.

# Reconcile inventory costs with the general ledger

When you post inventory transactions, such as sales shipments, purchase invoices, or inventory adjustments, the changed item costs are recorded in item value entries. To reflect this change of inventory value in your financial books, the inventory costs also need to be posted to the related inventory accounts in the general ledger, such as the inventory account, adjustment account, and COGS account in the general ledger.

Unless you have selected the **Automatic Cost Posting** check box in the **Inventory Setup** window, inventory costs aren't recorded dynamically in the general ledger, and COGS isn't calculated with a sale. Therefore, you must post to the general ledger manually by running the **Post Inventory Cost to G/L** batch job to update the general ledger and potentially print a report of the value entries that are posted.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Before you use this batch job, you should run the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job. This ensures that, when you run this batch job, the costs that will be posted to the general ledger are up to date. This is referred to as cost adjustment. For more information, see [Adjust Item Costs](inventory-how-adjust-item-costs.md).

## To post inventory costs manually

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Post Inventory Cost to G/L**, and then choose the related link.

2. Post inventory costs to the general ledger manually by running the batch job. When you run this batch job, general ledger entries are created on the basis of value entries. To calculate the value to post, it uses the difference between the **Cost Amount (Actual)** field and the **Cost Posted to G/L** field in the value entries. If you have selected the **Expected Cost Posting to G/L** checkbox on the **Inventory Setup** page, the batch job also posts the difference between the **Cost Amount (Expected)** field and the **Exp. Cost Posted to G/L** field to interim accounts in the general ledger. You can post the entries so that they are summarized per posting group.

|Option  |Description  |
|--------------|---------|
|**Posting Method**|The batch job can either post inventory value to the general ledger per posting group or per posted entry. If you post per entry, you achieve a detailed specification of how the inventory affects the general ledger, but you also get numerous G/L entries. If you post per posting group, the batch job creates a general ledger entry per posting date per posting group combination. This means that a general ledger entry is created for each combination of posting date, general business posting group, general product posting group, inventory posting group, and location code. In addition, the batch job creates separate general ledger entries for costs with different signs.|
|**Document No.**|In this field, you can enter a document number if you have chosen the *Post per Inventory Posting Group* option. The document number appears on posted entries.|
|**Post**|Select this field if you want the batch job to post to the general ledger automatically. If you don't choose to post the inventory cost to G/L, the batch job will only print a test report showing the values that can be posted to the general ledger, and on the report will appear: **Test Report (not posted)**.|

> [!NOTE]  
> When you run this batch job, you might encounter errors having to do with missing setup or incompatible dimension setup. If the batch job encounters errors in the dimension setup, it overrides these errors and uses the dimensions of the value entry. For any other errors, the batch job skips posting the value entries and lists them at the end of the report in a section titled “Skipped Entries.” To post these entries, you must fix the errors.
> For example if you have not selected the **Expected Cost Posting to G/L** check box in the **Inventory Setup** window, then the last section of the report will list value entries that are skipped because they represent expected costs.

To see a list of errors before running the posting batch job, you can run the **Post Invt. Cost to G/L - Test** report. The test report lists all the errors encountered during a test posting. You can then fix the errors, and run the inventory cost posting batch job without skipping any entries.

If you would like to get an overview of what values could be posted to the general ledger without actually performing the posting, you can run the **Post Inventory Cost to G/L** batch job without actually posting the values to the general ledger. You do this by clearing the check mark from the **Post** field on the request page. This way, when you run the batch job, the report is produced showing the values that are ready to be posted to the general ledger, but they aren't posted.

## To audit the reconciliation between the inventory ledger and the general ledger

The **Inventory - G/L Reconciliation** page provides the following:

- Exposes reconciliation differences by comparing what is recorded in G/L and what is recorded in the inventory ledger (value entries).
- Displays unreconciled cost amounts in the value entries in the inventory ledger as if they were mapped to corresponding inventory-related accounts in G/L and compares those to the totals recorded in the same accounts in G/L.
- Reflects the double entry structure of G/L by visually presenting data as such. For example, a COGS entry has a corresponding inventory entry.
- Lets users drill down and see the entries that make up the cost amounts.
- Includes filters to narrow the analysis by date, item, and location.
- Explains reasons for reconciliation differences in informative messages.


The **Name** column on the far left in the grid lists the various G/L account types that are associated with inventory.

The **Inventory**, **Inventory (Interim)**, and **WIP Inventory** columns show the invoiced, non-invoiced, and WIP totals of each G/L account type. These are calculated from value entries, that is, they're projected onto the G/L account types where they'll end when they're eventually posted to G/L.

The **Total** column shows the sum (in bold font) of the value entry amounts in the three inventory columns.

The **G/L Total** column shows the amounts (in bold font) for each G/L account type that exists in G/L. These are calculated from G/L entries, that is, they represent inventory costs already posted to G/L.

The **Difference** column represents the difference between the value in the **G/L Total** and **Total** fields.

In the top of the **Inventory - G/L Reconciliation** page, you can enter filters to limit, for example, the period of time for which you want information.

If you select the **Show Warning** check box and if there are any discrepancies between the inventory totals and G/L totals, application shows messages in the **Warning** field of the grid that explain the discrepancy. If you choose the Warning field, application gives you more information on what the warning means.

When you have entered all relevant filters, choose the **Show Matrix** action. The data is calculated and the matrix page appears.

On the far left column in the grid, you see the various general ledger account types that are associated with inventory. The grid then shows the invoiced, non-invoiced (interim), and WIP inventory totals for each of these account types. These totals are calculated from the value entries.

The next columns show the totals for the same account types calculated from the general ledger entries.

Choose the  amount in any of the total fields to see the inventory report entries that were used to calculate the totals. For inventory totals, the inventory report entries are the sums of the value entries for the items. For the G/L totals, the inventory report entries are the sums from the general ledger entries.

## Reporting Costs and Reconciling with the General Ledger
Other reports, tracing functions, and a special reconciliation tool are available to the auditor or controller responsible for reporting a correct and balanced inventory value to the finance department.

The following table describes them.    

|**To**|**See**|  
|------------|-------------|  
|View the inventory value of selected items, including information about the quantities and values of increases and decreases in inventory over a selected period.|**Inventory Valuation** report|  
|View the inventory value of selected production orders in your WIP (work in process) inventory, such as the quantities and values of consumption, capacity usage, and output in ongoing production orders.|**Inventory Valuation - WIP** report|  
|View the inventory value of selected items, including their actual and expected cost on the date specified.|**Invt. Valuation - Cost Spec.** report|  
|Use a report to analyze the reasons for cost variances or to gain insight into the cost shares of sold items (COGS).|**Cost Shares Breakdown** report|

# Pick Items with Inventory Picks

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you pick and ship items using one of four methods, as described in the following table.

|Method|Outbound Process|Require Pick|Require Shipment|Complexity Level (Learn more at [Warehouse Management Overview](design-details-warehouse-management.md))|  
|------|----------------|-----|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
|A|Post the pick and shipment from the order line|||No dedicated warehouse activity.|  
|B|Post the pick and shipment from an inventory pick document|Turned on||Basic: Order-by-order.|  
|C|Post the pick and shipment from a warehouse shipment document||Turned on|Basic: Consolidated receive/ship posting for multiple orders.|  
|D|Post the pick from a warehouse pick document, and post the shipment from a warehouse shipment document|Turned on|Turned on|Advanced|  

Learn more at [Outbound Warehouse Flow](design-details-outbound-warehouse-flow.md).

This article refers to method B in the table.

When your location is set up to require pick processing but not shipment processing, use the **Inventory Pick** page to record and post picking and shipping information for your source documents. Outbound source documents can be sales orders, purchase return orders, and outbound transfer orders.

> [!NOTE]
> Production and assembly order component needs also represent outbound source documents. Learn more about handling production and assembly orders for internal processes at [Design Details: Internal Warehouse Flows](design-details-internal-warehouse-flows.md).
>
> Although service orders are also outbound source documents, they don't support the basic, order-by-order level of complexity.
>
> When picking and shipping sales line quantities that are assembled to the order, there are rules you must follow when you create inventory pick lines. Learn more at [Handling Assemble-to-Order Items with Inventory Picks](#handling-assemble-to-order-items-with-inventory-picks).  

You can create an inventory pick in in three ways:

* Create the inventory pick directly from the source document.  
* Create inventory picks for multiple source documents at the same time by using a batch job.
* Request the pick in two steps by first releasing the source document, which acts as a signal to the warehouse that the source document is ready picking.

The inventory pick can then be created from the **Inventory Pick** page based on the source document.  

## To create an inventory pick from the source document

1. In the source document, which can be a sales order, purchase return order, or outbound transfer order, choose the **Create Inventory Put-away/Pick** action.
2. Select the **Create Invt. Pick** checkbox.  
3. Choose the **OK** button. A new inventory pick will be created.

## To create multiple inventory picks with a batch job

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Create Inventory Put-away/Pick/Movement**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Warehouse Request** FastTab, use the **Source Document** and **Source No.** fields to filter on certain types of documents or ranges of document numbers. For example, you can create picks only for sales orders.  
3. On the **Options** FastTab, select the **Create Invt. Pick** checkbox.
4. Choose the **OK** button.

## To create the pick in two steps

### To request an inventory pick by releasing the source document

For sales orders, purchase return orders, and outbound transfer orders, you create the warehouse request by releasing the order. Releasing the order makes the items available for picking.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Orders**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the sales order that you want to release, and then choose the **Release** action.

### To create an inventory pick based on the source document

After you release an order, the warehouse employee can create an inventory pick.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Inventory Picks**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. In the **Source Document** field, select the type of document you're picking for.  
4. In the **Source No.** field, select the source document.  
5. Alternatively, choose the **Get Source Document** action to create a list of all outbound source documents that are ready for picking at the location.  
6. Choose the **OK** button to fill the pick lines according to the selected source documents.  

## To record inventory picks

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Inventory Pick**, and then choose the related link.  
2. In the **Bin Code** field on the pick lines, the bin that the items must be picked from is suggesting per the item's default bin. You can change the bin in this page if necessary.  
3. Perform the pick, and then enter the quantity that in the **Qty. to Handle** field.

    If you must pick the items for a line from more than one bin, for example because the full quantity isn't in the bin, use the **Split Line** action on the **Lines** FastTab. The action creates a line for the remaining quantity to handle.

4. Choose the **Post** action.  

    * Post the shipment of the source document lines that were picked.
    * If the location uses bins, posting will also create warehouse entries to post the changes to the bin quantity.  

    [!INCLUDE [preview-posting-warehouse](includes/preview-posting-warehouse.md)]

## Handling assemble-to-order items with inventory picks

You can also use the **Inventory Pick** page to pick and ship for sales where items must be assembled before they can be shipped. Learn more at [Sell Items Assembled to Order](assembly-how-to-sell-items-assembled-to-order.md).

Assemble-to-order items aren't physically in a bin until they're assembled and posted as output to a bin. Picking assemble-to-order items from a bin for shipments follows a special flow.

1. From a bin, warehouse workers take the assembly items to the shipping dock and then post the inventory pick.
2. The posted inventory pick posts the assembly output, the component consumption, and the sales shipment.

You can set up [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to automatically create an inventory movement when the inventory pick for the assembly item is created. Select the **Create Movements Automatically** field on the **Assembly Setup** page. Learn more at [Set Up Basic Warehouses with Operations Areas](warehouse-how-to-set-up-basic-warehouses-with-operations-areas.md).

Inventory pick lines for sales items are created in different ways, depending on whether none, some, or all of the sales line quantities are assembled to order. In scenarios where some of the quantity is assembled and some is picked from inventory, a minimum of two pick lines are created.

For sales where the full quantity on the sales order line is assembled to order, one inventory pick line is created for the quantity. The value in the **Quantity to Assemble** field is the same as the value in the **Qty. to Ship** field. The **Assemble to Order** field is selected on the line.

If an assembly output flow is set up for the location, the **Bin Code** field on the inventory pick line contains the value from the following fields, in the following order.

* ***Asm.-to-Order Shpt. Bin Code** <!-- not applicable for inv pick-->
* **From-Assembly Bin Code**

If a bin code isn't specified on the sales order line, and no assembly output flow is set up for the location, the **Bin Code** field on the inventory pick line is empty. The warehouse worker must open the **Bin Contents** page and select the bin where the assembly items are assembled.

In scenarios where a part of the quantity is assembled and another must be picked, a minimum of two pick lines are created.

* One pick line for the assemble-to-order quantity. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses the following fields, in this order, to determine the bin code: **Bin Code**, **Asm.-to-Order Shpt. Bin Code**, and then **From-Assembly Bin Code**. If these fields are blank, the warehouse employee must open the **Bin Contents** page and choose the bin where the items are assembled.  
* The other pick line depends on which bins can fulfill the remaining quantity. If the item is kept in multiple bins, multiple lines will be created. The Take line is based on the quantity in the **Qty. to Ship** field.

> [!NOTE]  
> If items are assembled to order, the inventory pick for the linked sales order till create an inventory movement for all of the assembly components.

# FAQ for Sales Line Suggestions with Copilot (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]

These frequently asked questions (FAQ) describe the AI impact of the sales line suggestions feature in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/production-ready-preview-dynamics365.md)]

## What is Sales Line Suggestions with Copilot?

Sales line suggestions with Copilot can assist with creating lines on sales documents such as sales quotes, orders, and invoices based on structured input or natural language. The feature isn't a general-purpose chat, but a highly specific and integrated experience that you can use on sales documents. The feature offers two distinct skills that help you find data about individual products or entire documents.

## What are the capabilities of sales line suggestions with Copilot?

* Find products

  Information that describes products is stored in multiple places in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For example, item numbers and descriptions are stored in the **Item** table, multiple barcodes are stored in the **Item Reference** table, and product properties are stored in the **Item Attributes** table. While you might prompt for *Red bicycle*, the actual product might be *Crimson tourer*, where *Bicycle* is a product category and *red* is an attribute.

* Find a document by reference

  People often repeat a previous order, or at least use it as a starting point. But it might be tricky to find the right order in a stack of orders. You might remember some of the order's ID, which can be a company-assigned number or a reference number received from a customer. Being able to use prompts such as *Need last invoice from April* should help you find an order faster.

* Find a document by reference and then find a product within the document

  Use a combination of the **Find product** and **Find document** capabilities. You can use a prompt such as, *Need red bicycle from last invoice from April*.

* Find products from attachments
  
  If your typical sale contains multiple products, your customer might send you an attachment with details about the products they want to buy. Being able to understand the attachment and generate suggestions based its content makes it faster to create sales lines.

## What is the intended use of sales line suggestions?

* Find products

  Intended to answer user prompts to find products based on vague, incomplete, or inaccurate descriptions.

  Because the average number of items (products/services) for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] customers is 10.000, finding the right ones might be tough without prior experience or knowledge. The way data is stored in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] doesn’t make things easier, because you need to do multiple searches or filtering exercises on the different pages that store product data.

  Copilot extracts the requested products and quantities and identifies the main search term and attributes, so you can enter your prompt more quickly. Then, Copilot does an advanced search through multiple related tables, applies synonyms, corrects typos, and evaluates the quality of the search output.

* Find a document by reference

  Quickly reply to inquiries by finding sales documents for a customer using partial or approximate information.

  In B2B environments, people often deal with recurring requests, and order processors often need to repeat a past document or at least use it as a starting point. However, finding the right document might be tricky:

  - Through its lifecycle, a sales document can evolve from quote to order to posted invoice or shipment. Documents can also be archived.
  - You might have an ID, but don't know what it represents. For example, is it order number, invoice number, or external reference?
  - Sometimes you have a date or a period, but not an ID for a document.

  To find a source document manually, you need to open multiple pages and use search and filter multiple times. Copilot simplifies this process with a single, natural language query that lets you express what you're looking for in your own way.

  *	*Get products from order 103031*
  *	*Need products from last invoice in August*

* Find products from attachment
  
  Intended to find product suggestions based on the content of a file.
  
  * Copilot analyzes an attached file to understand its format, such as the column separator and data type. It also identifies columns that contain a product, quantity, and unit of measure (optional). You can change review and change the mapping if needed.
  * Copilot passes the contents of columns that contain product details to the **Find product** capability to find the requested items.

## How was sales line suggestions evaluated? What metrics are used to measure performance?

The feature underwent extensive testing where numerous prompts in US English representing both typical use and use by bad actors. Testing was based on [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]'s demonstration data and a large labeled product catalog available as open source.

This feature is built in accordance with Microsoft's Responsible AI Standard. Learn more about responsible AI from Microsoft at [Empowering responsible AI practices](https://aka.ms/RAI).

## What are the limitations of sales line suggestions? How can users minimize the impact of the sales line suggestions limitations when using the system?

* Find products
  
  Find products works best in the English language. While you can use this feature in any of the languages that [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports, item searches in other languages might be less accurate.

If your industry or domain overlaps with what Microsoft considers sensitive topics (such as drugs, violence, adult entertainment, and so on) Copilot might defer to neutral, curated responses, or give inaccurate responses.

Sales line suggestions only populates fields where the **Type** is **Item**, and the **No.**, **Unit of Measure**, and **Quantity**. Other fields, including **Unit Price** and **Location**, use the current logic and are filled in either based on item settings or values from the document header.

The **Variant Code** isn't currently supported. If you can ship a product in two different colors, for example, Copilot finds the product but leaves the **Variant Code** field empty. You need to fill in the field manually.

How you name your items can affect output. For example, using cryptic abbreviations versus friendly names can reduce output quality.

For items, the following table lists the tables and fields that Copilot searches.

|Table  |Fields  |
|---------|---------|
|**Items**     |  * No.<br>* Description<br>* Description 2<br>* Search Description<br>* GTIN<br>* Vendor Item Number       |
|**Item Variant**     | * Code<br>* Description<br>* Description 2	        |
|**Item Reference**     | * Reference No.<br>* Description<br>* Description 2        |
|**Item Attributes**     | * Name<br>* Value        |
|**Item Category**     |  * Code<br>* Description<br>* Parent Category - 1 Level	       |
|**Item Translation**     | * Language<br>* Description<br>* Description 2	        |
|**Item Identifier**     |  * Code       |
|**Extended text Line**     |  * Text      |

* Find documents by reference

  Currently, you can start sales line suggestions from sales orders, invoices, and quotes, and search the following documents:

  * Sales orders
  * Sales quotes
  * Sales invoices
  * Posted sales invoices
  * Posted sales shipments
  * Blanket sales order

  Copilot searches the following fields:

  * Document No.
  * External Document No.
  * Your Reference
  * Quote No.
  * Document Date
  * Sell-to Customer No.

  Copilot doesn't return all lines of the type Item. It transfers only item numbers, variant codes, and quantities. Copilot converts quantities from the source document to the **Sales Unit of Measure**.

* Find products from attachment

Currently, this feature supports only CSV files. If you received files in a different format, for example Microsoft Excel, use the **Save As** action to save the worksheet as a CSV.

To safeguard against scenario where a large file is uploaded, the CSV file is limited to 10,000 characters.

## In which geographies and languages is sales line suggestions available?

[!INCLUDE[copilot-geo-and-language-availability-en-only](includes/copilot-geo-and-language-availability-en-only.md)]

## What operational factors and settings allow for effective and responsible use of the feature?

AI-powered suggestions might sometimes be incorrect or incomplete. You should always review the accuracy of Copilot's suggestions before you choose whether to keep them. Copilot’s suggestions aren't saved to the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] database until you choose the **Keep it** button and exit the Copilot window. You can edit and correct any suggestions before you choose to keep it, or after they're inserted in a sales document.

### What is expected of administrators and end-users when using Sales lines suggestions?

After an administrator enables the **Sales lines suggestions** feature, each user can choose whether to use it always, sometimes, or never.  

Administrators make the overall decision on whether to use Copilot capabilities in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. If administrators enable Copilot, they should be sure to grant access to the appropriate users.

> [!NOTE]
> * We don't support this feature in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises or private cloud.
> * Partners can't extend this feature. That means partner developers can't modify, replace, or extend it.

## Is Copilot the only means to create sales lines?  

No, use of Copilot is optional. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers non-AI-powered ways to insert sales lines or copy documents. Organizations can use both approaches at the same time.  

## How do I give feedback about AI-generated content?  

Each time Copilot provides suggestions, you can provide feedback to Microsoft directly from the Copilot window, using the Like and Dislike buttons. Your feedback remains anonymous and we use this data to improve the quality of the service.

# Calculate Dates for purchases

If you want to have items in inventory on a certain date, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can automatically calculate the date on which you must order them. 

The result is the date on which you can pick the items that you ordered.  

If you specify a requested receipt date on a purchase order line, the calculated order date is the date on which you must place the order. The date on which the items will be available for picking displays in the **Expected Receipt Date** field.  

If you don't specify a requested receipt date, the date you expect to receive the items is based on order date on the line. 

The receipt date is also the date when the items will be available for picking.  

> [!TIP]
> By default, many of the date fields this article mentions are hidden on purchase order lines. If a field isn't available, you can add it by personalizing the page. For more information, see [Personalize Your Workspace](ui-personalization-user.md).

## Calculating with a requested receipt date

If there's a requested receipt date on the purchase order line, that date is the basis for the following calculations:  

- requested receipt date - lead time calculation = order date  
- requested receipt date + inbound whse. handling time + safety lead time = expected receipt date  

If you specify a requested receipt date on a purchase order line, that date is assigned to new lines as you create them. You can change or remove the date on the lines.  

> [!NOTE]
> If your process is based on backward calculation, for example, if you use the requested receipt date to get the order date, we recommend that you use date formulas that have fixed durations, such as "5D" for five days or "1W" for one week. Date formulas without fixed durations, such as "CW" for current week or CM for current month, can result in incorrect date calculations. For more information about date formulas, see [Work with Calendar Dates and Times](ui-enter-date-ranges.md).

## Calculating without a requested receipt date

If you enter a purchase order line without a requested receipt date, the **Order Date** field on the line shows the date in the **Order Date** field on the purchase order header. This date is either the date you entered or the work date. The dates are then calculated for the purchase order line, with the order date as the starting point, as follows:  

- order date + lead time calculation = planned receipt date  
- planned receipt date + inbound whse. handling time + safety lead time = expected receipt date  

If you change the order date on the line, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] recalculates the other dates.  

## Default values for lead time calculation

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses the date formula in the **Lead Time Calculation** field on the purchase order line to calculate the order and expected receipt dates.  

You can manually specify the date formula on lines. Otherwise, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will use the formulas that are defined on the following pages in this order of priority:

1. Item/Vendor Catalog
2. Item Card
3. Stockkeeping Unit Card
4. Vendor Card

# Sustainability value chain in purchasing

The requirement for enabling the us of the sustainability value chain in the purchase process is to enable the following fields on the **Sustainability Setup** page:

- **Enable Value Chain tracking** to enable value chain capabilities in all processes.  
- **Use Emissions In Purchase Documents** to enable emission fields in the purchase document lines.

To do so, follow next steps:

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sustainability Setup**, and then select the related link.
2. Check whether the basic setup already exists. If it doesn't, follow [these instructions](finance-sustainability-setup.md) to set it up.  
3. On the **Procurement** FastTab, fill in the fields that are related to the sustainability value chain features.  
   1. Select the **Use Emissions In Purchase Documents** field.
   2. Select the **Enable Value Chain tracking** field.
4. Close the page.

## Work with purchase documents

To learn how to work with purchase documents in sustainability, go to [How to record emissions with purchase documents](finance-sustainability-journal.md#purchase-documents).  

If you enabled the value chain on the **Sustainability Setup** page, and created a purchase document with the **Sustainability Accounts** and emissions (minimum one emission), [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically starts the sustainability value chain and posts details to the **Sustainability Value Entries** page.  

> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] only creates sustainability value entries for items. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't support emissions from item charges.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Because the sustainability value chain works only with the carbon equivalent (CO2e), before you start, configure carbon equivalent factors on the Emission Fees page. To learn more, go to [Emission fees](value-chain-howto-setup.md#emission-fees).  

After you post the purchase documents, the results display on the **Posted Purchase Invoice** or **Posted Purchase Credit Memo** pages. To review the results, use the **Find entries** action. In the list of entries, find the sustainability value entry. To open a list of value chain transactions related to your purchase documents, select the entry.  

When you post the document, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] also updates the **CO2e per Unit** field for all items in your purchase document. If the purchase document was the first for this item, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses the value from document. If you already had documents, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses the average model to calculate the **CO2e per Unit** value for your item.

# Configure service management processes

The following are some examples of the settings you can apply to service management processes:  
  
* Some overall settings for various processes, such as warnings, next service calculations for service items, the start-up fee to assess, the fault reporting level to use, and so on.  
* The types of information that technicians enter on service documents. For example, you can require them to specify the type of order, the start and/or end dates for the work, and the type of work that was done.  
* Some default settings for response times and warranties. These include a default response time for starting service, warranty discount percentages for parts and labor, and how long warranties are valid for.  
* Settings for contracts, such as the maximum number of days that you can use for contract service orders, whether to use reason codes when a contract is canceled, standard texts for descriptions, and contract values.  
* The number sequences to use for service-related documents and items.  

## To enter general and mandatory settings

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Management Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  

## Set up service invoice posting policies for users

Companies often have unique processes for invoices and shipments. For example, processes can vary from one person posting everything on a service order to multiple employees, each working with their own pages.

You can use posting policies to restrict users from posting service invoices, or require them to post invoices together with the related service shipment. To set up a posting policy, on the **User Setup** page, in the **Service Invoice Posting Policy** field, choose one of the following options:

* **Allowed** (Default): Keep the current behavior, where you can choose the posting options, such as **Ship**, **Invoice**, and **Ship and Invoice**.
* **Prohibited**: Prevent people from posting service invoices. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] shows a confirmation dialog that only provides the **Ship** option.
* **Mandatory**: Let people post invoices along with service shipments. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] shows a confirmation dialog that only provides the **Ship and Invoice** option.

This setting affects the following documents:

* Service orders
* Warehouse shipments
* Service invoices

> [!NOTE]
> When you post service invoices and credit memos, you don't have any posting options. The documents always post physical and financial transactions together. You can't partially post service invoices and credit memos.

## Send service documents to the right people

Your business probably deals with multiple customer and vendor contacts who are responsible for different areas of operation. For example, accountants, purchasers, and warehouse staff. Because their interests typically differ, you might want to generate and send different types of documents to them. You can save time when you send documents to different customer or vendor contacts by setting up specific contacts to use with specific documents. For example, send service invoices to accountant contacts and service orders to your customers' purchasers.

You can use the **Document Layouts** page to specify who to send service quotes, orders, invoices, and credit memos to for vendors and customers based on settings on the **Report Selection** page. To send specific documents to specific company contacts, choose the company contacts to use for specific document layouts. To learn more about document layouts, go to [Define document layouts for customers and vendors](ui-define-customer-vendor-document-layouts.md).

# Count and adjust inventory using documents

You can take a physical inventory of your items by using physical inventory order and physical inventory recording documents. The **Physical Inventory Order** page is used to organize the complete inventory counting project, for example one per location. Use the **Phys. Inventory Recording** page capture and communicate the actual count of items. You can create multiple recordings for one order, for example, to distribute groups of items to different employees.

You can print the **Physical Invt. Recording** report from each recording, and it contains empty quantity fields where you can enter the counted inventory. When you're done counting and the quantities are entered on the **Phys. Inventory Recording** page, choose the **Finish** action. This action transfers the quantities to the related lines on the **Physical Inventory Order** page. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]ensures that you can't record an item count twice.  

> [!NOTE]
> Using documents to perform a physical inventory count provides more control and supports distributing the counting to multiple employees. You can also use journals to perform the task, such as the **Phys. Inventory Journals** and **Whse. Phys. Inventory Journals** pages. To learn more, go to [Count, Adjust, and Reclassify Inventory Using Journals](inventory-how-count-adjust-reclassify.md). This article describes how to use documents to do a physical inventory count.
>
> If you're using zones in your warehouse, you can't use physical inventory orders. Instead, use the **Whse. Phys. Inventory Journal** page to count your warehouse entries before you synchronize them with item ledger entries.

Counting inventory by using documents consists of the following overall steps:

1. Create a physical inventory order with expected item quantities prefilled.
2. Generate one or more physical inventory recordings from the order.
3. Enter the counted item quantities on the recordings, as captured on print-outs, for example, and set it to **Finished**.
4. Complete and post the physical inventory order.

## To create a physical inventory order

A physical inventory order is a complete document that consists of a physical inventory order header and order lines. The information on a physical inventory header describes how to take the physical inventory. The order lines contain the information about the items and their locations.

To create the physical inventory order lines, you typically use the **Calculate Lines** action to add the current inventory as lines on the order. You can also use the **Copy from Document** action to fill in the lines with the content of another open or posted physical inventory order. The following procedure only describes how to use the **Calculate Lines** action.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Physical Inventory Orders**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action.
3. Fill in the required fields on the **General** FastTab. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
4. On the **Actions** tab, in the **Functions** group, choose **Other**, and then choose **Calculate Lines**.
5. Select options as necessary.
6. Set filters, for example, to only include a subset of items to count with the first recording.

    > [!TIP]
    > To plan for multiple employees to count the inventory, set different filters each time you use the **Calculate Lines** action to fill in the order with the subset of inventory items that a user will record. Then, as you generate multiple physical inventory recordings for multiple employees, you minimize the risk of counting items twice. To learn more, go to [To create a physical inventory recording](#to-create-a-physical-inventory-recording).

7. Choose the **OK** button.

A line for each item that exists on the chosen location and per the set filters and options is added to the order. For items that are set up for item tracking, the **Use Item Tracking** checkbox is selected and information about the expected quantity of serial and lot numbers is available by choosing **Lines**, and then **Item Tracking Lines**. To learn more, go to [Handle item tracking when counting inventory](#handle-item-tracking-when-counting-inventory).

You can now create one or more recordings, which are instructions to the employees who do the counting.  

> [!NOTE]
> If you use package-specific tracking, you can also use documents to count and adjust inventory with package numbers. To start using this feature, you must turn on **Feature Update: Enable use of package tracking in physical inventory orders** on the **Feature Management** page. Existing physical inventory orders are updated, however, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can't populate the **Package No.** field. You must recreate these lines using the **Calculate Lines** action on the **Physical Inventory Order** page.
>
> You can enter the package number for items where package tracking is needed on the **Phys. Inventory Recording Lines** page. Choose **Finish** to finalize recording.
>
> After you choose **Finish** on the **Physical Inventory Order** page, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates differences with respect to the package and other item tracking details, and makes positive or negative adjustments.

## To create a physical inventory recording

For each physical inventory order, you can create one or more physical inventory recording documents on which employees enter the counted quantities. Employees can enter quantities either manually, or with a scanning device.

By default, a recording is created for all the lines on the related physical inventory order. To avoid that two employees count the same items if you distribute counting, gradually fill in the physical inventory order by setting filters on the **Calculate Lines** batch job. Then create the physical inventory recording with the **Only Lines Not in Recordings** checkbox selected. This setting ensures that each new recording contains different items than those on other recordings.

For manual counting, you can print the **Phys. Invt. Recording** report, which has an empty column where warehouse employees can write the counted quantities. When counting is complete, you enter the recorded quantities on the related lines on the **Phys. Inventory Recording** page. Lastly, you transfer the recorded quantities to the related physical inventory order by setting the status to **Finished**.

1. On a **Physical Inventory Order** page that contains lines for the items to be counted in one recording, you need to choose the **Make New Recording** action.
1. On the **Actions** tab, in the **Functions** group, choose **Other**, and then choose **Make New Recording**.
1. Select options and set filters as necessary.
1. Choose the **OK** button.
1. For every set of items to be counted, load them on the related physical inventory order and repeat steps 1 through 3 with the **Only Lines Not in Recordings** checkbox selected.
1. On the **Related** tab, choose **Order**, and then choose the **Recordings** action to open the **Phys. Inventory Recording List** page.
1. Open the relevant recording.
1. On the **General** FastTab, fill in the fields as necessary.
1. For items that use item tracking, create an additional line for each lot number or serial number code by choosing the **Functions** action, and then the **Copy Line** action. To learn more, go to [Handle item tracking when counting inventory](#handle-item-tracking-when-counting-inventory).  
1. Choose the **Print** action to prepare the physical document that employees can use to note the quantities they count.

## To finish a physical inventory recording

After employees count the quantities, record the quantities in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

1. From the **Phys. Inventory Recording List** page, select the physical inventory recording that you want to finish, and then choose the **Edit** action.
2. On the **Lines** FastTab, fill the actual counted quantity in the **Quantity** field for each line.
3. For items with serial or lot numbers (the **Use Item Tracking** checkbox is selected), enter the counted quantities on the lines for the item's serial and lot numbers respectively. To learn more, go to [Handle item tracking when counting inventory](#handle-item-tracking-when-counting-inventory).
4. Select the **Recorded** checkbox on each line.
5. When you have entered all data for a physical inventory recording, choose the **Finish** action. Note that all lines must have the **Recorded** checkbox selected.

    > [!NOTE]
    > When you finish a physical inventory recording, each line is transferred to the line on the related physical inventory order that matches it exactly. To match, the values in the **Item No.**, **Variant Code**, **Location Code**, and **Bin Code** fields must be the same on the recording and the order lines.>
    > 
    > If a matching physical inventory order line doesn't exist, and if the **Allow Recording Without Order** checkbox is selected, a new line is added and the **Recorded Without Order** checkbox on the related physical inventory order line is selected. Otherwise, an error message displays and the process is canceled.>
    > If more than one physical inventory recording lines match a physical inventory order line, then a message displays and the process is canceled. If, for some reason, two identical physical inventory lines end up on the physical inventory order, you can use a action to resolve it. To learn more, go to [To find duplicate physical inventory order lines](#to-find-duplicate-physical-inventory-order-lines).

## To complete a physical inventory order

After you finish a physical inventory recording, the **Qty. Recorder (Base)** field on the related physical inventory order is updated with the counted (recorded) values, and the **On Recording Lines** checkbox is selected. If a counted quantity differs from the expected quantity, the **Pos Qty. (Base)** and **Neg Qty. (Base)** fields show the difference.

To access the expected quantities and any recorded differences for items with item tracking, choose the **Lines** action, and then choose **Item Tracking Lines** to select various views for the serial and lot numbers in the physical inventory count.

You can also choose the **Phys. Inventory Order Diff.** action to view any differences between the expected quantity and the counted quantity.

### To find duplicate physical inventory order lines

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Physical Inventory Orders**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the physical inventory order to view duplicate lines for.
1. On the **Related** tab, choose **Other**, and then choose **Show Duplicate Lines**.

Duplicate physical inventory order lines display so that you can delete them and keep only one line with a unique set of values in the **Item No.**, **Variant Code**, **Location Code**, and **Bin Code** fields.

### To post a physical inventory order

After you complete a physical inventory order and change its status to **Finished**, you can post it. You can only set the status of a physical inventory order to **Finished** under the following conditions:

- All related physical inventory recordings have a status of **Finished**.
- Each physical inventory order line is counted by at least one inventory recording line.
- The **In Recording Lines** and the **Qty. Exp. Calculated** checkboxes are selected for all physical inventory order lines.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Physical Inventory Orders**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the physical inventory order that you want to complete, and then choose the **Edit** action.

    On the **Physical Inventory Order** page, the quantity recorded shows in the **Qty. Recorded (Base)** field.
3. Choose the **Finish** action.

    The value in the **Status** field is **Finished**. You can now only change the order by choosing the **Reopen** action.
4. To post the order, choose the **Post** action, and then choose the **OK** button.

    The item ledger entries are updated along with any related item tracking entries.

    [!INCLUDE [preview-posting-inventory](includes/preview-posting-inventory.md)]

### To view posted physical inventory orders

After posting, the physical inventory order is deleted and you can view and evaluate the document as a posted physical inventory order. The posted order includes its physical inventory recordings and any comments made.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Posted Phys. Invt. Orders**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Posted Phys. Invt. Orders** page, select the posted inventory order to view, and then choose the **View** action.
3. On the **Related** tab, choose **Order**, and then choose the **Recordings** action to view a list of related physical inventory recordings.  

## Handle item tracking when counting inventory

Item tracking relates to the serial or lot numbers that are assigned to items. When you count an item that's stored in inventory as, for example, 10 different lot numbers, employee must be able to record which and how many units of each lot number are on inventory. To learn more, go to [Work with Serial and Lot Numbers](inventory-how-work-item-tracking.md).

The **Use Item Tracking** checkbox on physical inventory order lines is automatically selected if an item tracking code is set up for the item. You can select or clear the checkbox manually.

### Example - Prepare a physical inventory recording for an item-tracked item

Consider a physical inventory for Item A, which is stored in inventory as ten different serial numbers.

1. On the recording line for the item, select the **Use Item Tracking** checkbox.
2. Choose the **Serial No.** field, select the first serial number that exists in inventory for the item, and then choose the **OK** button.

    Copy the line for the first item-tracked item to insert additional lines that correspond to the number of serial numbers that are stored in inventory.

3. Choose the **Functions** action, and then choose **Copy Line**.
4. On the **Copy Phys. Invt. Rec. Line** page, enter **9** in the **No. of Copies** field, and then choose the **OK** button.
5. On the first line, in the **Serial No.** field, select the next serial number for the item.
6. Repeat step 5 for the remaining eight serial numbers. Be sure you don't select the same number twice.
7. Choose the **Print** action to prepare the print-out that employees use to write down the counted items and serial/lot numbers.

Notice that the **Phys. Invt. Recording** report contains ten lines for Item A, one for each serial number.

### Example - Record and post counted lot number differences

A lot-tracked item is stored in inventory with the "LOT" number series.

**Expected Inventory**:

|Lot No.|Quantity|
|-|-|
|LOT1001|80|
|LOT1003|30|
|LOT1006|10|
|Total|120|

**Recorded Quantities**:

|Lot No.|Quantity|
|-|-|
|LOT1001|80|
|LOT0002|12|
|LOT1003|20|
|LOT1006|10|
|Total|112|

**Quantities to Post**:

|Lot No.|Expected Quantity|Recorded Quantity|Quantity to Post|
|-|-|-|-|
|LOT1001|80|80|0|
|LOT1002|0|12|+12|
|LOT1003|30|20|-10|
|LOT1006|10|0|-10|
|Total|120|112|-8|

On the **Physical Inventory Order** page, the **Neg. Qty. (Base)** field contains **8**. For the order line, the **Phys. Invt. Item Track. List** page shows the positive or negative quantities for each lot number.

## Inventory documents

The following types of documents are useful for managing your warehouse:

* Use **inventory receipts** to register positive adjustments of items based on the quality, quantity, and cost.
* Use **inventory shipments** to write off missing or damaged goods.

You can print these documents at any stage, release, and reopen them, and assign common values such as dimensions in the header. To reprint the documents after they're posted, use the **Posted Inventory Receipt** and **Posted Inventory Shipment** pages.

> [!NOTE]
> Before you can use these documents, you must specify a number series to create their identifiers. To learn more, go to [To set up numbering for inventory documents](#to-set-up-numbering-for-inventory-documents).

### To set up numbering for inventory documents

The following procedure shows how to set up numbering for inventory documents.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Inventory Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Numbering** FastTab, specify in the following fields the series of numbers for documents:

   - **Invt. Receipt Nos.**  
   - **Posted Invt. Receipt Nos.**  
   - **Invt. Shipment Nos.**  
   - **Posted Invt. Shipment Nos.**  

### To create and post an inventory document

The following procedure shows how to create, print, and post an inventory receipt. The steps are similar for inventory shipments.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Inventory Receipts**, and then choose the related link.  
2. In the header of the **Invt. Receipt** page, choose the location in the **Location Code** field, and then fill in the remaining fields as necessary.
3. On the **Lines** FastTab, in the **Item** field, choose the inventory item. In the **Quantity** field, enter the number of items to add.
4. To print an **Inventory Receipt** report from the **Invt. Receipt** page, choose the **Print** action.

The following functions are available on the **Invt. Receipt** page:

- Choose the **Release** or **Reopen** actions to set the status for the next processing stage.  
- Choose the **Post** action to post the inventory receipt, or choose **Post and Print** to post the receipt and print the test report.  

    [!INCLUDE [preview-posting-inventory](includes/preview-posting-inventory.md)]

## Printing inventory documents

You can specify the reports that must be printed at different stages by choosing one of the following options in the **Usage** field the **Report Selection - Inventory** page:

* Inventory Receipt
* Inventory Shipment
* Posted Inventory Receipt
* Posted Inventory Shipment

# Connecting to Your Business Central Data to Build a Business App Using Power Apps

You can make your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] data available as a data source in Power Apps.  

> [!TIP]  
> Business Central now offers development and operations support for Power Platform in AL-Go and samples to get you started creating your own apps with Power Apps. These features are currently in preview. To learn more, go to [Business Central and Power Apps](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/powerplatform/power-apps-overview) in the developer and IT pro help.

## Prerequisites

You must have a valid account with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and with Power Apps.  

## Add [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] as a data source in Power Apps

These steps add a Business Central table, like customers or items, as the data source of a Power Apps app.

1. In your browser, go to [powerapps.microsoft.com](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/), and then sign in.
2. In the navigation pane on the left side, select **+ Create**, and then select **More data sources** on the **Create app** page.
  
   <!-- This step opens Power Apps canavs. On first sign-in, you must specify the country/region.  -->
3. The **Connections** the list shows any existing data connections you have.

   - If there's a **Business Central** connection already, select it, and then select **Create**.

   - If you don't see a Business Central connection, select **+ New connection**, search for and select **Business Central**, and then select **Create**.

   > [!NOTE]
   > If you want to connect to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, then you must choose the **Business Central (on-premises)** connector.  
  
4. Power Apps connects to your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Sign in using the Business Central account name and password. If you aren't an administrator of your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you may have to sign in with another account.  
5. Once you've signed in, Power Apps displays a list of *Environments and companies* that are available from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Choose the environment and company that contains the data you want to connect to, such as *PRODUCTION - My Company*.  
6. Next, you're presented with a list of tables that are exposed as part of the API for your environment. Select the table that you want to connect to, and then choose **Connect**.

These so-called tables are exposed as endpoints by the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] connector for Power Apps.  

> [!NOTE]
> If you want to include data from other tables in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in your app, then you must work with a developer to define a custom API in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

At this point, you have successfully connected to your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] data and are ready to begin building your Power App. You can always add more screens and connect to more data. Learn more at [Create a canvas app from a sample in Power Apps](/powerapps/maker/canvas-apps/open-and-run-a-sample-app).  

When you have designed and built your app, you can share it with your colleagues. For more information, see [Save and publish a canvas app in Power Apps](/powerapps/maker/canvas-apps/save-publish-app).

# Design your own financial reports

You can use financial reporting to create custom reports. For example, if you want more complex reports.

To create a new financial report, choose the **New** action. You can then give the report a name and add a description. Afterward, you can specify default settings for the report, such as:

* **Row Definition**
* **Column Definition**
* **Analysis Views**

## Copy an existing report

To copy an existing report, use the **Copy Financial Report** action. When you choose this option, you can rename the copied report. You can also copy and rename individual row definitions and column definitions.  

## Create your own row definition

To create your own row definition, choose **Edit Row Definition**. To explore existing row definitions, choose the **Name** field. Choose **New**, and give the row definition a name and description.

You now have a blank row definition that you can use to build your new report.  

> [!TIP]
> Take a moment to personalize your screen to show only the **Row No.**, **Description**, **Totaling Type**, **Totaling**, **Row Type**, and **Bold** columns. These columns are recommended as the minimum columns needed for a basic row definition. There are many columns available, which can be used as you become familiar with creating more advanced financial reports in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

When getting started with financial reporting, there are a few choices we recommended in fields. The following table describes the recommended choices.

|Field  |Option  |
|---------|---------|
|Row No.     |Alpha, numeric, or alphanumeric codes are used here to identify rows in formulas.         |

## When to show the opposite sign in rows and columns

Use the **Show Opposite Sign** option to show the opposite sign in a credit balance account, such as revenue, for reports you present to people who aren't accountants.

> [!TIP]
> It's important to remember that you should use the **Show Opposite Sign** option on the posting account line for the account where the sign needs to be flipped. If you use the option on a formula such as gross margin, where both revenue and cost of goods sold are represented, the calculation will be incorrect. Pay extra attention when you use the setting in formulas.

## Create your own column definition

To create your own column definition, choose **Edit Column Definition**. To explore existing definitions, choose the **Name** field. Choose **New**, and give the new column definition a name and a description.

You now have a blank column definition that you can use to build your new report.  

> [!TIP]
> Take a moment to personalize your screen to show only the **Column No.**, **Column Header**, **Column Type**, **Ledger Entry Type**, **Budget Name**, **Formula**, and **Comparison Period Formula** columns. These columns are recommended as the minimum needed for a basic column definition. There are many columns available, which you can use as you become more familiar with creating advanced financial reports.

When getting started with financial reporting, there are a few field choices we recommended. The following table describes the recommendations.

|Field  |Option  |
|---------|---------|
|Column No.     |Alpha, numeric, or alphanumeric codes are used here to identify columns in formulas.         |
|Column Header     |Used to hold the words used to label each column of the report.         |
|Column Type     |The often used options are **Net Change**, **Balance at Date**, and **Formula**.<br><br>**Net Change** is used for income statement reports.<br><br>**Balance at Date** is used for balance sheet reports.<br><br>**Formula** uses row references to Column No. to do basic addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.          |
|Ledger Entry Type     |Entries are used for general ledger entries.<br><br>**Budget Entries** are used for budget entry comparisons.         |
|Budget Name     |When using budget entries, select the budget to use.         |
|Formula     | Formula uses row references to Column No. to do basic addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.        |
|Comparison Period Formula     | Holds various period-related formulas that determine the period for the report combined with the date filter.        |

## When to use a comparison period formula and comparison date formula in a column definition

There are two options for column definition comparisons for accounting periods:

* Comparison period formula
* Comparison date formula

Comparison period formula is often used for reports that show monthly, quarterly, or annual accounting periods. In most cases, financial reports use these increments of time.  

Comparison date formula is typically used for reports that show weekly or daily accounting periods. These increments of time are appropriate for operational reporting, such as daily sales or weekly invoicing.

### Column definitions that include budgets

Budgets can be included on any report when included on the column definition. By selecting a ledger entry type of **Budget Entries**, and entering the **Budget Name** for the selected budget, you can easily show comparisons of actual to budget in reports.

# Work with catalog items

Catalog items are items that you don't manage in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] until you sell them. When you use the **Select Catalog Item** action to add a catalog item to a line on a sales order, quote, or blanket sales order, the catalog item is converted to a regular item.

> [!NOTE]  
> You can't select a catalog item from the **Sales Invoice** page.

A catalog item typically has the item number of the vendor who supplies it. Before you can convert a catalog item to a normal item, you must specify how to convert vendor item numbers to your item numbering. To learn more about item numbering, go to [Specify how catalog item numbers are converted to your own numbering](#specify-how-catalog-item-numbers-are-converted-to-your-own-numbering).  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Catalog items are not to be mistaken with non-inventory items, which are regular items that are given the type **Non-Inventory** to keep them out of availability and costing calculations, for example, because they are only used internally and have a low cost. To learn move about non-inventory items, go to [About Item Types](inventory-about-item-types.md).

## Create a catalog item

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Catalog Items**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Catalog Items** page, choose the **New** action.
3. On the **Catalog Item Card** page, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

## Specify how catalog item numbers are converted to your own numbering

Before you can convert a catalog item to a regular item, you must specify how to convert vendor item numbers to the structure you use for item numbers.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Catalog Item Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. In the **No. Format** field, choose the option you prefer.

## Convert a catalog item to a normal item

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Catalog Items**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the card for a catalog item that you want to convert to a normal item.
3. On the **Catalog Item Card** page, choose the **Create Item** action.

A new item card prefilled with information from the catalog item and an item template is created. You can edit the information about the new item if needed. To learn more about creating items, go to [Register New Items](inventory-how-register-new-items.md).

> [!NOTE]  
> An item reference is automatically created between the vendor's item number and your new item number. To learn more about item references, go to [Use Item References](inventory-how-use-item-cross-refs.md).

## To sell a catalog item and convert it to a normal item

The following process uses a sales order, but the steps are the same for blanket sales orders and quotes.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Orders**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action. Fill in the fields on the **General** FastTab as for any sales order. For more information, see [Sell Products](sales-how-sell-products.md).
3. On a new sales line, in the **Type** field, select **Item**, but leave the **No.** field empty.
4. Choose the **Line** action, and then choose the **Select Catalog Items** action.
5. On the **Catalog Items** page, select the catalog item that you want to sell, and then choose the **OK** button.
   The catalog item automatically converts to a normal item, and the new normal item is selected on the sales line.
6. When the sales order is complete, choose the **Post** action.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you change you mind and delete the sales line, the automatically created item is also deleted. Deleting the item helps reduce clutter in you list of items.
>
> The item is also deleted if you convert the item manually, or make changes such as adding new units of measure or updating prices or cost. However, the item won't be deleted if it's already used in sales or purchase lines, assembly BOMs, or has ledger entries.

# Invoice projects

During a project, costs from resource usage, materials, and project-related purchases can accumulate. As the project progresses, these transactions get posted to the project journal. It's important to record all costs in the project journal before you invoice the customer. You can invoice customers after the project is finished, or at certain intervals based on an invoicing schedule.

You can invoice:

* Multiple projects using a **Project Create Sales Invoice** task.
* Whole projects, projects within a project, or individual project planning lines using the relevant action in the project pages.
* Combine multiple project planning lines from different projects into a single sales invoice using **Get Project Planning Lines** action on the **Sales Invoice** page.

## To create multiple project sales invoices

You can create an invoice for a project or for one or more project tasks:

* When the work to invoice is complete.
* When you reach the date for invoicing set on an invoicing schedule.

The following procedure shows how to use a batch job to invoice multiple projects.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Project Create Sales Invoice**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
3. Set filters to specify the projects to invoice.
4. Choose the **OK** button to create the invoices.  

You can review and post created invoices on the **Sales Invoices** page.

> [!NOTE]
> Alternatively, invoice a customer by selecting the project, and then choosing the **Create Project Sales Invoice** action, or use the **Create Sales Invoice** action in the project tasks.

## To create and post project sales invoice from project planning lines

You can create an invoice from a project planning lines, and specify the quantity of the item, resource, or general ledger account.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Projects**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open a relevant project.
3. Select a project task for which the **Project Task Type** field contains **Posting**, and then choose the **Project Planning Lines** action.  
4. On a project planning line, in the **Qty. To Transfer to Invoice** field, enter the quantity of the item, resource, general ledger account type that you want to invoice.  
5. Choose the **Create Sales Invoice** action.
6. On the **Project Transfer to Sales Invoice** page, enter the posting date and whether you want to create a new invoice or append this invoice to an existing one.
7. Choose the **OK** button.  
8. On the **Project Planning Lines** page, choose the **Sales Invoices/Credit Memos** action.

    The **Sales Invoice** page opens, showing the quantity that you transferred to the invoice.
9. Make any other changes, and then choose the **Post** action.

> [!NOTE]  
> The procedure is similar for creating, reviewing, and posting a project-related sales credit memo.

## Invoice one customer for multiple project tasks

You can simplify your invoicing process by sending one invoice to a customer for multiple projects. Add project planning lines from multiple projects to a sales invoice in one go. This process is similar to creating a sales invoice from a project planning line and entering a value in the **Append to Sales Invoice No.** field.

Here's an overview of the process.

1. Create a new sales invoice, and fill in the **Sell-to Customer No.** field. If needed, also fill in the **Bill-to Customer No.** and **Currency Code** fields.
2. On the **Lines** FastTab, choose the **Get Project Planning Lines** action. The **Get Project Planning Lines** page shows billable project planning lines from projects for the sell-to customer, bill-to customer, and invoicing currency where the quantity to invoice is more than zero. 
3. Choose the lines you want to add to the invoice, and then choose **OK**.

Repeat these steps if you want to add another set of project planning lines. You can also delete the invoice or its lines and start over.

> [!NOTE]
> There are a couple of limitations:
>
> * The **Get Project Planning Lines** action isn't available on sales orders or sales quotes.
> * You can't filter on the **Ship-to Code** or **Contact No.** fields.

## Issue a credit memo for a project

When a credit is due to a customer for something you invoiced for a project, you can create a credit memo to reimburse them. You can issue a credit memo for job planning lines of the types **Billable** or **Both Budget and Billable**. This credit memo ensures that job planning always reflects the correct planned invoice/credit memo lines for the project before you post sales invoices and credit memos. To learn more about sales credit memos, go to [Process sales returns or cancellations](sales-how-process-sales-returns-cancellations.md).

To issue a credit memo for a planning line, follow these steps:

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Projects**, and then choose the related link.
1. Open the project you want to issue a credit memo for.
1. If the **Blocked** field is filled in, clear the field so that you can work with the project.
1. In the **Status** field, change the status from **Completed** to **Open**.
1. Choose the **Project Planning Lines** action.
1. Create a new planning line, and enter the same information as the line you want to credit. However, in the **Quantity** field, enter the same quantity but as a negative value. For example, if the quantity you want to credit is 10, enter a quantity of -10.
1. Choose the **Create Sales Credit Memo** action.
1. On the **Project Transfer to Credit Memo** page, fill in the fields as necessary, and then choose **OK**.
1. To review and post the credit memo, on the **Project Planning Lines** page, choose the **Sales invoices/credit memos** action.
1. On the **Sales Credit Memo** page, review the details. If it looks good, post the memo.

# EU sales list in Germany

In Germany, the German EU sales list is submitted to the "Bundeszentralamt für Steuern" (BZSt) through the BZSt Online Portal by using the ELMA5 interface.  

In order to increase security, all types of taxes and tax reports must be submitted under an authentication method. Beginning in January 1, 2013, it's mandatory that you make submissions with authentication. To do so, you sign in with your BZSt number and private key using your pass phrase on the ELMA5 communications server. ELMA5 is designed to handle the transmission of large datasets of more than 1000 records. Following successful login, you can upload the data transfer in an interactive way. You can also set up the transfer to be automatic.

# Set up data exports for a digital audit (GoBD/GDPdU) in the German Version

You must set up data export record sources to be able to export data for a digital audit according to the Grundsätze zum Datenzugriff und zur Prüfbarkeit digitaler Unterlagen (GDPdU). For each data export type, you must define one or more record sources, where each source is a table from which you want to export data.

> [!NOTE]  
> When someone opens **Data Exports** page for the first time, three data export records with predefined settings are created with the codes **GLAcc 2022**, **FAAcc 2022**, and **Item 2022**. Consider these data export records ready-made templates for exporting data from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] according to government requirements.
>
> - **GLAcc 2022** can be used to export data related to G/L and personal data.
> - **FAAcc 2022** can be used to export data related to fixed asset data.
> - **Item 2022** can be used to export data related to item and invoice data.

## Set up a data export  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Data Exports**, and then choose the related link.  
1. Choose the **New** action.  
1. On the **Data Exports** page, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |-----|-----------|  
    |**Code**|Specify the unique code for the data export, such as **Export-1**.|  
    |**Description**|Specify the description for the data export.|  

You must add record definitions to the data export. Each record definition represents a set of data that is exported.  

## Add a record definition to a digital audit definition group  

1. On the **Data Exports** page, choose the **Record Definitions** action.  
1. On the **Data Export Record Definitions** page, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |-----|-----------|  
    |**Data Export Code**|Select the data export code.<br><br/> If no data export code exists, you can create a new one.|  
    |**Description**|Specify the description for the record definition.|  
    |**Export Path**|Specify the path where the exported files are stored.|  

    Next, you must add the relevant *.dtd* file that is required according to the GDPdU, such as **gdpdu-01-08-2002.dtd**. If you must import a new DTD file to replace an existing file, you must first export the existing DTD file.  

1. Choose the **Import** action.  
1. On the **Import** page, navigate to the location of the relevant DTD file, and then choose the **Open** button.  

Next, you must specify the source for the data that is exported.  

## Add source tables to a data export  

1. On the **Data Export Record Definitions** page, choose the **Record Source** action.  
1. On the **Data Export Record Source** page, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Table No.**|Select the number of the main table to export data from.<br><br/> When you enter a value in the **Table No.** field, the **Table Name** field is updated.|  
    |**Export Table Name**|Optional. An archive file with the necessary data is created, containing an *INDEX.XML* file. You can change the suggested name of the table to be used in the `INDEX.XML` file during the export. The default name is the name of the table without special characters due to the requirements of the auditors' tool.<br><br/> **Tip:** In most cases, the **Export Table Name** and **Export File Name** fields are based on the same value.<br><br/> There may be cases where you specify exporting the same table more than once. You can choose different Export Table Names for each table entry, and the Export File Name is automatically adjusted to match. You can then change the Export File Name as long as it's unique.<br><br/> [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] automatically names the files as follows.<br><br/> **Table Name:** G/L Account<br><br/> **Export Table Name**: GLAccount<br><br/> **Export File Name:** GLAccount.txt<br><br/> **Table Name:** G/L Account<br><br/> **Export Table Name:** GLAccount1<br><br/> **Export File Name:** GLAccount1.txt|  
    |**Period Field No.**|Specify a filter for which date field is used in setting the start date and end date of the report.<br><br/> For example, if you select the **G/L Entry** table as your data export source, you can select one of the date fields that are available in that table.|  
    |**Table Filter**|Specify a field on which you want to set a filter.<br><br/> On the **Table Filter** page, enter filter settings in the **Field Filter** column.<br><br/> For example, you can specify a field that conveys information about the amount. You can also specify a date field and set a filter for it if you want to filter on a time period other than Start Date .. End Date. However, you can't specify a date field and set a filter for it if the same field is already used in the **Period Field No.**|  
    |**Date Filter Field No.**|Specify a date filter field if the table has one.<br><br/> If the table has more than one date filter, don't specify one in this field.|  
    |**Date Filter Handing**|Specify how the date filter is to be handled:<br><br/> - \<blank\>: No filter is set.<br><br/> - Period: Use the specified Start Date and End Date.<br><br/> - End Date Only: Use the batch job's End Date.<br><br/> - Start Date Only: Use the batch job's Start Date - 1.|  
    |**Export File Name**|Specify the name of the file that data from this table is exported to.<br><br/> For example, if the table is the **G/L Account** table, the value of the **Export Table Name** can be **GLAccount**, and the value of the **Export File Name** field can be **GLAccount.txt**.|  
    |**Key No.**|Optional. Specify the key field.|

    > [!NOTE]  
    > The INDEX.XML file contains table and field names in English based on the names of tables and fields. The names of tables and fields are defined in `<Name>` tags, and captions are defined in `<Description>` tags in the *INDEX.xml* file.
    > [!NOTE]  
    > Table and field names is written as-is, including any spaces, dots, parentheses, and so on. The only characters that are removed from the names are *&*, *'* (single quote), *"* (double quote), *<* (less-than sign), and *>* (greater-than sign).

    Learn more in [GDPdU Filter Examples](gdpdu-filter-examples.md).  

    Next, you must specify the fields that data is exported from.  

1. In the **Fields** pane, choose the **Add** action.  
1. On the **Data Exp. Field List** page, select one or more fields that you want to export, and then choose the **OK** button.  

    1. To change the order of the fields, choose the **Move Up** or the **Move Down** action.  
    1. To remove a field from the list of selected fields, choose the **Delete** action.  

You added the main table from which to export. Optionally, you can add one or more related tables.  

## Add related tables to a data export source  

1. On the **Data Export Record Source** page, in the line below the line for the main table, add the related table.  
1. Choose the **Indent** action.  
1. Select the indented table, and then choose the **Relationships** action.  
1. On the **Data Export Table Relation** page, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**From Field No.**|Contains the number of the field in the parent table. You can specify that this field is related to a field in the subordinate table.|  
    |**To Field No.**|Contains the number of the field in the subordinate table. You can specify that a field in the parent table is related to this field.|  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > The **From Field Name** and the **To Field Name** fields are populated automatically.  

1. Choose the **OK** button.  

After you added tables and fields, you must validate that the structure of the data export source is correct.  

## Validate the data export source  

On the **Data Exp. Record Source** page, choose the **Validate** action.  

This validates the list of fields against the keys for the tables. If you select a primary key after you select a secondary key, an error message displays, and you must change the order of the fields in the **Fields** pane.

# Create VAT reports in the German version

You can configure different types of VAT reports based on requirements. Then, when you have to submit a VAT report, you can create it on the **VAT Report** page and then export it in electronic format that conforms to the ELMA5 format requirements.  

## Create a VAT report  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Report**, and then choose the related link.  
1. Fill in the fields in the **General** FastTab, including the fields that are described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**No.**|Specify the report number.<br><br/>Depending on the type of report, and the configuration in your company, you can use the automatically generated number, select a different number series, or enter a different number manually.|  
    |**VAT Report Type**|Select the appropriate VAT report type. The default setting is  **Standard**. If the report is an update to an existing report, choose **Corrective**.|  
    |**Trade Type**|Specify the type of trade that the report is to describe. The default is **Sales**. Other options are **Purchases** or **Both**.|  
    |**Start Date**|Specify the start date of the report period.|  
    |**End Date**|Specify the end date of the report period.|  
    |**EU Goods/Services**|Specify whether the report applies to **Goods**, **Services**, or both. The default is **Both**.|  
    |**Report Period Type**|Specify the time period that the report applies to:<br>- Month<br>- Quarter<br>- Year<br>- Bi-Monthly|  
    |**Report Period No.**|Specify the number of the VAT period.|  
    |**Report Year**|Specify the year that the VAT report covers.|  
    |**Processing Date**|Specify the date that the VAT report is created.|  

1. Fill in the fields in the **Sign-off** FastTab, including the key fields that are described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Sign-off Place**|Specify the location where the VAT report was signed off.|  
    |**Sign-off Date**|Specify the date when the VAT report is signed off.|  
    |**Signed by Employee No.**|Specify the number of the employee who signed the VAT report from the lookup list.|  
    |**Created by Employee No.**|Specify the number of the employee who created the VAT report from the lookup list.|  

1. Import the VAT ledger entries that must be included in the VAT report.  
1. Choose the **Suggest Lines** action.  

This adds VAT entries to the page. For each line, in the **Amount** field, you can drill down to see the VAT ledger entries that are the source of the line.  

After you create the VAT report, you have to submit it to the tax authorities.  

## Submit a VAT report  

1. On the **VAT Report** page, choose the **Release** action.  
1. Confirm that you want to release the report.  

    [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] validates that the VAT report is set up correctly. If the validation fails, the errors are shown on the **VAT Report Error Log** page so that you can make the appropriate changes. For example, an error displays if you try to release a standard VAT report but you have not yet added any lines to the report.  

    When you mark a VAT report as released, it becomes non-editable. If you must change the report after marking it as released, you must first reopen it.  

1. Choose the **Export** action to create a VAT report of EU Sales List data in ELMA5 format. Save a copy of the report, which has the required name specified by ELMA5.  

   You can now submit the report to the tax authorities.  

1. Choose the **Mark as Submitted** action.

# Currency exchange rates in the German version

At the end of the fiscal year, you must adjust currency exchange rates for payables and receivables so that they're valued correctly in the annual balance. The **Adjust Exchange Rates** batch job supports different valuation methods in order to meet legal requirements in Germany.  

## Valuation methods

According to the Bilanz Modernisierungs Gesetz (BilMoG), payables and receivables are valued differently depending on the difference between the reference date and the due date. This is managed by the **Adjust Exchange Rates** batch job where you can specify which valuation method to use. If the due date is less than one year after the reference date, the **Adjust Exchange Rates** batch job must be run using the lowest value valuation method.  

The following table describes the valuation methods.  

|Valuation method|Description|  
|----------------------|---------------------------------------|  
|**BilMoG (Germany)**|Beginning in 2010, each ledger entry is adjusted as follows:<br><br/>- If the due date is less than one year after the reference date, payable/receivable transactions are valued at the actual exchange rate.<br><br/>- If the due date is more than one year after the reference date, payable/receivable transactions are valued at the lowest value, with the possibility of appreciation in value (Wertaufholung) up to the initial value. <br><br/>**Note:** Ledger entries must contain a due date. An entry that doesn't have a due date is treated as a long term liability.|  
|**Lowest value**|Exchange rates are adjusted by using the lowest value of the two exchange rates. Currency losses are always calculated and posted. Currency gains are only calculated and posted up to the original local currency value of the transaction.<br><br/> This ensures that receivables aren't valued above their original posting amounts, and that payables aren't valued below their original posting amounts.|  
|**Standard**|Exchange rates are adjusted according to standard valuation principles. Full unrealized gains and losses are calculated and posted. If the transaction is partially applied, only the remaining amount is included in the adjustment. Learn more in [Adjust Exchange Rates](#valuation-methods).|  

German companies must use the **BilMoG (Germany)** option when they run the **Adjust Exchange Rates** batch job. This ensures that each transaction is adjusted using the appropriate valuation method as required in Germany. This also enables two fields in the request page, where you can specify the two dates that must be used to calculate the adjustment. The following table describes the fields.  

|Field|Description|  
|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
|**Valuation Reference Date**|Specifies the base date that is used to calculate which entries are short-term entries.|  
|**Short term liabilities until**|Specifies the date that separates short-term entries from long-term entries. Short-term entries have a due date that is before or on this date. The default value is the value of the **Valuation Reference Date** field plus one year.|

# Correct VAT reports in the German version

If you have to submit a corrective VAT report or delete a submitted VAT report, you must create a new VAT report. According to the legislation, a corrective report must be submitted within a month of the initial report.  

When you create a corrective report, the report contains two line types per corrected line. In one line type, **Cancellation**, the base value of the VAT is reported as a cancellation. All other information remains the same, and can't be edited. On a new line, **Correction type**, you can make corrections as needed to the VAT amount. The **Suggest Lines** action, however, suggests the correct amount based on the filters and posted documents. You can't correct or modify the **VAT Registration No.**, each period being corrected needs its own corrective report.  

The **Suggest Lines** action recalculates the values to report. The **Correct Lines** action is used to make manual changes. You can combine the effects of the two actions to correct your report.  

## Example corrections scenarios

1. If you post additional VAT entries after you submit the Standard report in the report period, choose **Suggest Lines** in the **Process** group to get the updated amounts.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > If you manually changed the amount for a customer or vendor, this amount is overwritten when additional VAT entries are posted. Update the amount accordingly.  

1. If you want to change the amount of a report line that is submitted and no new VAT entries are posted, choose the  **Correct Lines** action. On the **VAT Report Lines** page, select the lines that you want to correct, and then choose the **OK** button.  

    For each entry, two lines are displayed: **Cancellation** and **Correction**. You can now change the amount on the **Correction line**.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > The **Correct Lines** action doesn't suggest the amount based in VAT entries. If you have new VAT entries for the customer or vendor, instead use the **Suggest Lines** action.  

1. If you used the wrong filters, for example, the wrong VAT product posting group, choose the **Suggest Lines** action, and then set filters as needed.  

    **Suggest Lines** creates entries to account for the difference between the filters.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > If the updated filters exclude a customer or vendor, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] creates a Cancellation line for the previous reported amount and a Correction entry with amount 0.

## Correct a VAT report  

1. Create a new VAT report. Learn more in [Create VAT Reports](how-to-create-vat-reports.md).  
1. Fill in the fields in the **General** FastTab, and set the **VAT Report Type** field to **Corrective**.  
1. In the **Original Report No.** field, select the report that you want to correct. You can only select reports of type **Standard** that are marked as **Submitted**.  
1. Create your correction VAT report line entries.  

    Choose the **Suggest Lines** action. Set filters as needed.  

    On each line, you can drill down on the amounts to see which VAT entries make up the amount. Change the amount if needed. You can't edit, however, the **VAT Registration No.**.  

1. If the **Suggest Lines** action doesn't provide suggestions to correct the amounts that you intended, use the **Correct Lines** action to insert cancellation and correction lines for the customer or vendor.  
1. Continue with the VAT report creation process, and release the report.

# Walkthrough: Exporting data for a digital audit in the German version

You can export business data for auditing purposes. How the data export is set up is different for all companies, and you should ask your tax advisor and the tax auditor. The following walkthrough describes the end-to-end process, but it's an example only.  

The sample implementation illustrates a scenario where the auditor requests that you export data from your general ledger, and information about your customers and vendors. This isn't an example that is based on actual requirements from a tax auditor, but it serves to illustrate how to export data for a digital audit (GoBD/GDPdU) in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)].  

## About this walkthrough

This walkthrough illustrates the following tasks:  

- Setting up requirements for the data export.  
- Setting up the source for the data export.  
- Exporting data for the tax auditor.  

## Prerequisites

To complete this walkthrough, you need:  

- The German version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] with the CRONUS AG demonstration company.
- The *.DTD* file that is required according to the GDPdU. In this scenario, **gdpdu-01-08-2002.dtd**.  

## Story

Cassie, an accountant at CRONUS AG is notified by the company's tax auditor that they want to see a list of purchase and sales transactions in the first quarter of the calendar year 2013. Cassie knows the type of financial data that the auditor wants, but needs the help of Sean to set up the export.  

Sean is a power user with CRONUS AG and understands how the data is set up technically with tables and fields. Therefore, Sean usually helps Cassie set up the data exports for the auditors. From other data exports, Sean knows that the tool that the auditors use has some requirements on what the exported files must contain, but needs the help of Cassie to establish exactly which data is needed.  

## Defining the requirements

Cassie sets up the requirements for the data export. The auditors ask for transactions with customers and vendors. Therefore, Cassie knows that data is needed from the customer ledger, the vendor ledger, and the general ledger.  

### Set up the requirements for a data export  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Data Export**, and then choose the related link.  
1. Choose the **New** action.  
1. On the **Data Exports** page, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Code**|The unique code for the data export, **AUDIT-Q113**.|  
    |**Description**|The description for the data export, **Data export for Q1 of CY 2013**.|  

    The **AUDIT-Q113** code is a container for the data export.  

    Next, Cassie adds descriptions of the kind of data needed in the export.  

1. On the **Data Exports** page, choose the **Record Definitions** action.  
1. On the **Data Export Record Definitions** page, choose the **Record Code** field, and then, on the page that appears, choose the **New** action.  
1. On the **Data Export Record Types** page, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Code**|The code for the record type, **GLCUSTVEND**.|  
    |**Description**|The description for the record type, **G/L, Cust., Vend.**.|  

1. Choose the **OK** button.  
1. On the **Data Export Record Definitions** page, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Record Code**|Select the record code, **GLCUSTVEND**.|  
    |**Description**|The description for the record type is added automatically, but you can change this to **General ledger, customers and vendors**, for example.|  
    |**Export Path**|Specify the path where the exported files are stored.<br><br/> In this scenario, **C:Exports**.|  

    If the specified folder doesn't exist, choose the **Yes** button to create it.  

Next, Cassie specifies the source for the data that are exported. Cassie knows from previous exports that data is needed from the following tables:  

- **G/L Account**  
- **Customer**  
- **Vendor**  

### Specify requirements for the source for the data export  

1. On the **Data Export Record Definitions** page, choose the **Record Source** action.  
1. On the **Data Export Record Source** page, in the **Table No.** field, enter **15**.  

   The **Table Name** field is automatically updated with the name of the **G/L Account** table.  

1. In the **Notes** part, choose the link, and then enter the following text:  

    **I need entries that show the affected accounts, the posting date, the balance, and the net change.**  

1. Repeat the two previous steps to add tables 18, **Customer**, and 23, **Vendor** to the data export record source.  

    For these tables, Cassie asks for data about each customer and vendor and detailed information about each transaction based on the customer ledger and the vendor ledger. Cassie also asks for the net change at the start of the period, during the period, and after the period that the data export is for.  

1. Choose the **OK** button.  

Cassie has described the kind of data needed, and requests Sean for help with setting up the data export.  

## Setting up the source for the data export

Cassie and Sean talked about the requirements. Cassie explained the comments made for the first three tables in the record sources. The next day, Sean can complete the setup for the data export source.  

First, Sean adds the required *.dtd* file to the data export record definition.  

### Add a .dtd file to a record definition  

1. On the **Data Exports** page, choose the **AUDIT-Q113** data export, and then choose the **Record Definitions** action.  
1. On the **Data Export Record Definitions** page, choose the line where the **Data Export Record Type Code** field is set to **GLCUSTVEND**, and then choose the **Import** action.  
1. On the **Import** page, navigate to the location of the relevant DTD file, and then choose the **Open** button.  

Next, Sean adds the **G/L Entry** table to the source and then adds fields from that table, and the **G/L Account** table.  

### Add the G/L Entry table to the data export record source  

1. On the **Data Export Record Definitions** page, choose the line where the **Data Export Record Type Code** field is set to **GLCUSTVEND**, and then choose the **Record Source** action.  
1. On the **Data Export Record Source** page, select the line under the line for the **G/L Account** table, and then choose the **New** action.  
1. In the **Table No.** field, enter **17**.  

   The **Table Name** field is automatically updated with the name of the **G/L Entry** table.  

1. Choose the **Indent** action.  

   This indents the **G/L Entry** table under the **G/L Account** table. Next, Sean adds a table relationship between the two tables.  

1. Choose the **Relationships** action.  
1. On the **Data Exp. Table Relationship** page, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**From Field No.**|Contains the number of the field in the parent table. In this scenario, the **No.** field on the **G/L Account** table.|  
    |**To Field No.**|Contains the number of the field in the parent table. In this scenario, the **G/L Account No.** field on the **G/L Entry** table.|  

1. Choose the **OK** button.  

### Add fields from the G/L Account and G/L Entry tables to the data export record source  

1. On the **Data Export Record Source** page, select the line for the **G/L Account** table, and then choose the **Add** action.  
1. Choose the following fields, and then choose the **OK** button.  

    |Field number|Field name|  
    |------------------|----------------|  
    |**1**|**No.**|  
    |**2**|**Name**|  
    |**4**|**Account Type.**|  
    |**31**|**Balance at Date**|  
    |**32**|**Net Change**|  

1. On the **Data Export Record Source** page, select the line for the **G/L Entry** table, and then in the **Fields** pane, in the toolbar, choose the **Add** action.  
1. Choose the following fields, and then choose the **OK** button.  

    |Field number|Field name|  
    |------------------|----------------|  
    |**4**|**Posting Date**|  
    |**5**|**Document Type**|  
    |**17**|**Amount**|  

Sean added the **Posting Date** field from the **G/L Entry** table because Cassie needs the data to be filtered based on the posting date. Now, Sean uses the field to specify the field on the **G/L Entry** table that uses to calculate the period for the data export.  

### Add a period filter to a table in a data export source  

1. On the **Data Export Record Source** page, select the line for the **G/L Entry** table, and then choose the **Period Field No.** field.  
1. On the **Data Exp. Field List** page, choose the **Posting Date** field, and then choose the **OK** button.  

   The **Data Exp. Field List** page is filtered to show only the date fields.  

This means that when Cassie exports the data and specifies the start date and the end date for the period that the auditors want, the export includes entries where the **Posting Date** field is between the specified start date and end date.  

Next, Sean adds the **Customer** and **Vendor** tables.  

### Add the Customer table  

1. On the **Data Export Record Source** page, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Table No.**|**18**|  
    |**Export Table Name**|**Customer**|  
    |**Export File Name**|**Customer.txt**|  

1. In the **Fields** pane, in the toolbar, choose the **Add** action.  
1. Choose the following fields, and then choose the **OK** button.  

    |Field number|Field name|  
    |------------------|----------------|  
    |**1**|**No.**|  
    |**2**|**Name**|  
    |**21**|**Customer Posting Group**|  
    |**59**|**Balance (LCY)**|  
    |**61**|**Net Change (LCY)**|  

1. Repeat the previous two steps to add the **Balance (LCY)** field again.  
1. Choose the line for the first instance of the **Balance (LCY)** field, and then, in the **Datefilter Handling** field, choose **Startdate**.  
1. Choose the line for the second instance of the **Balance (LCY)** field, and then, in the **Datefilter Handling** field, choose **Enddate**.  
1. Choose the line for the **Net Change (LCY)** field, and then, in the **Datefilter Handling** field, choose **Startdate..Enddate**.  

    The following table describes the field values for the fields on the **Customer** table.  

    |**Field No.**|**Field Name**|**Field Class**|**Datefilter Handling**|**Export Field Name**|  
    |---------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|  
    |**1**|**No.**|**Normal**||**No**|  
    |**2**|**Name**|**Normal**||**Name**|  
    |**21**|**Customer Posting Group**|**Normal**||**CustomerPostingGroup**|  
    |**59**|**Balance (LCY)**|**FlowField**|**..Startdate**|**StartBalanceLCY**|  
    |**59**|**Balance (LCY)**|**FlowField**|**..Enddate**|**EndBalanceLCY**|  
    |**61**|**Net Change (LCY)**|**FlowField**|**Startdate..Enddate**|**NetChangeLCYPeriod**|  

    > [!TIP]  
    > To change the order of the fields, select a field, and then choose the **Move Up** or the  **Move Down** action.  

Sean added the **Customer** table to the data export source. Now, he adds the **Vendor** table.  

### Add the Vendor table  

1. On the **Data Export Record Source** page, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Table No.**|**23**|  
    |**Export Table Name**|**Vendor**|  
    |**Export File Name**|**Vendor.txt**|  

1. Follow the steps in the previous procedure to add fields from the **Vendor** table to the data export source.  

    The following table describes the field values for the fields in the **Vendor** table.  

    |**Field No.**|**Field Name**|**Field Class**|**Datefilter Handling**|**Export Field Name**|  
    |---------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|  
    |**1**|**No.**|**Normal**||**No**|  
    |**2**|**Name**|**Normal**||**Name**|  
    |**21**|**Vendor Posting Group**|**Normal**||**VendorPostingGroup**|  
    |**59**|**Balance (LCY)**|**FlowField**|**..Startdate**|**StartBalanceLCY**|  
    |**59**|**Balance (LCY)**|**FlowField**|**..Enddate**|**EndBalanceLCY**|  
    |**61**|**Net Change (LCY)**|**FlowField**|**Startdate..Enddate**|**NetChangeLCYPeriod**|  

Sean almost completes the setup, but wants to verify that the data export source meets the technical requirements of the auditors' tool.  

### Validate the data export source  

Choose the **Validate** action.  

Sean now completes the setup of the data export based on the requirements from Cassie. Sean notifies Cassie to start exporting data for the tax auditors.  

## Exporting data for the tax auditors

Cassie wants to export data that can be sent to the tax auditors.  

### Export data  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Export Business Data**, and then choose the related link.  
1. On the **Export Business Data** page, on the **Options** FastTab, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Starting Date**|The start date. In this scenario, **01-01-2018**.|  
    |**Ending Date**|The end date. In this scenario, **03-31-2018**.|  

1. On the **Data Export Record Definition** FastTab, select filters as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Data Export Code**|In this scenario, **AUDIT-Q113**.|  
    |**Data Exp. Rec. Type Code**|In this scenario, **GLCUSTVEND**.|  

1. To export the data, choose the **OK** button.  

When the export is completed, Cassie is notified, and can now submit the exported files to the tax auditors. First, Cassie examines the files in the C:Exports folder on the computer. There's a file for each table, and the files have the names that Sean specified in the data export source. There's also an *INDEX.XML* file that describes the structure of the data export with the names of the tables and fields that Sean specified.  

## Next steps

When the tax auditors import Cassie's files into their software, they can read the data that was exported. If the auditors need a new version of the same data export, Cassie can run the export again.  

The next time the tax auditors request new data, Cassie, and Sean can collaborate to create a new data export.

# Set up VAT reports in the German version

Information from various invoice types is used to feed data into the EU Sales List report. To file a VAT report under the ELMA5 system from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], you need to set up report parameters.  

## Set up a VAT report  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Report Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
1. On the **General** FastTab, select the **Modify Submitted Reports** checkbox to let users modify VAT reports that are submitted to the tax authorities.  

   If the field is left blank, users must create a corrective VAT report instead.  

1. Select the **Export Cancellation Lines** checkbox if you want to include information about cancellation lines when you export data for the VAT report of EU sales. Learn more in [Correct VAT Reports](how-to-correct-vat-reports.md).  
1. On the **Numbering** FastTab, specify the number series to be used for standard VAT reports. This will be the default numbering series that is used on any VAT Report that you then create.  

   Depending on the requirements, you can use the same number series for all VAT reports, or separate number series for each type of VAT report.

   For example, if your company uses separate number series for standard and corrective VAT reports, this number series is the default number series. Users can select a different number series in the **No.** field when they create corrective reports.  

1. On the **ZIVIT** FastTab, specify information for the fields.  
1. Choose the **OK** button.

# Declare VAT-VIES tax in the German version

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] includes the **EC Sales List** report, which you can use to submit information about sales transactions with other European Union (EU) countries/regions to the customs and tax authorities' list system. The report displays information in the same format that is used in the customs and tax authorities' declaration list.  

Depending on the volume of sales of goods or services to other EU countries/regions, you must submit monthly, bi-monthly, or quarterly declarations. If your company has sales of more than 100,000 euros per quarter, you must submit a monthly declaration. If your company has sales of less than 100,000 euros per quarter, you must submit a quarterly declaration. Learn more in [BZSt website](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=204368).  

The report is based on the VAT Entry table.  

## Declare VAT-VIES tax  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT-Vies Declaration Tax – DE**, and then choose the related link.

# Export and print Intrastat reports

> [!NOTE]
> This article explains the old Intrastat Journals functionality, which is now deprecated.

[!INCLUDE[intrastat-2022w2](../../includes/intrastat-2022w2.md)]

Intrastat reporting is required throughout the European Union (EU) and must follow local requirements, such as specific formats and files. All companies in the EU must report their trade with other EU countries/regions. The movement of goods must be reported to the statistics authorities (Statistisches Bundesamt) every month, and a report must be delivered to the tax authorities.  

For Intrastat reporting, you must provide paper reports and files, which must be in ASCII format for Germany. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] includes reports and batch jobs that generate all of the information that must be sent to the German tax authorities. This information automatically includes both receipt and delivery of goods. The Intrastat file contains information from the lines in the **Intrastat** journal.  

## Deprecated Intrastat functionality

This article provides details about the deprecated Intrastat Journals functionality. Learn more in [Set up Intrastat reporting](../../finance-how-setup-report-intrastat.md), which provides information about the updated version of Intrastat.

# Process for digital audit (GoBD/GDPdU)

You can export data from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] according to the process for digital audit (GoBD/GDPdU), which is based on German tax law.  

## Overview  

Section 146 and 147 of the German Fiscal Code (Abgabenordnung, AO) allows tax authorities to assess the data of electronic accounting systems digitally. They may do this with a data storage device submitted to them or by direct or indirect access to the system. In the data storage device scenario, the tax liable company (or the person or entity entrusted with accounting and tax duties) must provide appropriate data storage devices with the data in computer-readable form. This means for the tax authorities that they'll be able to access at will all stored data, including the master data and connections with sort and filter functions. To provide data that can be used and evaluated in this manner, you must define and standardize the file formats for submission by data storage device.  

Tax authorities in Germany use analysis software, IDEA, which imports data from ASCII files. The IDEA software can import data in variable length or fixed length format. It requires an XML file, *index.xml*, that describes the structure of the data files.

## Defining GDPdU export data  

You can configure [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] to export data to meet your needs. You can export large sets of data, and you can export small sets of data. You can export data from a single table or a table and related tables.  

For each data export, you define the tables and fields that you want to export. This depends on the auditor's requests. The selected information is exported to the ASCII files. A corresponding XML file, *INDEX.XML*, is also created to describe the ASCII file structure.  

The elements in the *INDEX.XML* file define the names of the tables and fields that are exported. Because the current auditing tool has restrictions on these field names, such as the length and the characters that are used, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] removes spaces and special characters and then truncates the names to match the 20 character limitation. You can change the suggested table and field names when you add fields to a table definition.  

In most cases, you set up GDPdU data export one time, and then a person in your company can run the export when the auditor requests new data. It's recommended that the setup is handled by people with an understanding of the database structure and the technical hardware in your company, but also in collaboration with people who understand the business data, such as the accountant.  

## Configuration  

You can set up different GDPdU data exports depending on the type of data that you want to be able to export. For example, you can create two GDPdU data exports:  

- One exports high-level information about all general ledger entries, customer ledger entries, vendor ledger entries, and VAT entries.  
- The other exports detailed information about the general ledger entries.  

> [!NOTE]  
> How to set up the GDPdU data exports depends on your company’s needs and the auditor’s requests.  

[Walkthrough: Exporting Data for a Digital Audit](walkthrough-exporting-data-for-a-digital-audit.md) provides an example of how to set up data exports for GDPdU.  

### Data export filters  

When you set up a data export, you can filter data on different levels as described in the following table.  

|Filter level|Description|  
|------------------|---------------------------------------|  
|**Period filters**|You can specify a start date and end date for the data that is exported. You can then use this period filter to filter the data. For example, if you set a period filter for the export, you can then set table filters that use the period.|  
|**Table filters**|You can set filters on each table in the export. For example, you can include only open ledger entries, or entries that have a posting date in the specified filter. For example, you can also set a filter that is based on FlowFields, such as **Net Change (LCY)**, to only export customers where there's a change.<br><br>**Important:**  You can't set a table filter that is based on a FlowFilter.<br><br/> When you add table filters, you can increase performance by specifying the fields that the exported data will be sorted by the value of the **Key No.** field for the record definition. Which keys to use depends on the table. For example, if the table only has two key fields and relatively few entries, then the sort order doesn't affect the speed of the export. But for a table such as G/L Entry, the export is faster if you specify the key in advance, such as the `G/L Account No.,Posting Date` key. If you don't specify a key, then the primary key is used, which might not be the best choice.<br><br/>Other tables in which it can be useful to specify the key include the **Cust. Ledger Entry** and **Vendor Ledger Entry** tables.|  
|**FlowField filters**|You can include FlowFields in the export and set filters based on the period. For example, you can apply the period filter to the **Balance at Date** field on the **G/L Account** table.|  

If you include a FlowField such as the **Net Change (LCY)** field on the **Customer** table, you can specify that the entries must be filtered based on the remaining amount at the end date of the GDPdU period. If you add this as a field filter, then the calculation formulas are based on the dates that are specified during the export.

Learn more in [GDPdU Filter Examples](gdpdu-filter-examples.md).

## Export performance  

If you want to export large sets of data, it can take a long time. We recommend that you set up data exports based on advice from your tax advisor to establish your business needs, and the requirements of the tax auditor. The number of records in a table is also something that you should consider.

# GoBD filter examples in the German version

This article provides examples of how you can use and combine different filter types when you set up your GoBD exports. Setting the right filters can improve system performance.  

The following examples use the **G/L Entry** and **Cust. Ledger Entry** tables for data. They assume that you specified the following dates in the **Export Business Data** batch job.  

- Start Date = 01/01/2013  
- End Date = 12/31/2013  

## Setting up export record source examples  

### Period Field No. field

The following table describes the setup on the **Data Export Record Source** page.  

|Table No.|Table Name|Period Field No.|Period Field Name|Table Filter|  
|---------------|----------------|----------------------|-----------------------|------------------|  
|**17**|G/L Entry|4|Posting Date|No filter set.|  
|**21**|Cust. Ledger Entry|4|Posting Date|No filter set.|  

Results of the export:

- G/L entries and customer ledger entries with posting dates between 1/1/2013 and 12/31/2013.  

### Table filter field

In this example, in addition to the **Period Field No.** information, you also specify a table filter. This filter is useful when you want to include other filters to specify more criteria, for example, amounts, in addition to starting and ending dates for your export.  

|Table No.|Table Name|Period Field No.|Period Field Name|Table Filter|  
|---------------|----------------|----------------------|-----------------------|------------------|  
|**17**|G/L Entry|4|Posting Date||  
|**21**|Cust. Ledger Entry|||Cust. Ledger Entry: **Posting Date=..31-12-13**|  

Results of the export:

- G/L entries with posting dates between 1/1/2013 and 12/31/2013.  
- Customer ledger entries with posting dates that are earlier than 01/01/2014.  

### Date Filter Field No. and Date Filter handling fields

The following example shows how to set date type **FlowFilters**. If a table has more than one date FlowFilter, you can't specify the one to use. However, you can specify how to handle the date filter.  

|Table No.|Table Name|Period Field No.|Period Field Name|Table Filter|Date Filter Handling|  
|---------------|----------------|----------------------|-----------------------|------------------|--------------------------|  
|**18**|Customer|||Customer: **Net Change (LCY)**=<>0|**Period**|  
|**21**|Cust. Ledger Entry|4|Posting Date|Cust. Ledger Entry: **Remaining Amt. (LCY)**=<>0|**End Date Only**|  

Results of the export:

- Customers that have a **Net Change (LCY)** that is greater or less than **0** in the period from 1/1/2013 and 12/31/2013.  
- Customer ledger entries with posting dates between 01/01/2013 and 12/31/2013 that have a **Remaining Amt. (LCY)** that is greater or less than **0** on 12/31/2013.  

### Date filter handling for the same table

In this example, you set multiple filter definitions for the same table.  

|Table No.|Table Name|Table Filter|Date Filter Handling|  
|---------------|----------------|------------------|--------------------------|  
|**18**|Customer|Customer: **Net Change (LCY)**=<>0|**Period**|  
|**18**|Customer|Customer: **Net Change (LCY)**=<>0|**Start Date Only**|  

Results of the export:

- Customers that have a **Net Change (LCY)** that is greater or less than **0** in the period from 1/1/2013 and 12/31/2013.  
- Customers that have a **Net Change (LCY)** that is greater or less than **0** on the day before the start date.

# Set up and export sales VAT advance notifications

A sales VAT advance notification is an XML file that you can use to report VAT to the German tax authorities on the Elektronische Steuererklärungen (ELSTER) online portal. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] generates an XML file with tax and base amounts, and information about your company in the format and layout that German tax authorities require.

> [!NOTE]
> Most of the functionality is included in the **ELSTER VAT Localization for Germany** extension. Make sure that this is installed in your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)]. Learn more in [Customizing Business Central Online Using Extensions](../../ui-extensions.md).

## Process

To create valid sales VAT advance notification, you must set up the following information:  

- The company registration information and tax office information.  
- Basic sales VAT advance notification on the **Electronic VAT Decl. Setup** page.
- The VAT statement.  

### Set up company information

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Company Information**, and then choose the related link.  
1. On the **Company Information** page, fill in the fields. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](../../includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

   Specifically for sales VAT advance notifications, in the **VAT Representative** field, enter the contact person for VAT-related information.  
1. Choose the **OK** button.  

### Set up the electronic VAT declaration

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Electronic VAT Decl. Setup**, and then choose the related link.
1. Fill in the fields as described in the following table.

|Field|Description|
|-----|-----|
|**Sales VAT Adv. Notif. Nos.**|Choose the number series to assign identification numbers to new sales VAT advance notifications.|
|**Sales VAT Adv. Notif. Path**|Enter the path and name of the folder where you want to store the XML files.|
|**XML File Default Name**|Enter the name of the file.|

### Set up a VAT statement

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Statement**, and then choose the related link.  
1. On the **VAT Statement** page, in the **Name** field, choose the dropdown arrow.  
1. On the **VAT Statement Names** page, in the line for the appropriate VAT statement name, select the **Sales VAT Adv. Notification** field.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The VAT statement must have a VAT statement line for each key figure required by the tax authority, where the **Row No.** field contains the key figure and the **Amount Type** field specifies whether this is a base amount or a tax amount. Ask your tax office if you have questions concerning the key figures and their definition.

1. Choose the **OK** button.  

## Create an XML document

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Vat Advanced Notification List**, and then choose the related link.  
1. On the **Sales Vat Advanced Notification List** page, choose the **New** action.  
1. On the **Sales VAT Adv. Notif. Card** page, fill in the fields. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](../../includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

    > [!CAUTION]
    > If you submitted a sales VAT advance notification as a test notification by selecting the **Testversion** field, you can't change it into a real notification later. The tax authority doesn't accept the same XML file if it's submitted with the **Testversion** field cleared.

    Optionally, choose the **Preview statement** action to see a VAT statement that shows the data that is in the XML that you submit to the ELSTER portal. This view shows an amount for each element in the XML file in a human-readable format.  

    > [!NOTE]
    > In versions older than version 19.3 and other updates that are made available in January and February 2022, the **Sales VAT Adv. Notif. Card** page shows fields and actions based on deprecated functionality in both the ELSTER portal and [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)]. Specifically fields that are tied to stylesheets are no longer in use, because the ELSTER portal no longer provides such stylesheets.
1. Choose the **Create XML-File** action.
1. On the **Create XML - VAT Adv. Notif.** page, in the **XML-File** field, choose either the **Create** or the **Create and Export** option.  

    If you choose the **Create and Export** option, the XML file is generated and saved to your device. If you choose the **Create** option, data is generated in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] as an XML file when you choose the **Export** action on the **Sales VAT Adv. Notif. Card** page.  
1. Choose the **OK** button.  

After the sales VAT advance notification document is created, all fields in the **Sales VAT Adv. Notif. Card** page can no longer be modified, except the **Description** field, because they define the content of the XML document. If you created an XML document and want to create a new XML document for the same period without transmitting the existing document to the tax authority, you must delete the existing XML file. Then, create the new document.

# Belgian Intrastat reporting

[!INCLUDE[intrastat-2022w2](../../includes/intrastat-2022w2.md)]

Companies in the European Union (EU) are required to report trade with other countries/regions in the EU. This reporting process is through Intrastat reporting or VIES (VAT Information Exchange System). There are two types of Intrastat declarations:  

- Simplified declaration  
- Extended declaration  

To determine the type of declaration that you should use, visit the [National Bank of Belgium](https://aka.ms/BelgianNationalBank) website.  

## Submitting the Intrastat report

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], you can export the Intrastat declarations to a file that you can then submit to the OneGate portal. Learn more in [Export Intrastat Third-Party Declarations](how-to-export-intrastat-third-party-declararations.md).

# Belgian electronic payments

In the Belgian version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], you can make the following types of electronic payments:  

|Electronic payment|Description|  
|------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
|Domestic|A local financial institution process these payments in the local currency (LCY) for beneficiaries who have accounts that have a local financial institution. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] verifies the validity of the bank account numbers.|  
|International|A local financial institution process these payments that are either in foreign currencies or in LCY for beneficiaries who have accounts that have foreign financial institutions. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] verifies the validity of the bank account numbers.|  
|SEPA|These payments are in Euro and are processed in countries/regions that accept SEPA payments. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] verifies the validity of the bank account numbers.|  
|Non-Euro SEPA|These payments are in currency other than Euro and made to a country/region outside the European Economic Association (EEA). [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] verifies the validity of the bank account numbers.|  

Because the standard for electronic payments is different for countries/regions, only financial institutions in Belgium can process electronic payments created in the Belgian version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)]. The local financial institutions process the payment with the foreign institutions for international payments.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Credit memos can't be processed separately because payments must not have a negative balance. To process a credit memo, the credit memo must be added to one or more invoices by summarizing payments.  

Before you can make electronic payments, you must set up use electronic banking. Learn more in [Setup](belgian-electronic-banking.md#setup). You must also specify the relevant export protocols. Learn more in [Set Up Export Protocols](how-to-set-up-export-protocols.md).  

## Activate SEPA payments

[!INCLUDE [activate-sepa-payments](../includes/BENL/activate-sepa-payments.md)]

You can now make SEPA payments. Learn more in [Exporting Payments to a Bank File](../../finance-make-payments-with-bank-data-conversion-service-or-sepa-credit-transfer.md#exporting-payments-to-a-bank-file). If you don't use the AC Banking 365 capability, you can export payment journal lines to a file. Learn more in [Export Payment Files](how-to-print-payment-files.md).  

## File non-Euro SEPA payments

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], you can file non-Euro SEPA payments with the bank. This is useful when you make payments to other countries/regions that don't use SEPA and for currencies other than the Euro.  

Before you can file a non-Euro SEPA payment, you must complete the following administration tasks:  

1. Set up a new export protocol for a non-Euro SEPA.  
1. In the **Country/Region** table, clear the **SEPA Allowed** field for each country that belongs to the EEA zone.  
1. In the **General Ledger Setup** page, verify that the **Currency Euro** field is blank, and that the **SEPA Non-Euro Export** field is selected.  
1. Verify that the vendor's **Preferred Bank Account** field in the **Vendor** table contains the IBAN and SWIFT code.  

## File a non-Euro SEPA payment  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **File Non Euro SEPA Payments**, and then choose the related link.  
1. Fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Journal Template Name**|Specify the general journal template for the non-Euro SEPA payment report.|  
    |**Journal Batch**|Specify the general journal batch for the non-Euro SEPA payment report.|  
    |**Post General Journal Lines**|Specify if you want to transfer the payment lines to the general ledger.|  
    |**Include Dimensions**|Enter the dimensions that you want to include in the non-Euro SEPA payment report. The option is available only if the **Summarize Gen. Jnl. Lines** field on the **Electronic Banking Setup** page is selected.|  
    |**Execution Date**|Enter an execution date if you want an execution date that differs from the posting date on the payment lines.|  
    |**File Name**|Enter the name of the file, including the drive and folder, to which you want to print the report.|  

## Correct payment lines

You must correct all errors before you can post the electronic payment lines. You can correct payment lines in the following ways.  

|Correction|Description|  
|----------------|---------------------------------------|  
|Add a payment journal line|If the payment journal already contains many lines and you want to add an additional line, you can enter the journal line manually. For example, if you want to reimburse a credit memo to a customer. These types of customer payments aren't suggested automatically by the **Suggest Vendor Payments** batch job.|  
|Edit a payment journal line|If you don't assign a bank account to the payment journal or if you don't specify a preferred bank account on the Vendor card, you have to manually enter this information on each journal line before posting the journal. If you specify a bank account for a vendor, the bank account is copied to all payment journal lines for that vendor. Learn more in [Setup](belgian-electronic-banking.md#setup).|  
|Delete a payment journal line|The **Suggest Vendor Payments** batch job creates payment suggestions for all vendors matching the specified criteria. If you want to prevent payment for a specific vendor ledger entry or vendor, you can delete the corresponding journal lines.|

# Belgian CODA bank statements in the Belgian version

The Coded Statement of Account (CODA) is a national banking standard, designed by the Belgian Banker's Association, which allows you to automatically process electronic bank statements.  

Each type of transaction in a CODA statement is assigned a unique code. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] uses this code to interpret transactions and apply them to the corresponding ledger entries.  

## Applying statement lines

When you have imported a CODA statement, you can apply the statement lines to existing ledger entries, based on the information in the **Transaction Coding** table.  

If the transaction coding of the statement line isn't found, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] stops processing and continues with the next statement line. If you select the **Default Posting** field, the statement line is used as a default posting.  

If the transaction coding of the statement line is found, the statement lines are matched to the following account types and corresponding account numbers:  

- **General ledger**: If the account type is a general ledger account, the statement line is posted on the corresponding general ledger account.  

-**Customer or vendor**: If the account type is customer or vendor, a matching customer or vendor ledger entry is found based on the following criteria:

  - If a ledger entry is found using the standard format, the ledger entry is matched to the statement line, and the application status is set to **Applied**. If the ledger entry doesn't use the standard format, the bank account number of the customer or vendor is used to find the customer or vendor.
  - If no ledger entry with a matching remaining amount is found, the customer or vendor account is used, and the application status is set to **Partly Applied**.
  - If the bank account number is used to find the customer or vendor, a matching ledger entry is found based on the amount of the statement line. If the amount is found, the statement line is matched to the corresponding ledger entry, and the application status is set to **Applied**.  
  - If the bank account number can't be used to find the customer or vendor, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] either stops processing the current line or uses the line as a default posting, before continuing with the next statement line.  

You can run the process as many times as you like. Only statement lines with a blank application status are applied.  

When you have applied all statement lines to a general ledger account or to a matching customer ledger entry or vendor ledger entry, you're ready to post the CODA statement lines. Learn more in [Automatically Transfer and Post CODA Statements](how-to-manually-transfer-and-post-coda-statements.md).  

## Extending the CODA integration

The current support for CODA bank statements can be used in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] online and on-premises. However, partners can't extend the capabilities in an app for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] online. The code isn't deprecated but can only be extended or customized for on-premises deployments.

# Enterprise numbers and branch numbers in the Belgian version

Companies receive a unique enterprise number and one or more branch numbers from the Belgian [Crossroads Bank for Enterprises](https://crossroadsbankenterprises.com/). These numbers are used in all correspondence to simplify communication with the Belgian administrative and legal authorities.  

## Enterprise numbers

The enterprise number replaces the existing VAT number. For existing companies with a VAT registration number, the enterprise number is set as the VAT registration number preceded by a leading zero. New companies receive a new enterprise number.  

The enterprise number is printed on the following documents:  

- Outgoing sales and purchase documents  
- Financial statements  
- Reminders and finance charge memos  
- Intrastat forms and files  

The enterprise number is set up in the following locations:  

- Company Information table  
- Contact card  
- Customer table  
- Vendor table  

## Branch numbers

A branch number is given to a company to identify an address where at least one of the company’s activities is exercised, for example, a workshop, office, warehouse, agency, or subsidiary. Unlike the enterprise number, there's no legal requirement to print the branch number.  

All branches of a company receive a unique number that is different from the enterprise number. The branch number is transferable to another company, such as after a merger or takeover.  

The branch number is set up in the following locations:  

- Company Information table  
- Location table

# Set up export protocols in the Belgian version

Before you can use electronic banking, you must set up export protocols. Export protocols define the file format that is generated when you export payment history to be processed by the bank. Each line contains an export protocol identified by a code and a description. You can set up as many export protocols as necessary. You must set up an export protocol for domestic payments, international payments, SEPA payments, and non-Euro SEPA payments.  

 With export protocols, you can assign the codeunit that defines the check that should be performed before exporting the payment lines to a file and the report that defines the payment format. For example, you might have an export protocol named **DOM1**. This export protocol contains the **Check Domestic Payments** check codeunit and the **File Domestic Payments** report. Each export protocol has both a check codeunit and a matching report, as shown in the following table.  

|**Check Object ID**|**Export Object ID**|  
|-------------------------|--------------------------|  
|2000002 Check Domestic Payments|Report 2000001 File Domestic Payments|  
|2000003 Check International Payments|Report 2000002 File International Payments|  
|2000004 Check SEPA Payments|Report 2000005 File SEPA Payments|  
|2000005 Check Non-Euro SEPA Payments|Report 2000006 File Non-Euro SEPA Payments|  
|2000007 Check SEPA 001.001.09 Payments|Report 2000008 File FCY SEPA 001.001.09 Payments|
|If you don't want this option, set it to zero; otherwise, select another option.|XMLport 1000 (SEPA pain.001.001.03 Payments)|  

 After you set up export protocols, you can use them in your electronic banking payment journals.  

## Setup process

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Export Protocols**, and then choose the related link.  
1. Choose the **New** action.  
1. On the **Export Protocols**  page, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

   |Field|Description|  
   |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
   |**Code**|Specify a code that uniquely identifies the export protocol.|  
   |**Description**|Specify a description for the export protocol entry. You can enter a maximum of 50 characters, both numbers and letters.|  
   |**Code Expenses**|Specify the code that describes the type of expenses associated with the export protocol entry. Code expenses include **blank**, **SHA**, **BEN**, and **OUR**. For international payments, **SHA** is the default.|  
   |**Check Object ID**|Specify the identification number of the codeunit that you want to use to perform a check on the object before the payment file is exported.|  
   |**Check Object Name**|Specify the name of a verification process that is used to perform a check on the object before the payment file is exported. After you select the **Check Object ID**, this field will display the **Check Object Name**.|  
   |**Export Object Type**|Specify the type of the object that defines the export format of the payment file export. After you select the **Export Object ID**, this field displays the **Export Object Type**.<br><br/> **NOTE:** To set up the export protocol for SEPA pain.001.001.03, select **XMLPort**.|  
   |**Export Object ID**|Specify the identification number of the object that defines the export format of the payment file export. For example, if you select **2000002**, the export format for the payment file is **File International Payments**.<br><br/> **NOTE:** To set up the export protocol for SEPA pain.001.001.03, select XMLport **1000**.|  
   |**Export No. Series**|Specify the number series that is used to assign identification numbers to the payment file export.|  
   |**Grouped Payment**|Specifies if this export protocol is used for grouped payments.|

# Direct debit using domiciliation

A domiciliation is a financial agreement between you and your customers, allowing you to automatically collect the payments for customer's invoices through a preferred bank account. Domiciliation can only be processed for domestic customers with domestic bank accounts. Domiciliation in foreign currencies or involving foreign banks aren't supported.  

Direct debit domiciliation is useful for companies with many customers or subscribers, such as a utility company or a publishing company.  

Before you can start using electronic banking for domiciliation, you must enter certain basic information.  

- **Domiciliation number** - This is a unique code obtained from the bank which identifies the domiciliation agreement between you, your customer, and the bank. The contract contains details regarding payment frequency, bank account numbers, and amounts. When you send your payments to the bank, the bank uses the domiciliation number to identify all parties involved.  

- **Preferred bank account** - The preferred bank account is suggested as a default bank account on all domiciliation suggestions for that customer. If necessary, you can change the bank account before posting the domiciliation suggestions. Learn more in [Generate Domiciliation Suggestions](/dynamics365/business-central/LocalFunctionality/Belgium/direct-debit-using-domiciliation).  

## Set up domiciliation

Before you can use electronic banking for domiciliation, you must enter the customer's domiciliation number and preferred bank account.  

> [!NOTE]  
> You should use one bank account per customer for all domiciliation.  

### Set up process

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customers**, and then choose the related link.  
1. Select the customer, and then choose the **Edit** action.  
`. Fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |-----|-----------|  
    |**Domiciliation**|Enter the domiciliation number for the customer. This number is used when you create domiciliation for this customer.|  
    |**Preferred Bank Account**|Enter the preferred bank account for transactions with this customer. This account is used when you create a payment suggestion for this customer.|  

## Generate domiciliation suggestions

After setting up domiciliation, you can start generating domiciliation suggestions. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], you can create domiciliation suggestions for domestic customers only.  

### Process

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Domiciliation Journal**, and then choose the related link.  
1. In the **Batch Name** field, select the required journal batch, and then choose the **Suggest Domiciliations** action.  
1. Fill in the fields as displayed in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Due Date**|Enter the due date to be included in the batch job. Only entries that have a due date before or on this date is included.|  
    |**Take Payment Discounts**|Select if you want the batch job to include customer ledger entries for which you can receive a payment discount.|  
    |**Payment Discount Date**|Enter the date that is used to calculate the payment discount.|  
    |**Select Possible Refunds**|Select if you want the batch job to include refunds.|  
    |**Posting Date**|Enter the date that appears as the posting date on the lines that the batch job inserts in the domiciliation journal.|  

1. Enter any additional filter criteria.  
1. Choose the **OK** button.  

When the batch job is finished, the domiciliation journal contains all open customer ledger entries that match the filters.  

> [!NOTE]  
> The domiciliation suggestions include only customers who have a Domiciliation number set up. Learn more in the [Set up domiciliation](#set-up-domiciliation) section.  

## Edit and delete domiciliation lines

After generating domiciliation suggestions, you might want to change the domiciliation lines. For example, you might want to reassign a bank account or prevent payment for a specific customer or customer ledger entry.  

After modifying the journal lines, print the **Domiciliation Journal - Test** report to test all journal lines.  

The **Suggest Domiciliations** batch job creates domiciliation suggestions for all customers matching the specified criteria.  

### Edit a journal line  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Domiciliation Journals**, and then choose the related link.

1. Choose the **Test Report** action.  
1. Choose the **Print** button to print the report, or choose the **Preview** button to view it on the screen.  

## Export and Post Domiciliation

You can submit domiciliation to your bank by exporting the data to a file. When you export to a file, you can choose to automatically post the lines to the general ledger.  

Depending on setup of the **SEPA Direct Debit Exp. Format** field on the **Bank Account Card** page, the **File Domiciliations** action opens either of these request pages:  

- **Create Gen. Jnl. Lines** page – for the SEPA Direct Debit format.

# Belgian VAT

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] includes Belgian extensions to the VAT reporting capabilities so that you can print VAT transaction details. You must send the following reports to the Belgian tax authorities:  

- **Monthly/Quarterly declaration**: Use this report to create monthly or quarterly VAT declarations, depending on your company revenue.  

- **VAT annual listing (on paper/disk)**: Use this report to annually report all amounts invoiced for both goods and services to all Belgian companies with a registered VAT number.  

- **EC sales list**: Use this report to report the sales of goods to other countries/regions in the European Union. Learn more in [About the EC Sales List Report](../../finance-how-report-vat.md#ecsaleslist).  

You're also required to provide a printed statement detailing the VAT transactions to the Belgian tax authorities.

## Nondeductible VAT

In Belgium, VAT can be fully or partially deductible. Expenses such as representation cost or purchases of cars are only partially deductible, and the transaction must specify how much of the VAT is nondeductible. For example, you create a general ledger account for fixed assets such as cars, and another account for representation cost. For each account, you specify how much of the reported VAT is nondeductible by setting the **Percentage Non deductible VAT** field. Then, when you post a transaction, the deductible VAT posts to the corresponding VAT account. The nondeductible VAT is added to the base amount and posted to the same account as a tangible or intangible asset.  

For fixed assets, the nondeductible VAT depreciates just like the base acquisition cost of the fixed asset. You must set up separate fixed asset posting groups for each percentage of nondeductible VAT. You must do so because each fixed asset posting group posts to a general ledger account where the **Percentage Non deductible VAT** field specifies how much VAT must post to the same account as the fixed asset.  

If you select the **Incl. Non Deductible VAT** field in a VAT statement line, nondeductible VAT is included in the VAT amount. The **Calc. and Post VAT Settlement** report adds the nondeductible part of that amount to the **Non Ded. VAT Amount** and **Non Ded. Source Curr. VAT Amt.** fields in the resulting VAT entries.  

## Multiple VAT numbers for customers

The feature for using multiple VAT registration numbers for customers, including adding different **VAT Registration Numbers**, **VAT Business Posting Groups**, and **General Business Posting Groups** for addresses in another country, are available in the Belgian localization. Learn more in [Multiple VAT registration numbers](../../finance-how-use-multiple-vat-registrations.md).

In addition to different **VAT Registration Numbers**, **VAT Business Posting Groups**, and **General Business Posting Groups**, businesses using the Belgian localization also need to work with the **Enterprise No.**. When you open the **Alternative Customer VAT Registration** page, you can add the **Enterprise No.** for the customer if their address is in another country. After you enter this information, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] does the following things when you're working with sales documents:  

- If the customer is from Belgium and the ship-to address is in Belgium, the **Enterprise No.** comes from the **Customer** card.
- If the customer is from Belgium and the ship-to address isn't in Belgium, the **Enterprise No.** is removed.
- If the customer isn't from Belgium and the ship-to address is in Belgium, the **Enterprise No.** comes from the **Alternative Customer VAT Registration** page.
- If the customer isn't from Belgium and the ship-to address isn't in Belgium, the **Enterprise No.** isn't available.  

> [!NOTE]
> If there's a change in the **Enterprise No.** in a sales document, it displays on the **Confirm Alternative Customer VAT Registration** dialog.

# Limit the posting period in the Belgian version

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], you can limit the period by which posting is permitted on three different levels: **by company**, **by user**, and **by template**.  

Limiting posting periods can be useful when a company closes its sales journal at the end of each month. This keeps salespeople from registering sales documents from the previous month. At the same time, the purchase journal may stay open to register incoming purchase invoices from the previous month.  

When you post on the **General Journal Templates** page, the contents of the **Allow Posting From** field and **Allow Posting To** field are checked for a date interval. The date interval indicates when you can post to a journal template. If the field is blank, the **User Setup** page is checked for a date interval for the current user. If the **User Setup** page doesn't contain an interval, the **Allow Posting From** field and the **Allow Posting To** field on the **General Ledger Setup** page is checked for a date interval at the company level.  

## Limit posting periods by company  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Ledger Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
1. To specify the start of the period, choose the **Allow Posting From** field, and then enter the earliest date on which posting to the company is enabled.  
1. To specify the end of the period, choose the **Allow Posting To** field, and then enter the last date on which posting to the company is enabled.  

## Limit posting periods by user  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **User Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
1. To specify the start of the period, choose the **Allow Posting From** field, and then enter the earliest date on which the user can post to the company.  
1. To specify the end of the period, choose the **Allow Posting To** field, and then enter the last date the user will be able to post to the company.  

## Limit posting periods by template  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Journal Templates**, and then choose the related link.

# Set up vendors for automatic payment suggestions in the Belgian version

You can set up each vendor so that unpaid invoices from that vendor are automatically included in payment suggestions. For each vendor, you must decide whether you want to automatically generate payment suggestions. If you don't want to generate payment suggestions for a vendor, you shouldn't select the **Suggest Payments** checkbox. This way the outstanding ledger entries for the vendor aren't included in payment suggestions.  

## Set up a vendor to be included in the payment suggestion batch  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Vendors**, and then choose the related link.  
1. On the **Vendors** page, select a relevant vendor, and then choose the **Edit** action.  
1. Select the **Suggest Payments** checkbox.  

   If this field isn't selected, no payment suggestions are generated for the vendor.  

1. Choose the **OK** button.

# Export payment files in the Belgian version

After printing a test report and correcting errors, you can export the payment journal lines to a payment file.  

A payment file contains either domestic, international, SEPA, or non-Euro SEPA payments. The file can be sent to a bank electronically. You can create only one file for each posting date and each currency code. When you export the payments to a file, an accompanying note is printed, which can also be sent to the bank.  

In the payment journal, the **Status** field on the exported lines is set to **Posted**.  

## Print a payment file  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter *Payment Journal*, and then choose the link to open the **EB Payment Journal** page.  
1. In the **Batch Name** field, select the required journal batch.  
1. In the **Export Protocol** field, select the export protocol.  

   Export protocols control which payment file is generated in the payment journal. You can have a mixture of export formats in a single batch, such as domestic, international, SEPA, or a combination of these. However, when exporting the payment lines to a file, you can use only one export format, or export protocol.  

   > [!NOTE]
   > By defining the export protocol, you also define the type of validation that is performed in the payment journal.
1. Enter the payment journal line information.

    1. Choose the **Suggest Vendor Payments** action.
    1. In the **Suggest Vendor Payments EB** page, set the relevant filters and options.

        This batch job processes open vendor ledger entries and creates a payment suggestion as lines in a payment journal. Open vendor ledger entries result from posting invoices and finance charge memos.

        Only the ledger entries of vendors where the **Suggest Payments** field is selected on their **Vendor** card are included in the batch job. The suggestions are registered in a payment journal. You must specify a last payment date that is used in the batch job.

        In addition, only vendor entries that aren't marked as **On Hold** in the **Vendor Ledger Entries** page are included in the batch job. You can also run the batch job so that it also includes payments for which you can obtain a discount.

        When you enter an available amount, the vendors are ordered by **Priority**.

        You can define what is included in the report by setting filters. To set additional fields on the tab, choose the field. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](../../includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
    1. Delete or modify the lines as appropriate.
    1. If no bank account is indicated on the payment journal template, indicate a bank account to pay with on each line.
1. Choose the **Check Payment Lines** action.

    The **Export Check Error Logs** page displays any errors that exist. If there are errors, you must fix them before you can continue.

1. If there are no errors, choose the **Export Payment Lines** action.  

   The report that you specified in the relevant export protocol processes the payment lines and generates the file.

# Make journal templates mandatory in the Belgian version

You can use journals to post purchase and sales documents and make other general ledger entries. Journal templates can then help you structure different types of entries. In the Belgian version of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], you must specify if journal templates are required in the current company.  

## Make journal templates required in a company

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Ledger Setup**, and then choose the related link.

> If the **Journal Template Name Mandatory** field isn't selected, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't use template names in the posted documents and entries.

## Use journal templates in sales and purchase documents

If your organization decides to switch on the **Journal Template Name Mandatory** field, you must configure which journal templates must be used as default in sales and purchase documents.

> [!TIP]  
> Before you post a transaction, you can change the suggested template name in the **Journal Template Name** field. This way, the transactions are assigned another document number, as defined by the template.

### Use journal templates in sales documents

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales & Receivables Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
1. On the **Journal Templates** FastTab, choose the journal templates you want to use as default for all sales documents.  

### Use journal templates in purchase documents

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchases & Payables Setup**, and then choose the related link.

# Set up non-deductible VAT in the Belgian version

You can calculate VAT amounts for specific types of expenses that can be partially declared as VAT. For example, on the **G/L Account Card** page, if you enter 75 in the **% Non-Deductible VAT** field, then 75 percent of the regular VAT amount is considered an additional cost and is added to the net amount during posting. The remaining 25 percent is posted as regular VAT.  

> [!NOTE]  
> If no value is entered in the **% Non-Deductible VAT** field, the VAT amount is 100 percent deductible.  

## Set up the non-deductible VAT percentage  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Chart of Accounts**, and then choose the related link.  
1. Select a general ledger expense account that requires the partial deduction, and then choose the **Edit** action.  
1. Enter the amount in **% Non deductible VAT** field.  
1. Choose the **OK** button.

# Apply CODA statements in the Belgian version

After a CODA statement is imported, the statement lines can be accessed from the **Bank Account Card** page. The application status on each line is blank because the statement amounts haven't been applied to outstanding ledger entries.  

Statement amounts can be applied to outstanding ledger entries by:  

- Manually applying CODA statement lines.  
- Automatically applying CODA statement amounts to the appropriate ledger entries and accounts. Automatic processing of CODA statement lines is recommended.  

## Manually apply the CODA statement lines  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Bank Accounts**, and then choose the related link.  
1. Select the bank account, and then choose the **CODA Statements** action.  
1. Select the CODA statement, and then choose the **Edit** action.  
1. For each statement line, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Account No.**|Enter the number of the general ledger account, bank, customer, vendor, or fixed asset that the bank account statement line is linked to.|  
    |**Description**|[!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] automatically retrieves the description from the imported CODA file, but you can modify the contents of this field.|  

1. Choose the **OK** button.  

## Automatically apply the CODA statement lines  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Bank Accounts**, and then choose the related link.  
1. Select the bank account, and then choose the **CODA Statements** action.  
1. Select the CODA statement, and then choose the **Edit** action.  
1. Choose the **Process CODA Statement Lines** action.  
1. Fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

   |Field|Description|  
   |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
   |**Default Posting**|Select if you want the batch job to post statement amounts that can't be linked to existing ledger entries.|  
   |**Print List**|Select to print a list of statement amounts that can't be linked automatically.|  

1. Choose the **OK** button.  

   When you start the batch job, statement amounts are applied to existing ledger entries based on the transaction codes. Learn more in [Set up bank accounts for CODA](how-to-set-up-bank-accounts-for-coda.md).

# Summarizing payment lines and general journal lines in the Belgian version

Business Central summarizes payment lines and journal line across the following types of payments:  

- Domestic payments  
- International payments  
- SEPA payments  
- Non-Euro SEPA payments  

## How payment journal lines are transferred to the general journal

When you export the payment journal lines to a file, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] transfers the payment journal lines to the specified general journal. By default, a general journal line is created for each payment journal line.  

The following two fields on the **Electronic Banking Setup** page affect how the payment lines are summarized:  

- **Summarize Gen. Jnl. Lines**  
- **Cut off Payment Message Texts**  

If you select the **Summarize Gen. Jnl. Lines** checkbox on the **Electronic Banking Setup** page, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] summarizes all payment journal lines for a specific vendor into one general journal line. The general description "Payment %1," where %1 is the vendor number, is used for the summarized journal line description. A separate payment line and a separate general journal line are created to handle:  

- Payment journal lines that contain partial payments, with both the **Partial Payment** and the **Separate Line** fields selected.  
- Payment journal lines that contain a standard format message (passes the MOD97 test), which sets **Standard Format Message** to True in the electronic banking journal.

## Example 1

In this example, you export payment lines, and the **Summarize Gen. Jnl. Lines** checkbox is selected. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] creates:  

- One combined payment line in an XML file that has a concatenated payment message. White space is the delimiter.  
- One payment line in the general journal with a generic description that includes the vendor name.  

## Example 2

In this example, you export payment lines, and the **Summarize Gen. Jnl. Lines** checkbox is selected. The **Cut off Payment Message Texts** checkbox is cleared, and the combined SEPA and non-Euro SEPA payment lines exceed 140 characters in the payment message. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] creates:  

- Two combined payment lines in an XML file. The first payment line contains the first concatenated payment messages. The second payment line contains the payment message from the third line.  
- One payment line in the general journal with a generic description that includes the vendor name.  

## Example 3

In this example, you export payment lines, and the **Summarize Gen. Jnl. Lines** checkbox is selected. The **Cut off Payment Message Texts** checkbox is also selected, and the combined SEPA and non-SEPA payment lines exceed 140 characters in the payment message. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] creates:  

- One combined payment line in an XML file that has two concatenated payment messages. An ellipsis (…) is used to indicate that the message is truncated.  
- One payment line in the general journal with a generic description that includes the vendor name.  

Based on the XML structure, the payments are summarized per account number, beneficiary bank account number, and bank account number. The bank account filter can be empty.  

The EndToEndId in the SEPA message is taken from the payment message and can be truncated to the maximum length of 45 characters.

# Create payment journal templates and batches in the Belgian version

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], payment suggestions are generated and posted in payment journals. The structure of the payment journal is similar to the structure of other journal types. However, the payment journal contains some fields that are specific for processing payments. Before you can start generating payment suggestions, you have to set up a payment journal template and a payment journal batch.  

You can assign a specific page and a test report to each journal template. This way, you can manage your domestic and international payments from this adjusted page. The specified *source code* is copied to all the journal lines that are created based on the journal template. The code is also copied to the entries when they're posted. This way, you can always see where an entry is posted from.

If you assign a bank account to the payment journal template, the bank account is inserted on all payment journal batches and payment journal lines that are created by using this template. By specifying a bank account for the journal template, you can reduce the time that is required for checking the payment suggestions.  

## Create a payment journal template  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Payment Journal Templates**, and then choose the related link.  
1. Choose the **New** action.  
1. On the **Payment Journal Templates** page, fill in the fields.  

   [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](../../includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > If the **Page ID** and **Test Report ID** fields aren't shown, you must add them through personalization. The fields must be filled in before you continue. Learn more in [Personalize Your Workspace](../../ui-personalization-user.md).
1. Repeat step 2 for any additional templates.
1. Choose the **OK** button.  

You can create multiple journal batches under each journal template. Several journals, each with its own name, can display the same page. For example, this can be practical if every user must have a dedicated journal.

## Add payment journal batches to the journal template  

1. On the **Payment Journal Templates** page, choose the **Batches** action.  
1. On the **Paym. Journal Batch** page, fill in the fields.  

   [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](../../includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

   > [!NOTE]
   > To have the journal name update numerically, include a number in the journal batch name. For example, the name KBC1 increments by one number with every posting to KBC2, KBC3, and so on.  

   Next, you can test the configuration. Learn more in [Test Electronic Payments](how-to-test-electronic-payments.md).

# Set up declaration types in the Belgian version

[!INCLUDE[intrastat-2022w2](../../includes/intrastat-2022w2.md)]

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], there are two types of declaration:  

- Simplified declaration  
- Extended declaration  

The type of declaration depends on the amount of shipped or received goods. To determine the type of declaration that you should use, visit the [National Bank of Belgium](https://aka.ms/BelgianNationalBank) website.  

When using the extended declaration, also, you need to set up an Incoterm in Intrastat Declaration for each shipping method. If you don't see the **Incoterm in Intrastat Decl.** field on the **Shipment Method** page, you might need to customize the page and add the field.

## Set up declaration types  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Ledger Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
1. Select the **Simplified Intrastat Decl.** checkbox to set up a simplified declaration type. Clear this field to use extended declaration.  
1. Choose the **OK** button.

# SEPA payments in the Belgian version

The Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) unifies payment methods in participating European countries/regions. This makes international payments as easy to process as domestic payments. Regardless of location, European citizens and companies can make and receive payments in euros, whether within or across national/regional borders, with the same basic conditions, rights, and obligations.

# Deferrals in Sales ledger and Purchase ledger reports

When you use deferrals, the Purchase ledger and Sales ledger reports in the Belgian version of Dynamics 365 Business Central must show only the original entries from invoices and credit memos, and not those created using deferrals.

## Set up deferrals

1. Select the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Source Code Setup**, and then select the related link.  
1. On the **General** FastTab, enter any required field information and the fields described in the following table.  

   |      Field   |         Description        |
   |--------------|----------------------------|
   | **General Deferral** | The **Source Code** that the system uses for deferrals that are created from posting in General journals. |
   | **Sales Deferral** | The **Source Code** that the system uses for deferrals that are created from posting in Sales documents. |
   | **Purchase Deferral** | The **Source Code** that the system uses for deferrals that are created from posting in Purchase documents. |

1. Select **OK**.

> [!NOTE]
> You can configure specific source codes for deferral postings or use the same source code for the general journal, sales journals, and purchase journals.  

## Belgium Sales ledger and Purchase ledger reports

After the deferral entries have a specific source code, you can manipulate the reports’ view by selecting **Exclude Deferral Entries** in the Sales ledger and Purchase ledger reports.

When you set the option to **Off**, the report prints all entries related to a specified period. When the switch is **On**, the report excludes the deferral entries.  

> [!NOTE]
> The next period, of one month, doesn't include deferral entries when the switch is **On**.

# Make manual corrections to VAT in the Belgian version

You can make corrections to posted VAT entries without posting the correction into the VAT or general ledger entries. This is useful if you need to make a change to the total sales or purchases VAT amounts without changing the VAT base. For example, you can manually correct VAT if you receive an invoice from a vendor who has calculated VAT incorrectly.  

## Make manual corrections to VAT  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Statement Preview**, and then choose the related link.  
1. Select the line that needs to be corrected. You can make the VAT correction on both the **Row Totaling** and **VAT Entry Totaling** row **Type**.  
1. To make the correction, choose the **Correction Amount** field. The **Manual VAT Correction List** page opens.  
1. Choose the **Edit List** action. On the **Manual VAT Correction List** page, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Posting Date**|Enter the posting date of the VAT correction.|  
    |**Amount**|Enter the amount of the VAT correction. You must enter the correction amount, not the new amount. For example, if the amount is 1,000.00 and should be 1,200.00, enter 200.00.|  
    |**Additional-Currency Amount**|This field displays the amount of the VAT correction in the additional reporting currency.<br><br/> The field is automatically calculated, based on the contents of the **Amount** field and the current exchange rate.|  

1. Choose the **OK** button.  
1. Refresh the **VAT Statement Preview** page to see your corrections.  
1. To view a report related to the preview of the VAT information, choose one of the following actions:  

    |Action|Description|  
    |------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Detailed Report**|Opens the **VAT Statement** report. Learn more in VAT Statement.|  
    |**Form/Intervat Declaration**|Opens the **VAT – Form** report.<br><br/> The **Form/Intervat Declaration** report is based on the VAT Statement template that is defined in the general ledger setup. Therefore, it might export data that isn't the same as what is shown on the **VAT Statement Preview** page.|  
    |**Declaration Summary Report**|Opens the **VAT Statement Summary** report.|

# Test electronic payments in the Belgian version

After you set up electronic banking and generated payment suggestions, you can test the payment journal lines for errors before posting them.  

Some of the information that is validated includes:  

- Whether bank account numbers are valid.  
- Whether positive payment lines are present.  
- Whether domestic and international payments are made from only one bank account.  
- Whether only one bank account can be used for Interbanks Standards Association Belgium (Isabel).  
- Whether payment lines are in euro for Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA).  
- Whether a number series is defined for SEPA.  

You can view any errors on the **Export Check Error Logs** page.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> You have to correct all errors before you can post the lines.  

## Test payment journal lines  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Payment Journals**, and then choose the link to open the **EB Payment Journals** page.  
1. In the **Batch Name** field, select the required journal batch.  
1. In the **Export Protocol** field, select the export protocol.  
1. Enter the payment journal line information, and then choose the **Check Payment Lines** action to validate the payment journal lines. The validation that is performed on the journal lines depends on the type of check that is specified on the **Export Protocols** page.

# Belgian electronic banking

In the Belgian version of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], you can exchange data with Belgian financial institutions  electronically. This speeds up processing time and helps avoid errors caused by manual data entry or processing.  

You can use electronic banking to perform the following functions:  

- Send electronic payments.  
- Process bank statements with CODA.  
- Process direct debits with domiciliation.  

## Setup

Before you can process electronic payments and statements, you must set up electronic banking in the **Electronic Banking Setup** page as described in the following table.

|Field|Description |
|-----|------------|
|**Summarize Gen. Jnl. Lines**| Select to indicate if you want to group the payment journal lines for each vendor. Payments with a structured message aren't grouped. |
|**Cut off Payment Message Texts** |Select to indicate if you want to truncate long payment messages. Messages are truncated if greater than 106 characters for domestic payments and less than 140 characters for international payments. |

Learn more in [Summarizing Payment Lines and General Journal Lines](summarizing-payment-lines-and-general-journal-lines.md), which explains how the two fields affect the transfer of payment journal lines to the general journal.

# Create an audit file for the tax authority in the Dutch version

During an examination of the books for a fiscal year, a tax inspector can ask for data about the basis transactions from the general ledger for that fiscal year. Basis transactions usually are processed via journal entries. That is the reason why the journal entries are the basis for the audit file.  

The tax authority stimulates companies to use the audit file but it isn't prescribed.  

The audit file can also be used to exchange data between companies. You can select every period you want, but the start and end date of the entered period must be in the same fiscal year.  

## Create an audit file  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Tax Authority - Audit File**, and then choose the related link.  
1. On the **Options** FastTab, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Start Date**|Specify the start date of the period on which the data must be based.|  
    |**End Date**|Specify the end date of the period on which the data must be based.|  
    |**Exclude Begin Balance**|Specifies if the audit file must contain the begin balance of general ledger accounts.<br><br/> The field is editable if the start date of the period is equal to the start date of a fiscal year.|  

1. Choose the **OK** button to create the audit file. If you don't want to create the audit file, choose the **Cancel** button to close the page.  

When you run the report, you must specify the name and location of the exported file. The default file name is **audit.xaf**, but you can change that. The file extension must be *.xaf*.

# Payment scenarios

Based on a sales or purchase invoice or credit memo, a proposal can be generated and exported in order to  process it by our bank.  

Using telebanking you can deal with three scenarios:  

1. The payment is done with a bank account denominated in your local currency (LCY), which is the same currency as linked to the invoice/credit memo. Learn more in [Payment Scenario 1 - Domestic Payments (LCY to LCY)](payment-scenario-1-domestic-payments-lcy-to-lcy-.md).  

1. The payment is done with a bank account denominated in the same currency as the currency linked to the invoice/credit memo. Both foreign. Learn more in [Payment Scenario 2 - Foreign Payment (FCY to FCY)](payment-scenario-2-foreign-payment-fcy-to-fcy-.md).  

1. The payment is done with a bank account denominated in your local currency (LCY), while the invoice/credit memo is linked to a foreign currency. Learn more in [Payment Scenario 3 - Foreign Payment (LCY  to FCY)](payment-scenario-3-foreign-payment-lcy-to-fcy-.md).

# Setting up electronic VAT and ICP declarations in the Dutch version

To create electronic VAT and ICP declarations and communicate with tax authorities, set up general information about electronic tax declarations. Your company must be registered with the tax authorities before you can send electronic declarations.

When electronic declarations are set up, you can begin to declare VAT and ICP to the tax authorities. Learn more in [Submitting Electronic VAT and ICP Declarations](electronic-vat-and-icp-declarations.md).  

## Set up electronic declarations  

Ensure that you've uploaded the certificates needed to communicate with Digipoort. Use the **Certificates** page to upload a client and a service certificate. When they're added to the list of certificates, you can continue with setting up electronics declarations.

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Elec. Tax Declaration Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
1. On the **Elec. Tax Declaration Setup** page, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](../../includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
1. If you want the contact ID in the electronic declaration to be filled with the VAT registration number of the company, then select  **Tax Payer** in the **VAT Contact Type** field.
1. If you want to send electronic ICP declarations for a subsidiary company of a fiscal entity, select the **Part of Fiscal Entity** checkbox.  

   > [!NOTE]  
   > If a company has several companies registered as subsidiaries of a holding company, they have the option to submit the VAT declaration individually or combined for one fiscal entity. To set up electronic declarations for subsidiaries of a holding company, you must select the **Part of Fiscal Entity** field on the **Elec. Tax Declaration Setup** page. You can then create an electronic declaration for only one company.<br><br/>
   If you want to combine the tax information for all subsidiaries of a holding company, you must create a VAT statement on paper for each subsidiary company and manually calculate the total amounts for the holding company. These total amounts of the holding company must be entered on the website of the tax authorities.<br><br/>
   You can't combine tax information for ICP declarations. ICP declarations must always be submitted individually.<br><br/>
   For each subsidiary company, an electronic ICP declaration can be created and submitted to the tax authorities. These electronic ICP declarations must contain the VAT registration number of the subsidiary company and the value of the **Fiscal Entity No.** field on the **Company Information** page of the holding company.

1. On the **Digipoort** FastTab, set up the following configurations:
   - In the **Digipoort Delivery URL** field, specify the URL for the production version of the Digipoort Aanlever service. Learn more on [digipoort](https://www.logius.nl/producten/gegevensuitwisseling/digipoort).  
   - In the **Digipoort Status URL** field, specify the URL for the status information that is coming from the Digipoort Statusinformatie service. Learn more in [Electronic VAT and ICP Declarations](electronic-vat-and-icp-declarations.md).
   - Select **Use Certificate Setup** to specify that the certificate codes specified in the next step must be considered to transfer data to the information service.
   - In the **Client Certificate Code** field, specify the client certificate.
   - In the **Service Certificate Code** field, specify the service certificate.

1. To set up endpoints, add the endpoint URLs on the **Endpoints** FastTab.

   > [!NOTE]  
   > Endpoints set up is deployed to 21.1 tenants. However, all values are blank, but the Digipoort solution still works by taking hardcoded values if there are no values in the setup. In the 21.2 release, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] automatically runs an upgrade.

# Single EURO Payments Area (SEPA)

The Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) unifies payment methods in participating European countries/regions, making international payments as easy to process as domestic payments. 300 million European citizens and companies are able to make and receive payments in euros, whether within or across national/regional borders, with the same basic conditions, rights, and obligations, regardless of location.  

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] supports the Dutch requirements for submitting SEPA payments, credit transfers, and direct debit.  

Before you can submit vendor payments electronically in SEPA ISO2022 format, you must activate SEPA in the following pages:  

- Countries/Regions  
- Bank Accounts  
- Export Protocols  
- Transaction Modes  

Additionally you need to verify that vendor payment transaction modes and vendor bank accounts are set up to use SEPA for each vendor.  

Vendor payments made using SEPA ISO 20022 must comply with the following rules.  

- Make all payments in euros.  
- Make payments within the European Economic Area (EEA).  
- Use the vendor bank’s International Bank Account Number (IBAN) and Bank Identifier Code (BIC) information.

# Required descriptions in G-L entry

When entering general journal lines on a form, the system automatically fills in the description field. This description is also stored in the G/L entry after posting the journal. For a good audit trail, a more detailed description is desirable, when you post a journal line of type G/L Account.  

To force the user to enter a more detailed description, it's possible to choose if the system must fill in automatically the description of the G/L account or leave the field blank. If the **Omit Default Descr. in Jnl. Field** checkbox on the **G/L Account Card** page is checked, the system doesn't fill in the **Description** field for that G/L account when selected in a general journal line.  

When posting the journal lines, the system checks if all the **Description** fields are filled in. If there's a blank description, an error message appears.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Leaving the description field blank and checking if all the description fields are filled in before posting will only be done on the general journal pages in several application areas and on the local Cash Bank Giro pages.

# Import post code updates in the Dutch version

Every month, a post code file is delivered with all post code mutations for that month. This post code file can be imported to update the relevant data of the **Post Code Range** table.  

## Import the update file  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Post Codes Updates**, and then choose the related link.  
1. On the **Post Codes Updates** page, choose the **Import Post Codes Update** action.  
1. Specify the path and name of the post code update file, and then choose the **OK** button. If you don't want to import the file, choose the **Cancel** button to close the page.  

If there's no file imported with a full set of post code data, then a message appears.  

Before you update the post codes, the following checks are performed:  

- Is there already an update file imported with a **Date Field** later than the date of this new update file? If so then the process stops.  

- Is there a gap between the date of this file and the value in the **Date Field** for the last imported file? If there's a gap, then a message appears. You can choose if you still want to import the update file.  

Information about the imported post code is saved in the **Post Code Update Log Entry Table**.

# Dutch electronic banking

Electronic banking functionality allows you to create electronic payment files and direct debit files, and to import electronic bank statements from supported bank software.  

## Telebanking

Using Telebanking, you can export payments, import bank statements, and collect data to forward to the bank. Learn more in [Telebanking](telebanking.md).  

You can create payment proposals and reconcile bank accounts in the cash, bank, and giro journals.  

### Payment files

You can make payment proposals for paying open invoices to suppliers. Payment proposals can be edited manually prior to processing to add or remove payment invoices, or to change payment amounts. After processing a proposed payment batch, you can transfer electronic payment files to the bank. If an error occurs in the payment file while importing into the banking software, you can make a copy of the payment file to resubmit to the bank.  

You can make domestic payments and international payments using the designated formats. Learn more in [Telebanking](telebanking.md).  

### Direct debit files

You can create a payment proposal to collect payment from customer bank accounts. You can edit payment proposals manually to add or remove invoices, or to change collection amounts. After processing a proposed payment batch, you can transfer electronic direct debit files to the bank. If an error occurs in the direct debit file while importing into the banking software, you can make a copy of the direct debit file to resubmit to the bank.  

You can only collect payments domestically at this time. Learn more in [Create Proposals](how-to-create-proposals.md).  

### Bank statement import

You can import bank statements from supported bank software, and reconcile them with incoming and outgoing payments. You can also reconcile bank charges and interest earned.  

Learn more in [Import and Reconcile Bank Statements](how-to-import-and-reconcile-bank-statements.md).

# Set up VAT categories

To use the electronic VAT declaration, you must set up a VAT category code for all XML elements in the electronic VAT declaration.  

You must set up all of the possible category and subcategory combinations that represent an XML element in the electronic VAT declaration. Then, you can map the VAT statement data directly to an XML element.  

## Set up a VAT category  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Elec. Tax. Decl. VAT Categories**, and then choose the related link.  
1. On the **Elec. Tax. Decl. VAT Categories** page, choose the **New** action.  
1. Fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Code**|The unique code for each category and subcategory combination. You can enter a maximum of 10 alphanumeric characters.|  
    |**Category**|Specify the main category option for the VAT statement.|  
    |**By Us (Domestic)**|The subcategory for the VAT Statement.<br><br/> Select a subcategory here if the **Category** field displays **By Us (Domestic)**.|  
    |**To Us (Domestic)**|The subcategory for the VAT Statement.<br><br/> Select a subcategory here if the **Category** field displays **To Us (Domestic)**.|  
    |**By Us (Foreign)**|The subcategory for the VAT Statement.<br><br/> Select a subcategory here if the **Category** field displays **By Us (Foreign)**.|  
    |**To Us (Foreign)**|The subcategory for the VAT Statement.<br><br/> Select a subcategory here if the **Category** field displays **To Us (Foreign)**.|  
    |**Calculation**|The subcategory for the VAT Statement.<br><br/> Select a subcategory here if the **Category** field displays **Calculation**.|  
    |**Optional**|Select to indicate that the XML element that is represented by the category code isn't required in the electronic VAT declaration.|  

1. Choose the **OK** button.  

You can now map the VAT statement data directly to an XML element.

# Payment scenario 3 - Foreign payment (LCY  to FCY) in the Dutch version

You can use telebanking for trade with domestic and foreign customers and vendors. This article describes a scenario where the trade is with foreign customers and vendors that use a different currency than your local currency.  

1. Create Vendor/Customer.  
1. Create Vendor/Customer Bank Account.  
1. Create and Post Purchase Invoice for Vendor or Sales Invoice for Customer.  
1. Create Proposal.  
1. Create Payment History.  
1. Export Payment History.  
1. Import Bank Statement.  

> [!NOTE]  
> In the following examples, some standard CRONUS data is being used. Likewise, instead of creating a vendor/customer and a vendor/customer bank account you could use existing data.  

## Create vendor/customer

Create vendor/customer and enter all necessary information. Special attention should be paid to the following fields:  

- **Currency Code**: Set it to the foreign currency (FCY).  
- **Transaction Mode**: Select an appropriate, default transaction mode - that is, one that can deal with foreign currency payments for your local bank.  
- **Preferred Bank Account**: Select an appropriate, default vendor/customer bank account having the same Currency Code as the vendor/customer itself.  

> [!NOTE]  
> To enter a bank account in the **Bank Account**, vendor/customer bank accounts must be available. See below.  

### Example

Hernandez Ortiz (code **ORTIZ**) is one of our Mexican vendors. Purchase invoices are paid through our national bank account (code **ABN**) to their bank account (code **HOBA**). While our bank account ABN is denominated in local currency (LCY), Hernandez Ortiz's bank account HOBA is denominated in Mexican peso (MXN). Therefore, on Hernandez Ortiz's vendor card, we set the **Currency Code** field to **MXN**, fill the **Transaction Mode** field with **ABN** that is linked to our bank account, ABN, and set the **Bank Account** field to **HOBA**.  

## Create vendor/customer bank account

Create vendor/customer bank account and enter all necessary information. Special attention should be paid to the following fields:  

- **Preferred Bank Account**: Enter a valid bank account number.  
- **Currency Code**: Set it to the foreign currency (FCY).  
- **Owner Information**: Be sure all owner information is entered.  

### Example

Hernandez Ortiz's bank account (code **HOBA**) is denominated in **MXN**. Therefore, on Hernandez Ortiz's vendor bank account card, we enter a valid number in the **Bank Account No.** field, set the **Currency Code** field to **MXN**, and fill the fields on the **Owner Information** FastTab with appropriate values.  

## Create and post purchase invoice for vendor or sales invoice for customer

Create a purchase/sales invoice and enter all necessary information. Special attention should be paid to the following fields:  

- **Currency Code**: Set it to the foreign currency (FCY).  
- **Transaction Mode**: Select an appropriate, default transaction mode - that is, one that can deal with local currency payments for your local bank.  
- **Preferred Bank Account**: Select an appropriate, default vendor/customer bank account having the same Currency Code is the vendor/customer itself.  

By default these three fields are populated with values taken from the vendor/customer card.  

When the invoice is finished, it can be posted.  

### Example

When creating a purchase invoice for Hernandez Ortiz, we enter **ORTIZ** in the **Buy-from Vendor No.** field. By default, the **Currency Code**, **Transaction Mode**, and **Bank Account** fields are populated with values taken from the Hernandez Ortiz's vendor card. Therefore, the **Currency Code**, **Transaction Mode**, and **Bank Account** fields are **MXN**, **ABN**, and **HOBA** respectively. Nevertheless, these values can be changed.  

## Create proposal

Open the **Telebank - Bank Overview** page and browse to the bank through which we want to perform our payment. Open the **Proposal** page and generate payment proposals using the **Get Proposal Entries** batch job.  

### Example

Through the **Telebank - Bank Overview** page, we open the **Proposal** page for our bank, ABN. Using the batch job, one proposal line is created for the purchase invoice we just created and posted for the vendor ORTIZ. The amount of the payment is in local currency (LCY).  

## Create payment history

From the **Proposal** page, we process our proposal into a payment history. The proposal disappears and can be found on the **Payment History Overview** page for the same bank.  

### Example

We process our proposal concerning the payment to the vendor ORTIZ and open the **Payment History Overview** page for our bank, ABN. The last payment history is the one we just created.  

## Export payment history

Open the **Payment History Overview** page, browse to the relevant payment history, and then choose the **Export** action. The export batch job appears for the export protocol that is linked to this payment. For this export, the system already has entered appropriate filters. Check, if wanted, any of the fields on the **Options** FastTab, and choose the **OK** button to export the payment. The system generates a text file using a filename as defined in the **Default File Names Field** field of the export protocol, which now is ready to be sent to our bank.  

### Example

As the transaction mode associated with our payment is **ABN**, the **BBV** or **PAYMUL** batch job appears.  

## Import bank statement

After receiving electronic bank statements from our bank, we can import them by running the appropriate import protocol from the **Import Protocol List** page.  

### Example

The bank statement containing our payment to Hernandez Ortiz is sent to us by our bank, ABN. Therefore, we should choose **OFFICE NET EXTRA** as the appropriate import protocol.

# Submitting electronic VAT and ICP declarations in the Dutch version

Companies must submit periodic VAT and Intracommunautaire leveringen (ICP) declarations to the tax authorities.  

- VAT declarations must be submitted on a monthly or quarterly basis.
- ICP declarations must be submitted on a quarterly basis.

> [!NOTE]  
> ICP declarations must be submitted by companies/regions that sell goods or services to European Union (EU) countries. Purchases aren't included in this declaration. <br><br/>
For a transaction to qualify for ICP, it's required that the merchandise crossed the border physically. It isn't enough that the location of an invoice address or the office of the vendor or customer is in another EU country or region.  

You can submit the VAT declarations and ICP declarations in the following ways:  

- Sign in to the website of the Dutch tax office and enter the information manually. Learn more on the [website](https://www.belastingdienst.nl/wps/wcm/connect/en/individuals/individuals) of the Dutch tax office.  
- Create an electronic declaration and submit the encrypted file through the Digipoort channel to the Dutch tax office. Digipoort is the electronic post office provided by the Dutch government for companies. It provides the common infrastructure for the communication of information between companies and the government, including VAT declarations. The reports are in the eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) format. Learn more in [Create Reports with XBRL](../../bi-create-reports-with-xbrl.md).

## Prepare for electronic declaration

Before you can send electronic declarations to the tax authorities, you must perform the following tasks:

1. Ensure that you obtain the certificates from the government. If you haven't, take the following steps to obtain the certificates:

    - Obtain a PKIoverheid certificate for the company if you don't have one already. You can find a list of certificate providers on this [website](https://www.logius.nl/producten/toegang/pkioverheid/aansluiten/toegetreden-csps).  
    - You can register a user of Digipoort on this [website](https://aansluiten.procesinfrastructuur.nl/site/registratienieuw).
    - You can obtain a **Digipoort Service certificate**, on the [Dutch Tax Administration website](https://aansluiten.procesinfrastructuur.nl).

1. Enter general data and personal data received from the tax authorities on the **Elec. Tax Declaration Setup** page. Learn more in [Setting Up Electronic VAT and ICP Declarations](how-to-set-up-electronic-vat-and-icp-declarations.md).

1. Set up a VAT category code for all XML elements in the electronic VAT declaration. Learn more in [Set Up VAT Categories](how-to-set-up-vat-categories.md).

## Create an electronic declaration

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Elec. Tax Declarations**, and then choose the related link.  
1. On the **Elec. Tax Declaration List** page, choose the **New** action.  
1. On the **Elec. Tax Declaration Card** page, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](../../includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  
1. Choose the **OK** button.

The XML elements and the accompanying data of the electronic declaration are displayed on the **Lines** FastTab on the **Elec. Tax Declaration Card** page.

The XBRL reporter ensures that all account numbers that are imported from Business Central are mapped to the XBRL elements in a report. The XBRL reporter also displays a list of errors of unmapped elements or accounts.

## Submit an electronic declaration

With the XBRL reporter, you can submit the Intracommunautaire Leveringen (ICP) declaration or the VAT declaration in the required XML format. When it's submitted, the file is sent to the tax authorities as defined on the **Elec. Tax Declaration Setup** page.

1. On the **Elec. Tax Declaration Card** page, choose the **Submit Electronic Tax Declaration** action.
1. Fill in the fields as described in the following table.

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Client Certificate**|Select the **PKIoverheid** certificate for the company.|  
    |**Client Certificate Password**|Enter the password that encrypts the client certificate.|
    |**Service Certificate**|Select the **Digipoort Service** certificate.|

1. Choose the **OK** button.  

The electronic declaration is submitted to the tax authorities.

> [!NOTE]  
> If there are no intra-community deliveries in the declaration period, then an electronic ICP declaration is created without XML elements for the deliveries. If you submit such a declaration, an error message is displayed.

## Import a response message from the tax authorities

For each electronic declaration, the tax authorities send a response message. These messages must be received from the server of the tax authorities
and be processed. The first step is to import the response message into [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)].

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Elec. Tax Decl. Response Msgs.**, and then choose the related link.  
1. Choose the **Receive Response Messages** action.  
. On the **Options** FastTab, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Client Certificate**|Select the **PKIoverheid** certificate for the company.|  
    |**Client Certificate Password**|Enter the password that encrypts the client certificate.|
    |**Service Certificate**|Select the **Digipoort Service** certificate.|  

1. Choose the **OK** button.

## Process a response message from the tax authorities

When a response message is imported, it must be processed by validating its content against the related electronic declaration. If no errors are found in the electronic declaration and the data is processed by the tax authorities, then the **Status** field on the **Elec. Tax Declaration Card** page is changed to **Acknowledgement**.

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Elec. Tax Decl. Response Msgs.**, and then choose the related link.  
1. Choose the **Process Response Messages** action.  
1. On the **Process Response Messages Batch Job** page, select the appropriate filters, and then choose the **OK** button.  

   The processed information about the response message is displayed on the **Elec. Tax Decl. Response Msgs.**. page.  

1. To export a message or attachment, choose the **Export Response Message** action or the **Export Response Attachment** action.

# Payment scenario 2 - Foreign payment (FCY to FCY) in the Dutch version

You can use telebanking for trade with domestic and foreign customers and vendors. This article describes a scenario where the trade is with foreign customers and vendor that use the same foreign currency as your bank account is set up to use.  

The following list describes the main steps:  

1. Create Vendor/Customer.  
1. Create Vendor/Customer Bank Account.  
1. Create and Post Purchase Invoice for Vendor or Sales Invoice for Customer.  
1. Create Proposal.  
1. Create Payment History.  
1. Export Payment History.  
1. Import Bank Statement.  

> [!NOTE]  
> In the examples below, some standard CRONUS data is being used. Likewise, instead of creating a vendor/customer and a vendor/customer bank account you could use existing data.  

## Create vendor/customer

 Create vendor/customer and enter all necessary information. Special attention should be paid to the following fields:  

- **Currency Code**: Set it to the foreign currency (FCY).  
- **Transaction Mode**: Select an appropriate, default transaction mode - that is, one that can deal with foreign currency payments for your foreign bank.  
- **Preferred Bank Account**: Select an appropriate, default vendor/customer bank account having the same Currency Code as the vendor/customer itself.  

> [!NOTE]  
> To enter a bank account in the **Bank Account** vendor/customer bank accounts must be available. See below.  

### Example

Jannet Carter (code **JANNET**) is one of our US vendors. Purchase invoices are paid through our foreign bank account (code **ABN-USD**) to their bank account (code **JCBA**). Both bank account ABN-USD and JCBA are denominated in the same foreign currency (FCY) - that is, USD. Therefore, on Jannet Carter's vendor card, we set the **Currency Code** field to **USD**, fill the **Transaction Mode** field with **ABN-USD** that is linked to our bank account, ABN-USD, and set the **Bank Account** field to **JCBA**.  

## Create vendor/customer bank account

Create vendor/customer bank account and enter all necessary information. Special attention should be paid to the following fields:  

- **Preferred Bank Account**: Enter a valid bank account number.  
- **Currency Code**: Set it to the foreign currency (FCY).  
- **Owner Information**: Make sure all owner information is entered.  

### Example

Jannet Carter's bank account (code **JCBA**) is denominated in foreign currency (FCY) - that is, USD. Therefore, on Jannet Carter's vendor bank account card, we enter a valid number in the **Bank Account No.** field, set the **Currency Code** field to **USD**, and fill the fields on the **Owner Information** tab with appropriate values.  

## Create and post purchase invoice for vendor or sales invoice for customer

Create a purchase/sales invoice and enter all necessary information. Special attention should be paid to the following fields:  

- **Currency Code**: Set it to the foreign currency (FCY).  
- **Transaction Mode**: Select an appropriate, default transaction mode - that is, one that can deal with foreign currency payments for your foreign bank.  
- **Preferred Bank Account**: Select an appropriate, default vendor/customer bank account having the same Currency Code is the vendor/customer itself.  

By default, these three fields are populated with values taken from the vendor/customer card.  

When the invoice is finished, it can be posted.  

### Example

When creating a purchase invoice for Jannet Carter, we enter **JANNET** in the **Buy-from Vendor No.** field. By default, the **Currency Code**, **Transaction Mode**, and **Bank Account** fields are populated with values taken from the Jannet Carter's vendor card. Therefore, the **Currency Code**, **Transaction Mode**, and **Bank Account** fields are **USD**, **ABN-USD**, and **JCBA** respectively. Nevertheless, these values can be changed.  

## Create proposal

Open the **Telebank - Bank Overview** page and browse to the bank through which we want to perform our payment. Open the **Proposal** page and generate payment proposals using the **Get Proposal Entries** batch job.  

### Example

Through the **Telebank - Bank Overview** page, we open the **Proposal** page for our bank, ABN-USD. Using the batch job, one proposal line is created for the purchase invoice we just created and posted for the vendor JANNET.  

## Create payment history

From the **Proposal** page we process our proposal into a payment history. The proposal disappears and can be found on the **Payment History Overview** page for the same bank.  

### Example

We process our proposal concerning the payment to the vendor JANNET and open the **Payment History Overview** page for our bank, ABN-USD. The last payment history is the one we created.  

## Export payment history

Open the **Payment History Overview** page, browse to the relevant payment history, and choose the **Export** action. The export batch job appears for the export protocol that is linked to this payment. For this export, the system already has entered appropriate filters. Check, if wanted, any of the fields on the **Options** FastTab, and then choose the **OK** button to export the payment. The system generates a text file using a filename as defined in the **Default File Names Field** field of the export protocol, which now is ready to be sent to our bank.  

### Example

As the transaction mode associated with our payment is ABN-USD, the **BBV** or **PAYMUL** batch job appear.  

## Import bank statement

After receiving electronic bank statements from our bank, we can import them by running the appropriate import protocol from the **Import Protocol List** page.  

### Example

Our bank sent us the bank statement containing our payment to Jannet Carter, ABN-USD. Therefore, we choose **OFFICE NET EXTRA** as the appropriate import protocol.

# Enter and post cash and bank/giro journals

The cash journal and the bank/giro journal help you post transactions into the system in an easier and more direct way than using the general journal.  

In conjunction with Telebanking, they allow you to import electronic bank statements into the **Bank/Giro Journal** page. The system can automatically reconcile these statements during the import process and determine whether a statement can be applied to open ledger entries for the relevant vendor/customer.

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], you can use the cash and bank journals to enter the transactions that affect the cash and bank accounts by using the **Cash Book** and **Bank Book** types.  

You can enter increases or decreases to the cash account on the **Cash Journal** page. For example, you can use this journal for paying out petty cash or receiving transfers from a different bank account.  

The **Bank/Giro Journal** page records the inflow or outflow of the cash to a specific bank account. This journal forms the basis for bank reconciliation. The layout of this journal resembles the paper bank statement, so you can transpose the required fields from the paper statement to the journal, or you can import an electronic bank statement file. The transactions can be customer payments or vendor payments.  

You can apply the payments from customers to the open invoices from accounts receivables. You can also enter general ledger transactions to capture miscellaneous amounts, such as bank charges or interest income. VAT codes can also be applied to these transaction lines. You can define a journal for every bank account.  

## Post cash journals  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Cash Journal**, and then choose the related link.

# Docket reports in the Dutch version

The Dutch telebanking application allows you to combine ledger entries for the same customer or vendor, having the same transaction mode, into one payment or collection order to the bank. As such one total amount is paid to or collected from the vendor or customer involved. Possibly this combined payment could lack all detail information about the individual payments or collections. Telebanking offers you the possibility to inform your vendor or customer in detail by generating a docket report that describes the individual payments that constitute the total amount paid or collected.  

When generating payment proposals using the **Get Proposal Entries** batch job the system selects the **Docket** checkbox on the proposal in case that:  

- The resulting combined payment includes too many invoice numbers to list them in the available four description fields of the new proposal line: **Description 1** field, **Description 2** field, **Description 3** field, and **Description 4** field.  
- The payment isn't based upon an invoice.

# CMR notes in the Dutch version

A CMR note is a bill of lading or an international consignment note defined under the 1956 United Nations Convention for the Contract of the International Carriage of Goods by Road. This is also known as the CMR Convention.  

Claims with complete CMR note information are easily processed.  

## CMR notes

Countries/Regions that follow the CMR Convention adhere to a standard form for CMR notes. The type of CMR notes used depends on the type of transaction. There are three types:  

- **CMR - Sales Shipment** – This report is used to print CMR documents for sales shipments. For each CMR document, the report shows address data for the sender, shipping agent, and consignee, along with data about the shipped items.

- **CMR - Purchase Return Shipment** – This report is used to print CMR documents for purchase return shipments. For each CMR document, the report shows address data for the sender, shipping agent, and consignee, along with data about the shipped items.

- **CMR - Transfer Shipment** – This report is used to print CMR documents for transfer shipments. For each CMR document, the report shows address data for the location from which the items are shipped, the location to which the items are shipped, and information regarding the shipping agent, along with data about the shipped items.

> [!NOTE]  
> CMR notes are formatted to print on preprinted CMR forms.  

The following details the standard life cycle of a CMR note:  

- The warehouse manager prints the CMR notes for the shipments that need to be sent.  
- The shipments are then packed and handed to the truck driver, along with the CMR notes.  
- The driver ensures that each shipment has a CMR note.  
- When goods are delivered to the customers, the driver ensures that the customers sign the CMR notes.  
- The signed CMR notes are then given to the respective internal Accounts Receivable departments.  
- The Accounts Payable administrators receive the signed CMR notes, along with the invoice for freight forwarding services from the freight forwarder.

# Payment scenario 1 - Domestic payments (LCY to LCY) in the Dutch version

You can use telebanking for trade with domestic and foreign customers and vendors. This article describes a scenario where the trade is with domestic customers and vendors.  

The following list describes the main steps:  

1. Create Vendor/Customer.  
1. Create Vendor/Customer Bank Account.  
1. Create and Post Purchase Invoice for Vendor or Sales Invoice for Customer.  
1. Create Proposal.  
1. Create Payment History.  
1. Export Payment History.  
1. Import Bank Statement.  

> [!NOTE]  
> In the following examples, some standard CRONUS data is being used. Likewise, instead of creating a vendor/customer and a vendor/customer bank account, you can use existing data.  

## Create vendor/customer

Create vendor/customer and enter all necessary information. Special attention should be paid to the following fields:  

- **Currency Code**: Leave empty - that is, it's set to the local currency (LCY).  
- **Transaction Mode**: Select an appropriate, default transaction mode - that is, one that can deal with local currency payments for your bank.  
- **Preferred Bank Account**: Select an appropriate, default vendor/customer bank account having the same Currency Code as the vendor/customer itself.  

> [!NOTE]  
> To enter a bank account in the **Bank Account** vendor/customer bank accounts must be available. See below.  

### Example

Olek Johansson (code **OLEK**) is one of our local vendors. Purchase invoices are paid through our national bank account (code **ABN**) to their bank account (code **OJBA**). Both bank account ABN and OJBA are denominated in local currency (LCY). Therefore, on Olek Johansson's vendor card, we leave the **Currency Code** field empty, fill the **Transaction Mode** field with **ABN** that is linked to our bank account, ABN, and set the **Bank Account** field to **OJBA**.  

## Create vendor/customer bank account

Create vendor/customer bank account and enter all necessary information. Special attention should be paid to the following fields:  

- **Preferred Bank Account**: Enter a valid bank account number.  
- **Currency Code**: Leave empty - that is, it's set to the local currency (LCY).  
- **Owner Information**: Be sure all owner information is entered.  

### Example

Olek Johansson's bank account (code **OJBA**) is denominated in local currency (LCY). Therefore, on Olek Johansson's vendor bank account card, we enter a valid number in the **Bank Account No.** field, leave the **Currency Code** field empty, and fill the fields on the **Owner Information** FastTab with appropriate values.  

## Create and post purchase invoice for vendor or sales invoice for customer

Create a purchase/sales invoice and enter all necessary information. Special attention should be paid to the following fields:  

- **Currency Code**: Leave empty - that is, it's set to the local currency (LCY).  
- **Transaction Mode**: Select an appropriate, default transaction mode - that is, one that can deal with local currency payments for your bank.  
- **Preferred Bank Account**: Select an appropriate, default vendor/customer bank account having the same Currency Code is the vendor/customer itself.  

By default these three fields are populated with values taken from the vendor/customer card.  

When the invoice is finished, it can be posted.  

### Example

When creating a purchase invoice for Olek Johansson, we enter **OLEK** in the **Buy-from Vendor No.** field. By default the **Currency Code**, **Transaction Mode** and **Bank Account** fields are populated with values taken from the Olek Johansson's vendor card. Therefore, the **Currency Code**, **Transaction Mode**, and **Bank Account** fields are **\<empty\>**, **ABN**, and **OJBA** respectively. Nevertheless, these values can be changed.  

## Create proposal

Open the **Telebank - Bank Overview** page and browse to the bank through which we want to perform our payment. Open the **Proposal** page and generate payment proposals using the **Get Proposal Entries** batch job.  

### Example

Through the **Telebank - Bank Overview** page, we open the **Proposal** page for our bank, ABN. Using the batch job, one proposal line is created for the purchase invoice we just created and posted for vendor OLEK.  

## Create payment history

From the **Proposal** page, we process our proposal into a payment history. The proposal disappears and can be found on the **Payment History Overview** page for the same bank.  

### Example

We process our proposal concerning the payment to vendor OLEK and open the **Payment History Overview** page for our bank, ABN. The last payment history is the one we created.  

## Export payment history

Open the **Payment History Overview** page, browse to the relevant payment history, and choose the **Export** action. The export batch job appears for the export protocol that is linked to this payment. For this export, the system already enters appropriate filters. Check, if wanted, any of the fields on the **Options** FastTab, and then choose the **OK** action to export the payment. The system generates a text file using a filename as defined in the **Default File Names Field** field of the export protocol, which now is ready to be sent to our bank.  

## Import bank statement

After receiving electronic bank statements from our bank, we can import them by running the appropriate import protocol from the **Import Protocol List** page.  

### Example

The bank statement containing our payment to Olek Johansson is sent to us by our bank, ABN. Therefore, we should choose **OFFICE NET EXTRA** as the appropriate import protocol.

# Telebanking

Based on both sales and purchase transactions, telebanking enables you to generate your payments and collections and interchange them with your bank electronically. This includes the export of payment and collection data that need to be forwarded to the bank and the import of bank statements sent to you by the bank.  

## Transactions

In general, all financial interactions with vendors and customers are done through either purchase or sales invoices and credit memos. As soon as these transactions are registered and posted, payments, or collections can be carried out by your company.  

## Proposals

Based on vendor and customer ledger entries, telebanking enables you to generate payment and collection proposals. This can be done for any bank that is set up for your company. Both domestic and foreign payments and collections are possible.  

You can set up [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] to combine payments to or collections from the same bank account automatically.  

When a proposal is agreed upon, it should be processed into a payment history.  

> [!NOTE]  
> In general, for any open vendor and customer ledger entries, a proposal can be generated if it meets a number of criteria. Learn more in [Create Proposals](how-to-create-proposals.md).  

## Payment histories

A payment history is nothing more than a proposal except for the fact that data on a payment history can't be modified. The payment or collection data is ready to be exported and forwarded to the bank. Learn more in [Create and Export Payment History](how-to-create-and-export-payment-history.md).  

## Bank statements

For all your financial interactions through your bank, the bank can send you electronic bank statements. These statements can be imported into the Bank/Giro Journals. If you want, you can have [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] automatically reconcile these statements during this import process and determine whether a statement can be applied to open ledger entries for the relevant vendor/customer. Learn more in [Import and Reconcile Bank Statements](how-to-import-and-reconcile-bank-statements.md).  

> [!NOTE]  
> The currency of the imported transactions must match the currency that is specified on the bank account in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)].  

## Exchange protocols

For both exporting and importing, a number of protocols are defined. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] supports the following protocols:  

- BTL91 (export). This cross-border protocol is no longer accepted in the Netherlands as of May 1, 2019. This protocol is replaced by the Generic Payment File protocol.
- BBV (export)  
- PAYMUL (export)  
- Generic Payment File (export). Can be used for cross-border Non-EUR transfers.
- Rabobank mut.asc (import)  
- Rabobank vvmut.asc (import)  
- Rabobank ASCII (import)  
- SEPA CAMT
