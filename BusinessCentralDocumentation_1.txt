# Manage Interactions for Segments
The **Segment** page is a type of worksheet where you can:

* Create segments.
* Save the segmentation criteria you have used to select contacts.
* Log the segment and record interactions involving the contacts within the segment.

## Segmenting
There are several ways to create segments:

* You can manually enter the contacts you want to include in the segment in the segment lines.
* You can select contacts.
* You can reuse a logged segment as the basis to create a new one.
* You can reuse saved segmentation criteria.

## Interactions
On the **Segment** page, you can create interactions for several contacts simultaneously. For example, you can merge a segment with a Microsoft Word document, so that you can send a letter to all the contacts in the segment.

You can specify information about the interaction for the segment on the **Segment** header. For example, you can decide which interaction template you want to use for all the contacts, specify a description, a correspondence type, and so on. However, you can modify this information in the segment line for each particular contact, for example, by specifying another description for one contact. If you are merging a segment with a Microsoft Word document, you can personalize the document to be sent for one or several of the contacts within the segment, for example, by adding individualized comments to the document.

## Logging
On the **Segment** page, when you choose **Log**, the application records the interactions on the **Interaction Log Entry** page, and logs the segment. After you have logged the segment, you can only find it on the **Logged Segments** page.

On the **Logged Segments** page, you can decide to create a follow-up segment containing the same contacts as the segment you have logged.

# Resources for help and support

[!INCLUDE[azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id](~/../shared-content/shared/azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id.md)]

Organizations that use [!INCLUDE[prod_long](includes/prod_long.md)] can get technical support for any issues that they might experience. In this article, we show you the following information and many other tips for how to use [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]:

- Learn how your AI-powered assistant [can guide and explain](#chat-with-copilot)
- Learn how to [get unblocked](#in-product-tips)  
- Learn where to [learn more](#help-pane)
- Learn how to find [the technical information](#help--support-page) you need to submit a support request

## Chat with Copilot

[!INCLUDE [online_only](includes/online_only.md)]

Chat with Copilot is an AI-powered tool that answers questions and finds business data related to Business Central. You can access it from any page by selecting the ![Shows the icon for chat with Copilot](media/chat-copilot-icon.png) **Copilot** icon in the upper-right corner. [Learn more about chat with Copilot](chat-with-copilot.md).

### Help with fields

Copilot can help you understand the purpose and typical use of individual fields. When you choose **Ask Copilot** in a tooltip for a field, chat opens with an Explain prompt for the field name and Copilot provides information about it. Copilot links to the articles it referenced, so you can verify the description.

## In-product tips

[!INCLUDE [ua-get-help](includes/ua-get-help.md)] These links can also access content from other websites, such as the websites of providers of any apps that are part of your [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

## Help pane

[!INCLUDE [2022_releasewave1](includes/2022_releasewave1.md)]

In [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the Help menu item (the question mark in the top-right corner) gives you access to a Help pane that can help you find answers to your questions. The Help pane has different content, depending on how you access it. The following list describes the cards that are always, or nearly always, present:  

[!INCLUDE [ua-help-pane-links-default](includes/ua-help-pane-links-default.md)]

The following list describes how you can access the Help pane and whether cards are added to it:

- Choose the Help menu item (the question mark in the top-right corner)
- Use the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>F1</kbd> keyboard shortcut from anywhere in Business Central.
- Choose the *Learn more* link on a tooltip for a field, if available. The *Learn more* link is only available in the mobile app or on custom fields (that is, fields from non-Mocrosoft extensions) in the web client.

> [!TIP]
> When you choose a link, the target article opens in a new browser tab. You can choose to un-dock the browser tab, then, so that you can view the relevant information side-by-side with [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The pane remains open while you navigate through [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] so that content you searched for remains visible.  

## Search in the Help pane

[!INCLUDE [2021_releasewave2](includes/2021_releasewave2.md)]

Use the search field at the top of the Help pane to search for guidance about how to use the product, built-in capabilities, and available training modules. Depending on your search terms, the pane shows five or more links with a short description. Choose a link, or refine your search terms. When you choose a link, the target article opens in a new browser tab. You can choose to undock the browser tab so that you can view the relevant information side-by-side with [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The pane remains open while you navigate through [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] so that content you searched for remains visible.  

> [!NOTE]
> In the current version of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the search field in the Help pane only applies to content that is published to the [Dynamics 365 Business Central documentation](/dynamics365/business-central) on Microsoft Learn.

## Help & Support page

From the Help pane, you can access the **Help & Support** page inside [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] that includes helpful links. You can also see how you can contact technical support for your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

This section outlines the resources available to you in the different sections of the **Help and Support** page as outlined in the following list:

- [Find answers](#find-answers)  
- [Help](#product-help)  
- [Community](#community)  
- [Blog](#blog)  
- [Capabilities coming soon](#capabilities-coming-soon)  
- [Do more with your trial](#do-more-with-your-trial)  
- [Give feedback](#give-feedback)  
- [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)  
- [Report a problem](#report-a-problem)  
- [Support contacts](#support-contacts)  

> [!TIP]
> [!INCLUDE [ua-get-help](includes/ua-get-help.md)]

### Find answers

The **Find it** section provides links to the most common places to find answers to your questions. The links fall into four categories and are explained in the following subsections. Your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] partner can configure some of the links, and as a result the behavior can be slightly different.  

#### Product Help

The **Find it** section includes two links to product Help:

- Help about the page you were just viewing in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]  

  This link is automatically generated. If [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can't find the relevant link, the [landing page on Microsoft Learn](index.yml) for the default version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is shown. For example, if the page was part of an app that didn't add context-sensitive Help mapping to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the *Learn link* defaults to the landing page.  
  
- Help landing page for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]  

  The functionality in the default version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is described in the [Dynamics 365 Business Central documentation](/dynamics365/business-central) Learn more in the [Learn more using the product documentation](#learn-more-using-the-product-documentation) section. You can also extend and customize [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with apps from AppSource. All apps provide links to the relevant product Help so that you can always find guidance for the different workflows in your version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

#### Community

In the [Business Central community forum](https://community.dynamics.com/forums/thread/?groupid=e78817ab-a926-4d31-96cc-aef040a4eb04), you can submit a question and learn from other [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] community members. Partners and Microsoft employees participate in the conversations.  

If you don't yet have a partner, the Community can also help you get unblocked if you have questions. For example, if you just signed up for a trial, the Community can be a great starting point.  

#### Blog

We talk about new capabilities on [the Dynamics 365 Blog](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics-365/blog/business-leader/product/dynamics-365-business-central/), including any special considerations.  

#### Capabilities coming soon

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is updated with major feature updates every six months, and with monthly service updates. Choose the link to view the latest release plan. You can also get an overview of upcoming and recently released capabilities in [the release plans across Dynamics 365](/dynamics365/release-plans/).  

For the longer term overview, the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] [roadmap page](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/roadmap/business-central/) shows the general priorities for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in the coming years.  

### Do more with your trial

This section gives you shortcuts to the Microsoft commercial marketplace where you can find solutions and services from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] partners. Use the links to explore the full capabilities of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] before you decide if you want to buy a subscription. You can also find a link to contact the sales team.

> [!NOTE]
> This section is only available in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online trial experiences. If you already bought [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the section isn't longer visible.

### Give feedback

Periodically, the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] team gathers feedback from our users about how satisfied they are with the product. In addition to ratings, you can also provide a written comment. By giving us specific and actionable comments, you help our engineering teams to prioritize the product improvements we invest in. You can also consent to be contacted about your comment. If you do, you're invited to a Teams meeting at a time that's convenient for you. You can provide product suggestions at any time on our [Dynamics 365 Ideas](https://aka.ms/bcideas) website.  

### Product suggestions

On the [Dynamics 365 Ideas site](https://aka.ms/bcideas) website, you can provide suggestions for new features and capabilities. Your input goes directly into Business Central's engineering backlog for investigation and prioritization.  

Make sure that you search through the list of submitted suggestions. There's a chance that someone already submitted something similar, and that entry might have already received votes. Vote if an idea already has been submitted to get it prioritized on the engineering backlog.  

### Troubleshooting

The **Troubleshooting** section shows technical information that your administrator or [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] partner can use to unblock users. The section includes information about the latest error message, the current version of your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], and a link to go to the **Page Inspection** page. Learn more in [Inspecting Pages in Business Central](across-inspect-page.md).  

To help you or your supporting partner troubleshoot, you can switch on additional logging in the **Report a Problem** section. You can then analyze the extra telemetry in the admin center or Application Insights, for example.  

As the internal administrator, you have access to the admin center where you can continue the troubleshooting. You can view telemetry, manage environments, and manage user sessions. The following articles in the administration content provide more information:

- [Finding technical information](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/manage-technical-support#finding-technical-information)  
- [Managing environments](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/tenant-admin-center-environments)  
- [Monitoring and analyzing telemetry](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/telemetry-overview)  
- [Enable sending telemetry to Application Insights](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/telemetry-enable-application-insights)  

### Report a problem

Your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] reselling partner helps you with technical support. This section makes it easy for you to contact your reselling partner, if they submit their support contact details. If your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] partner then can't resolve the problem, they raise a support ticket with Microsoft.  

Learn more in [Escalating support issues to Microsoft](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/manage-technical-support#escalating-support-issues-to-microsoft) in the administration content.  

> [!NOTE]
> With [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, the **Report a Problem** section is only available if you have paid for a [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] subscription. If you have signed up for a trial and have not yet purchased [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you don't have a reselling partner, and you can't contact the Microsoft support team. You can find a [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] partner on the [I'm looking for a solution provider](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2038145) page. Learn more in [How do I find a reselling partner?](/dynamics365/business-central/across-faq#how-do-i-find-a-reselling-partner).  
>
> With [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, this section is only available in 2020 release wave 2 (version 18) and later.

### Support contacts

The **Report a problem** section displays an email address or a hyperlink for you to get in contact with the customer support person or team, like: Do you need technical support? Contact support at `someone@example.com` or `https://www.contoso.com`. 

> [!NOTE]
> If support contact details aren't present, it means that your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] reselling partner hasn't provided the information. As a reslling partner, you set up the preferred support contact details in the admin center. Learn more in [Configuring the support experience](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/technical-support#configuring-the-support-experience) in the administration content.  

To alert your partner to a problem, choose the link to either send an email or open their support site in a new browser tab. You can then add the technical information about your Microsoft Entra tenant from the **Troubleshooting** section and any other information that you find relevant.  

> [!NOTE]
> The support contacts information isn't available with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises.

## Learn more using the product documentation

A large community of partners extend and customize the base version of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Each partner and many customers deploy their own Help to their own website. But you can always go to the [Dynamics 365 Business Central documentation](index.yml) site to learn more. The site hosts different types of content, such as the following content:

- [Conceptual content about business functionality](welcome.md)  
- [Documentation for developers](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-dev-overview)  
- [Free learning paths and e-learning modules across multiple user profiles](/training/dynamics365/business-central?WT.mc_id=dyn365bc_landingpage-docs)  

In this section, you can learn about how to navigate the business functionality content.  

[!INCLUDE [ua-get-help](includes/ua-get-help.md)]

### Content on the site

[This section](welcome.md) of Microsoft Learn hosts content from Microsoft that represents the *Learn more* pillar in the user assistance model. In part, the *Learn more* content intends to answer those questions that the user interface can't answer, such as the following list:

- Where does this page fits into the bigger workflow?  
- What comes next?  
- What would be the alternative?  

From inside the product, you can access this content either through the *Learn more* link in tooltips and teaching tips, or by using the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>F1</kbd> keyboard shortcut.  

The navigation panel shows the table of contents that groups articles by business area. For example, you read the article [Purchase Items for a Sale](purchasing-how-purchase-products-sale.md), and then the table of contents shows you that there's also an article called [Correct or Cancel Unpaid Purchase Invoices](purchasing-how-correct-cancel-unpaid-purchase-invoices.md). Both articles are in the group called *Purchasing*, which bundles articles that are related to the Purchasing module in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

The table of contents includes a group of content that describes [local functionality](about-localization.md) for the countries/regions that Microsoft supports. If you don’t see your country/region listed there, it’s probably because a partner localizes your country/region. Learn more at [Country/regional availability and supported languages](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/compliance/apptest-countries-and-translations).  

The local functionality content describes the capabilities in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] that can help you be compliant in the supported markets, such as tax statements and other reports. In some cases, the difference between the default version and the specific country/region version is invisible to users. In other cases, users must set up reporting or electronic invoicing in a specific way. If you can't find a description of a certain button or action in the general section, you can hopefully find it in the *Local Functionality* section.  

> [!TIP]
> On the learn.microsoft.com site as well as in the in-product search field and in the Help pane, the search results show some context for the target article. The context includes the link that might show the name of a country, or a short description that calls out a certain capability or a country/region, for example.

### Find other content

If you land on an article that doesn't answer your question, you can find other content in two ways on Microsoft Learn:

- Use the **Filter by title** field in the table of contents on the left side of the website

  This way, you can filter by words used in the titles of the various articles. For example, type *invoice*, and then choose one of the offered links, such as [Set Up Invoice Rounding](finance-set-up-invoice-rounding.md) or [Create Prepayment Invoices](finance-how-to-create-prepayment-invoices.md).  

  Underneath each link, you can see where that article is in the table of contents. That way, you can easily see if the article is in the Purchasing section or in the section for Australian local functionality, for example.  
- Use the **Search** field in the top-right corner of the website

  This way, you can search for any term. The site then searches all the content for that term or expression. Search for *invoice* again, and scroll through the list of hundreds of articles in the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] content that uses that word somewhere in the text.  

### Languages

Content about business functionality is published in several languages. When you land on Microsoft Learn from inside the product, you see the content in the same language as you specified in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], unless that language isn't available on Microsoft Learn.  

You can change the language by changing the URL, or you can use the language toggle in the bottom-left corner of the website.  

The content is authored in English and published to URLs with *en-us* as the language code. When new information is published in English, it's then sent off for translation into the supported languages. In some cases, you can't read this new content in your own language for up to four weeks, but in most cases it only takes a week or two. You can always view the latest information by switching the language to *en-us*.  

For each language, the table of contents is translated, but the content in the *Local Functionality* section is in English except for the country or region that corresponds to the current language. For example, in the Danish version of Microsoft Learn (`https://learn.microsoft.com/da-dk/dynamics365/business-central/`), you can see the entries for Australian local functionality in Danish in the table of contents, but the articles are in English. Only the articles for Danish local functionality are translated into Danish.  

### Recommended content

On Microsoft Learn, each article shows a pane with links to other articles. The **Recommended content** section is automatically generated based on how each article is used with the rest of the site. The links aren't static and change over time.

### Tell us what you think

With Microsoft Learn, each article has two buttons at the end of the article. The **This product** button sends you to the Ideas site, and the **This page** button lets you submit feedback about the content through GitHub. In both cases, you must create an account if you don't already have one. For *product feedback*, you must sign in with your work or organizational email account. For *access to GitHub*, you can use any email address when you create an account.  

We welcome your contributions, both as pull requests with suggestions or corrections to the content, and as GitHub Issues with bugs or questions. But be mindful that feedback and contributions to the *dynamics365smb-docs* repo is about the content, not about the product.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Microsoft accepts pull requests to the *dynamics365smb-docs* repo only, not the language-specific repos. If you have feedback about translations, you can report a GitHub issue in the relevant repo.  

### Navigate to other parts of the site

Microsoft Learn hosts content for other products and other types of content. Use the links at the top of the site to navigate to [Microsoft training](/training/dynamics365/business-central?WT.mc_id=dyn365bc_landingpage-docs) site or to the [Dynamics 365 release plans](/dynamics365/release-plans/), for example. You can also find a link to the
[Dynamics 365 Community](https://community.dynamics.com/) site, for example.  

## Apps and other solutions

If your [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes functionality that isn't provided by Microsoft, then the provider of that functionality also provides *Learn more* content on their own website. You can access this content in the same way as in the default version of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], such as by using the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>F1</kbd> keyboard shortcut.  

The same applies if you use [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises.

# Work with responsibility centers

Responsibility centers provide the ability to handle administrative centers. A responsibility center can be a cost center, a profit center, an investment center, or other company-defined administrative center. Examples of responsibility centers are a sales office, a purchasing department for several locations, and a plant planning office. For example, companies can set up user-specific views of sales and purchase documents related to a particular responsibility center.  

Using multiple locations together with responsibility centers provides the ability to manage business operations in flexible, optimal ways.

Multiple locations allow companies to manage their inventory in multiple locations using one database. Two concepts, locations and stockkeeping units, are the cornerstones of this granule. A location is defined as a place that handles physical placement and quantities of items. The concept is broad enough to include locations such as plants or production facilities and distribution centers, warehouses, showrooms, and service vehicles. A stockkeeping unit is defined as an item at a specific location and/or as a variant. Using stockkeeping units, companies with multiple locations can add replenishment information, addresses, and some financial posting information at the location level. As a result, they can replenish variants of the same item for each location and order items based on location-specific replenishment information.  

## To set up a responsibility center

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Responsibility Centers**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  

    If you're using responsibility centers to administer your company, it can be useful to have a default responsibility center.
4. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Company Information**, and then choose the related link.
5. On the **Shipping** FastTab, in the **Responsibility Center** field, enter a responsibility center code.

This code is used on all purchase, sales, or service documents, if the user, customer, or vendor has no default responsibility center. On sales, purchase, or service documents, you can enter another responsibility center than the default.

> [!NOTE]  
> When you enter a responsibility center code on a document, it affects the address, dimensions, and prices on the document.  

## To assign responsibility centers to users

You can set up users so that [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] retrieves only the documents relevant for their particular work areas. Users are associated with one responsibility center and work only with documents related to specific application areas at that particular center.  

To set this up, you assign responsibility centers to users in three functional areas: Purchases, Sales, and Service Management.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **User Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **User Setup** page, select the user you want to assign a responsibility center to. If the user not is on the list, you must enter a user ID in the **User ID** field.  
3. In the **Sales Resp. Ctr. Filter** field, enter the responsibility center where the user will have tasks related to sales.  
4. In the **Purchase Resp. Ctr. Filter** field, enter the responsibility center where the user will have tasks related to purchasing.  
5. In the **Service Resp. Ctr. Filter** field, enter the responsibility center where the user will have tasks related to service management.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Users can view only those posted documents that related to their own responsibility center. However, they can view all ledger entries and navigate to other posted documents from the ledger entries.

# Walkthrough: Receiving and Putting Away in Basic Warehouse Configurations

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you receive items and put them away using one of four methods, as described in the following table.

|Method|Inbound Process|Require Receipts|Require Put-aways|Complexity Level (Learn more at [Warehouse Management Overview](design-details-warehouse-management.md))|  
|------------|---------------------|--------------|----------------|------------|  
|A|Post receipt and put-away from the order line|||No dedicated warehouse activity.|  
|B|Post receipt and put-away from an inventory put-away document||Turned on|Basic: Order-by-order.|  
|C|Post receipt and put-away from a warehouse receipt document|Turned on||Basic: Consolidated receive/ship posting for multiple orders.|  
|D|Post receipt from a warehouse receipt document and post put-away from a warehouse put-away document|Turned on|Turned on|Advanced|  

Learn more at [Inbound Warehouse Flow](design-details-inbound-warehouse-flow.md).

The following walkthrough demonstrates method B in the previous table.  

## About this walkthrough  

In basic warehouse configurations where your location is set up to require put-away processing but not receive processing, use the **Inventory Put-away** page to record and post put-away and receipt information for your inbound source documents. The following documents are inbound source documents:

* Purchase order
* Sales return order
* Inbound transfer order
* Production order with output that's ready to be put away

> [!NOTE]
> Even though the settings are called **Require Pick** and **Require Put-away**, you can still post receipts and shipments directly from the source business documents at locations where you select these checkboxes.  

This walkthrough demonstrates the following tasks:  

* Set up SILVER location for inventory put aways.  
* Set up SILVER location for bin handling.  
* Define a default bin for item LS-81. (LS-75 is already set up in CRONUS.)  
* Create a purchase order for vendor 10000 for 40 loudspeakers.  
* Verify that the put-away bins are preset by setup.  
* Release the purchase order for warehouse handling.  
* Create an inventory put-away based on a released source document.  
* Verify that the put-away bins are inherited from the purchase order.  
* Register the warehouse movement into the warehouse and post the purchase receipt for the source purchase order.  

> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE [locations-cronus](includes/locations-cronus.md)]

## Roles  

The following user roles perform the tasks that this walkthrough demonstrates:  

* Warehouse Manager  
* Purchasing Agent  
* Warehouse Worker  

## Prerequisites  

To complete this walkthrough, you'll need:  

* CRONUS International Ltd. data  
* To be a warehouse employee at SILVER location. To set yourself up, follow these steps:  

    1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Warehouse Employees**, and then choose the related link.  
    2. Choose the **User ID** field, and select your user account on the **Users** page.  
    3. In the **Location Code** field, choose **SILVER**.  
    4. Select the **Default** checkbox.  

## Story  

Ellen, the warehouse manager at CRONUS International Ltd., creates a purchase order for 10 units of item LS-75 and 30 units of item LS-81 from vendor 10000 to be delivered to SILVER Warehouse. When the delivery arrives at the warehouse, John, the warehouse worker, puts the items away in the default bins defined for the items. When John posts the put-away, the items are posted as received into inventory and available for sale or other demand.  

## Setting up the location  

Settings on the **Location Card** page define the company's warehouse flows.  

### To set up the location  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Locations**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the SILVER location card.  
3. Turn on the **Require Put-away** toggle.  

    Set up a default bin for the two item numbers to control where they're put away.  

4. Choose the **Bins** action.  
5. Select the first row, for bin **S-01-0001**, and then choose the **Contents** action.  

    Notice on the **Bin Content** page that item **LS-75** is already set up as content in bin S-01-0001.  

6. Choose the **New** action.  
7. Select the **Fixed** and the **Default** fields.  
8. In the **Item No.** field, enter **LS-81**.  

## Create the purchase order  

Purchase orders are the most common type of inbound source document.  

### To create the purchase order  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. Create a purchase order for vendor 10000 on the work date (January 23) with the following purchase order lines.  

    |Item|Location code|Bin code|Quantity|  
    |----------|-------------------|--------------|--------------|  
    |LS_75|SILVER|S-01-0001|10|  
    |LS-81|SILVER|S-01-0001|30|  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > The bin code is entered automatically according to the setup you created in the [Setting up the location](#setting-up-the-location) section.  

    Next, notify the warehouse that the purchase order is ready for warehouse handling when the delivery arrives.  

4. Choose the **Release** action.  

    The delivery of loudspeakers from vendor 10000 has arrived at SILVER warehouse, and John proceeds to put them away.  

## Receive and put the items away  

Use the **Inventory Put-away** page to manage all inbound warehouse activities for a specific source document, such as a purchase order.  

### To receive and put the items away  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Inventory Put-aways**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. Select the **Source Document** field, and then select **Purchase Order**.  
4. Select the **Source No.** field, select the line for the purchase from vendor 10000, and then choose the **OK** button.  

    Alternatively, choose the **Get Source Document** action, and then select the purchase order.  

5. Choose the **Autofill Qty. to Handle** action.  

    Alternatively, in the **Qty. to Handle** field, enter 10 and 30 respectively on the two inventory put-away lines.  

6. Choose the **Post** action, select the **Receive** action, and then choose the **OK** button.  

    The 40 loudspeakers are now registered as put away in bin S-01-0001, and a positive item ledger entry is created reflecting the posted purchase receipt.

# Design details: planning parameters

This article describes the planning parameters that you can use in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

How the planning system controls item supply is determined by various settings on the **Item Card**, **SKU**, and **Manufacturing Setup** pages. The following table explains how planning uses these settings.  

|Purpose|Settings|
|-------------|---------------|
|Define whether the item is planned|Reordering Policy = Blank|
|Define when to reorder|Time Bucket<br /><br /> Reorder Point<br /><br /> Safety Lead Time|
|Define how much to reorder|Safety Stock Quantity<br /><br /> Reordering Policy:<br /><br /> - Fixed Reorder Qty. plus Reorder Quantity<br />-   Maximum Qty. plus Maximum Inventory<br />- Order<br />- Lot-for-Lot|
|Optimize when and how much to reorder|Rescheduling Period<br /><br /> Lot Accumulation Period<br /><br /> Dampener Period|
|Modify the supply orders|Minimum Order Quantity<br /><br /> Maximum Order Quantity<br /><br /> Order Multiple|
|Delimit the planned item|Manufacturing Policy:<br /><br /> - Make-to-Stock<br />- Make-to-Order|

## Define whether the item is planned  

To include an item or SKU in the planning process, you must assign it a reordering policy. Otherwise, it must be planned manually, for example, by using the **Order Planning** page.  

## Define when to reorder  

Reorder proposals are typically released only when the projected available quantity is equal to or below a given quantity. The reorder point defines the quantity. Otherwise, it's zero. Zero can be adjusted by entering a safety stock quantity. If you define a safety lead time, the proposal is delivered in the period before the required due date.  

The **Time Bucket** field is used by reorder point policies (**Fixed Reorder Qty.** and **Maximum Qty.**). The inventory level is checked after each time bucket. The first time bucket begins on the planning start date.  

> [!NOTE]  
> When planning calculates time buckets, it ignores working calendars that are defined in the **Base Calendar Code** field on the **Company Information** and **Location Card** pages.  

On the **Manufacturing Setup** page, you should set the default safety lead time to at least one day. The due date of the demand might be known, but not the due time. The planning schedules backward to meet gross demand. If you don't define a safety lead time, the goods might arrive too late to meet the demand.  

The **Rescheduling Period**, **Lot Accumulation Period**, and **Dampener Period** fields also play a role in defining when to reorder. To learn more, go to [Optimize When and How Much to Reorder](design-details-planning-parameters.md#optimize-when-and-how-much-to-reorder).  

## Define how much to reorder

If the planning system detects the need to reorder, the reordering policy determines when, and how much, to order.  

Independent of the reordering policy, the planning system usually follows this logic:  

1. Calculate the quantity of the order proposal to meet the minimum inventory level of the item, usually the safety stock quantity. If nothing is specified, the minimum inventory level is zero.  
2. If the projected available inventory is below the safety stock quantity, a backward-scheduled supply order is suggested. The order quantity refills the safety stock quantity. Gross demand can increase it within the time bucket according to the reordering policy and the order modifiers.  
3. If the projected inventory is on or below the reorder point (calculated from aggregated changes within the time bucket) and above the safety stock quantity, a forward-scheduled exception order is suggested. Both the gross demand to be met and the reordering policy determine the order quantity. At a minimum, the order quantity meets the reorder point.  
4. If more gross demand is due before the ending date of the forward-scheduled order proposal, and this demand brings the currently projected available inventory below the safety stock quantity, the order quantity is increased to make up the deficit. The suggested supply order is then scheduled backward from the due date of the gross demand that exceeded the safety stock quantity.  
5. If the **Time Bucket** field isn't filled in, only the gross demand on the same due date is added.  

### Reordering policies  

The reordering policies in the following table affect the reorder quantity. To learn more about reordering policies, go to [Design Details: Handling Reordering Policies](design-details-handling-reordering-policies.md).  

|Reordering policy|Description|  
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------|  
|**Fixed Reorder Qty.**|At a minimum, the order quantity is equal to the reorder quantity. You can increase the quantity to meet the demand or the desired inventory level. This reordering policy is often used with a reorder point.|  
|**Maximum Qty.**|The order quantity is calculated to meet the maximum inventory. If quantity modifiers are used, then maximum inventory can be violated. We don't recommend that you use the time bucket together with maximum quantity. The time bucket is often overruled. This reordering policy is often used with a reorder point.|  
|**Order**|The order quantity is calculated to meet each single demand event, and the demand-supply set remains linked until execution. No planning parameters are considered.|  
|**Lot-for-Lot**|The quantity is calculated to meet the sum of the demand that becomes due in the time bucket.|  

## Optimize when and how much to reorder  

A planner can fine-tune planning parameters to limit rescheduling suggestions, accumulate demand (dynamic reorder quantity), or to avoid insignificant planning actions. The following fields help optimize when and how much to reorder.  

|Field|Description|  
|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
|**Rescheduling Period**|This field determines whether the action message should reschedule an existing order or cancel it and create a new order. The existing order will be rescheduled within one rescheduling period before the current supply and until one rescheduling period after the current supply.<br><br>**Note:** This parameter only works with the **Lot-for-Lot** reordering policy.|  
|**Lot Accumulation Period**|With the reordering policy Lot-for-Lot, this field is used to accumulate multiple supply needs into one supply order. From the first planned supply, the system accumulates all supply needs in the following lot accumulation period into one supply, which is placed on the date of the first supply. Demand outside the lot accumulation period isn't covered by this supply.|  
|**Dampener Period**|This field is used to avoid minor rescheduling of existing supply out in time. Changes from the supply date until one dampener period from the supply date don't generate action messages.<br /><br /> The dampener period specifies a period of time during which you don't want the planning system to propose to reschedule existing supply orders forward. This setting limits the number of insignificant rescheduling of existing supply to a later date if the rescheduled date is within the dampener period.<br /><br /> As a result, a positive delta between the suggested new supply date and the original supply date is always larger than the dampener period.|  

> [!NOTE]
> With the reordering policy Lot-for-Lot, the value of the **Lot Accumulation Period** field must be equal to or larger than the value of the **Dampener Period** field. Otherwise, the dampener period is reduced during the planning routine to match the lot accumulation period.  

The timing of rescheduling period, dampener period, and lot accumulation period is based on a supply date. The time bucket is based on the planning start date, as shown in the following illustration.  

:::image type="content" source="media/supply_planning_5_time_bucket_elements.png" alt-text="Time bucket elements.":::

In the following examples, the black arrows represent existing supply (up) and demand (down). Red, green, and orange arrows are planning suggestions.  

**Example 1**: The changed date is outside the rescheduling period, which causes the existing supply to be canceled. A new supply is suggested to cover the demand in the lot accumulation period.  

:::image type="content" source="media/supply_planning_5_recheduling_period_lot_accumulation_period.png" alt-text="Rescheduling and lot accumulation periods.":::

**Example 2**: The changed date is in the rescheduling period, which causes the existing supply to be rescheduled. A new supply is suggested to cover the demand outside the lot accumulation period.  

:::image type="content" source="media/supply_planning_5_recheduling_period_lot_accum_period_reschedule.png" alt-text="Rescheduling period, lot accumulation period, and reschedule.":::

**Example 3**: There's a demand in the dampener period and the supply quantity in the lot accumulation period matches the supply quantity. The next demand is uncovered and a new supply is suggested.  

:::image type="content" source="media/supply_planning_5_dampener_period_lot_accumulation_period.png" alt-text="Dampener period and lot accumulation period.":::

**Example 4**: There's a demand in the dampener period and the supply remains on the same date. However, the current supply quantity doesn't cover the demand in the lot accumulation period. A change quantity action for the existing supply order is suggested.  

:::image type="content" source="media/supply_planning_5_dampener_period_lot_accum_period_change_qty.png" alt-text="Dampener period, lot accumulation period, and change quantity.":::

**Default values:** The default value of the **Time Bucket** field and the three reorder period fields is blank. For all fields, except the **Dampener Period** field, this means 0D (zero days). If the **Dampener Period** field is blank, the global value in the **Default Dampener Period** field on the **Manufacturing Setup** page is used.  

## Modify the supply orders  

When the quantity of the order proposal is calculated, one or more of the order modifiers can adjust it. For example, the maximum order quantity is larger than or equal to the minimum order quantity, which is larger than or equal to the order multiple.  

The quantity is decreased if it exceeds the maximum order quantity. Then, it increases if it's below the minimum order quantity. Finally, it rounds up so that it matches a specified order multiple. Any remaining quantity uses the same adjustments until the total demand is converted to order proposals.  

## Delimit the item  

The **Manufacturing Policy** field on the **Item Card** page defines which other orders the MRP calculation proposes.  

If the **Make-to-Stock** option is used, the orders concern only the item.  

If the **Make-to-Order** option is used, the planning system analyzes the production BOM of the item and creates linked order proposals for those lower-level items that are also defined as make-to-order. This pattern continues as long as there are make-to-order items in the descending BOM structures.

## Use low-level codes to manage derived demand

Use low-level codes to make derived demand for components progress through to the lower levels of the BOM. To learn more about low-level codes, go to [Item Priority / Low-Level Code](design-details-central-concepts-of-the-planning-system.md#item-priority--low-level-code).

You can assign a low-level code to each part in the product structure or the indented BOM. The top final assembly level is denoted as level 0 - the end item. The higher the low-level code number, the lower the item is in the hierarchy. For example, end items have low-level code 0, and the item parts that go into the assembly of the end item have low-level codes 1, 2, 3, and so on. The result is the planning of component parts coordinated with the requirements of all higher-level part numbers. When you calculate a plan, the BOM is exploded in the planning worksheet, and the gross requirements for level 0 are passed down the planning levels as gross requirements for the next planning level.

On the **Manufacturing Setup** page, use the **Dynamic Low-Level Code** toggle to specify whether to immediately assign and calculate low-level codes for each component in the product structure. If you have large amounts of data, this function can have negative effects on the program's performance, for example during automatic cost adjustment. This function isn't retroactive, so it's a good idea to consider the use of this feature beforehand.

As an alternative to the automatic calculation that occurs dynamically if the field is selected, you can run the **Calculate Low-Level Code** batch job from the **Manufacturing** menu by clicking **Product Design**, **Calculate Low-Level Code**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you don't turn on the **Dynamic Low-Level Code** toggle, you must run the **Calculate Low-Level Code** batch job before you calculate a supply plan (the **Calculate Plan** batch job).  

> [!NOTE]
> Although you turn on the **Dynamic Low-Level Code** field selected, the low-level codes of component items aren't changed dynamically if a parent BOM is deleted or set to noncertified. This case might make it difficult to add new items to the end of the product structure because it might exceed the maximum number of low-level codes. Therefore, for large product structures that reach the low-level code limit, you can run the **Calculate Low Level Code** batch job frequently to maintain the structure.

# Design Details: Item Tracking and Reservations

Simultaneous use of reservation and specific item tracking is uncommon, because they both create a coupling between supply and demand. Except for situations where a customer or production planner requests a specific lot, it rarely makes sense to reserve inventory items that already carry item tracking numbers for specific application. Although it is possible to reserve items that require specific item tracking, special functionality is needed to avoid availability conflicts between order processors that request the same item-tracked items.  
  
The concept of Late Binding ensures that a nonspecific reservation of a serial number or a lot number remains loosely coupled until posting. At posting time, the reservation system can reshuffle nonspecific reservations to ensure that fixed application is possible against the serial or lot number that is actually picked. Meanwhile, the serial or lot number is made available for specific reservation in other documents that request that particular serial or lot number.  
  
A nonspecific reservation is one in which the user does not care which specific item is picked, and a specific reservation is one in which the user does care.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
> The Late Binding functionality relates only to items that are set up with specific item tracking, and it applies only to reservations against inventory, not against inbound supply orders.  
  
Reservation of item tracking numbers falls into two categories, as shown in the following table.  
  
|Reservation|Description|  
|-----------------|---------------------------------------|  
|Specific|You select a specific serial or lot number when you reserve the inventory item from a demand, such as a sales order.<br /><br /> This is a regular reservation. It is a rigid link between supply and demand that both carry serial or lot numbers. **Note:**  The demand carries serial or lot numbers. <br /><br /> For example, you want to reserve a can of blue paint from Lot A, because the customer requests it. A can of blue paint from Lot A is shipped to the customer.|  
|Nonspecific|You do not select a specific serial or lot number when you reserve the inventory item from a demand, such as a sales order.<br /><br /> This is a state that is imposed on a reservation entry for serial or lot numbers that are not selected specifically. **Note:**  The demand does not carry serial or lot numbers. <br /><br /> For example, you want to reserve a can of blue paint from any lot for your sales order. A can of blue paint from a random serial or lot number is shipped to the customer.|  
  
The main difference between specific and nonspecific reservation is defined by the existence of serial or lot numbers on the demand side, as shown in the following table.  

| Type            | Supply                | Demand                   |
|-----------------|-----------------------|--------------------------|
| **Specific**    | Serial or lot number. | Serial or lot number.    |
| **Nonspecific** | Serial or lot number. | No serial or lot number. |
  
When you reserve inventory quantities from an outbound document line for an item that has item tracking numbers assigned and is set up for specific item tracking, the **Reservation** page leads you through different workflows depending on your need for the serial or lot numbers.  
  
## Specific Reservation  
When you choose **Reserve** from the outbound document line, a dialog box appears that asks you if you want to reserve specific serial or lot numbers. If you choose **Yes**, then a list is displayed with all the serial or lot numbers that are assigned to the document line. The **Reservation** page opens after you select one of the serial or lot numbers, and you can then reserve among the selected serial or lot numbers in a typical fashion.  
  
If some of the specific item tracking numbers that you are trying to reserve are held in nonspecific reservations, then a message at the bottom of the **Reservation** page informs you how many of the total reserved quantity are held in nonspecific reservations and whether they are still available.  
  
## Nonspecific Reservation  
If you choose **No** in the dialog box that appears, the **Reservation** page opens and allows you to reserve among all serial or lot numbers in inventory.  
  
Because of the structure of the reservation system, when you place a nonspecific reservation on an item-tracked item, the system must select specific item ledger entries to reserve against. Because the item ledger entries carry the item tracking numbers, the reservation indirectly reserves specific serial or lot numbers, even though you did not intend to. To handle this situation, the reservation system tries to reshuffle nonspecific reservation entries before posting.  
  
The system actually still reserves against specific entries, but then it uses a reshuffling mechanism whenever there is specific demand for the lot or serial number in the nonspecific reservation. This can be the case when you post a demand transaction, such as a sales order, consumption journal, or transfer order, for the serial or lot number, or when you try to specifically reserve the serial or lot number. The system reshuffles the reservations to make the lot or serial number available to the demand or to the specific reservation, thereby placing a different lot or serial number in the nonspecific reservation. If there is insufficient quantity in inventory, the system reshuffles as much as possible, and you receive an availability error if there is still insufficient quantity at the time of posting.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  On a nonspecific reservation the lot number or serial number field is blank in the reservation entry that points at the demand, such as the sale.  
  
## Reshuffle  
When a user posts an outbound document after picking the wrong serial or lot number, other nonspecific reservations are reshuffled to reflect the actual serial or lot number that is picked. This satisfies the posting engine with a fixed application between supply and demand.  
  
For all supported business scenarios, reshuffling  is possible only against positive item ledger entries that carry reservation and serial or lot numbers but without defined serial or lot numbers on the demand side.  
  
## Supported Business Scenarios  
The Late Binding functionality supports the following business scenarios:  
  
* Entering a specific serial or lot number on an outbound document with nonspecific reservation of a wrong serial or lot number.  
* Reserving a specific serial or lot number.  
* Posting an outbound document with nonspecific reservation of a serial or lot number.  
  
### Entering Serial or Lot Numbers on an Outbound Document with Wrong Nonspecific Reservation  
This is the most common of the three supported scenarios. In this case, the Late Binding functionality ensures that a user can enter a serial or lot number, which is actually picked, on an outbound document that already has a nonspecific reservation of another serial or lot number.  
  
For example, the need arises when an order processor has first made a nonspecific reservation of any serial or lot number. Later when the item is actually picked from inventory, the picked serial or lot number must be entered on the order before it is posted. The nonspecific reservation is reshuffled at posting time to ensure that the picked serial or lot number can be entered without losing the reservation and to ensure that the picked serial or lot number can be fully applied and posted.  
  
### Reserve Specific Serial or Lot Numbers  
In this business scenario, Late Binding functionality ensures that a user who is trying to reserve a particular serial or lot number that is currently nonspecifically reserved can do so. A nonspecific reservation is reshuffled at the time of reservation to free the serial or lot number for the specific request.  
  
The reshuffle happens automatically, but embedded Help is displayed at the bottom of the **Reservation** page and shows the following text:  
  
**XX of the Total Reserved Quantity are nonspecific and may be available.**  
  
In addition, the **Nonspecific Reserved Qty.** field shows how many reservation entries are nonspecific. By default, this field is not visible to users.  
  
### Posting an Outbound Document with Nonspecific Reservation of Serial or Lot Numbers  
This business scenario is supported with Late Binding functionality that enables fixed application and outbound posting of what is actually picked by reshuffling another nonspecific reservation of a serial or lot number. If reshuffling is not possible, then the following standard error message appears when the user tries to post the shipment:  
  
**Item XX cannot be fully applied.**

# Change which features are displayed

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is designed to help you run your business regardless of the size and complexity. At the core of the product, you find essential features, such as financial reporting, sales, purchasing, and inventory management. As business complexity increases, you can turn on functionality for manufacturing and service management, for example.

You can define the product complexity level, and thereby which features the company's users get access to, by changing the **Experience** setting on the **Company Information** page. Note that the experience setting can also be changed by adding certain extensions from AppSource. For more information, see [Customizing [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Using Extensions](ui-extensions.md).

The following table lists the experiences that are currently available.

| Experience | Impact on User Interface |
| --- | --- |
| **Essential** |Shows all actions and fields for all common business functionality.|
| **Premium** |Shows all actions and fields for all business functionality, including Manufacturing and Service Management.|

The experiences that can be selected in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] reflect the solution licenses, called plans, that are defined for the product. For information about the Essential and Premium plans, see [Business Central](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2264940) on the Microsoft Dynamics 365 marketing site. See also the [[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Licensing Guide](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2264939).

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Users of type Team Member, Internal Admin, External Accountant, and Delegated Admin can be assigned a different plan than other users in the solution. Only users of type Evaluation or Premium can change the value in the **Experience** field from Essential to Premium.

> [!NOTE]
> In 2024 release wave 1, a user with the Premium plan can sign in to a company that's using the Essentials plan. However, the Premium user can't use any of the features that the Premium license provides. The same isn't true in the opposite direction. Users who have the Essentials plan can't sign in to a company that's using the Premium plan.

Prior to defining a company's experience setting, you define users' access to specific functions and pages by assigning permission sets. For more information, see [Assign Permissions to Users and Groups](ui-define-granular-permissions.md).

The **Experience** setting applies to all users in a company, but each user can personalize their own experience further by changing page layouts and content. For more information, see [Personalize Your Workspace](ui-personalization-user.md).

## Enabling premium features after upgrading a plan

Users are assigned to plans in Microsoft 365 Admin Center in connection with the general work to create the Business Central users. For more information, see [Add users and assign licenses at the same time](/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/add-users?view=o365-worldwide&preserve-view=true).

### To update plan changes in users groups

[!INCLUDE [2023rw1-sec-group-short](includes/2023rw1-sec-group-short.md)]

When you have made a change to users plans in Microsoft 365 Admin Center, such as assigned more users to the Premium plan, you must update [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to reflect the change.

1. Sign is as an administrator.
2. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Users**, and then choose the related link.
3. On the **Users** page, choose the **Update users from Microsoft 365** action.

### To select the Premium experience

You can now proceed to select the new experience.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Company Information**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Company Information** page, on the **User Experience** FastTab, select Premium  in the **Experience** field.

## Help assumes the Premium experience

All feature descriptions in user documentation for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] assume the **Premium** experience, meaning the descriptions cover the full scope of UI elements.

# About inventory costing
Managing inventory costs is concerned with recording and reporting business operating costs. It includes the reporting of manufacturing costs and inventory costs, that is, the value of items.  

 Central principles to understand are that costing methods define how items are valued when they leave inventory, that cost adjustment updates the cost of goods sold with related purchase costs posted after the sale, and that inventory values must be posted to dedicated G/L accounts at regular intervals.  

 The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the articles that describe them.

# Set up calculations and posting methods for value-added tax

Consumers and businesses pay value-added tax (VAT) when they purchase goods or services. The amount of VAT to pay can vary, depending on several factors. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you set up VAT to specify the rates used to calculate tax amounts based on the following parameters:

* Who you sell to  
* Who you buy from  
* What you sell  
* What you buy  

You can set up VAT calculations manually, but that can be tricky and time-consuming. It's easy to use different VAT rates by mistake and create inaccurate VAT-related reports. To make VAT set up easier, we recommend you use the **VAT Setup** assisted setup guide.

However, if you want to set up the VAT calculations yourself, or just want to learn about each step, this article contains descriptions of each step.  

[!INCLUDE [finance-vat](includes/finance-vat.md)]

## Set up VAT using the assisted setup guide (recommended)

> [!NOTE]
> You can use the **VAT Setup** guide only if you have created a *My Company* and haven't posted transactions that include VAT. To learn more about a My Company, go to [Create new companies in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]](about-new-company.md).

To start the assisted setup guide, follow these steps:

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon and enter **Assisted Setup**. 
2. Choose **Set up Value-Added Tax (VAT)** and complete the steps.
3. After you complete the assisted setup, go to the **VAT Posting Setup** page to check whether you need to fill in more fields according to the local requirements in your version of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Learn more at [Local functionality in Business Central](about-localization.md).  

### Check the VAT posting setup

To support your fast start, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] notifies you of missing general ledger (G/L) accounts in posting groups or posting setups, such as on the **VAT Posting Setup** page. You can turn this type of notification on or off using the **G/L Account is missing in posting group or setup** notification in the **My Notifications** page. Just go to the **My settings** page, and then choose the **Change when I receive notifications** link.  

If you choose the notification, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates posting setups based on the posting groups in the document or journal you're currently working on.  

At this point, you can just fill in the missing G/L accounts. But, when you further refine your setup later, you might realize your initial setup is wrong. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't allow you to delete a VAT posting setup and general posting setup after they're used to create entries. To prevent people from mistakenly using a setup that's no longer relevant for new postings, you can use the **Blocked** field on the **General Posting Setup** page.

## Set up a default VAT date for documents and journals

VAT reporting in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is based on the **VAT Date** to include VAT entries on VAT reports in a VAT period. The VAT date can be changed on all documents and journals, but you must specify a default value for VAT date.

> [!NOTE]
> After posting the document or journal, the **VAT Date** will appear on **VAT Entries** and **G/L Entries** as well as on the posted document if exists.

To set up a default value for a VAT date, follow these steps:

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon and enter **General Ledger Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **General** FastTab, in the **Default VAT Date** field, choose either **Posting Date** or **Document Date**.
3. Close the page.  

> [!NOTE]
> By default, the **Default VAT Date** is the **Posting Date**.

### Enable or disable the VAT Date feature

Some countries/regions require that businesses use a specific VAT date, but other countries/regions don't. Some countries/regions also require businesses to change the VAT date in specific situations after they post documents, but other countries/regions don't allow changes to VAT dates. To allow for different contexts, you can choose whether you want to use this functionality and, if so, to what degree.

To set up the level of VAT date usage, follow these steps:

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon and enter **General Ledger Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **General** FastTab, in the **VAT Date Usage** field, specify the degree to which you want to use the VAT date feature. You can choose one of the following options:

   | Type | Description |
   |--------------------|-----------------------------------------|
   | **Use full VAT Date functionality** | Everything related to **VAT Date** works by default, giving you the maximum **VAT Date** functionality. You can set up the date, change it in documents, report based on it, and modify the date after posting as long as the period isn't closed or protected with allowed dates for posting. |
   | **Use but do not allow modifications** | Everything related to **VAT Date** works by default with one exception. You can't modify the **VAT Date** in **VAT Entries**. |
   | **Not using VAT Date functionality** | [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] hides and makes the **VAT Date** fields unavailable on documents, journals, and entries. The **Default VAT Date** is configured as the **Posting Date**. |

3. Close the page.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Even if you choose the **Not using VAT Date functionality** option, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will use the **VAT Date** in the background. Because the **Default VAT Date** is configured as the **Posting Date**, and you can't change it in this case, you'll get the same experience as without this feature. **VAT Date** fields will be removed from all pages, but this field will still exist in tables and reports will work based on it.

### Limiting periods for posting and changing the VAT date

You can prevent people from posting or changing VAT entries in specific date ranges. You set the restriction using two settings:

* Based on closed **VAT Return Period**
* Based on the **Allow Posting From** and **Allow Posting To** fields.

#### To limit posting based on VAT return period

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the TellF Me feature 1.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Ledger Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **General** FastTab, in the **Control VAT Period** field, specify the degree of VAT Return Period control. The following table describes the options.

| Type | Description |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **Block posting within closed and warn for released period** | Prevent people from posting a document or journal, or changing VAT entries that have a VAT date within a closed **VAT Return Period**. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] also shows a warning if your **VAT Return Period** is open, but the status of **VAT Return** is **Released** or **Submitted**. |
| **Block posting within closed period** | Prevent people from posting a document or journal, or changing vat entries that have a VAT date within the closed **VAT Return Period**. |
| **Warn when posting in closed period** | Show a warning, but don't block posting, if you want to post a document or journal that has a VAT date within a closed **VAT Return Period**. |
| **Disabled** | Take no action based on a closed **VAT Return Period**. |

#### Limit posting based on Allow from/to period

> [!NOTE]
> As of Business Central version 23.1, this control is changed. In earlier versions, there was only one control on the **General Ledger Setup** page for both Posting Date and VAT Date. Now, these controls are split, so control in the **General Ledger Setup** page is for the **Posting Date** only and control in the **VAT Setup** page is for the **VAT Date** only. There are also new date controls in the **User Setup** page.  

##### Version 23.1 or newer

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When you upgrade to a newversion, be aware that values are upgraded in the new **Allow VAT Date From/To** in the **VAT Setup** page based on the values in **Allow Posting From/To** in the **General Ledger Setup**. If you want to use different date controls, open the **VAT Setup** page and make changes.  

You can set up limitations on the company or at specific user levels.

To limit all postings for the whole company:

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Setup**, and then select the related link.  
2. On the **VAT Date** FastTab, in the **Allow VAT Date From** field, specify the VAT date from which you allow posting. Posting a document or journal with a VAT date before this date isn't allowed.  
3. On the **VAT Date** FastTab, in the **Allow VAT Date To** field, specify the VAT date until which you allow posting. Posting a document or journal with a VAT date after this date isn't allowed. 

To limit postings for the specific user:  

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **User Setup**, and then select the related link.  
2. In the **User ID** field, specify the user allowed to post in a specific period.  
3. In the **Allow VAT Date From** field, specify the VAT date from which you allow posting. Posting a document or journal with a VAT date before this date isn't allowed. 
4. In the **Allow VAT Date To** field, specify the VAT date until which you allow posting. Posting a document or journal with a VAT date after this date isn't allowed.  

##### Versions before 23.1 

You can set up limitation on the company or specific user levels.

To limit all postings for the whole company:

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Ledger Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **General** FastTab, in the **Allow Posting From** field, specify the VAT date from which you allow posting. Posting a document or journal with a VAT date before this date isn't allowed.  
3. On the **General** FastTab, in the **Allow Posting To** field, specify the VAT date until which you allow posting. Posting a document or journal with a VAT date after this date isn't allowed.

To limit postings for the specific user:

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **User Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. In the **User ID** field, specify the user allowed to post in specific period.  
3. In the **Allow Posting From** field, specify the VAT date from which you allow posting. Posting a document or journal with a VAT date before this date isn't allowed.
4. In the **Allow Posting To** field, specify the VAT date until which you allow posting. Posting a document or journal with a VAT date after this date isn't allowed.

## Set up VAT registration numbers for your country/region

To help ensure people enter valid VAT registration numbers, you can define formats for the VAT registration numbers that are used in the countries/regions in which you do business. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] displays an error message if someone makes a mistake or uses a format that is incorrect for the country/region.

To set up VAT registration numbers, follow these steps:

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 2.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Countries/Regions**.
2. Choose the country or region, and then choose the **VAT Reg. No. Formats** action.
3. In the **Formats** field, define the format by entering one or more of the following characters:  

* **#** Requires a single-digit number.  
* **@** Requires a letter. This format isn't case-sensitive.  
* **?** Allows any character.  

    > [!TIP]
    > You can use other characters as long as they are always present in the country or region format. So, if you need to include a period or a hyphen between sets of numbers, you can define the format as ##.####.### or @@-###-###.  

## Set up VAT business posting groups

VAT business posting groups should represent the markets in which you do business with customers and vendors, and define how to calculate and post VAT in each market. Examples of VAT business posting groups are **Domestic** and **European Union (EU)**.  

Use codes that are easy to remember and describe the business posting group, such as **EU**, **Non-EU**, or **Domestic**. Each code must be unique, meaning you can set up as many codes as you need, but you can't have the same code more than once in a table.

To set up a VAT business posting group, follow these steps:

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 3.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Business Posting Groups**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary.

You can set up default VAT business posting groups by linking them to general business posting groups. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically assigns the VAT business posting group when you assign the business posting group to a customer, vendor, or general ledger account.

## Set up VAT product posting groups

VAT product posting groups represent the items and resources you buy or sell, and determine how to calculate and post VAT according to the type of item or resource.

It's a good idea to use codes that are easy to remember and describe the rate, such as **NO-VAT** or **Zero**, **VAT10** or **Reduced** for 10 percent VAT, and **VAT25** or **Standard** for 25 percent.

To set up a VAT business posting group, follow these steps:

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 4.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Product Posting Groups**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary.

## Combine VAT posting groups in VAT posting setups

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates VAT amounts on sales and purchases based on VAT posting setups, which are combinations of VAT business and product posting groups. For each combination, you can specify the VAT percent, VAT calculation type, and general ledger accounts for posting VAT for sales, purchases, and reverse charges. You can also specify whether to recalculate VAT when a payment discount is applied or received.  

Set up as many combinations as you need. To group VAT posting setup combinations with similar attributes, define a **VAT Identifier** for each group, and assign the identifier to the group members.  

> [!NOTE]
> A **VAT Identifier** is a code you can use to group similar attributes. We recommend you use different VAT identifiers for different VAT percentages.  

To combine VAT posting setups, follow these steps:

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 5.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Posting Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

## Assign VAT posting groups by default to multiple entities

If you want to apply the same VAT posting groups to multiple entities, you can set up [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to do so by default.

* You can assign VAT business posting groups to general business posting groups, or customer or vendor templates.
* You can assign VAT product posting groups on general product posting groups.  

The VAT business or product posting group is assigned when you choose a business or product posting group for a customer, vendor, item, or resource.

## Assign VAT posting groups to accounts, customers, vendors, items, and resources

The following sections describe how to assign VAT posting groups to individual entities.

### To assign VAT posting groups to individual general ledger accounts

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 6.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Chart of Accounts**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the **G/L Account Card** for the account.  
3. On the **Posting** FastTab, in the **Gen. Posting Type** field, choose either **Sale** or **Purchase**.  
4. Choose the VAT posting groups to use for the sales or purchase account.  

### To assign VAT business posting groups to customers and vendors

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 7.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customer** or **Vendor**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Customer** or **Vendor** card, expand the **Invoicing** FastTab.  
3. Choose the **VAT Bus. Posting Group**.  

### To assign VAT product posting groups to individual items and resources

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 8.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Item** or **Resource**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Do one of the following steps:  

    * On the **Item** card, expand the **Price & Posting** FastTab, and then choose **Show more** to display the **VAT Prod. Posting Group** field.  
    * On the **Resource** card, expand the **Invoicing** FastTab.  
3. Choose the VAT product posting group.  

## Set up clauses to explain VAT exemption or nonstandard VAT rates

You set up a VAT clause to describe information about the type of VAT that is being applied. Government regulations might require this information. After you set up a VAT clause and associate it with a VAT posting setup, the VAT clause displays on printed sales documents that use the VAT posting group setup.

If needed, you can also specify how to translate VAT clauses to other languages. When you create and print a sales document that contains a VAT identifier, the document includes the translated VAT clause. The language code specified on the customer card determines the language.

When you use nonstandard VAT rates in different types of documents, such as invoices or credit memos, you might have to include an exemption text (VAT clause). The exemption text states why you calculated a reduced VAT or zero VAT rate. You can define different VAT clauses to include on business documents for each type of document on the **VAT Clauses by Document Type** page.

You can modify or delete a VAT clause, and your modifications are reflected in a generated report. However, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't keep a history of the change. On the report, the VAT clause descriptions are printed and displayed for all lines in the report alongside the VAT amount and the VAT base amount. If a VAT clause isn't defined for any lines on the sales document, the whole section is omitted when you print the report.

### To set up VAT clauses

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 9.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Clauses**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **VAT Clauses** page, create a new line.  
3. In the **Code** field, enter an identifier for the clause. You use this code to assign the clause to VAT posting groups.  
4. In the **Description** field, enter the VAT exemption text that you want to display on documents that can include VAT. In the **Description 2** field, enter more text, if needed. The text is displayed on new document lines.
5. Choose the **Description by document type** action.
6. On the **VAT Clauses by Document Type** page, fill in the fields to set up which VAT exemption text to display for which document type.  
7. Optional: To assign the VAT clause to a VAT posting setup right away, choose **Setup**, and then choose the clause. If you want to wait, you can assign the clause later on the **VAT Posting Setup** page.  
8. Optional: To specify how to translate the VAT clause, choose the **Translations** action.

### To assign a VAT clause to a VAT posting setup

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 10.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Posting Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. In the **VAT Clause Code** column, choose the clause to use for each VAT posting setup it applies to.  

### To specify translations for VAT clauses

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 11.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Clauses**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **Translations** action.  
3. In the **Language Code** field, choose the language you're translating to.  
4. In the **Description** and **Description 2** fields, enter the translations of the descriptions. This text displays in the translated VAT report documents.  

### To specify extended text for VAT clauses

> [!NOTE]  
> If your country or region requires longer text for the VAT clauses than the default version supports, you can specify the longer text for the VAT clauses as *extended text* so that it prints on the sales and purchase reports.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 11.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Clauses**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **Extended Texts** action.  
3. Choose the **New** action.  
4. Fill in the **Language Code** and **Description** fields.  
5. Optionally, select the **All Language Codes** field, or specify the relevant language in the **Language Code** field if you use language codes.  
6. Fill in the **Starting Date** and **Ending Date** fields if you want to limit the dates on which the extended text is used.  
7. In the **Text** lines, write the extended text for your VAT clauses.  
8. Select the relevant fields for the document types where you want the extended text printed.  
9. Close the page.  

## Create a VAT posting setup to handle Import VAT

Use the *Import VAT* feature when you need to post a document where the entire amount is VAT. You use this feature if you receive an invoice from the tax authorities for VAT for imported goods.  

To set up codes for import VAT, follow these steps:  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 12.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Product Posting Groups**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the VAT Product Posting Groups page, set up a new VAT product posting group for import VAT.  
3. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 13.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Posting Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
4. On the VAT Posting Setup page, create a new line, or use an existing VAT business posting groups in combination with the new VAT product posting group for import VAT.  
5. In the **VAT Calculation Type** field, choose **Full VAT**.  
6. In the **Purchase VAT Account** field, enter the general ledger account to use for posting import VAT. All other accounts are optional.  

## Use reverse charge VAT for trade between EU countries/regions

Some companies must use reverse charge VAT when trading with other companies. For example, this rule applies to purchases from EU countries/regions and sales to EU countries/regions.  

> [!NOTE]  
> This rule applies when trading with companies that are registered as VAT liable in another EU country/region. If you do business directly with consumers in other EU countries/regions, then you should contact your tax authority for applicable VAT rules.  

> [!TIP]  
> You can verify that a company is registered as VAT liable in another EU country/region by using the EU VAT Registration Number Validation service. The service is available for free in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For more information, see [Verify VAT registration numbers](finance-how-validate-vat-registration-number.md).

### Sales to EU countries/regions

VAT isn't calculated on sales to VAT-liable companies in other EU countries/regions. You must report the value of these sales to EU countries/regions separately on your VAT statement.  

To correctly calculate VAT on sales to EU countries/regions, you should:  

* Set up a line for sales with the same information for purchases. If you set up lines on the **VAT Posting Setup** page for purchases from EU countries/regions, you can also use these lines for sales.  
* Assign the VAT business posting groups in the **VAT Bus. Posting Group** field on the **Invoicing** FastTab of the customer card of each EU customer. You should also enter the customer's VAT registration number in the **VAT Registration No.** field on the **Foreign Trade** FastTab.  

When you post a sale to a customer in another EU country/region, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates the VAT amount and creates a VAT entry based on information about the reverse charge VAT and the VAT base. This amount is used to calculate the VAT amount. No entries are posted to the VAT accounts in the general ledger.

If you want to use combination of VAT business posting group and VAT product posting group for reporting as services in the periodic VAT reports, mark the **EU Service** field.

> [!NOTE]  
> The **EU Service** field is only applicable for VAT reports. The field isn't related to the **Service Declaration** or **Intrastat for Services** features.

## VAT rounding for documents

Amounts in documents that aren't posted are rounded and displayed to correspond with the final rounding of amounts that are posted. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates VAT for a complete document. The VAT calculation is based on the sum of all lines with the same VAT identifier in the document.  

## Set up VAT reporting

You must set up information about how the tax authorities in your country or region require you to submit VAT reports. The following steps illustrate the most commonly used information. However, your country or region might require other steps. For more information, see the relevant article in the *Local functionality* section in the panel to the left.

# Responsible AI FAQ for Chat with Copilot (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/production-ready-preview-dynamics365.md)]

These frequently asked questions (FAQ) describe the AI impact of Chat with Copilot in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. If you're interested in general questions about using the feature, see [FAQ for chat with Copilot](chat-with-copilot-faq.md).

## What is Chat with Copilot?

Microsoft Copilot is an AI-powered assistant that helps you be more creative, productive, and efficient. You can chat with Copilot in Business Central to get answers and insights about [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and your business data by typing what you want to know in natural language.

Chat with Copilot, also called chat, is an interactive feature that answers your questions without requiring you to navigate the user interface or the product documentation. The Copilot pane is available from anywhere in the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] client.

You can ask questions in natural language, like "How do I deliver goods to my customers directly from my vendors?" or "Do we have any office chairs in stock for under $600?" In response, Copilot provides answers in natural language. Depending on the questions, answers can include plain text, links to records or pages in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], and links to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] help articles on Microsoft Learn.

## What are the capabilities of Chat with Copilot?

You can chat with Copilot to get answers to the following classes of questions:

### Explain and guide

You can ask Copilot to explain a specific concept related to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], like what are dimensions, or provide guidance on how to complete a task, like how to post a sales order. Copilot searches the official [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] documentation published by Microsoft, and provides an answer based on the documentation.

- Copilot uses the knowledge on Microsoft Learn (not a broad web search) to semantically search only Dynamics 365 [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] documentation on Microsoft Learn. This includes product documentation, release plans, local functionality content, and troubleshooting content.

- Copilot doesn't take action, create new data, or modify any configuration. It simply summarizes any paragraphs it finds on Microsoft Learn that match the question or prompt in chat.

### Find business data and related pages

You can ask Copilot to locate pages by name or request records based on specific fields and constraints. If Copilot finds a match, it responds with a link to the relevant record or page, which you can then select to open. Chat with Copilot works closely with analysis assist to generate data analysis tabs directly from the Chat pane, helping you gain insights into your data. This approach is used whenever you ask questions best illustrated by grouped records or simple calculations, such as totals or averages.

- Copilot converts the natural language input into a query consisting of a table search, sort, and filter criteria.

  The capability uses [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]'s native data search capabilities to find matching data from tables within the companies database. The search runs under your own identity for security and compliance. It doesn't search outside of the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] database.

- Copilot doesn't take action, create new data, or modify any configuration. It only summarizes the records received from the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] native data search.

## What is the intended use of Chat with Copilot?

Chat is designed for enterprise use and answering questions that relate to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and the business data it contains. The feature helps you solve common tasks such as finding records or getting guidance. You can express yourself in your own words, making your work easier and more accessible when working with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## How was Chat with Copilot evaluated? What metrics are used to measure performance?

- The feature underwent extensive testing during which numerous English language texts covering a broad range of topics and styles of expressing intent were given to Copilot. The outcomes were evaluated against accuracy, relevance, and safety.
  
- The feature is built in accordance with Microsoft's Responsible AI Standard. [Learn more about responsible AI from Microsoft](https://aka.ms/RAI).

## How does Microsoft monitor the quality of generated content?

Microsoft has various systems in place to ensure that content generated by Copilot is of the highest quality, detect abuse, and ensure safety for our customers and their data.

You can provide feedback to every Copilot response and report inaccurate or inappropriate content to help Microsoft improve this feature. 

- You can provide feedback by using the like (thumbs up) or dislike (thumbs down) icon on the **Copilot** pane in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].
  
- We analyze and utilize your feedback on the feature to help us improve responses.
  
- If you encounter inappropriate generated content, report it to Microsoft by using this feedback form: [Report abuse](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2249810).
  
- Microsoft might disable the Copilot features for selected customers if abuse of the functionality is detected.

## What are the limitations of Chat with Copilot? How can users minimize the impact of the Chat with Copilot limitations when using the system?

- General limitations of AI

  AI systems are valuable tools but they're nondeterministic. The content they generate might not be accurate. So, it's important to use your judgment to review and verify responses Copilot before making decisions that could affect stakeholders like customers and partners. For most responses, Copilot also includes citations or reference links that you can use to quickly verify whether Copilot gives a correct answer. For example, when asked how to perform some task, Copilot includes links to the source article. When asked to find a record based on specific criteria, Copilot includes links that describe the list page it identified as the topic of conversation. It also provides information about any filters or sorting that was applied to reach an answer.

- Language limitations

  - [!INCLUDE[copilot-language-support-en-only](includes/copilot-language-support-en-only.md)]

    If you chat with Copilot in a language other than English, Copilot might either respond in the same language, in English, or not at all. While in preview, chat is intended for use with the English language only.

  - The quality of answers can be lower under the following conditions:
    - The language of chat messages to Copilot is something other than en-US.
    - The language setting for the user in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] differs from the primary language of the data in the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] database.

- Specific industry, product, and topic limitations

   Chat includes built-in safety mechanisms that prevent the undesirable generation of harmful content, such as sexually explicit content or incitement of violence. Sometimes, customers operate in industries, sell products and services, or work with processes that naturally overlap with what might be considered inappropriate in other contexts, or work with data that might trigger these safeguards. Chat might not perform as well in these cases.

## What data does Chat with Copilot collect and how is it used

Microsoft doesn't use your company data, including the text you send to Copilot, to train the foundational AI models for the benefit of others. Company administrators have full control to govern this data that is part of their Azure subscription. Because administrators or others in your company might have access to this data as determined by your employer, we recommend you don't enter sensitive data such as passwords or other secrets.

## What does Chat with Copilot offer for security

Chat is designed to be secure and executes under the user's identity, inheriting all security permissions and other restrictions and never operating outside of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]'s platform security. This design means that Copilot can only access data that you have access to.

For users with SUPER permission, chat can more easily locate unsecured data that's typically harder to get to for other users. Organizations that don't apply [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]'s security model to restrict which tables and objects each user or user role has access to, might be at elevated risk when using chat. Therefore, we recommend that your organization either implements [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]'s security model or deactivates chat.

# The Ceridian Payroll Extension

To account for salary payments and related transactions, you must import and post financial transactions made by your payroll provider to the general ledger.

To do this, you first import a file that you receive from the payroll provider into the **General Journal** page. Then you map the external accounts in the payroll file to the relevant G/L accounts. Lastly, you post the payroll transactions according to the account mapping. For more information, see [Import Payroll Transactions](finance-how-import-payroll-transactions.md).

The Ceridian Payroll extension allows you to import payroll transactions from the Ceridian HR/Payroll (US) and Ceridian PowerPay (Canada) services.

# Define user tasks

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can create tasks to remind you of work to be done. You can create tasks for yourself, but you can also assign tasks to others or be assigned a task by someone else in your organization.  

Some usage scenarios for User Tasks are 

| If you work with... | Set up user tasks to track or follow-up on... |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Finance             | Month-end checklist activities, such as:<br><br>* Adjust cost<br>* Set a posting date range<br>* Close an inventory period<br>* Reconcile accounts payable (AP)<br>* Reconcile accounts receivable (AR)<br>* Recurring journals<br>* Bank reconciliation |
| Finance             | Year-close checklist activities, such as:<br><br>* Financial reporting (prepare and finalize annual financial statements)<br>* Audit preparation (gather necessary documents and information for external auditors)<br>* Budget review (compare actual performance against budget and analyze variances)<br>* Budget planning (develop the budget for the next fiscal year)<br>* Accounts receivable (follow up on outstanding invoices for the fiscal year and write off bad debts if necessary)<br>* Accounts payable (ensure all bills and expenses for the fiscal year are recorded and paid)<br>* Check whether fixed assets depreciations for the fiscal year are posted |
| Sales               | * Daily/weekly follow-ups on lead generation (identifying and contacting potential customers)<br>* Track communications with potential customers<br>* Sales calls/meetings (scheduling and conducting meetings with prospects)<br>* Proposal and quote creation (preparing and sending pricing and service details to prospects)<br>* Sales closing (finalizing deals and signing contracts)<br>* Customer relationship management (maintaining relationships with existing customers for up-selling or cross-selling opportunities)
| Sales               | * Daily/weekly follow-ups on sales target tracking (monitoring progress towards sales goals)<br>* Follow-up on sales activities such as recurring updates on sales targets |
| Sales               |* Weekly/Monthly follow-ups on revenue forecasting (predicting future sales based on current data)<br>* Competitor analysis (keeping an eye on competitor products, prices, and marketing strategies)<br>* Sales reporting (preparing sales reports for management review) |
| Sales               | * Monthly/Quarterly follow-ups on market research (understanding industry trends and customer needs)<br>* Training and development (improving sales skills and product knowledge) |

The list of sample user tasks for sales in the table was generated by AI using Microsoft Copilot. If you want to generate similar lists for your work domain, consider copying and modifying the following prompt:

```Copilot prompt
Come up with a list of common tasks for people working in a sales team that would be useful to track in a system. 

Format the list in bullet form
```

## Managing user task groups

You can use **User Task Groups** to group related tasks and assign them to a group of users instead of individual users. For example, you could create a group for "Month-end" activities and then assign membership to users in the accounting department. This way, anyone in the team can pick up tasks.

## Managing user tasks

The **User Tasks** page shows all tasks, and you can easily create and assign new tasks. When you create a task, you can specify the start date and due date, and you can add a link to the page or report in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] where the user must do the work.  

For example, you can create a task for yourself or a coworker to view all posted sales invoices. In that case, you link the task to page 143, **Posted Sales Invoices**. In the following screenshot, someone is creating a task for MeganB to review the posted sales invoices.  

:::image type="content" source="media/across-user-tasks/sample-user-task.png" alt-text="Example of a user task.":::

> [!TIP]  
> Use the look-up in the **Page** field and then use the **Search** field to find the page that you want.  
>
> You can link to any page, but you can't link to individual entries, so make the description as explicit as possible. For example, write "Please take a look at customer no. 10000 and make sure they don't have overdue payments.".

### Picking up user tasks

In the Business Manager, Bookkeeper, and Accountant Role Centers, a tile shows pending tasks that are assigned to that user. To pick up a task, choose it from the list of pending user tasks. In the ribbon, the link **Go to Task Item** opens the page where you can do the work.  

After you complete a task, mark it as completed.  

### Deleting user tasks

If you want to bulk delete all or some user tasks, use the **Delete User Tasks** report. In the request page, you can set filters to determine which tasks to delete.

# FAQ for mapping e-documents with purchase orders using Copilot (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]

These frequently asked questions (FAQ) describe the AI impact of **E-documents Matching Assistance** feature in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/production-ready-preview-dynamics365.md)]

## What is E-documents Matching Assistance?

Electronic documents (e-documents) serve as the foundation for modern business transactions. They represent critical paperwork such as invoices and receipts that flow in both directions through delivery and receipt. You can generate and transmit electronic invoices digitally in a structured format that facilitates automated invoice processing. However, handling incoming digital invoices can be more intricate for accounts payable teams.  

In small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs), the accounts payable team plays a pivotal role in accurately tracking vendor obligations. Their primary responsibility is to accurately record incoming invoices. Achieving precision can require effort, particularly when they reconcile external invoices from vendors with existing purchase orders. Discrepancies in codes, descriptions, and units of measurement often present challenges because these elements might not match across different systems and companies. Also, unexpected costs, such as transportation fees, might appear as separate line items that need manual adjustment. Accountants must also include invoice numbers and dates in the documents. Importantly, the relationship between purchase orders and external invoices isn't always one-to-one. You might receive multiple external invoices for the same purchase order.

Historically, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] could generate new purchase invoices based on received electronic invoices. However, manually matching invoices with existing purchase orders was a time-consuming and error-prone process.

**E-documents Matching Assistance** uses generative AI to streamlines this process by automating the analysis of external electronic invoices. The feature allows accountants to ask Copilot to match lines on incoming electronic invoices with lines on purchase orders in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## What are capabilities of the E-documents Matching Assistance?

Copilot provides AI-powered assistance to match received digital invoice with existing purchase orders in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Copilot matches lines based on the following:

- Similarity of descriptions
- Units of measure
- Quantities available for invoicing
- Amounts

Copilot identifies similar descriptions if they have proper unit of measures and the prices, but it can also find matches in more complex cases. For example, it can identify if an electronic invoice has two lines with a variant of the same item, and just one line in the purchase order; [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] matches these lines as long as the descriptions are similar and the prices are the same.

Copilot doesn't connect to your e-documents endpoint service to retrieve or send digital vouchers. This task remains fully within your control and is a prerequisite to using Copilot's assistance. This is true, regardless of whether the digital documents are added to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] using a connection with an endpoint service or entered manually.  

## What is the intended use of the E-documents Matching Assistance?  

The goal of the **E-documents Matching Assistance** feature is to assist the accounts payable team match existing purchase orders with incoming electronic invoices. Much of this activity revolves around string matching. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers a feature that automates some of this activity, and LLMs have been identified as an opportunity to supplement that feature and further reduce manual effort.  

## How was E-documents Matching Assistance evaluated? What metrics are used to measure performance?

This feature was tested using combinations of the following information:

- External item descriptions
- Units of measure
- Quantities and amounts
- Standard item descriptions
- Different languages
- Other parameters that cover the typical variations and data limits for each field 

Test data represents both typical use and use by bad actors. Performance was measured compared to manual matching the same data in electronic invoices and purchase orders.

## What are the limitations of E-documents Matching Assistance? How can users minimize the impact of the E-documents Matching Assistance limitations when using the system?

**E-documents Matching Assistance** performs best when external (e-invoice) and internal ([!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]) item descriptions, and unit of measures are all in the same language. Mixed languages or mixed language of item descriptions often result in fewer matches and suggestions.  

Suggested matching of items from e-invoices with items in purchase orders performs best in English language. Although you can use this feature in any language that [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports, you might experience fewer item matches in other languages. Learn more in the section [In which geographies and languages is E-documents Matching Assistance available?](#in-which-geographies-and-languages-is-e-documents-matching-assistance-available).

## In which geographies and languages is E-documents Matching Assistance available?

[!INCLUDE[copilot-geo-and-language-availability-en-only](includes/copilot-geo-and-language-availability-en-only.md)]

## What operational factors and settings allow for effective and responsible use of the feature?

Copilot supplements the mapping algorithm that [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] already provides and maps the lines that the algorithm didn't.

### What is expected of users while using E-Documents Matching Assistance?

<!--Not sure that this is the right content for this section. Seems like it belongs more in the overview article because it's more related to how to use the feature-->

After you map incoming electronic invoices with purchase orders, you must map the lines on the documents.

The **Purchase Order Mapping** page shows all lines from both of documents. Here, you can do the mapping manually, which can be difficult if there are many lines.

You can use **E-Documents Matching Assistance** to map lines based on the following criteria:

- Similarity in their descriptions
- Units of measure
- Quantities available for invoicing
- Amounts

Copilot's matches might be incorrect or incomplete. You should always review their accuracy before you choose to keep them. Copilot’s matches and suggestions are saved in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] when you choose **Keep it** and exit Copilot. You can edit and correct any matches or suggestions before you choose to keep them. 

### What is expected of administrators and users when operating E-Documents Matching Assistance?

Users, such as accountants or others who receive e-invoices, should always review the accuracy of matches and suggestions provided by Copilot before choosing to keep them. We recommend that you review the purchase order lines to verify their accuracy and find any discrepancies. You decide whether to use the **E-Documents Matching Assistance**. Even when the **E-Documents Matching Assistance** is enabled by administrators and available, you can still choose to use it always, sometimes, or never.  

Administrators make the overall decision on whether to use Copilot in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. If they enable Copilot, administrators should ensure they grant access to the appropriate.

> [NOTE!]
> - We don't support the feature for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises or in private clouds.
> - Partners can't extend this feature. Partner developers can't modify, replace, or extend this feature. 

## Is Copilot the only way to match e-documents to purchase orders?  

No, whether you use Copilot is up to you. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers non-AI-powered ways to match items from received electronic invoice with items on purchase orders in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Organizations can also use both approaches at the same time.  

## How do I give feedback about AI-generated content?  

Each time Copilot provides matches or suggestions, you can provide feedback to Microsoft directly from the Copilot window, using the **Like** and **Dislike** controls. Your feedback remains anonymous, and we use this data to improve the quality of the service.

# Categorize items

To maintain an overview of your items and to help you sort and find items, it's useful to organize your items in item categories.

To find items by characteristics, you can assign item attributes to items and also to item categories. For more information, see [Work with Item Attributes](inventory-how-work-item-attributes.md).
<br><br>  

> [!Video https://learn-video.azurefd.net/vod/player?id=4c02e1d8-7569-4eb4-94cf-105899787978]

## To create an item category
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Item Categories**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Item Categories** page, choose the **New** action.
3. On the **Item Category Card** page, on the **General** FastTab, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
4. On the **Attributes** FastTab, specify any item attributes for the item category. For more information, see [To assign item attributes to item categories](inventory-how-work-item-attributes.md#assign-item-attributes-to-item-categories).

> [!NOTE]  
> If the item category has a parent item category, as indicated by the **Parent Category** field, then any item attributes that are assigned to that parent item category are prefilled on the **Attributes** FastTab.

> [!NOTE]  
> Item attributes that you assign to an item category will automatically apply to the item that the item category is assigned to.

If you change your mind about an item category, you can delete it. However, if the category is assigned to an item, you must remove that assignment beforehand.

## To assign an item category to an item

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the card for the item that you want to assign to an item category.
3. Choose the lookup button in the **Item Category Code** field and select an existing item category. Alternatively, choose the **New** action to first create a new item category as explained in [To create an item category](inventory-how-categorize-items.md#to-create-an-item-category).

# View and edit in Excel from Business Central

With pages that display a list of records in rows and columns, such as a list of customers, sale orders, or invoices, you can export the list to Microsoft Excel and view it there. Depending on the page, you have two options for viewing in Excel. Both are available from the **Share** icon ![Share a page in another app.](media/share-icon.png) at the top of a page. You can either select the **Open in Excel** action or the **Edit in Excel** action on the page. This article explains the two actions.

## Open in Excel

With the **Open in Excel** action, you can make changes to the records in Excel, but you can't publish the changes back to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. You can only save the changes to the Excel file, without affecting data in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

- Excel respects filters on the page that limit the records shown. The Excel workbook has the same rows and columns that appear on the page in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].
- This action works on both Windows and macOS.
- [!INCLUDE[open-edit-excel](includes/open-and-edit-excel.md)]

<!-- 
> [!IMPORTANT]
> For [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, the **Open in Excel** action is available by default. However, if you set up [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises for editing data in Excel, then the **Open in Excel** action is replaced by the **Edit in Excel** action.-->

[!INCLUDE [send-report-excel](includes/send-report-excel.md)] 

> [!NOTE]
> In Excel, whole numbers in columns will have a decimal symbol at the end (like a period `.` or comma `,`) even though the decimal symbol isn't shown in Business Central. The decimal symbol depends on your device's region settings. For example, `10` in Business Central could appear as `10.` or `10,` in Excel. You can change the format in Excel by selecting the values, then selecting <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>1</kbd>. To learn more about changing the number format in Excel, go to [Format numbers](https://support.microsoft.com/office/format-numbers-f27f865b-2dc5-4970-b289-5286be8b994a).

## Edit in Excel

The **Edit in Excel** action is available on most lists, but not all. With the **Edit in Excel** action, you make changes to records in Excel and then publish the changes back to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. When Excel opens, the **Excel Add-in** pane displays.

- With this action, Excel respects most filters on the page that limit the records shown, so the Excel workbook has almost the same records and columns.
- To get the latest data from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], choose **Refresh** in the Excel Add-in pane.
- [!INCLUDE[open-edit-excel](includes/open-and-edit-excel.md)]

### First-time sign-in

The **Edit in Excel** action requires that the Business Central add-in is installed in Excel. In some cases, your administrator might set up the add-in to install automatically for you. In this case, you just have to sign in to Business Central in the **Excel Add-in** pane with your user name and password. Otherwise, the **New Office Add-in** pane opens. To install the add-in, choose **Trust this add-in**, which installs the add-in directly from the Office Store.

If the add-in doesn't install, either contact your admin or try to install it manually. For more information, see [Install the add-in manually for your own use](admin-deploy-excel-addin.md#install).

### Work across environments and companies

You can switch the company that you're working with. To switch a company, select the **Options** icon ![Excel add-in options.](media/cogwheel.png "Excel add-in options") in the Excel Add-in pane, then select the company from the **Company** field.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When changing the company, make sure that the **Environment** field is not empty. If it is, then set it to one of the available options; otherwise, the add-in will not work correctly.  

If you make changes to the add-in, you must reload it to update the connection. To reload, use the ![Excel add-in menu](media/excel-addin-menu.png "Excel add-in menu") menu in the upper-right corner of the add-in. If you can't load the add-in, talk to your administrator. If you're the administrator, see [Get the Business Central add-in for Excel](admin-deploy-excel-addin.md).

> [!NOTE]
> The add-in works with Excel for the web (online) from any device as long as you use a supported browser. It also works with the Excel app for Windows (PC), but not for macOS.
>
> For [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, the **Edit in Excel** action is only available if the Excel add-in has been configured by your administrator, and only available for the web client. For administrators, if you want to learn how to install the Excel add-in, see [Setting up the Business Central add-in for Excel in Business Central on-premises](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/configuring-excel-addin).

### Limits when using Excel for the web

When **Edit in Excel** is used on list pages for tables with many columns, the resulting workbook might have too many columns for the file to be viewed in Excel for the web. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically limits the exported workbook to 100 columns when OneDrive is configured for system features.

# Design Details: Item Tracking Lines Page
Item tracking records and reservation records are created in the reservation system, and their availability is calculated dynamically. Data that is entered on the **Item Tracking Lines** page is managed in a temporary version of the **Tracking Specification** table. When the page is closed, the active data is committed to the **Reservation Entry** table and the historic data is committed to the **Tracking Specification** table. For more information, see [Design Details: Active versus Historic Item Tracking Entries](design-details-active-versus-historic-item-tracking-entries.md).  
  
Lookups from the **Serial No.** and **Lot No.** fields show availability based on both the **Item Ledger Entry** table and the **Reservation Entry** table, with no date filter. The matrix of quantity fields on the header of the **Item Tracking Lines** page dynamically displays the quantities and sums of item tracking numbers that are being entered on the lines of the page. The quantities must correspond to those of the document line, which is indicated by **0** in the **Undefined** fields in the header of the page.  
  
To coordinate the flow of serial and lot numbers through inventory, the following rules exist for entering data on the **Item Tracking Lines** page:  
  
* For both inbound and outbound item tracking lines, you cannot enter a serial number, with or without a lot number, more than once in the same instance of the **Item Tracking Lines** page. If you try to enter any combination of serial or lot numbers that is already present on the page, then an error message blocks the data entry.  
* For inbound item tracking lines, you cannot post the related document if an item of the same variant and with the same serial number is already in inventory. If you try to post a positive line for an inventory item with the same variant and serial number, then an error message blocks the posting. However, for both inbound and outbound item tracking lines on open documents, you can have the same combination of serial or lot numbers that relate to different source document lines, that is, existing in different instances of the **Item Tracking Lines** page until the related document is posted.  
* If the item is set up for serial number-specific tracking or lot number- specific tracking, then you cannot post an outbound document line unless an item with the defined serial or lot number exists in inventory. If you try to post an outbound document line for an item with a serial lot number that is not in inventory, then an error message blocks the posting.  
  
The rules for entering data on the **Item Tracking Lines** page also support the coupling principles that govern order tracking, planning, and reservation. For more information, see [Design Details: Item Tracking and Planning](design-details-item-tracking-and-planning.md).

# Make check payments

You can issue electronic and manual checks in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Both methods use the payment journal to issue checks to vendors. You can also void checks and view check ledger entries.

The following procedure shows how to pay a vendor with a computer checks by:

- Applying the payment to the relevant vendor invoice.
- Printing the check.
- Posting the payment as paid.

These steps result in positive vendor ledger entries that are applied to negative bank ledger entries, and physical checks for processing in the bank.

You can pay with two types of checks. For both types, the **Bal. Account Type** or the **Account Type** field must contain **Bank Account**.

- **Computer Check**: Select this option if you want to print a check for the amount on the payment journal line. You must print the checks before you can post the journal lines.
- **Manual Check**: Select this option if you have created a check manually and want to create a corresponding check ledger entry for this amount. By using this option, you can't print the check.

> [!NOTE]  
> To make sure that your bank only clears validated checks and amounts, you can send them a file that contains vendor, check, and payment information. To learn more, go to [Export a Positive Pay file](finance-how-positive-pay.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Your printer must be correctly set up with the check forms, and you must define which check layout to use. To learn more, go to [Select a Check Layout](finance-how-define-check-layouts.md). Alternatively, you can send the check as a PDF file, for example.  

You can print up to 10 invoices on a page for a check stub. If a check applies to more than 10 invoices, when you print the stub we void the check on the first page and print the word VOID on the check. We then print the remainder of the invoices and the total check amount on the second page.

## To pay a vendor invoice with a check

The following describes how to pay a vendor by check. The steps are similar to refund a customer by check.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Payment Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. Fill in the payment journal lines. To learn more, go to [Record Payments and Refunds](payables-how-post-payments-refunds.md).
3. In the **Payment Method Code** field, select **Check**.
4. Choose the **Print Check** action.
5. On the **Check** page, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
6. If your printer is set up to print checks, choose the **Print** button. Otherwise, choose the **Send to** button, select the **PDF Document** option, choose the **OK** button, and then print the PDF document.

    You can now send the physical checks to the vendors.
7. Choose the **Post** action.

    The payment is applied to the vendor and paid. Fully applied vendor ledger entries and bank ledger entries are created.

> [!NOTE]  
> If you want to print and pay checks in more than one currency from different bank accounts, you must run the **Print Check** batch job separately for each currency and specify the appropriate bank account.

## To cancel printed checks that aren't posted

You can cancel non-posted checks after they have been printed by using the **Void Check** action on the **Payment Journal** page.

1. On the **Payment Journal** page, choose the **Void Check**, and then choose which checks to cancel.

## To void checks

After you post a check payment, you can only cancel (void) a check from the resulting bank ledger entries.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If the check is applied to an invoice, unapply the payment first so that the invoice can be repaid. To learn more, go to [To unapply an application of vendor entries](payables-how-apply-purchase-transactions-manually.md#to-unapply-an-application-of-vendor-entries). The steps are the same for customers. After you unapply the payment, void the check. If the check was printed but didn't pay an invoice, then choose **Void Check Only** as described in this section.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Bank Accounts**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the relevant bank account, and then choose the **Check Ledger Entries** action.
3. On the **Check Ledger Entries** page, choose the **Void Check** action.
4. Select the **Void Check Only** checkbox.
5. Choose the **OK** button.

## To view a summary of posted checks

If you want to review posted checks, for example to verify multiple checks paid to one vendor, you can use the **Bank Account - Check Details** report.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Bank Account - Check Details**, and then choose the related link.
2. Set filters as relevant, and then choose the **Preview** button.

# Record payments and refunds in the payment journal

On the **Payment Journals** page, you record payments that you make to vendors and refunds that you make to customers. When you post a payment journal line, the paid amount is recorded on the specified bank account. You must then take steps to perform the actual money transfer from the related bank account.  

Payment journals are general journals that are optimized for making payments. You can quickly add lines manually, you can let [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] suggest vendor payments, and you can apply the payment to posted documents. Although you're making payments, you enter a positive amount in the **Document Amount** field. Depending on the document type for the journal line, this amount is then converted to a negative amount in the underlying transactions. This way, it's faster for you to add journal lines manually. If you prefer to enter negative amounts, you can personalize the payment journal to show the **Amount** field instead. To learn more about personalizing pages, go to [Start personalizing by using the personalization mode](ui-personalization-user.md#start-personalizing-by-using-the-personalization-mode).  

- Applying payments to invoices or credit memos

    If you fill in the **Applies-to Doc. No.** field with the invoice or credit memo to pay or refund, the document is set to **Paid** when you post the journal. This setting is referred to as "applied." As an alternative to applying when you post a payment, you can use the **Apply Vendor Entries** and **Apply Customer Entries** pages after you post the payment. To learn more, go to, for example, [Reconcile Vendor Payments with the Payment Journal or from Vendor Ledger Entries](payables-how-apply-purchase-transactions-manually.md).  

- Get suggested payments to vendors or employees

    The **Suggest Vendor Payments** and **Suggest Employee Payments** actions can help you fill in payment journal lines automatically according to vendor prioritization and due dates. To learn more, go to [Suggest Vendor Payments](payables-how-suggest-vendor-payments.md). With this function, the **Applies-to Doc. No.** field is always filled in.  

- Print checks and submit payments electronically to your bank

    In addition to recording that the payment is made, you can also use the **Payment Journal** page to output the payment for further processing by your bank. To learn more, go to [Make Check Payments](payables-how-work-checks.md) and [Make Electronic Payments](finance-make-payments-with-bank-data-conversion-service-or-sepa-credit-transfer.md#exporting-payments-to-a-bank-file).  

## To make payments in the payment journal

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Payment Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the journal batch that you use for payments.
3. If you know who to pay, fill in the fields manually. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
4. To also apply the payment to the related invoice or credit memo, choose the **Applies-to Doc. No.** field, on the **Apply Vendor Entries** page, select the relevant invoice or credit memo, and then choose the **OK** button.

    Many fields, such as the **Document Amount** and **Due Date** fields, now contain information from the selected document.
5. Alternatively, use the **Suggest Vendor Payments** action. All the applies-to information and amounts are also entered on the journal lines. To learn more, go to [Suggest Vendor Payments](payables-how-suggest-vendor-payments.md).
6. After you complete all payment journal lines, choose the **Post** action.

## To issue a refund check

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Payment Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. In the **Document Type** field, select **Refund**.  
3. In the **External Document No.** field, enter a reference for the refund check (for example, the return order number).  
4. In the **Account Type** field, select **Customer**.  
5. In the **Account No.** field, select the customer's account number that the refund check is being issued to.  
6. In the **Amount** field, enter the amount to be refunded.  
7. In the **Bal. Account Type** field, select **Bank Account**.  
8. In the **Bal. Account No.** field, select the bank account the check comes out of.  
9. In the **Applies To Doc. No.** field, select the documents that require a refund.  
10. After you complete all payment journal lines, choose the **Post/Print** action, choose the **Post and Print** action, and then choose **Yes**.

# Service Posting
Service posting functionality lets you process your documents efficiently and maintain successful customer service policy. You can create and update posted documents, and create ledger entries both in the service area and in other modules to ensure the correct update.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  The following describes service posting regardless of how items are physically handled in the warehouse.  
>   
>  In a location that is not set up to require warehouse handling, you perform the posting actions directly from the **Service Lines** page. In locations that involve warehouse handling, the described posting actions, except Ship and Consume, are performed indirectly through varying warehouse ship functions, depending on setup. For more information, see [Pick Items with Inventory Picks](warehouse-how-to-pick-items-with-inventory-picks.md).  

## Ship  
The ship option lets you register the relevant items and time entered on the lines of a service order after you complete the service. A posted shipment is created and updates occur in the Inventory module and other modules in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to reflect that the items have been taken out of the inventory and sent to the customer. In particular, the item ledger entries, value ledger entries, service ledger entries, and warranty ledger entries are produced.  

If the location is set up to require warehouse handling, then the shipping and moving of service line items functions in the same ways as for other source documents. The only difference is that service line items can be consumed either externally or internally, which requires two different release functions.

## Invoice  
You have to use the invoice option to issue an invoice to the customer you want to charge for the service. Usually, it is the difference between the shipped quantity registered by the **Post Shipment** function and the consumed quantity registered by the **Post Consumption** function that is subject to invoice. You cannot invoice what has not been shipped. When you run the **Post Invoice** function, you create a posted service invoice and update the documents posted before to make them consistent with the quantities that are contained in the issued invoice. Like in other posting procedures, the relevant ledger entries that includes general ledger entries, are generated.  

## Ship and Invoice  
The ship and invoice option lets you issue both a service shipment and an invoice at the same time.  

## Ship and Consume  
With the ship and consume option, you can register and post items, costs, or hours that have been used for servicing but that cannot be included in the invoice to the customer. An invoice is not issued, but you can issue both a service shipment and service consumption at the same time to reflect the fact that some items or hours have been given to the customer free of charge. The corresponding ledger entries are also created to register consumption.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  The service posting procedure enables you to perform partial posting. You can create a partial shipment or a partial invoice by filling in the **Qty. to Ship** and **Qty. to Invoice** fields on the individual service lines of the service orders before you post. Note that you cannot create an invoice for something that is not shipped. That is, before you can invoice, you must have registered a shipment, or you must choose to ship and invoice at the same time.  

After the posting has been completed, you will be able to view the posted service documents from the corresponding **Posted Service Shipment** and **Posted Service Invoice** pages. The posted entries created can be seen in various pages that contain posted entries, such as **G/L Entries**, **Item Ledger Entries**, **Warehouse Entries**, **Service Ledger Entries**, **Project Ledger Entries**, and **Warranty Ledger Entries**.  

## To view information about a posted service document  
When you post a service invoice, a service shipment, or a service credit memo, the information on the document is transferred to the **Posted Service Invoice**, **Posted Service Shipment**, or **Posted Service Credit Memo** pages respectively. You cannot enter, change, or delete anything in these pages. You can print a shipment, invoice, or credit memo from these pages.  

The following procedure uses a posted service invoice as an example, but the same procedure can apply to posted service shipments and posted credit memos.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Posted Service Invoice**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the posted service invoice you want to view.  
3. To get an overview of the posted invoice, choose the **Statistics** action.  

    The **Service Order Statistics** page opens. The page displays information such as quantity, amount, VAT, cost, profit, and customer credit limit for the posted document.

# Design Details: Item Tracking Availability
The **Item Tracking Lines** and **Item Tracking Summary** pages provide dynamic availability information for serial or lot numbers. The purpose of this is to increase transparency for users on outbound documents, such as sales orders, by showing them which serial numbers or how many units of a lot number are currently assigned on other open documents. This reduces uncertainty that is caused by double allocation and instills confidence in order processors that the item tracking numbers and dates that they are promising on unposted sales orders can be fulfilled. For more information, see [Design Details: Item Tracking Lines Page](design-details-item-tracking-lines-window.md).  

 When you open the **Item Tracking Lines** page, availability data is retrieved from the **Item Ledger Entry** table and the **Reservation Entry** table, with no date filter. When you choose the **Serial No.** field or the **Lot No.** field, the **Item Tracking Summary** page opens and shows a summary of the item tracking information in the **Reservation Entry** table. The summary contains the following information about each serial or lot number on the item tracking line:  

|Field|Description|  
|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
|**Total Quantity**|The total quantity of the serial or lot number that is currently in inventory.|  
|**Total Requested Quantity**|The total quantity of the serial or lot number that is currently requested in all documents.|  
|**Current Pending Quantity**|The quantity that is entered in the current instance of the **Item Tracking Lines** page but is not yet committed to the database.|  
|**Total Available Quantity**|The quantity of the serial or lot number that is available for the user to request.<br /><br /> This quantity is calculated from other fields on the page as follows:<br /><br /> total quantity – (total requested quantity + current pending quantity).|  

> [!NOTE]  
>  You can also see the information in the preceding table by using the **Select Entries** function on the **Item Tracking Lines** page.  

 To preserve database performance, availability data is only retrieved once from the database when you open the **Item Tracking Lines** page and when you use the **Refresh Availability** function on the page.  

## Calculation Formula  
 As described in the preceding table, the availability of a given serial or lot number is calculated as follows.  

 total available quantity = quantity in inventory – (all demands + quantity not yet committed to the database)  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  This formula implies that the serial or lot number availability calculation considers only inventory and ignores projected receipts. Accordingly, supply that is not yet posted to inventory does not affect item tracking availability, as opposed to regular item availability where projected receipts are included.

# Display a stockout warning

When someone enters a quantity for an item on a sales document that exceeds the item's current inventory level at the location, you might want to let them know by displaying a notification. The notification is just to inform them of the potential problem, and doesn't prevent them from creating the order.

## To show a warning about low inventory on a sales document

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales & Receivables Setup**, and then choose the related link.
1. Depending on whether you want to show the warning, turn on or turn off the **Stockout Warning" toggle.

## Video guidance

The following video shows a scenario where someone is creating a sales order, and the quantity exceeds the available inventory level for the item at its location.

# Design Details: Active versus Historic Item Tracking Entries
When parts of a document line quantity are posted, only that particular quantity is transferred to the item ledger entries and its item tracking numbers. However, you will want to access all relevant item tracking information directly from the active document line. That is, not only will you want to see the entries that are related to the remaining quantity, you will also want information about the units that have been posted. When you view or modify the **Item Tracking Lines** page, the collective contents of the **Tracking Specification** table (T336) and **Reservation Entry** table (T337) are presented in a temporary version of T336. This ensures that historic and active item tracking data is accessed as one.  

 The following table shows how T336 and T337 are used in a purchase scenario. The bold figures represent values that the user manually enters on the **Item Tracking Lines** page.  

 Step 1: Create a purchase order line of seven pieces with item tracking numbers.  

||**Quantity (Base)**|**Qty. to Handle**|**Qty. to Invoice (Base)**|**Quantity Handled (Base)**|**Quantity Invoiced (Base)**|  
|-|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|  
|**T337**|7|0|0|0|0|  
|**T336**|0|0|0|0|0|  

 Step 2: Receive four pieces.  

||**Quantity (Base)**|**Qty. to Handle**|**Qty. to Invoice (Base)**|**Quantity Handled (Base)**|**Quantity Invoiced (Base)**|  
|-|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|  
|**Item Tracking Lines** page|7|**4**|**0**|0|0|  
|**T337**|3|0|0|0|0|  
|**T336**|4|0|0|4|0|  

 Step 3: Receive two pieces and invoice two pieces.  

||**Quantity (Base)**|**Qty. to Handle**|**Qty. to Invoice (Base)**|**Quantity Handled (Base)**|**Quantity Invoiced (Base)**|  
|-|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|  
|**Item Tracking Lines** page|7|**2**|**2**|4|0|  
|**T337**|1|0|0|0|0|  
|**T336**|6|0|0|6|2|  

 Step 4: Receive one piece.  

||**Quantity (Base)**|**Qty. to Handle**|**Qty. to Invoice (Base)**|**Quantity Handled (Base)**|**Quantity Invoiced (Base)**|  
|-|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|  
|**Item Tracking Lines** page|7|**1**|**0**|6|2|  
|**T336**|7|0|0|7|2|  

 Invoice 5 pieces.  

||**Quantity (Base)**|**Qty. to Handle**|**Qty. to Invoice (Base)**|**Quantity Handled (Base)**|**Quantity Invoiced (Base)**|  
|-|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|  
|**Item Tracking Lines** page|7|0|**5**|7|2|  
|**T336**|7|0|0|7|7|

# Enabling new and upcoming features ahead of time

Some new features can be enabled ahead of time, letting you take advantage of them as early as possible. Enabling features early gives you the time to test and prepare your organization for change.

When Microsoft releases features or feature design improvements as part of minor updates, some of the features aren't immediately enabled. Administrators can enable each feature from the **Feature Management** page. After a feature is enabled, it becomes available for all users on that environment no matter how they access [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Features can be safely turned off again. These features are only optional for a while.

Learn more in [Feature Management](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/feature-management).

# Manage the Intercompany Inbox and Outbox

The intercompany transactions that you receive from your partners are listed on the **Intercompany Inbox** page. To learn how to process incoming intercompany transactions, go to [Process incoming intercompany transactions](#process-incoming-intercompany-transactions). The intercompany transactions that you send to partners are listed on the **Intercompany Outbox** page. To learn how to process outgoing intercompany transactions, go to [To process outgoing intercompany transactions](#to-process-outgoing-intercompany-transactions).

However, depending on your intercompany setup, some transactions are automatically handled. You can set up the source company and partner companies to automatically create documents and journals that correspond to transactions that partners post through the intercompany general journal. To learn about using intercompany journals, go to [Fill in and post an intercompany journal](intercompany-how-work-documents-journals.md#fill-in-and-post-an-intercompany-journal).  

## Organizing the Inbox  

You can use the filter fields at the top of the Inbox page to determine which transactions are shown on the page. For example, if you only want to explore transactions that a particular partner created, use the **Transaction Source** and **Intercompany Partner Code** filters.  

### Transaction source  

What you can do with a transaction depends whether it was:  

* Created by your intercompany partner  
* Rejected by your intercompany partner and returned to you  

Use the **Show Transaction Source** field to filter the **Intercompany Inbox Transactions** page so that it displays only one of these types of transactions. You can also filter by intercompany partner, or by the contents of the **Line Action** field.  

#### Created by intercompany partner  

 When you receive a new transaction that was created by your partner, you can choose to either:

* Accept the transaction  
* Reject the transaction (return to partner)  
* Cancel the transaction (delete the transaction and don't return it to your partner)  

#### Returned from intercompany partner  

If your intercompany partner rejects a transaction, you must cancel the transaction in the inbox and then create correction lines or reverse the journal or document.  

## Recreating inbox entries  

If you accepted a transaction in your inbox but then deleted the document or journal instead of posting it, you can re-create the inbox entry and accept it again.  

## Get an overview of intercompany transactions for a period  

You can get an overview of all of the intercompany transactions that you have sent and received in a period. The **Intercompany Transactions** report lists all intercompany G/L entries, customer ledger entries, and vendor ledger entries.

> [!NOTE]  
> If the intercompany partners are in the same database, the partners can automatically accept transactions. The go directly to the **Handled Intercompany Inbox Transactions** and **Handled Intercompany Outbox Transactions** pages. To learn more about auto-accepting transactions, go to [Auto-accept transactions from intercompany partners](intercompany-how-setup.md#autoaccept-transactions-from-intercompany-partners).  
>
> * For the synchronization partner, on the **Intercompany Setup** page, turn on the **Auto. Send Transactions** toggle.
> * For partner companies, on the **Intercompany Partner** page, turn on the **Auto. Accept Transactions** toggle.  

## Import intercompany transactions from a file

[!INCLUDE [onprem_only_md](includes/onprem_only_md.md)]

If you have an intercompany partner that is not in the same database as your company, you can receive intercompany transactions from that partner in an .xml file. Then you must import the transactions into your inbox.  

1. Save the file to the location that you specified in the **Intercompany Inbox Details** field when you set up intercompany.  
2. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Intercompany Inbox Transactions**, and then choose the related link.
3. On the **Intercompany Inbox Transactions** page, choose the **Import Transaction File** action.  
4. on the page that appears, select the .xml file that contains the transactions, and then choose the **Open** button.  

The transactions are imported into the inbox and you can now process them.

## Process incoming intercompany transactions (using the inbox) 

When your intercompany partners send you intercompany transactions, the transactions end up in your intercompany inbox. You must evaluate each transaction in your inbox and act on it.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Intercompany Inbox Transactions**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Intercompany Inbox Transactions** page, select a line, and then choose an action, such as **Accept**, to process the line.
3. On the **Complete IC Inbox Action** page, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
4. Choose the **OK** button.  

For lines that you accept, document or journal lines are created in your company. Open each document or journal, make any necessary changes, and then post them.  

Lines that you reject and return to your partner go to your intercompany outbox, where you can send them to your partner.

For lines that a partner rejected and returned to you, you must post a correction to the original transaction that you posted in your company.

## To process outgoing intercompany transactions (using the outbox) 

When you post an intercompany journal or document, or send an intercompany order confirmation, the transactions go to your intercompany outbox. To send them to your intercompany partners, open the outbox and process them.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Intercompany Outbox Transactions**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Intercompany Outbox Transactions** page, select a line, and then choose an action, such as **Return to Inbox**, to process the line.

Use the **Send to Intercompany Partner** action to send lines to the relevant partner's inbox.

Use the **Return to Inbox** action to move lines to your inbox, where you can then accept them to create documents or journal lines in your company.  

If you use the **Cancel** action, you must post a correction to the transaction that you originally posted in your company.  

## Recreate intercompany inbox or outbox transactions  

You might want to re-create a transaction in the inbox or outbox. For example, if you accepted a transaction in your inbox but then deleted the document or journal instead of posting it, you can re-create the inbox entry and accept it again.  

The following procedure describes to re-create inbox transactions, but the same steps also apply to the outbox.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Handled IC Inbox Transactions**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Handled IC Inbox Transactions** page, select the line with the transaction that you want to re-create in the inbox, and then choose the **Re-create Inbox Transaction** action.

# Set Up Universal Print Printers

[!INCLUDE[azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id](~/../shared-content/shared/azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id.md)]

Universal Print is a Microsoft 365 subscription-based service that runs entirely on Microsoft Azure. It gives you centralized printer management through the Universal Print portal. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] makes printers set up in Universal Print available to client users through the **Universal Print Integration** extension.

![Universal Print setup.](media/Universal-Print-arch.png)

The complete setup requires you work in both Microsoft Azure, using the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), and in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The setup is divided between two main tasks as described in this article:

1. In Microsoft Azure, set up Universal Print and add the printers you want to use in Business Central to a print share. Go to [this section](#set-up-universal-print-and-printers-in-microsoft-azure).
2. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], add the printers from the print shares in Universal Print. Go to [this section](#add-printers-in-business-central-online) for online or [here](#add-printers-in-business-central-on-premises) for on-premises.

## Prerequisites

- Supported printers

  [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports the same printers as Universal Print, which can be either Universal Print–compatible or non-compatible printers. Non-compatible printers can't communicate with Universal Print directly, so they require extra connector software, which is provided by Universal Print. Some older printers may not be supported. 

- Universal Print:

  - A Universal Print subscription/license for your organization.

    Learn more at [License Universal Print](/universal-print/fundamentals/universal-print-license).

  - You have at least the [Printer Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#printer-administrator) role in Microsoft Entra ID.

    To manage Universal Print, your account must have at least the [Printer Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#printer-administrator) role in Microsoft Entra ID. These roles are only needed for managing Universal Print. They aren't required by people setting up and  the printers from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

- [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online and on-premises:

  - [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] 2021 release wave 1 or later.
  - **Universal Print Integration** extension is installed.

    This extension is published and installed by default as part of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online and on-premises. You can verify whether it's installed on the **Extension Management** page. Learn more at [Installing and Uninstalling Extensions in Business Central](ui-extensions-install-uninstall.md).
- [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises only:
  - Microsoft Entra ID or NavUserPassword authentication is configured.
    > [!NOTE]
    >  Universal Print extension doesn't support service-to-service (S2S) authentication. It requires a signed-in user to send print jobs to the Universal Print service through Graph API.
  - An application for Business Central is registered in your Microsoft Entra tenant and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

    Like other Azure services that work with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], Universal Print requires an app registration for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in Microsoft Entra ID. The app registration provides authentication and authorization services between [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and Universal Print.

    Your deployment may already use an app registration for other Azure services, like Power BI. If so, then use the existing app registration for Universal Print as well, instead of adding a new one. The only thing you'll need to do, in this case, is modify the app registration to include the relevant print permissions for Microsoft Graph API: **PrinterShare.ReadBasic.All**, **PrintJob.Create**, and **PrintJob.ReadBasic.** 

    To register an app and set the proper permissions, follow the steps described in [Register an application in Microsoft Entra ID](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/register-app-azure#register-an-application-in-azure-active-directory).

## Set up Universal Print and printers in Microsoft Azure

Before you can start managing Universal Print printers in Business Central, there are several tasks to get Universal Print up and running in Azure with the printers you want to use.

For detailed instructions on how to get set up, see [Get started: Set up Universal Print](/universal-print/fundamentals/universal-print-getting-started) in the Universal Print documentation. Here's an overview of the steps you'll need to complete. Most of these steps are done in the Azure portal.

1. Assign Universal Print licenses to yourself and other users.

    How you assign the license depends on whether you're integrating with Business Central online or on-premises.

    - With [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, you assign licenses using the Microsoft 365 admin center.

      Learn more at [Microsoft Admin Center Help - Assign licenses to users](/microsoft-365/admin/manage/assign-licenses-to-users).

    - With [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, you assign licenses in your tenant using the Azure portal.

      Learn more at [Assign or remove licenses in the Azure portal](/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/license-users-groups).

2. Install the Universal Print connector for registering printers that can't communicate with Universal Print directly.

    Most in-market printers can't communicate with Universal Print directly, so you'll need to install the Universal Print connector. Learn more at [Installing the Universal Print Connector](/universal-print/fundamentals/universal-print-connector-installation).

3. Register your printers in Universal Print.

    Registering a printer makes Universal Printer aware of the printer.

    - For printers that can communicate directly with Universal Print, follow the steps provided by the printer manufacturer.

    - For other printers, register the printers by using the Universal Print connector. 

      Learn more at [Printer registration](/universal-print/fundamentals/universal-print-connector-printer-registration).

4. Change printer properties (optional)

    After a printer is registered, you can view and modify printer properties, such as default preferences.

    Learn more at [Managing Printer Settings using the Universal Print Portal](/universal-print/reference/portal/printer-settings).

5. Share the printers with users.

    Any printer you want to use in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will need to be added to a *printer share* in Universal Print. Any user who needs access to the printer must be added as a member of the printer share. Learn more at [Share a Printer](/universal-print/reference/portal/share-printers).

    > [!TIP]
    > You can always add or remover users later. Learn more at [Configure user permssions for printer share](/universal-print/reference/portal/share-printers#configure-user-permissions-for-a-printer-share).

6. Enable document conversion.

    Universal Print renders content for print in XPS format. Some legacy in-market printers don't support XPS content rendering&mdashin many cases, only PDF format. Printing to these printers will fail unless Universal Print is set up to convert documents to the printer-supported format.

    Learn more at [Document conversion](/universal-print/reference/portal/settings#2-document-conversion).

Now, you're ready to add the printers to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], set up default printers for reports, and print.  

## Add printers in Business Central online

After printers are set up and shared in Universal Print, you're ready to add them to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] for use. There are two ways to add Universal Print printers. You can add the printers all at once or individually, one at a time.

Adding printers individually let's you set up the same Universal Print printer in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] more than once. Then, for each added printer, you can change the print settings, like paper tray, size, and orientation. This way, you can set up printers for different reports and documents with special output requirements.

> [!NOTE]
> Are you using [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises? If so, go to the [next section](#add-printers-in-business-central-on-premises), the first time setup is slightly different.  
<!-- To Do Adding printers individually lets you duplicate printers with custom , like different paper trays and paper size and orientation.  To add printers individually, you'll need to know printer's share name in Universal Print. -->

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Printer Management**, then select the related link.
2. Select **Universal Print**, then choose one of the following options:

   - **Add all Universal Print printers** to add all printers not already added. You can use this option even if there are already printers added.
   - **Add a Universal Print printer** to add a specific printer.  
3. Follow the on-screen instructions.

    - If you chose **Add all Universal Print printers**, then the **Add Universal Print Printers** setup starts. 

    - If you chose to **Add a Universal Print printer**, then the **Universal Printer Settings** page appears. Fill in the **Name** field, then select **...** next to the **Print Share in Universal Print** field to select the printer share that contains the Universal Print printer. Fill in the remaining fields as needed. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)].

After a printer has been added, you can view and change its settings from the **Printer Management** page. Just select the printer, then choose **Edit printer settings**.

## Add printers in Business Central on-premises

<!--With [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, unlike online, users aren't automatically authenticated with the registered app in Azure used for the Universal Print service. So, before any Business Central user (including admins) can add or even use Universal Print printers, they'll have to authenticate with the Azure app and grant access to the Universal Print service. The following procedure describes how to initiate this authentication flow. Each user typically only has to do this task once.-->

Before a user can add or use Universal Print printers Business Central, they have to authorize access to the Azure services used by Universal Print and grant it to permission to data and operations like:

- Signing in and reading user profile
- Reading basic print job information
- Creating print jobs

This is typically done the first time they connect to the Azure registered app used for Universal Print. In Business Central online does, this authorization flow is done seamlessly, with no user interaction. But Business Central on-premises operates differently. It requires that you, or any other user who wants to use Universal Print printers, initiate the authentication flow&mdash;usually, one time only. The most direct way is described in the following steps. A less direct way is by connecting to another integrated service that uses the same Azure registered app, like Power BI or OneDrive. Each user typically only has to do this task once.

> [!NOTE]
> If you're an admin, we recommend you complete this task before other users. Then afterwards, inform users who will need to use Universal Print printers how to do it. If the Azure registered app for Universal Print requires admin consent for API permissions, it's easier if you grant consent on behalf of the organization. You can grant admin consent from the Azure Portal or when you run the steps that follow. 

<!-- To Do Adding printers individually lets you duplicate printers with custom , like different paper trays and paper size and orientation.  To add printers individually, you'll need to know printer's share name in Universal Print. -->
### Connect to Universal Print for the first-time

Complete these steps to connect to the Universal Print service for the first-time.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Printer Management**, then select the related link.
2. Select **Universal Print** > **Add all Universal Print printers** to start the **Add Universal Print Printers** assisted setup guide (wizard).
3. Follow the on-screen instructions until you get to the **MICROSOFT ENTRA SERVICE PERMISSIONS** page.

    <!--The MICROSOFT ENTRA SERVICE PERMISSIONS page appears. You'll be prompted to give consent to Azure Services. You'll be lead through the process of verifying your Microsoft Entra ID setup, checking your Universal Print license, and then adding the printers.-->

   ![Shows the MICROSOFT ENTRA SERVICE PERMISSIONS page](media/azure-ad-services-permissions.png "Shows the MICROSOFT ENTRA SERVICE PERMISSIONS page")

4. Select the **Authorize Azure Services** link.

   1. If the **Permission Requested** page appears, read it carefully and select **Accept** to agree and continue. If you're running as an admin, you can select **Consent on behalf of organization** if you want to consent for all users.

      ![Shows the Azure request permissions page](media/azure-ad-permissions-requested.png "Azure request permissions page").

   2. If you're prompted, sign in using your name and password.

5. When authorization completes successfully, you're returned to the **Add Universal Print Printers** page. Select **Next** > **Finish** to complete the setup.

After a printer has been added, you can view and change its settings from the **Printer Management** page. Just select the printer, then choose **Edit printer settings**.

Once you complete the initial sign-in, you can use the Universal Print printers to print reports and other print jobs. For more information, go to [Printing a Report](ui-work-report.md#PrintReport). If you want to add, remove, or change any printers, just go back to the **Print Management** page and select **Universal Print**.

## Common problems and resolutions

In this section, you'll learn about the common problems that users may experience when trying to set up or use Universal Print printers.

### You don't have access to the printer \<your-printer\>.

If a user gets this message when trying to print a document to a Universal Print printer, it may be caused by one of the following conditions:

- The user doesn't have Universal Print licensed assigned to their Microsoft 365 or Azure Active AD account. 
- The user isn't assigned to the printer share in Universal Print.
- (On-premises) The Azure app registration used for Universal Print isn't working or has recently changed since the last time the user signed in.
- (On-premises) The user hasn't yet signed in to Azure registered app for Universal Printer app and consented for the first time.

## There was an error fetching printers shared to you.

If a user gets this message when trying to add a Universal Print printer from the **Printer Management** page, it's typically because they haven't yet signed in to Azure registered app for Universal Printer app and consented for the first time.

# Database Wait Statistics in [!INCLUDE[prod_long](includes/prod_long.md)]

The administrators and developers can have insights into the database performance by looking at **Database Wait Statistics** in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The information presented by **Database Wait Statistics** can help to check the kind of resources that are being used and the kind of delays that are being faced by the database processes. By analyzing these wait statistics, you can find the root cause of the slow performance by your database and can eventually make better decisions for the application performance.

For more information about the database wait statistics, see [Database Wait Statistics in Dynamics 365 Business Central](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/database-wait-statistics).

# Design Details: Rounding
Rounding residuals can occur when you value the cost of an inventory decrease that is measured in a different quantity than the corresponding inventory increase. Rounding residuals are calculated for all costing methods when you run the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job.  

 When you use the average costing method, the rounding residual is calculated and recorded on a cumulative, entry-by-entry basis.  

 When you use a costing method other than Average, the rounding residual is calculated when the inventory increase has been fully applied, that is when the remaining quantity for the inventory increase is equal to zero. A separate entry is then created for the rounding residual, and the posting date on this rounding entry is the posting date of the last invoiced value entry of the inventory increase.  

## Example  
 The following example illustrates how different rounding residuals are handled for the average costing method and non-Average costing method, respectively. In both cases, the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job has been run.  

 The following table shows the item ledger entries that the example is based on.  

|Posting Date|Quantity|Entry No.|  
|------------------|--------------|---------------|  
|01-01-20|3|1|  
|02-01-20|-1|2|  
|03-01-20|-1|3|  
|04-01-20|-1|4|  

 For an item using the Average costing method, the rounding residual (1/300) is calculated with the first decrease (entry number 2) and is carried forward to entry number 3. Therefore, entry number 3 is valued at –3.34.  

 The following table shows the resulting value entries.  

|Posting Date|Quantity|Cost Amount (Actual)|Item Ledger Entry No.|Entry No.|  
|------------------|--------------|----------------------------|---------------------------|---------------|  
|01-01-20|3|10|1|1|  
|02-01-20|-1|-3.33|2|2|  
|03-01-20|-1|-3.34|3|3|  
|04-01-20|-1|-3.33|4|4|  

 For an item using a costing method other than Average, the rounding residual (0.01) is calculated when the remaining quantity for the inventory increase is zero. The rounding residual has a separate entry (number 5).  

 The following table shows the resulting value entries.  

|Posting Date|Quantity|Cost Amount (Actual)|Item Ledger Entry No.|Entry No.|  
|------------------|--------------|----------------------------|---------------------------|---------------|  
|01-01-20|3|10|1|1|  
|02-01-20|-1|-3.33|2|2|  
|03-01-20|-1|-3.33|3|3|  
|04-01-20|-1|-3.33|4|4|

# Manage Budgets for Fixed Assets

You can set up budgeted fixed assets. For example, this lets you include anticipated acquisitions and sales in reports.  

To prepare your budgeted income statement, budgeted balance sheet, and cash budget, you need information about future investments, disposals and depreciation of fixed assets. You can get this information from the **Fixed Asset - Projected Value** report. Before you print this report, you must prepare the budget.  

## To budget the acquisition cost of a fixed asset

To prepare a budget, you have to set up fixed asset cards for fixed assets that you intend to buy in the future. The budget fixed assets are set up as ordinary fixed assets, but it must be set up to not post to the general ledger.

When you post the acquisition cost, you enter the number of the budgeted fixed asset in the **Budgeted FA No.** field. This will post an acquisition cost with an opposite sign for the budgeted asset. This means that the total acquisition cost on the budgeted asset is the difference between the budgeted and the actual acquisition cost.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Fixed Assets**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action to create a new fixed asset card for the budgeted fixed asset.
3. Select the **Budgeted Asset** check box to prevent posting to the general ledger.
4. Fill in the remaining fields, assign a depreciation book, and then post the first acquisition cost with the budgeted fixed asset entered in the **Budgeted FA No.** field on the journal line. For more information, see [Acquire Fixed Assets](fa-how-acquire.md).

## To budget the disposal of a fixed asset

If you plan to sell assets within the budget period, you can enter information about sales price and sales date.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Fixed Assets**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the fixed asset to be disposed of, and then choose the **Depreciation Books** action.
3. On the **FA Depreciation Books** page, fill in the **Projected Disposal Date** and **Projected Proceeds on Disposal** fields. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

## To view projected disposal values

To see the projected disposal values and have the gain and loss calculated, you can use the **FA Projected Value** report.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **FA Projected Value**, and then choose the related link.
2. Fill in the fields as necessary.
3. Choose the **Print** or **Preview** button.

## To budget depreciation

You can use the **Fixed Asset - Projected Value** report to calculate future depreciation. The report shows the book value and accumulated depreciation at the start of the selected period, changes during the period, and the book value and accumulated depreciation at the end of the selected period.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Fixed Asset Projected Value**, and then choose the related link.
2. Fill in the fields as necessary.
3. To see total values for all assets, clear the **Print per Fixed Asset** check box.
4. Leave the **Fixed Asset** FastTab blank to have all assets included. In the **Budgeted Asset** field, enter **No** to exclude budgeted assets or **Yes** to see budgeted assets only.
5. Choose the **Print** or **Preview** button.

# Delivery date calculation for sales

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically calculates the earliest possible date that an item on a sales order line can be shipped.

* If the customer has requested a specific delivery date, then the date on which the items must be available to pick to meet that delivery date is calculated.
* If the customer doesn't request a specific delivery date, then the date on which the items can be delivered is calculated. The calculation starts from the date on which the items are available for picking.

## Calculating a requested delivery date

If you specify a requested delivery date on the sales order line, that date becomes the starting point for the following calculations.

- *requested delivery date - shipping time = planned shipment date*
- *planned shipment date - outbound whse. handling time = shipment date*

If the items are available to pick on the shipment date, then the sales process can continue. Otherwise, a stock-out warning is displayed.

> [!NOTE]
> If your process is based on backward calculation, for example, if you use the requested delivery date to get the planned shipment date, we recommend you use date formulas with fixed durations, such as "5D" for five days or "1W" for one week. Date formulas without fixed durations, such as "CW" for current week or CM for current month, can result in incorrect date calculations. Learn more about date formulas at [Work with Calendar Dates and Times](ui-enter-date-ranges.md).

## Calculating the earliest possible delivery date

If you don't specify a requested delivery date on the sales order line, or if the requested delivery date can't be met, then the earliest date on which the items are available is calculated. That date is then entered in the **Shipment Date** field on the line, and the date on which you plan to ship the items and the date on which they'll be delivered to the customer are calculated using the following formulas.

- *shipment date + outbound whse. handling time = planned shipment date*
- *planned shipment date + shipping time = planned delivery date*

# FAQ for suggest item substitutions with Copilot

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]

These frequently asked questions (FAQ) describe the AI impact of the sales line suggestions feature in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/production-ready-preview-dynamics365.md)]

## What is suggest item substitutions with Copilot?

In a business landscape that changes fast, companies often need to evolve the portfolio of products they sell. Whether it's adding new products, changing existing products, or adding entire product lines and categories, it's often time consuming to create and manage product (item) information.  

Reusing information from similar items can be a good option and Copilot can help you to identify similar items. An extra benefit is that suggest item substitution also reduces the risk of creating duplicated entries on the Items list page.

## What are the capabilities of suggest item substitutions with Copilot?

* Substitutions

You can store similar or interchangeable products on the **Item Substitution Entry** page. Copilot helps to add this information for current products by searching for similar ones in the database.

## What is the intended use of suggest item substitutions with Copilot?

* Substitutions

Intended to suggest item substitutions based on the description of the current item.  

Because the average number of items (products/services) for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] customers is 10.000, finding the right ones might be tough without prior experience or knowledge. The way [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] stores data doesn’t make things easier because you need to do multiple search or filtering exercises on the different pages that store product data.

To assist you in finding items, Copilot extracts keywords, other search terms, and synonyms from the product (item) description, and uses embeddings to find similar items in the database.

## How was suggest item substitutions with Copilot evaluated? What metrics are used to measure performance?

The feature underwent extensive testing with numerous prompts in US English representing both typical use and use by bad actors. Testing was based on [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] demonstration data and a large labeled product catalog available as open source.

This feature is built in accordance with Microsoft's Responsible AI Standard. [Learn more about responsible AI from Microsoft](https://aka.ms/RAI).

## What are the limitations of suggest item substitutions with Copilot? How can users minimize the impact of the suggest item substitutions with Copilot limitations when using the system? 

Find products works best in the English language. While you can use this feature in any of the languages that [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports, item searches in other languages might be less accurate.

If your industry or domain overlaps with what Microsoft considers sensitive topics (such as drugs, violence, adult entertainment, and so on) Copilot might defer to neutral, curated responses, or give inaccurate responses.

Suggest item substitutions only fills in the **Substitute Type**, **Substitute No.**, and **Description** fields. The **Variant Code** field isn't currently supported. If you can ship a product in two different colors, for example, Copilot finds the needed product but leaves the **Variant Code** field empty. You need to fill in the field manually.  

Catalog items aren't currently supported.

The maximum number of results is currently limited to 10.

How you name your products can affect the output. For example, using cryptic abbreviations versus friendly names can reduce output quality.

For products, the following table lists the tables and fields that Copilot searches.

|Table  |Fields  |
|---------|---------|
|Items     | * No.<br>* Description<br>* Description 2<br>* Search Description<br>* GTIN<br>* Vendor Item Number        |
|Item Variants    |* Code<br>* Description<br>* Description 2<br>         |
|Item Reference     |* Reference No.<br>* Description<br>* Description 2         |
|Item Attributes     |* Name<br>* Value         |
|Item Category     |* Code<br>* Description<br>* Parent Category - 1 level         |
|Item Translation     |* Language<br>* Description<br>* Description 2         |
|Item Identifier     |* Code         |
|Extend Text Line     |* Text         |

## In which geographies and languages is Suggest item substitutions available?

* Available geographies

This Copilot feature is available in all supported [Business Central countries/regions](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/compliance/apptest-countries-and-translations). However, for customer environments located in countries/regions where Azure OpenAI Service isn't deployed, administrators must first consent to allowing their data to move across boundaries for Business Central to connect to Azure OpenAI service. Learn more at [Copilot data movement across geographies](ai-copilot-data-movement.md).

* Available languages

[!INCLUDE [copilot-language-support-en-only](includes/copilot-language-support-en-only.md)]

## What operational factors and settings allow for effective and responsible use of the feature?

AI-powered suggestions might sometimes be incorrect or incomplete. You should always review the accuracy of Copilot's suggestions before you choose whether to keep them. Copilot’s suggestions aren't saved to the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] database until you choose the **Keep it** button and exit the Copilot window. You can edit and correct any suggestions before you choose to keep it, or after they're inserted in item substitution page.

## What is expected of administrators and end-users when using Suggest item substitutions?

Each individual user chooses whether or not to use suggest item substitutions. Even when the feature is enabled by administrators and available, you can choose to use it always, sometimes, or never.

Administrators make the overall decision on whether to use Copilot capabilities in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. If administrators enable Copilot, they should be sure to grant access to the appropriate users.

> [!NOTE]
> * We don't support this feature in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises or private cloud.
> * Partner's can't extend this feature. That means partner developers can't modify, replace, or extend it.

## Is Copilot the only means to create item substitution entries? 

No, use of Copilot is optional. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers non-AI-powered ways to insert item substitution entries. Organizations can use both approaches at the same time.

## How do I give feedback about AI-generated content?

Each time Copilot provides suggestions, you can provide feedback to Microsoft directly from the Copilot window, using the Like and Dislike buttons. Your feedback remains anonymous and we use this data to improve the quality of the service.

The **Month-to-Date (MTD)** report is a must-have report for executives and managers. The report helps them monitor the progress of their sales revenue for the current month. This report provides a detailed overview of the total revenue generated from sales activities from the start of the month up until the current date.

> [!NOTE]
> The month to date (MTD) figure doesn't include revenue generated on the current date because sales activities might still be ongoing.

# Design Details: Transfers in Planning

Transfer orders are also a source of supply when working at the SKU level. When using multiple locations (warehouses), the SKU replenishment system can be set to Transfer, implying that the location is replenished by transferring goods from another location. In a situation with more warehouses, you might have a chain of transfers. Supply to GREEN location is transferred from YELLOW, supply to YELLOW is transferred from RED, and so on. In the beginning of the chain, there's a replenishment system of **Prod. Order** or **Purchase**.  

![Example of transfer flow.](media/nav_app_supply_planning_7_transfers1.png "Example of transfer flow")  

> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE [locations-cronus](includes/locations-cronus.md)]

If you compare the following situations, it's clear that the planning task in the latter can become complex:

* A supply order is directly facing a demand order
* A sales order is supplied through a chain of SKU transfers

If demand changes, it might cause a ripple effect through the chain. All transfer orders, plus the purchase and production order in the opposite end of the chain, will have to be updated to re-balance demand and supply.  

![Example of supply/demand balance in transfers.](media/nav_app_supply_planning_7_transfers2.png "Example of supply/demand balance in transfers")  

## Why is a transfer a special case?  

Transfer orders are similar to other orders, such as purchase and production orders. However, behind the scene they're different.  

One difference is that a transfer line represents both demand and supply. The outbound part that's shipped is demand. The inbound part that's received at the new location is supply at that location.  

![Content of the Transfer Order page.](media/nav_app_supply_planning_7_transfers3.png "Content of the Transfer Order page")  

When [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] changes the supply side of the transfer, it must make a similar change on the demand side.  

## Transfers are dependent demand  

The demand and supply relationship is similar to components on production order lines. The difference is that components on production order lines are on the next planning level, and have a different item. The two parts of the transfer are on the same level for the same item.  

An important similarity is that components and transfers are dependent demand. Demand from a transfer line is dictated by the supply side of the transfer. If the supply changes, the demand is directly affected.

Unless the planning flexibility is None, a transfer line shouldn't be treated as independent demand in planning.  

In the planning procedure, the transfer demand should only be taken into account after the planning system has processed the supply side. Before that processing happens, the actual demand isn't known. The sequence of changes is important for transfer orders.  

## Planning sequence  

The following image shows an example of a string of transfers.  

![Example of simple transfer flow.](media/nav_app_supply_planning_7_transfers4.png "Example of simple transfer flow")  

In this example, a customer orders the item at location GREEN. Location GREEN is supplied through transfer from the central warehouse RED. The central warehouse RED is supplied by transfer from production on location BLUE.  

In this example, the planning system starts at the customer demand and works its way back through the chain. The demands and supplies are processed for one location at a time.  

![Supply planning with transfers.](media/nav_app_supply_planning_7_transfers5.png "Supply planning with transfers")  

## Transfer level code  

The transfer level code of the SKU determines the sequence in which the planning system processes locations.  

The transfer level code is an internal field. The field is calculated and stored on the SKU when you create or modify the SKU. The calculation runs across all SKUs for a given combination of item and item variant. The calculation uses the location code and the transfer-from code to determine the route to use for the SKUs. The calculation ensures that all demands are processed.  

The transfer level code will be 0 for SKUs with Purchase or Prod. Order replenishment system, and will be -1 for the first transfer level, -2 for the second, and so on. In the example described in the previous section, the levels would be -1 for RED and -2 for GREEN, as shown in the following illustration.  

![Content of SKU Card page.](media/nav_app_supply_planning_7_transfers6.gif "Content of SKU Card page")  

When updating a SKU, the planning system detects whether replenishment systems for SKUs have circular references.  

## Planning transfers without SKU  

For less advanced warehouse setups, you can use locations and make manual transfers between locations, even if you don't use SKUs. For example, the transfer might cover a sales order at that location. The planning system reacts to changes in the demand.  

For manual transfers, the planning system analyzes transfer orders and then plans the order in which to process the locations. Internally, the planning system uses temporary SKUs that have transfer level codes.  

![Transfer level code.](media/nav_app_supply_planning_7_transfers7.png "Transfer level code")  

If there are several transfers to a location, the first transfer order defines the planning direction. Transfers in the opposite direction are canceled.  

## Changing quantity with reservations  

When changing quantities on a supply, the planning system takes reservations into account. The reserved quantity represents the lower limit for how much to reduce the supply.  

When you change the quantity on a transfer order line, keep the lower limit in mind. The lower limit is the highest reserved quantity of the outbound and inbound transfer lines.

For example, a transfer order line of 117 pieces is reserved for the following lines:

* A sales line of 46
* A purchase line of 24

Even though the inbound side might have excess supply, you can't reduce the transfer line below 46.  

![Reservations in transfer planning.](media/nav_app_supply_planning_7_transfers8.png "Reservations in transfer planning")  

## Changing quantity in a transfer chain  

Here's an example of what happens when you change a quantity in a transfer change.

The starting point is a balanced situation with a transfer chain supplying a sales order of 27 at location RED. There's a corresponding purchase order at location BLUE. Both transfers go through location PINK. There are two transfer orders, BLUE-PINK and PINK-RED.  

![Changing the quantity in transfer planning 1.](media/nav_app_supply_planning_7_transfers9.png "Changing the quantity in transfer planning 1")  

Now, the planner at the PINK location chooses to reserve for the purchase.  

![Changing the quantity in transfer planning 2.](media/nav_app_supply_planning_7_transfers10.png "Changing the quantity in transfer planning 2")  

The reservation usually means that the planning system ignores the purchase order and transfer demand. There isn't a problem long as there's balance. But what happens when the RED location changes the order from 27 to 22?  

![Changing the quantity in transfer planning 3.](media/nav_app_supply_planning_7_transfers11.png "Changing the quantity in transfer planning 3")  

When the planning system runs again, it should get rid of excess supply. However, the reservation locks the purchase and the transfer to a quantity of 27.  

![Changing the quantity in transfer planning 4.](media/nav_app_supply_planning_7_transfers12.png "Changing the quantity in transfer planning 4")  

The PINK-RED transfer has been reduced to 22. The inbound part of the BLUE-PINK transfer isn't reserved, but the outbound part is. The reservation means that you can't reduce the quantity below 27.  

## Lead time calculation  

When calculating the due date of a transfer order, different kinds of lead time are taken into account.  

The following lead times are active when planning a transfer order:  

* Outbound warehouse handling time  
* Shipping time  
* Inbound warehouse handling time  

On the planning line, the following fields are used to provide information about the calculation:  

* Transfer shipment date  
* Starting date  
* Ending date  
* Due date  

The shipment date of the transfer line is shown in the **Transfer Shipment Date** field. The receipt date of the transfer line is shown in the **Due Date** field.  

The starting and ending dates describe the actual transportation period.  

The following image shows the interpretation of the starting date-time and ending date-time on planning lines for transfer orders.  

![Central date-times in transfer planning.](media/nav_app_supply_planning_7_transfers13.png "Central date-times in transfer planning")  

The example shows the following calculations:  

* Shipment date + Outbound handling = Starting Date  
* Starting Date + Shipping time = Ending Date  
* Ending Date + Inbound Handling = Receipt Date  

## Safety lead time  

The **Default Safety Lead Time** field on the **Manufacturing Setup** page and the related **Safety Lead Time** field on the **Item Card** page aren't included in transfer order calculations. However, the safety lead time does influence the total plan. The safety lead time affects the replenishment order (purchase or production) at the beginning of the transfer chain. That's the point where the items were put in the location from which they'll be transferred.  

![Elements of the transfer due date.](media/nav_app_supply_planning_7_transfers14.png "Elements of the transfer due date")  

On the production order line, the Ending Date + Safety Lead Time + Inbound Warehouse Handling Time = Due Date.  

On the purchase order line, the Planned Receipt Date + Safety Lead Time + Inbound Warehouse Handling Time = Expected Receipt Date.  

## Reschedule  

When you reschedule a transfer line, the planning system finds the outbound part and changes the date-time.

> [!NOTE]
> If a lead time is defined, there'll be a gap between the shipment and the receipt. The lead time can consist of more elements, such as transportation time and warehouse handling time. On a time line, the planning system moves back in time while it balances the elements.  

![Changing the due date in transfer planning.](media/nav_app_supply_planning_7_transfers15.png "Changing the due date in transfer planning")  

When you change the due date on a transfer line, the lead time must be calculated to update the outbound side of the transfer.  

## Serial and lot numbers in transfer chains  

If the demand uses serial or lot numbers, and you run the planning engine, it will create transfer orders. For more information about this concept, see Item Attributes. However, if serial or lot numbers are removed from the demand, the transfer orders still use the serial or lot numbers and planning will ignore them (not deleted).  

## Order-to-order links  

In this example, the BLUE SKU is set up with an **Order** reordering policy. The PINK and RED SKUs have the **Lot-for-Lot** reordering policy. Creating a sales order for 27 at location RED leads to a chain of transfers. The last transfer is at location BLUE, and it's reserved with binding. In this example, the reservations aren't hard reservations created by the planner at PINK location. The planning system creates the bindings. The important difference is that the planning system can change the latter.  

![Order-to-order links in transfer planning.](media/nav_app_supply_planning_7_transfers16.png "Order-to-order links in transfer planning")  

If the demand is changed from 27 to 22, the planning system will lower the quantity through the chain. The binding reservation is also reduced.

# Register new customers

Customers are your source of income. You must register each customer you sell to as a customer card. Customer cards contain the information required to sell products to the customer. Learn more at [Invoice Sales](sales-how-invoice-sales.md) and [Register New Items](inventory-how-register-new-items.md).  

Before you can register new customers, you must set up various sales codes to choose from when you fill in customer cards. Learn more at [Setting Up Sales](sales-setup-sales.md).

> [!VIDEO https://learn-video.azurefd.net/vod/player?id=37d3ec2a-71c2-4f0d-9a94-62c83805fbfa]

## Add new customers

You can add new customers manually by filling out the **Customer Card** page, or you can use templates that contain predefined information. For example, you can create a template for different types of customer profiles. Using templates saves time when adding new customers, and helps ensure the information is correct each time. 

If you create:
* Multiple templates for use with more than one type of customer, you can choose the suitable template when you add a customer.
* Only one template is used for all new customers. 

After you create a template, you can use the **Apply Template** action to apply it to one or more selected customers. To create a template, fill in the information to be reused on the **Customer Card** page, then save it as a template. Learn more in the [To save the customer card as a template](sales-how-register-new-customers.md#to-save-the-customer-card-as-a-template) section.

> [!TIP]
> It can be helpful to personalize the **Customer Template** page when you create a template. For example, you might want to add the **Credit Limit** field to a template. Learn more in the [Personalize your workspace](/dynamics365/business-central/ui-personalization-user#start-personalizing-by-using-the-personalization-mode) section.

You can also create a customer from a contact. Learn more in the [To create a customer, vendor, employee, or bank account from a contact](marketing-create-contact-companies.md#to-create-a-customer-vendor-employee-or-bank-account-from-a-contact) section.  

### To create a new customer card

[!INCLUDE[create_new_customer](includes/create_new_customer.md)]

The **Prices & Discounts** action provides options for managing special prices or discounts for a customer when an order meets certain criteria. When purchasing a certain item, ordering a minimum quantity, or buying before a date, such as when a campaign ends, are examples of such criteria. Learn more at [Record Sales Price, Discount, and Payment Agreements](sales-how-record-sales-price-discount-payment-agreements.md).

The customer is now registered, and the customer card is ready to be used on sales documents.  

### To save the customer card as a template

You can use a customer card as a template when you create new customer cards.

1. On the **Customer Card** page, choose the **Save as Template** action. The **Customer Template** page opens showing the customer card as a template.
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
3. To reuse dimensions in templates, choose the **Dimensions** action. The **Dimension Templates** page opens showing any dimension codes set up for the customer.
4. Edit or enter dimension codes you want to apply to new customer cards created with this template.  
5. When you complete the new customer template, choose **OK**.

The customer template is added to the list of customer templates, and you can use it to create new customer cards.

## Delete customer cards

If you post a transaction for a customer, you can't delete the customer card because the ledger entries might be needed for auditing. To delete customer cards with ledger entries, contact your Microsoft partner to do so through code.  

## Manage credit limits

Credit limits, balance amounts, and payment terms make it possible for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to issue a credit and an overdue balance warning when you enter a sales order. Furthermore, reminder term and finance charge term elements enable you to invoice interest and/or extra fees.  

The **Credit Limit** field on a customer card specifies the maximum amount you allow the customer to exceed the payment balance before warnings are issued. When you enter information in journals, quotes, orders, and invoices, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] tests both the sales header and individual sales lines to determine if the credit limit is exceeded.

You can post even if the credit limit exceeds. A blank field means there's no credit limit for this customer.  

You can choose not to receive warnings when the customer's credit limit is exceeded, and you can specify which types of warnings you want to see.

### To specify credit limit warnings

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales & Receivables Setup**, then choose the related link.

2. On the **General** FastTab, in the **Credit Warnings** field, choose the relevant option as described in the following table:

    |Option| Description|
    |------|------------|
    |**Both Warnings**| Both the **Credit Limit** and the **Balance Due** fields on the customer's card are checked, and a warning is shown if the customer exceeds its credit limit or has an overdue balance.|
    |**Credit Limit**|The value in the **Credit Limit** field on the customer's card is compared with the customer's balance, and a warning is shown if the customer's balance exceeds this amount.|
    |**Overdue Balance**|The **Balance Due** field on the customer's card is checked, and a warning is shown if the customer has an overdue balance.|
    |**No Warning**|No credit warnings are shown regarding the customer's status.|

## Assign a salesperson

You can assign salespeople to customer ship-to address rather than their billing address so your sales reports reflect the true geographical distribution of your sales. Assigning a salesperson to a customer's ship-to address gives you more precise insights and optimizes resource allocation.

Assign a salesperson on the **Customer** card page by choosing **Customer**, and then **Ship-To Addresses** to open the **Ship-to Addresses List** page. Choose **Manage**, and then **Edit** to open the **Ship-to Address** card page. Enter or choose a **Salesperson Code** to select the salesperson.

When you choose the **Alternate Shipping Address** option as a **Ship-To** location on a sales document, the **Salesperson Code** updates to match the salesperson from the **Ship-to** rather than the **Bill-to** address.

# Post Multiple Documents at the Same Time

Instead of posting individual documents one by one, you can select multiple non-posted documents in a list for immediate posting or for batch posting according to a schedule, such as at the end of the day. This may be useful if only a supervisor can post documents created by other users or to avoid system performance issues from posting during work hours.

## To post multiple purchase orders immediately

The following procedure explains how to post multiple purchase orders immediately. The steps are similar for all purchase and sales documents.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Orders**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Purchase Orders** page, proceed to select all orders to be posted:
3. In the **No.** field, choose the three vertical dots to open the context menu, and then choose the **Select More** action.
4. Select the check box for all the lines representing orders that you want to post at the same time.
5. Choose the **Posting** action, and then choose the **Post** action.
6. Choose the **Yes** button on the confirmation message.

## To batch post multiple purchase orders

The following procedure explains how to batch post purchase orders. The steps are similar for all purchase and sales documents where the **Batch Post** action is available.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Purchase Orders** page, proceed to select all orders to be posted:
3. In the **No.** field, choose the three vertical dots to open the context menu, and then choose the **Select More** action.
4. Select the check box for all the lines representing orders that you want to post at the same time.
5. Choose the **Posting** action, and then choose the **Post Batch** action.
6. On the **Batch Post Purchase Order** page, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
7. Choose the **OK** button.
8. To view potential issues that occurred during batch posting of documents, open the **Error Message Register** page.

> [!NOTE]
> Posting of multiple documents might take some time and block other users. Consider enabling background posting. For more information, see [Use Job Queues to Schedule Tasks](admin-job-queues-schedule-tasks.md).

## To set up background posting with job queues
Job queues are an effective tool to schedule the running of business processes in the background, such as when multiple users are trying to post sales orders, but only one order can be processed at a time.  

The following procedure explains how to set up background posting of sales orders. The steps are similar for purchasing.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales & Receivables Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page, choose the **Post with Job Queue** check box.
3. Choose the **Job Queue Category Code** field, and then specify the **SALESPOST** code.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Some jobs change the same data and should not run at the same time because that can cause conflicts. For example, background jobs for sales documents will try to modify the same data at the same time. Job queue categories help prevent these kinds of conflicts by ensuring that when one job is running, another job that belongs to the same job queue category will not run until it finishes. For example, a job that belongs to a Sales job queue category will wait until all other sales related jobs are done. You specify a job queue category on the **Background Posting** FastTab on the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page.
    >
    > [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides job queue categories for sales, purchase, and general ledger posting. We recommend that one of these, or one that you create, is always specified. If you experience failures due to conflicts, consider setting up a category for all sales, purchase, and general ledger background posting.

    If you also want sales documents to be printed when they are posted, select the **Post & Print with Job Queue** check box on the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page.  
    If you select **PDF** in the **Report Output Type** field, successfully posted purchase orders will be available in the **Report Inbox** part on your Role Center.

    > [!IMPORTANT]  
    > If you set up a job that will post and print documents, and the printer displays a dialog box, such as a request for credentials or a warning about low printer ink, your document is posted but not printed. The corresponding job queue entry eventually times out and the **Status** field is set to **Error**. Accordingly, we recommend that you do not use a printer setup that requires interaction with the display of printer dialog boxes in conjunction with background posting.

    Next time that you post sales documents, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically creates a job queue entry for each document and run the jobs in the background, one by one.

4. To verify that the job queue is working as expected, post a sales order. For more information, see [Sell Products](sales-how-sell-products.md).
    The sales order will now be added to a dedicated job queue entry, which defines when the documents are posted. 

### To view status from a sales or purchase document
If the job queue cannot post the sales order, the status is changed to **Error** and the sales order is added to the list of sales orders that the user must handle manually.
1. From the document that you have tried to post with background posting, choose the **Job Queue Status** field, which will contain **Error**.
2. Review the error message and fix the problem.

Alternatively, you can review on the **Job Queue Log Entries** page if the sales order was posted successfully. For more information, see the [Monitor the job queue](#monitor-the-job-queue) section.

## To create a job queue entry for batch posting of sales orders

Alternatively, you can postpone postings for when it is convenient for your organization. For example, in your business it might make sense to run certain routines when most of the data entry for the day has concluded. You can achieve this by setting the job queue up to run various batch-posting reports, such as the **Batch Post Sales Orders**, **Batch Post Sales Invoices**, and similar reports. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports background posting for all sales, purchasing, and service documents.

The following procedure shows how to set the **Batch Post Sales Orders** report up to automatically post sales orders at 4 PM on weekdays.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Job Queue Entries**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. In the **Object Type to Run** field, select **Report**.  
4. In the **Object ID to Run** field, select 296, **Batch Post Sales Orders**.

   You can also use following reports:
  
   * 900 **Batch Post Assembly Orders**
   * 497 **Batch Post Purchase Invoices**
   * 496 **Batch Post Purchase Orders**
   * 498 **Batch Post Purch. Credit Memos**
   * 6665 **Batch Post Purch. Ret. Orders**
   * 298 **Batch Post Sales Credit Memos**
   * 297 **Batch Post Sales Invoices**
   * 296 **Batch Post Sales Orders**
   * 6655 **Batch Post Sales Return Orders**
   * 6005 **Batch Post Service Cr. Memos**
   * 6004 **Batch Post Service Invoices**
   * 6001 **Batch Post Service Orders**

5. Select the **Report Request Page** check box.
6. In the **Batch Post Sales Orders** request page, define what is included during automatic posting of sales orders, and then choose the **OK** button.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Remember to set strict filters; otherwise, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will post all documents, even if they are not ready. Consider setting a filter on the **Status** field for the value *Released*, and a filter on the **Posting Date** field for the value *..today*. For more information, see [Sorting, Searching, and Filtering](ui-enter-criteria-filters.md).
7. Select all check boxes from **Run on Mondays** through **Run on Fridays**.
8. In the **Starting Time** field, enter 4 PM.
9. Choose the **Set Status to Ready** action.

Sales orders that are within defined filters will now be posted every weekday at 4 PM.

## Monitor the job queue

If you set up background posting with job queues, make it a regular task to monitor the job queue to catch any issues. You can track the status in the **Job Queue Entries** page. For more information, see [Use Job Queues to Schedule Tasks](admin-job-queues-schedule-tasks.md).  

As an administrator, you can use [Application Insights](/azure/azure-monitor/app/app-insights-overview) to gather and analyze telemetry that you can use to identify problems. For more information, see [Monitoring and Analyzing Telemetry](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/telemetry-overview) in the developer and administration content.

# Create Blanket Assembly Orders

You can use assembly management to customize an assembly item to a customer's request during the sales process. For more information, see [Sell Items Assembled to Order](assembly-how-to-sell-items-assembled-to-order.md).  

 As with any other type of item, you can also create blanket sales orders for customized assembly items before periodically making the actual sales orders according to the blanket order agreement. This process involves several extra steps when you compare it to creating a regular blanket sales order, and it uses a variation of a linked assembly order, which is a blanket assembly order.

> [!NOTE]  
>  Like all blanket orders, quantities on assembly blanket orders are only forecasts and are not operational until they are converted to actual assembly orders. Therefore, order functionality, such as availability calculation, reservation, and item tracking, is not active on blanket assembly orders.  

## To create a blanket assembly order for an assemble\-to\-order item  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Blanket Sales Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Create a new blanket sales order with one line for an assembly item. For more information, see [Create Blanket Sales Orders](sales-how-to-create-blanket-sales-orders.md).  
3. In the **Qty. to Assemble to Order** field on the blanket assembly order line, enter the full quantity.

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  You should not create blanket order agreements for a partial quantity. Therefore, you must enter the same quantity that you entered in the **Quantity** field on the blanket sales order line.  

4. Choose the **Assemble to Order** action, and then choose the **Assemble-to-Order Lines** action. Alternatively, choose the **Qty. to Assemble to Order)** field on the line.  
5. On the **Assemble-to-Order Lines** page, review or modify the assembly order lines according to the blanket order agreement that you have made with the customer. If you want to view more information, choose the **Show Document** action to open the complete blanket assembly order. You cannot change the contents of most fields, and you cannot post.  
6. When you have adjusted the assembly order lines according to the blanket order agreement, close the **Assemble-to-Order Lines** page to return to the **Blanket Sales Order** page.  
7. When the customer requests to create a sales order based on the agreed blanket sales order, create a sales order for the agreed assembly item or items. For more information, see [Create Blanket Sales Orders](sales-how-to-create-blanket-sales-orders.md).

The linked blanket assembly order and any customizations are linked to that new sales order to prepare for assembly of the item or items to be sold.

# Design Details: Production Order Posting
Similar to assembly order posting, the consumed components and the used machine time are converted and output as the produced item when the production order is finished. For more information, see [Design Details: Assembly Order Posting](design-details-assembly-order-posting.md). However, the cost flow for assembly orders is less complex, especially because assembly cost posting only occurs once and therefore does not generate work-in-process inventory.


Transactions that occur during the manufacturing process can be tracked through the following stages:  

1.  Purchase of materials and other manufacturing inputs.  
2.  Conversion into work in process.  
3.  Conversion into finished goods inventory.  
4.  Sale of finished goods.  

Therefore, apart from regular inventory accounts, a manufacturing company must establish three separate inventory accounts to record transactions at various stages of production.  

|Inventory Account|Description|  
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------|  
|**Raw Materials account**|Includes the cost of raw materials that are purchased but not yet transferred to production. The balance in the Raw Materials account indicates the cost of raw materials on hand.<br /><br /> When raw materials move into the production department, the cost of the materials is transferred from the Raw Materials account to the WIP account.|  
|**Work in Process (WIP) account**|Accumulates the costs that are incurred during production in the accounting period. The WIP account is debited for the cost of raw materials that are transferred from the raw materials warehouse, the cost of direct labor performed, and the manufacturing overhead costs that are incurred.<br /><br /> The WIP account is credited for the total manufacturing cost of units that are completed in the factory and transferred to the finished goods warehouse.|  
|**Finished Goods account**|This account includes the total manufacturing cost of units that are completed but not yet sold. At the time of sale, the cost of units sold is transferred from the Finished Goods account to the Cost of Goods Sold account.|  

The inventory value is calculated by tracking the costs of all increases and decreases, as expressed by the following equation:  

* inventory value = beginning balance of inventory + value of all increases - value of all decreases  

Depending on the type of inventory, increases and decreases are represented by different transactions.  

||Increases|Decreases|  
|-|---------------|---------------|  
|**Raw material inventory**|-   Net purchases of material<br />-   Output of subassemblies<br />-   Negative consumption|Material consumption|  
|**WIP inventory**|-   Material consumption<br />-   Capacity consumption<br />-   Manufacturing overhead|Output of end items (cost of goods manufactured)|  
|**Finished goods inventory**|Output of end items (cost of goods manufactured)|-   Sales (cost of goods sold)<br />-   Negative output|  
|**Raw material inventory**|-   Net purchases of material<br />-   Output of subassemblies<br />-   Negative consumption|Material consumption|  

The values of increases and decreases are recorded in the different types of manufactured inventory in the same way as for purchased inventory. Every time a transaction of inventory increase or decrease takes place, an item ledger entry and a corresponding general ledger entry are created for the amount. For more information, see [Design Details: Inventory Posting](design-details-inventory-posting.md).  

Although values of transactions that are related to purchased goods are posted only as item ledger entries with related value entries, transactions that are related to produced items are posted as capacity ledger entries with related value entries, in addition to the item ledger entries.  

## Posting Structure  
Posting production orders to WIP inventory involves output, consumption, and capacity.  

The following diagram shows the involved posting routines in codeunit 22.  

![Production order posting routines.](media/design_details_inventory_costing_14_production_posting_1.png "Production order posting routines")  

The following diagram shows the associations between the resulting entries and the cost objects.  

![Production entry flow.](media/design_details_inventory_costing_14_production_posting_2.png "Production entry flow")  

The capacity ledger entry describes the capacity consumption in terms of time units, whereas the related value entry describes the value of the specific capacity consumption.  

The item ledger entry describes the material consumption or output in terms of quantities, whereas the related value entry describes the value of this specific material consumption or output.  

A value entry that describes WIP inventory value can be associated with one of the following combinations of cost objects:  

-   A production order line, a work or machine center, and a capacity ledger entry.  
-   A production order line, an item, and an item ledger entry.  
-   Only a production order line  

For more information about how costs from production and assembly are posted to the general ledger, see [Design Details: Inventory Posting](design-details-inventory-posting.md).  

## Capacity Posting  
Posting output from the last production order routing line results in a capacity ledger entry for the end item, in addition to its inventory increase.  

 The capacity ledger entry is a record of the time that was spent to produce the item. The related value entry describes the increase of the WIP inventory value, which is the value of the conversion cost. For more information, see “From the Capacity Ledger” in [Design Details: Accounts in the General Ledger](design-details-accounts-in-the-general-ledger.md).  

## Production Order Costing  
 To control inventory and production costs, a manufacturing company must measure the cost of production orders, because the predetermined standard cost of each produced item is capitalized in the balance sheet. For information about why produced items use the Standard costing method, see [Design Details: Costing Methods](design-details-costing-methods.md).  

> [!NOTE]  
>  In environments that do not use the Standard costing method, the actual rather than the standard cost of produced items is capitalized on the balance sheet.  

The actual cost of a production order consists of the following cost components:  

-   Actual material cost  
-   Actual capacity cost or subcontractor cost  
-   Manufacturing overhead  

These actual costs are posted to the production order and compared to the standard cost to calculate variances. Variances are calculated for each of the item cost components: raw materials, capacity, subcontractor, capacity overhead, and manufacturing overhead. The variances can be analyzed to determine problems, such as excessive waste in processing.  

In standard-cost environments, the costing of a production order is based on the following mechanism:  

1.  When the last routing operation is posted, the production order cost is posted to the item ledger and set to the expected cost.  

    This cost equals the output quantity that is posted in the output journal multiplied by the standard cost that is copied from the item card. The cost is treated as expected cost until the production order is finished. For more information, see [Design Details: Expected Cost Posting](design-details-expected-cost-posting.md).  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  This differs from assembly order posting, which always posts actual costs. For more information, see [Design Details: Assembly Order Posting](design-details-assembly-order-posting.md).  
2.  When the production order is set to **Finished**, the order is invoiced by running the **Adjust Cost-Item Entries** batch job. As a result, the total cost of the order is calculated based on the standard cost of the consumed materials and capacity. The variances between the calculated standard costs and the actual production costs are calculated and posted.

# Set up validation of purchase amounts

> [!NOTE]
> Businesses around the world can benefit from this functionality, so in 2025 release wave 1 we moved it out of the Dutch version and made it available to everyone.

You can validate the total amount on purchase invoices and credit memos before you post the documents. You can turn on the **Check Doc. Total Amounts** toggle on the **Purchases & Payables Setup** page. By default, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] validates the total amount when you post the document. The total amount of the purchase lines must equal the amount including VAT and the VAT amount. To validate the amount automatically, you must enter the document amount including VAT and the document amount VAT on the **Purchase Invoice** or **Purchase Credit Memo** page.  

If you have only one purchase line, or several purchase lines with the same VAT percentage, the correct document amount VAT is calculated automatically when you add the purchase lines and the document amount including VAT. If you have several purchase lines with different VAT percentages, you must manually change the document amount VAT value.  

If the total amount on the document differs from the total amount of its lines, you can add a few values to the page that can help you find out why. You can add the total amount, total base amount, total VAT amount, and total amount including VAT values. The values display at the bottom of the document. To avoid clutter on the page during daily work, these values are hidden. To add these values to the document, turn on the **Show Totals on Purch. Inv.-CM.** toggle on the **Purchases & Payables Setup** page.  

You can turn on this option only if the purchase invoice or purchase credit memo has:  

- A minimum of one purchase line.  
- The quantity field specified.  

## To set up validation of total amounts for purchase documents  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchases & Payables Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **General** FastTab, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Show Totals on Purch. Inv./CM.**|Recalculate the totals on all purchase invoices and credit memos. Depending on how many documents you have, the recalculation can take some time.|  
    |**Check Doc. Total Amounts**|Verify the **Doc. Amount Incl. VAT** and **Doc. Amount VAT** fields on the purchase invoices and credit memos.|  

3. Choose the **OK** button.

# Walkthrough: Planning Supplies Manually

<!-- [!INCLUDE[complete_sample_data](includes/complete_sample_data.md)]   -->

This walkthrough demonstrates the process of planning supply orders to fulfill new demand. You can initiate supply planning at fixed intervals, for example, every morning or every Monday, or when you are notified by sales or production, depending on the type of demand. In this walkthrough you will use the **Order Planning** page, a simple supply planning tool that is based on manual decision-making instead of parameter-based automatic planning.  

## About This Walkthrough  
 This walkthrough illustrates the following tasks:  

-   Planning a purchase order for manufacturing components.  
-   Planning a transfer order to fulfill sales demand.  
-   Planning a production order for a multilevel item.  

## Roles  
 This walkthrough demonstrates tasks performed by the following user roles:  

-   Production Planner  
-   Purchasing Agent  
-   Sales Order Processor  

## Prerequisites  
 Before you begin this walkthrough, you must install the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The following modifications must be made to the database:  

-   Delete all existing sales orders for bicycles.  
-   Create one sales order for 10 bicycles at EAST location.  
-   Delete all planned and firm planned production orders. Do not delete started orders with entries that are already posted.  

 As a rule, use the suggested data in this walkthrough because this data has the necessary records.  

## Story  
 Eduardo, the Production Planner of a small manufacturing company, is about to plan production and purchase orders to fulfill new sales demand.  

 Because the products have few BOM levels and the flow of orders is relatively low, Eduardo uses the **Order Planning** page to manually create supply orders, one product level at a time.  

 In a more complex manufacturing environment, the planning worksheet is used to plan supply based on item parameters such as rescheduling period, safety lead time, reorder point, and batch calculations of consolidated demand from all product levels.  

## Setting Up the Sample Data  
 The standard CRONUS demonstration company currently has lots of unplanned demand. During the different planning tasks in this walkthrough, you will have to deviate from the realistic business flow by ignoring demand with close due dates and instead use demand with later due dates.  

## Use the Order Planning Page  

The **Order Planning** page can be accessed from several different locations:  

-   Manufacturing, Planning  
-   Sales & Marketing, Order Processing  
-   Purchase, Planning  
-   In addition, you can open this page for a specific production order by choosing the **Planning** action.

### To use the Order Planning page  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Order Planning**, and then choose the related link.  

     When the **Order Planning** page first opens, a plan must be calculated to show the new demand since it was last calculated.  

2.  Choose the **Calculate Plan** action.  

     The planning system analyzes any new demand that has been introduced, such as new sales, changed sales, or production orders.  

     Based on total availability, the quantity needed for each demand line is calculated. This calculation is performed order-by-order. This means that the order which includes the demand line with the earliest due date or shipment date will be calculated first. After that, additional demand lines will be calculated in the same order, regardless of the due date or shipment date.  

3.  Be sure that the **Order Planning** page is maximized and that column fields are resized to show all the default field names.  

     When the calculation is completed, the page displays all unfulfilled demand as collapsed order header lines sorted by earliest demand date.  

     Notice that CRONUS has several orders with unfulfilled demand. Each bold planning line represents an order, sales order, or production order, including at least one order line with insufficient availability.  

4.  In the **Show Demand As** field, select the **All Demand** filter.  

     With the **Demand Type** field, you can choose which order types that you want to display.  

     Orders that do not have availability problems are not shown. If no orders exist when a plan is calculated, a message will display and no planning lines will appear.  

## Planning a Purchase Order to Fulfill Component Demand  
 In this procedure, you create a purchase order for needed manufacturing components.  

### To plan a purchase order to fulfill component need in production  

1.  Expand the first line (choose the + symbol).  
2.  Choose the first demand line, with item **LSU-15**, and then choose the **Show Document** action.  
3.  Close the opened production order to return to the **Order Planning** page.  
4.  In the **Replenishment System** field, select **Purchase**.  

     The default value is from the item card, or SKU card, but you can change it to one of the following options:  

    -   **Purchase** – To create a purchase order.  
    -   **Transfer** – To create a transfer order.  
    -   **Prod. Order** – To create a production order.  

5.  In the **Supply From** field, select one of the following options according to the selected replenishment system:  

    -   **Vendor** – For purchases  
    -   **Location** – For transfers  

     If the field is not filled in, an error message will display when you try to create the supply orders.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  If the components have a default vendor number set up on the item cards, the lines will be preset.  

6.  Choose the **Supply From**  field.  
7.  On the **Item Vendor Catalogue** page, choose the **New** action, and then select vendor **30000**.  
8.  Choose the **OK** button to return to the **Order Planning** page.  
9. Copy vendor **30000** to the other lines for loudspeaker components on this production order.  

     You are now ready to create a purchase order.  

10. Choose the **Make Orders** action. The **Make Supply Orders** page opens.  
11. On the **Order Planning** FastTab, in the **Make Orders for** field, choose the **Active Order** option.  
12. On the **Options** FastTab, in the **Create Purchase Order** field, choose the **Make Purch. Order** option.  
13. Choose the **OK** button to create purchase orders for all the components of the order.  

     The purchase orders are now created and saved as the last orders in the list of purchase orders.  

## Planning a Transfer Order to Fulfill Sales Demand  
 In this procedure, you will plan for demand from a sales order. Demand lines represent sales lines and not component lines, as in production demand.  

### To plan a transfer order to fulfill sales demand  

1.  Move the pointer to the planning line for order **2008**.  
2.  Expand the line and move the pointer to the demand line.  

     Sales order **2008** is for ten loudspeakers, item **LS-120**, ordered by John Haddock Insurance Co.  

     The item's defined replenishment system and default vendor will display.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  At the bottom of the page, there are four information fields. In the **Earliest Date Available** field, the ten pieces that are needed will be available, on an inbound supply order, nine days later than the current due date. If this is too late for the customer, the **Available for Transfer** field shows 13 pieces of the item at another location. You will want to plan for this stock.  

3.  Choose the **Available for Transfer** field to open the **Get Alternative Supply** page.  
4.  Choose the **OK** button to book the ten items that are available.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  In the demand line, the suggested purchase has been exchanged with a transfer from MAIN location. The **Make Orders** function creates a transfer order from MAIN to the demanded location. The **Substitutes Exists** field works in the same way.  

5.  Choose the **Make Orders** action. The **Make Supply Orders** page opens.  
6.  On the **Order Planning** FastTab, in the **Make Orders for** field, choose the **The Active Order** option.  
7.  On the **Options** FastTab, in the **Create Transfer Order** field, select the **Make Trans. Orders** option.  
8.  Choose the **OK** button to create the transfer order to supply the sales order.  

     The transfer order is now created and saved in the list as the last order in the list of open transfer orders.  

## Planning a Multilevel Production Order to Fulfill Sales Demand  
 In this procedure, you will plan to fulfill sales demand for a produced item with multiple product levels, each creating dependent production demand.  

### To plan multilevel production to fulfill sales demand  

1.  Select the planning line with sales demand for order **1001**, created earlier as prerequisite data.  

     This demand is a sales line, but the item has a defined replenishment system of **Prod. Order**. Proceed to add an extra bell to the component need of each bicycle.  

2.  Choose the **Components** action to open the **Planning Components** page.  
3.  On the line with the Bell item, change the **Quantity per** field from **1** to **2**.  
4.  On the **Order Planning** page, consider your planning alternatives. In this case, you have no alternative means of supply, no transfer, substitute, or later delivery. You must create the suggested supply order, a production order.  
5.  Choose the **Make Orders** action to create the production order.  

     On the **Order Planning** page, notice that the planning line for sales order **1001** no longer exists and that the initial sales demand has been covered.  

6.  Close the **Order Planning** page.  

     Now, you could choose to stay in this view and complete all the planning tasks. Instead, you will now take on the Production Planner role by going to the production order that you just created and access the **Order Planning** page.  

 As a production planner you now must plan a specific production order.  

### To plan a specific production order  

1.  Open the production order **101001**, for ten bicycles, that you just created by using the **Make Orders** function.  
2.  Open the **Prod. Order Components** page to check that the extra bell is reflected on the production order.  
3.  Choose the **Planning** action.  

     The **Order Planning** page opens in a view that is always filtered on the specific production demand. Sales demand is not displayed. You must calculate a plan before you can see any additional demand.  

4.  Choose the **Calculate Plan** action.  

     Notice that four new production orders appear as unplanned production demand derived from order **101001**. The new lines represent new production demand from the subassemblies that must be created to produce the order.  

5.  Choose the **Expand All** action to get an overview of all the production demand for the production orders.  

     To provide additional information about the demand lines, you may want to add the **Demand Quantity** and **Demand Qty. Available** fields to your view.  

     Now you must supply ten of each component.  

     Note that four of the demand lines have replenishment system Prod. Order. These four subassemblies represent the second product level of the bicycle.  

     The default replenishment settings are already filled in and you can proceed to make orders.  

6.  Choose the **Make Orders** action.  

     Before you choose the **OK** button, notice the text on the **Order Planning** FastTab. This text is important because you know that the bicycle has several produced components, subassemblies, in its product structure that might be in demand when you create this production order.  

7.  On the **Make Supply Order** page, in the **Make Orders for** field, choose the **All Lines** option, and then choose the **OK** button to create production orders for the second product level of the order.  

     Note that the top-level production demand for production order 101001 no longer exists. This means that the initial production demand for subassemblies has been planned for.  

     On the **Order Planning** page, you calculate a plan again in order to plan the bicycle structure.  

8.  Choose the **Calculate Plan** action to recalculate the plan as instructed by the embedded Help text.  

     The two new lines represent additional production demand derived from the subassemblies planned in the previous steps. It is suggested that you make two production orders to supply the wheel hubs, one for 10 front hubs and one for 10 back hubs.  

9. Choose the **Expand All** action to get an overview of all the demand for the two production orders.  

     The suggested supply plan indicates that a total of four purchase orders will be created for the components. You decide to make the proposed orders.  

10. Choose the **Make Orders** action.  
11. In the **Make Orders for** field, select the **All Lines** option, and then choose the **OK** button. Check if additional demand exists for the production of the parent item, the bicycle, which is being sold on sales order 1001.  
12. Choose the **Calculate Plan** action.  

     The message indicates that all required items are now supplied. Verify the firm planned production orders that are created.  

13. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Firm Planned Prod. Orders**, and then choose the related link.  

     On the **Firm Planned Prod. Orders** page review how start times and end times of individual orders are scheduled according to the product structure. The lowest-level components are produced first. Therefore, you must plan multilevel orders as demonstrated in this planning workflow.

# Close open item ledger entries resulting from fixed application in the item journal

You can use the **Applies-from Entry** field on the **Item Journal** page to create a fixed application between an inbound transaction and the original outbound transaction. For example, to correct the outbound transaction or to process its return.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Fixed applications made in this manner only apply the cost, not the quantity. Accordingly, the posted positive item ledger entry will not close the applied outbound entry and will itself remain open. This also applies when you post a fixed application for a positive entry to a negative entry that has not been closed by a regular positive entry, then both the negative and the positive entries will remain open.  
>
> This also means that you cannot close an inventory period if such an entry exists.  

You can change and reapply application entries under certain conditions by using the **Application Worksheet** page.  

The following procedure shows how to close such entries by performing two corrective postings in the item journal.  

## To close open item ledger entries that result from a fixed application in the item journal  

1. Use the **Applies-from Entry** field to post a positive adjustment with the corresponding quantity. This closes the original negative entry with a fixed application.  

    The **Applies-from Entry** field specifies the number of the outbound item ledger entry whose cost is forwarded to the inbound item ledger entry when you post an inbound transaction of type **Positive Adjmt.** or **Purchase** with the item journal.  
2. Use the **Applies-to Entry** field to post a negative adjustment. This closes the original corrective positive entry with a fixed application.  

    The **Applies-to Entry** field specifies if the quantity in the item journal line should be applied to an already-posted document. If so, enter the entry number of the item ledger entry to which the item journal line should be applied.

# About Finished Production Order Costs

Finishing the production order is an important task in completing the costing lifecycle of the item that is being produced. Final costs, including variances in a standard cost environment, actuals in a FIFO, Average, or LIFO cost environment, are calculated using the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job, which allows for financial reconciliation of the costs of item production. For a production order to be considered for cost adjustment, the status must be **Finished**. It is therefore critical that upon completion, the status of a production order is changed to **Finished**.  

## Example

In a standard cost environment, when you consume material to produce an item, stated simply, the cost of the item plus labor and overhead go into WIP. When the item is produced, WIP is reduced by the amount of the standard cost of the item. Typically, these costs do not net to zero. So that these costs can net to zero, you must run the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job, noting that only production orders with the status of **Finished** will be considered for adjustment.

# Set up customer discount groups

You can define sales line discounts for a group of customers instead of applying them individually.

**Customer Discount Groups** are similar to [customer price groups](sales-how-to-set-up-customer-price-groups.md), but can be combined with Item Discount Groups to quickly set line discounts to many items for selected customers.

## Create sales line discounts for a customer group

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customer Disc. Groups**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Customer Disc. Groups** page, select **New** to create a new discount group and give it a name under the **Code** column and add a description.
3. Choose the **Sales Line Discounts** action.
4. Fill in the **Sales Code** column with the discount group created on the previous page.
5. Fill in the fields on the lines with the **Type** (Item or Item Discount Group), **Code**, **Unit of Measure Code**, and the **Line Discount %**.
6. If the customer group needs to purchase a minimum quantity in order to gain the discount, fill in the **Minimum Quantity** field.
7. If necessary, enter the **Starting Date** and **Ending Date** for the discount group.
8. If relevant, you can also specify the **Currency Code** or **Variant Code** after [personalizing the columns](ui-personalization-user.md).

Repeat steps 4 through 8 for each item or item discount group you want to create a sales line discount for.

## Assign a customer to a discount group

After you set up the customer discount groups, you can enter the customer discount group codes on the customer cards.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customers**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the **Customer Card** for a customer you want to be part of a customer discount group.
3. On the **Invoicing** FastTab, in the **Customer Disc. Group** field, select the group code.

# Create G/L budgets

Budgets play an important role in business intelligence. Examples include a financial statement based on financial reports that include budget entries or when analyzing budgeted versus actual amounts in the chart of accounts. To learn more, go to [Financial Reporting](bi.md).

You can create budgets for any given time period. However, most often businesses set up budgets for their fiscal year. You can create multiple budgets for the same period so you can work with multiple budget versions or revisions. You can create budgets for dimensions too, so you can analyze budget variances per dimension. You can work with up to four dimensions in a budget. To learn more, go to [Work with Dimensions](finance-dimensions.md).

In cost accounting, you work with cost budgets in a similar way. To learn more, go to [Creating Cost Budgets](finance-create-cost-budgets.md).  

## To create a new G/L budget

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **G/L Budgets**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **Edit List** action, then fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  
3. Choose the **Edit Budget** action.
4. At the top of the **Budget** page, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  

   The page shows only entries that contain the budget name you entered in the **Budget Name** field. Because you just created the budget name, there are no entries that match the filter. Therefore, the page is empty.  
5. To enter an amount, choose the relevant cell in the matrix. The **G/L Budget Entries** page opens.  
6. Create a new line and fill in the **Amount** field. Close the **G/L Budget Entries** page.  
7. Repeat steps 5 and 6 for all amounts in the budget.  

> [!NOTE]  
> On the **Filters** FastTab, you can filter the budget information by the budget dimensions you set up under the budget name.

## Exporting and importing G/L budgets with Excel

You can export data on budget pages to Microsoft Excel for further processing or analysis and then import budget data back in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

### Exporting G/L budgets to Excel

Exporting a G/L budget to an Excel workbook lets you work offline and using Excel's powerful data manipulation features.

To export the budget to Excel, follow these steps:

1. Open the Budget: Select the budget you want to work on from the list of G/L budgets. Choose the **Edit Budget** action.
1. To export to Excel, on the **Budget** page, choose **Export to Excel**.
1. Choose the dimensions and filters you want to include in the export. For example, you might want to filter by specific departments or projects.
1. To generate the Excel file, choose **OK**.
1. Save the exported Excel file to your local drive for further editing.

### Editing G/L budgets in Excel

After you export the G/L budget to Excel, you can fill in your budget data. Here's a few tips to be more effective and reduce errors:

- Add budget amounts for each combination of dimensions and periods. Ensure that the data is accurate and adheres to the formatting requirements of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For example, your numbering shouldn't have special characters or formatting.
- Take advantage of Excel features such as formulas, data validation, and conditional formatting to streamline data entry and ensure accuracy.
- Save the Excel file after you enter the budget data.
- Make local copies of your budgets as backups.

### Importing G/L budgets to Excel

After you add your budget numbers in a local Excel workbook, the next step is to import it back into [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Do as follows to import the budget from Excel:

1. Open the Budget: Select the budget you want to work on from the list of G/L budgets. Choose the **Edit Budget** action.
1. To import from Excel, on the **Budget** page, choose **Import from Excel**.
1. Choose the Excel file from your local drive. You can choose which budget you're uploading to and whether to add or replace the entries. The **Add** action adds the entries from Excel to entries that already exist. The **Replace** action overwrites entries existing entries in the budget.
1. If everything looks correct, choose **OK** to complete the import process. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] updates the budget with the imported data.

### Scenario example: setting budget targets for payroll expenses

You know that the new budgeted salaries cost is going to be 1.200.000 in local currency (LCY). You want to enable the Salaries department to budget for the three specific lines (of the Posting account type) for full-time employees, part-time employees, and temp help. The three lines are grouped under a Salaries heading line.

You enter 1.200.000 on the Heading line, export the budget to Excel, then send it to the Salaries department, telling them to distribute the LCY 1.200.000.

The Salaries department distributes the amount on the three posting accounts. When you import back into the G/L budget, the three accounts are filled in with the new Excel data, summing to LCY 1.200.000, and the Heading line is blank.

> [!NOTE]
> The chart of accounts, which general ledger (G/L) budgets are based on, has lines of the account type Heading. These lines contain the total of the lines below it. When you export a G/L budget, you export data on all lines regardless of the account type. However, you can only import data on lines of the Posting account type. Similarly, when you import a G/L budget, any values on Heading lines are deleted. They're deleted to avoid incorrect totals after you import data that was created or edited in Excel.

## Tips for effective budget management

Here are some tips for effective budget management:

- Regular Updates: Periodically update your G/L budgets to reflect changes in your financial plans and business environment. You can copy any of the budgets and turn them into forecasts.
- Version Control: Maintain different versions of your budget to compare actual performance against various scenarios.
- Collaboration: Encourage collaboration by involving relevant stakeholders in the budgeting process, ensuring that the budget is comprehensive and realistic.

# Set up prices and discounts

> [!NOTE]
> In 2020 release wave 2, we released streamlined processes for setting up and managing prices and discounts. If you're a new customer using that version, you're using the new experience. If you're an existing customer, whether you're using the new experience depends on whether your admin enabled the **New sales pricing experience** feature update on the **Feature Management** page. To learn more, go to [Enabling Upcoming Features Ahead of Time](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/feature-management).

Price and discount strategies for the purchase and sale of items and services are fundamental tools for successful businesses. After you set up the items and services your company buys and sells, you can define what you pay or charge for them. When you select the item or service on sales and purchase documents, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] adds the amounts.

## Setting up prices and discounts

Before you create price lists, you must define your pricing and discount strategies on the **Sales & Receivables Setup** and **Purchase & Payables Setup** pages.

You can set up and use two types of discounts:

| Discount Type | Description |

| **Line Discount** |A discount amount that is given for lines on sales and purchase documents. Typically, line discounts are based on a combination of customer, item, minimum quantity, unit of measure, or period of time that you define for sales and purchases on the **Sales & Receivables Setup** and **Purchase & Payables Setup** pages.|
| **Invoice Discount** |A discount percentage that is subtracted from sales and purchase document total if the sum of all lines on the document exceeds a certain minimum. |

Because sales prices and sales line discounts are based on a combination of item and customer, you can also set them up on the items to which the rules and values apply.

> [!TIP]  
> If an item should never be sold with a discount, leave the discount fields on the item empty, and don't include the item in any line discount setups.

## About price lists

Price lists are flexible and let you specify the business partner or activity that they apply to. For example, you can set up one price list that applies to all vendors and customers, or offer special prices or discounts for each business partner. Special prices or discounts are often based on a minimum quantity on purchase or sales orders, periods of time, or a certain combination of customer, item, minimum quantity, and unit of measure. The prices and discounts you define automatically apply to purchase and sales documents.

## Set up prices

These steps differ, depending on whether your admin turned on the **New sales pricing experience** feature update.

### [Current Experience](#tab/current-experience)  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customers**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the customer, and then choose the **Prices** action.
3. Fill in the fields on the line as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)] Fill a line for each combination that grants a special sales price to the customer.

### [New Experience](#tab/new-experience)  

You can add items and services manually for each line, or you can use the **Suggest Lines** action to create new prices for selected items, item discount groups, resources, and other product types. If you choose **Suggest Lines**, on the **Price Lines - Create New** page you can use filters to select the items or services to include on the price list. You can also specify whether to consider other factors, such as:

* A minimum quantity when calculating prices.
* The adjustment factor to apply for new price list lines.
* The rounding method to apply for prices.

[!INCLUDE [edit-in-excel-price-list](includes/edit-in-excel-price-list.md)]

By default, the status of new price lists is **Draft**. When you're ready to start using the list, you can change the status to **Active**.

To review price lists and prices that apply for specific customers or vendors, on the **Customer** or **Vendor** pages, choose either **Sales Price Lists** or **Purchase Price Lists** action. For items and resources, you can view price list lines by choosing **Sales Prices** or **Purchase Prices** on the **Item** and **Resource** pages.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customers**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the customer, and then choose the **Sales Price Lists** action.
3. Choose **New** to create a new sales price list.
4. On the **General** and **Tax** FastTabs, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
5. Add items to the list in one of the following ways:
   * To add many items, choose **Suggest Lines**, and then enter filter criteria to specify the types of items to add. Optionally, you can enter settings for the items that are specific to the price list. You can change the settings later, if needed.
   * To copy items from another price list, choose **Copy Lines**, and then choose the price list to copy.
   * To add items manually, in the **Product Type** field, choose the type of product that the price list is for. Depending on your selection, fill in the remaining fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
6. To start using the price list, in the **Status** field, choose **Active**.

## Work with invoice discounts and service charges

When you use invoice discounts, the size of the invoice amount determines the size of the discount that is granted. On the **Invoice Discounts** page, you can also add a service charge to invoices over a certain amount.

Before you can use invoice discounts with sales, you must enter certain information in application. You must decide which customers you want to grant this type of discount, and the discount percentages.  

If you want [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to automatically calculate invoice discounts, turn on the **Calc. Inv. Discount** toggle on the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page.  

For each customer, you can specify whether you grant invoice discounts if the requirement is satisfied (that is, if the invoice amount is large enough). You can define the terms of the invoice discount in local currency for domestic customers and in foreign currency for foreign customers.  

You link discount percentages to specific invoice amounts on the **Invoice Discounts** page. You can enter as many percentages as you need. Each customer can have their own page, or you can link several customers to the same page.  

In addition to (or instead of) a discount percentage, you can link a service charge amount to a specific invoice amount.  

> [!TIP]  
> Before you start entering this information, it's a good idea to prepare your discount structure beforehand, so it's easier to see which customers to link to the same invoice discount page. For more information about discounts in sales, see [Set up discounts for your customers](/training/modules/customer-discounts-dynamics-365-business-central/index).

### To set up an invoice discount for a customer

After you decide which customers are eligible for invoice discounts, enter the invoice discount code on the customer cards and set up the terms for each code.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customers**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the customer page for a customer that's eligible for invoice discounts.
3. In the **Invoice Disc. Code** field, select a customer for which you specified the invoice discount terms to use to calculate invoice discounts.

> [!NOTE]  
> Invoice discount codes are the discount term settings for a customer, which can save you time. You can quickly assign invoice discount terms to customers by reusing the settings from another customer.

Proceed to set up new the sales invoice discount terms.

1. On the **Customers** page, choose the **Invoice Discounts** action. The **Cust. Invoice Discounts** page opens.
2. In the **Currency Code** field, enter the code for a currency that the invoice discount terms on the line applies to. Leave the field blank to set up invoice discount terms in USD.
3. In the **Minimum Amount** field, enter the minimum amount that an invoice must have to be eligible for the discount.
4. In the **Discount %** field, enter the invoice discount as a percentage of the invoice amount.
5. Repeat steps 2 through 4 for each currency that the customer uses.

The invoice discount is now set up and assigned to the customer. When you select the customer code in the **Invoice Disc. Code** field on other customer cards, the same invoice discount is assigned to those customers.

## To copy sales prices

These steps differ, depending on whether your admin turned on the **New sales pricing experience** feature update.

### [Current Experience](#tab/current-experience/)

To copy sales prices, such as an individual customer's sales prices, to use for a customer price group, you must run the **Suggest Sales Price on Wksh.** batch job on the **Sales Price Worksheet** page.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Price Worksheet**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **Suggest Sales Price on Wksh.** action.  
3. On the **Sales Prices** FastTab, fill in the **Sales Type** and **Sales Code** fields with the original sales prices you want to copy.  
4. In the top section of the request page, fill in the **Sales Type** and **Sales Code** fields with the type and name you want the sales prices copied to.  
5. If you want the batch job to create new prices, select the **Create New Prices** check box.  
6. Choose the **OK** button to fill in the lines on the **Sales Price Worksheet** page with the suggested new prices, indicating that they're valid for the selected sales type.  

   > [!NOTE]  
   > This batch job only creates suggestions and it doesn't implement the suggested changes. If you're satisfied with the suggestions and want to implement them, that is insert them on the **Sales Prices** page, choose the **Implement Price Changes** action on the **Sales Price Worksheet** page.

### [New Experience](#tab/new-experience/)

The status of the price list must be **Draft**.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Price Lists**, and then choose the related link. 
2. Choose the price list to copy, and then choose **Copy Lines**.
3. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

   > [!NOTE]
   > You can't have two lines that have the same settings but different prices. If that happens, a message displays when you activate a price list. You can choose the price to use by opening the list and deleting the incorrect price.

## To bulk update item prices

These steps differ, depending on whether your administrator turned on the **New sales pricing experience** feature update.

### [Current Experience](#tab/current-experience/)

If you want to bulk update item prices, such as increase all item prices by some percentage, you must run the **Suggest Item Price on Wksh.** batch job. You can find a link to the batch job on the **Sales Price Worksheet** page.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Price Worksheet**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **Suggest Item Price on Wksh.** action.  
3. On the **Item** FastTab, fill in the **No.** or **Inventory Posting Group** or other fields with the original item prices you want to update.  
4. In the top section of the request page, fill in the **Sales Type** and **Sales Code** with the type and name you want the sales prices copied to.
5. If you want the batch job to automatically adjust suggested item prices, enter adjustment in **Adjustment Factor** field. For example, you would enter 1.15 in **Adjustment Factor** for 15% increase in item price.  
6. If you want the batch job to create new prices, select the **Create New Prices** field.  
7. Choose the **OK** button to fill in the lines on the **Sales Price Worksheet** page with the suggested new prices, indicating that they're valid for the selected **Item**.  

> [!NOTE]
> This batch job only creates suggestions and it doesn't implement the suggested changes. If you're satisfied with the suggestions and want to implement them, that is insert them in the **Sales Prices** table, you can use the **Implement Price Changes** batch job, which is found on the **Actions** tab, in the **Functions** group, on the **Sales Price Worksheet** page.

### [New Experience](#tab/new-experience/)

To update prices for multiple items, you must create a new price list, and then copy the lines from an existing price list. When you copy the lines you can use filters to specify what to copy, and you can specify an integer or decimal number in the **Adjustment Factor** field to increase or decrease prices. The price list must be in the **Draft** status. If needed, you can then deactivate the old price list.

> [!NOTE]
> You can't have two lines that have the same settings but different prices. If that happens, a message displays when you activate a price list. You can choose the price to use by opening the list and deleting the incorrect price.

# Export and Import Approval Workflows

To transfer workflows to other [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] databases, for example to save time when creating new workflows, you can export and import workflows.  

Another way to quickly create workflows is to use workflow templates. Learn more at [Create Workflows from Workflow Templates](across-how-to-create-workflows-from-workflow-templates.md).  

On the **Workflow** page, you create a workflow by listing the involved steps on the lines. Each step consists of a workflow event, moderated by event conditions, and a workflow response, moderated by response options. You define workflow steps by filling fields on workflow lines using fixed lists of event and response values representing scenarios supported by the application code. Learn more at [Create Workflows](across-how-to-create-workflows.md).  

## Export a workflow

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Workflows**, then choose the related link.  
2. Select a workflow, then choose the **Export to File** action.  

## Import a workflow

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Workflows**, then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **Import from File** action.  
3. On the **Import** page, select **Choose**, choose the XML file containing the workflow, then select **Open**.  

> [!CAUTION]  
> If the workflow code already exists in the database, the workflow steps will be overwritten with the steps in the imported workflow.

# Setup best practices: planning parameters

The **Planning** FastTab on the **Item Card** page is the center of a company’s supply chain. Setting the correct planning parameters is very important for cost-effective inventory control and quality customer service.  

This article provides best practices on how to set up selected planning parameter fields.

|Setup field|Best practice|Comment|  
|-----------------|-------------------|-------------|  
|Reordering Policy||To learn more, go to [Setup Best Practices: Reordering Policies](setup-best-practices-reordering-policies.md).|  
|Reserve|Select **Never** when the item is planned using a reorder point.<br /><br /> In manufacturing, select **Never** to allow the planning system to cover all demands.<br /><br /> Select **Optional** for items that you may want to reserve for top-priority customers.<br /><br /> Select **Always** for unique items (Non-Standard type of Items), such as items of type miscellaneous that are inbound for specific demands.|Reservations generally counteract the purpose of planning, which is to balance demand and supply. Therefore, items that are set up for planning should generally not be reserved.<br /><br /> If the user reserves an inventory quantity for future demand, then the planning foundation will be disturbed, and the reorder point may not work correctly. Even if the projected inventory level is acceptable with regard to the reorder point, the quantities may not be available because of the reservation.|  
|Dampener Period|Set with regard to the supplier’s flexibility.<br /><br /> A shorter period enables you to reduce working capital by avoiding excessive stock, but will also cause more rescheduling actions.|If the supplier accepts last-minute changes to orders, then use a shorter period, but be prepared for more rescheduling actions. If the supplier requires firm planning, then extend the period as much as possible.<br /><br /> To learn more about this field, go to [Design Details: Planning Parameters](design-details-planning-parameters.md).|  
|Include Inventory|Always select when you are using the **Lot-for-Lot** reordering policy.|Do not select only in special situations, such as when inventory items are not sellable.|  
|Safety Lead Time|Set between 1D and 6D. Set a safety lead time of at least one day to make sure that supplies are available on the day before they are needed. If you're using a new supplier, define a longer time until their delivery performance is known.<br /><br />In manufacturing, define longer safety lead times for critical components. Use longer safety lead times for produced components to have a buffer that allows for fluctuations in production times.|Supply that is planned by the system to avoid a stock-out will arrive on the same day that the stock-out occurs. The supply might be several hours too late if, for example, the demand is needed in the morning and the supply arrives in the afternoon. **Note:** The Safety Lead Time field uses the base calendar. Therefore, 14D is not necessarily two weeks.|  
|Safety Stock Quantity|Use for items with large demand fluctuations.<br /><br /> In manufacturing, use for critical components.<br /><br /> Use for items that are subject to service agreements.|If the **Reorder Point** field is not filled in, the safety stock quantity also acts as a reorder point.|  
|Lot Accumulation Period|If you want only a few big orders and it's ok to carry inventory, specify a long period for lot accumulation.<br /><br /> If you want multiple small orders and minimal inventory, set a short lot accumulation period.|The lot accumulation period is generally the longest period that you carry inventory.|  
|Reorder Point|Base the reorder point on the item’s demand profile.|If historical data shows that the item’s average demand is 100 units during a lead time of seven days, the reorder point can be set to 100 as a minimum.<br /><br /> When the inventory level falls below 100 units, the planning system suggests that you replenish because it takes seven days to supply the item, and there must be enough to cover the demand within those seven days.|  
|Time Bucket|Leave blank, meaning that the inventory level is checked every day.|Checking the inventory level every day ensures optimal reorder point planning. **Note:** A time bucket of 1W means that the inventory level can be below the reorder point for one week before a supply order is suggested.|  
|Rounding Precision|In expensive manufacturing, set to 0.00001.|Large rounding quantities of scrap or material consumption can amount to very large inventory costs. It might be relevant to set the smallest rounding precision to minimize this potential cost.|  

> [!NOTE]  
> The best practices for planning parameters on item cards also apply to the same fields on SKU cards.  
>
> If you plan for demand at different locations, we recommend that you define SKUs for each location and that all demand is created by using a value in the **Location Code** field. To learn more, go to [Design Details: Planning With or Without Locations](production-planning-with-without-locations.md).

# Record special sales prices and discounts

> [!NOTE]
> 2020 release wave 2 introduced new, streamlined processes for setting up and managing prices and discounts. If you're a new customer using the latest version, you're using the new experience. If you're an existing customer, whether you are using the new experience depends on whether your administrator has enabled the **New sales pricing experience** feature update in **Feature Management**. Learn more at [Enabling Upcoming Features Ahead of Time](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/feature-management) in the administration content.

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports various pricing strategies, such as:

* One-price-fits-all models where an item is always sold at the same price.
* Special price agreements with specific customers, or groups of customers.
* Campaigns when a sale meets the criteria for a special offer. For example, you might have the following criteria for an order:

  * It meets a minimum quantity
  * It's before a certain date
  * It includes a certain type of item  

To use a basic pricing model, you only need to specify a unit price when you set up an item or resource. That price will always be used on sales documents. For more advanced models, for example, when you want to offer special prices for a sales campaign, you can specify criteria on the **Sales Prices** page. You can offer special prices based on a combination of the following information:  

* Customer
* Item
* Unit of measure
* Minimum quantity
* Dates that define the period for which the prices are valid.

After you set up special prices, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can calculate best prices on sales and purchase documents, and on lines on projects and item journals. Learn more at [Best Price Calculation](sales-how-record-sales-price-discount-payment-agreements.md#best-price-calculation).

For sales discounts, you can set up two types:

| Discount Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Sales Line Discount** |Add an amount on sales lines that have a certain combination of customer, item, minimum quantity, unit of measure, or starting and ending date. This type works in the same way as for sales prices. |
| **Invoice Discount** |A discount percentage that is subtracted from the sales document total if the sum of all lines on the document exceeds a certain minimum. |

> [!TIP]  
> If an item should never be sold with a discount, leave the discount fields on the item page empty, and do not include the item in any line discount setups.

## To set up a sales price for a customer

These steps differ, depending on whether your administrator has turned on the **New sales pricing experience** feature update. If the feature update isn't turned on, follow the steps on the Current Experience tab. 

#### [Current experience](#tab/current-experience/)

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customers**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the customer, and then choose the **Prices** action.
3. Fill in the fields on the line as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)] Fill a line for each combination that will grant a special sales price to the customer.

#### [New experience](#tab/new-experience/)  

By default, the status of new price lists is **Draft**. Draft price lists aren't included in price calculations. When you're done adding lines and want to start using the prices, change the status to **Active**.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customers**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the customer, and then choose the **Sales Price Lists** action. 
3. Choose **New** to create a new sales price list.
4. On the **General** and **Tax** FastTabs, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
5. To add items to the list, do one of the following steps:
   * To add many items, choose **Suggest Lines**, and then enter filter criteria to specify the types of items to add. Optionally, you can enter other settings for the items that are specific to the price list. You can change these settings later if needed.
   * To copy items from another price list, choose **Copy Lines**, and then choose the price list to copy.
   * To add items manually, in the grid, in the **Product Type** field, choose the type of product that the price list is for. Depending on your selection, fill in the remaining fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
6. To start using the price list, in the **Status** field, choose **Active**.

## Using sales and purchase price lists

> [!NOTE]
> Using price lists requires that your administrator has enabled the **New sales pricing experience** feature update in **Feature Management**. Learn more at [Enabling Upcoming Features Ahead of Time](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/feature-management) in the administration content.

Most of the new sales pricing experience is similar to the current experience, but there are a few differences. Those differences are described in the following sections.

The **Applies-to Type** and **Applies-to No.** fields let you choose what a price list will apply to, such as customer or customer price group. Using **View Columns for**, you can show or hide columns relevant for setting prices, discounts, or prices and discounts.

### Converting existing prices when you turn on the pricing feature update

When you enable the **New sales pricing experience** feature update on the **Feature Management** page, the **Feature Data Update** guide opens. Use the **Use default prices** toggle as follows:

* If you want to work with all prices on a single page, turn it on. Existing prices will be converted to one default price list for each of the following documents:

  * Sales
  * Purchases
  * Job sales
  * Job purchases

  You can edit all prices for these areas on the **Prices Worksheet** page. The default price lists will be set on the **Sales & Receivables Setup**, **Purchases & Payables Setup,** and **Projects Setup** pages.

> [!NOTE]
> If prices are set only on item or resource cards, default price lists will not be filled in with those prices during the data update. However, you can open any of the default price lists or the **Price Worksheet** page and use the **Suggest Lines** action to add the prices set on item or resource cards.

* To use sales price lists, turn it off. Existing prices will be converted to a new price list for each combination of the following things:

  * Customer
  * Customer group or campaign
  * Starting and ending dates
  * Currencies

If you have many combinations, you'll have many price lists.

If you've already enabled the New Pricing Experience, you can create default price lists manually or specify an existing price list as the default. To set an existing price list as default, turn on the **Allow Updating Defaults** toggle on the price list. Then, on the **Sales & Receivables Setup**, **Purchase & Payables**, or **Projects Setup** pages, set the price list as the default.

### Editing active price lists

To allow people to edit prices on active price lists for items, resources, customers, vendors, or other entities that use pricing, turn on the **Allow Editing Active Price** toggle on the **Sales & Receivables Setup** and **Purchase & Payables Setup** pages.

When the **Allow Editing Active Price** toggle is turned off, to update prices in a price list you must change the status of the price list to **Draft**, make your change, and then reactivate the price list.

The **Prices Overview** page provides an overview of all prices across price lists. You can set filters to narrow down the list of prices you may want to modify or add to. After you modify prices, you must use the **Verify Lines** action to verify the prices against other price list lines. Verifying prices helps avoid duplicates and ambiguity during price calculation.

> [!NOTE]
> When you edit a line in an active price list the status of the line becomes **Draft**, and the line will not be considered during price calculation until you use the **Verify Lines** action. After you verify the price the line's status becomes **Active** and it will be considered in price calculations.

To add new prices, on the **Prices Overview** page, use the **Add New Lines** action. The **Prices Worksheet** page opens, and you can add price lines either by suggesting them based on criteria, copying them from other price lists, or manually entering them. Afterward, you can use the **Implement Price Change** action to compare the new prices with other price lists to avoid duplicates and ambiguity during price calculation.

#### Create sales price lines based on the unit price

1. On the **Prices Worksheet** page, choose the **Suggest Lines** action.
2. On the **Price Lines - Create new** page, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

## To copy sales prices

These steps differ, depending on whether your administrator has turned on the **New sales pricing experience** feature update. If the feature update isn't turned on, follow the steps on the Current Experience tab.

#### [Current experience](#tab/current-experience/)  

If you want to copy sales prices, such as an individual customer's sales prices to use for a customer price group, you must run the **Suggest Sales Price on Wksh.** batch job on the **Sales Price Worksheet** page.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Price Worksheet**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **Suggest Sales Price on Wksh.** action.  
3. On the **Sales Prices** FastTab, fill in the **Sales Type** and **Sales Code** fields with the original sales prices you want to copy.  
4. In the top section of the request page, fill in the **Sales Type** and **Sales Code** fields with the type and name you want the sales prices copied to.  
5. If you want the batch job to create new prices, select the **Create New Prices** checkbox.  
6. Choose the **OK** button to fill in the lines on the **Sales Price Worksheet** page with the suggested new prices, indicating that they're valid for the selected sales type.  

   > [!NOTE]  
   > This batch job only creates suggestions and it does not implement the suggested changes. If you are satisfied with the suggestions and want to implement them, that is insert them on the **Sales Prices** page, choose the **Implement Price Changes** action on the **Sales Price Worksheet** page.

#### [New experience](#tab/new-experience/)  

You can specify the settings that the price list will use:

* Use the settings from the header on the list you're copying.
* Use the settings from the list you're copying to. To use the settings from the price list you're copying prices to, turn on the **Use defaults from target** toggle.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Price Lists**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the price list to copy, and then choose **Copy Lines**.
3. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

   > [!NOTE]
   > You can't have two items that have the same settings but different prices. If that happens, a message will display when you activate the price list. You can choose the price to use by opening the list and deleting the incorrect price.

## To bulk update item prices

These steps differ, depending on whether your administrator has turned on the **New sales pricing experience** feature update. If the feature update isn't turned on, follow the steps on the Current Experience tab.

#### [Current experience](#tab/current-experience/)

To bulk update item prices, such as increase all prices by a percentage, you can fill in the Sales Price Worksheet page by using the following batch jobs:

* **Suggest Sales Price on Wksh.** suggests changes in one of two ways:

  * By applying an adjustment factor to existing sales prices.
  * By copying existing sales price agreements to other customers, customer price groups, or sales campaigns.

* **Suggest Item Price on Wksh.** suggests changes in one of two ways:

  * By applying an adjustment factor to existing unit prices on item cards.
  * By suggesting prices for new combinations of currency, units of measure, and so on.

  This batch job doesn't change the unit prices on items.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Price Worksheet**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **Suggest Item Price on Wksh.** action.  
3. On the **Item** FastTab, fill in the **No.** or **Inventory Posting Group** or other fields with the original item prices you want to update.  
4. In the top section of the request page, fill in the **Sales Type** and **Sales Code** with the type and name you want the sales prices copied to.
5. If you want the batch job to automatically adjust suggested item prices, enter the adjustment in the **Adjustment Factor** field. For example, you would enter 1.15 in **Adjustment Factor** for a 15% increase in item price.  
6. If you want the batch job to create new prices, turn on the **Create New Prices** toggle.  
7. Choose the **OK** button to fill in the lines on the **Sales Price Worksheet** page with the suggested new prices.
8. To implement the suggestions, use the **Implement Price Changes** action. The batch job creates suggestions but doesn't implement them. 

#### [New experience](#tab/new-experience/)

To update prices for multiple items, you must create a new price list, and then copy the lines from an existing price list. When you copy the lines you can use filters to specify what to copy, and you can specify an integer or decimal number in the **Adjustment Factor** field to increase or decrease prices. The price list must be in the **Draft** status. If needed, you can then deactivate the old price list.

> [!NOTE]
> You can't have two lines that have the same settings but different prices. If that happens, a message will display when you activate a price list. You can choose the price to use by opening the list and deleting the incorrect price.

## Best price calculation

After you record special prices and line discounts for sales and purchases, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates the best price on sales and purchase documents, and on project and item journal lines.

The best price is the lowest price with the highest line discount allowed on a given date. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates best prices when it adds unit prices and the line discount percentages on document and journal lines.

> [!NOTE]  
> The following describes how the best price is calculated for sales. For purchases, the calculation is similar but is based on the available parameters. For example, item discount groups are not supported for purchasing.

1. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] checks the combination of the bill-to customer and the item and then calculates the applicable unit price and line discount percentage, using the following criteria:

    * Does the customer have a price/discount agreement, or does the customer belong to a group that does?
    * Is the item or the item discount group on the line included in any of these price/discount agreements?
    * Is the date within the starting and ending date of the price/discount agreement? For invoices and credit memos, this is the date in the **Posting Date** field on the document header. For all other documents, it's the date in the **Order Date** field on their headers.
    * Is a unit of measure code specified? If so, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] checks for prices/discounts with the same unit of measure code, and prices/discounts with no unit of measure code.

2. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] checks whether any price/discount agreements apply to information on the document or journal line. It then inserts the applicable unit price and line discount percentage using the following criteria:

    * Is there a minimum quantity requirement in the price/discount agreement that is fulfilled?
    * Is there a currency requirement in the price/discount agreement that is fulfilled? If so, the lowest price and the highest line discount for that currency are inserted, even if local currency would provide a better price. If there's no price/discount agreement for the specified currency code, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] inserts the lowest price and the highest line discount in your local currency.

If no special price can be calculated for the item on the line, then either the last direct cost or the unit price from the item card is inserted.

## Sales invoice discounts and service charges

When you use invoice discounts, the total amount on the invoice determines the size of the discount that is granted. On the **Cust. Invoice Discounts** page, you can also add a service charge to invoices over a certain amount.  

Before you can use invoice discounts with sales, you must specify certain information. You must make the following decisions:  

* Which customers will be granted this type of discount?  
* Which discount percentages you'll use?  

If you want invoice discounts to be calculated automatically, on the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page, turn on the **Calc Inv. Discount** toggle.  

You can specify whether you'll grant invoice discounts when an invoice meets certain criteria for each customer. For example, when the invoice amount is large enough. Invoice discounts can be in local currency for domestic customers, or in foreign currency for foreign customers.  

You link discount percentages to specific invoice amounts on the **Cust. Invoice Discounts** page for each customer. You can enter any number of percentages. Each customer can have their own page, or you can link several customers to the same page.  

In addition to, or instead of, a discount percentage, you can link a service charge amount to a specific invoice amount.  

> [!TIP]  
> Before you enter this information, it's a good idea to prepare an outline of the discount structure that you want to use. The structure makes it easier to determine which customers can be linked to the same invoice discount page. The fewer pages you have to set up, the faster you can enter the basic information.

For training in discounts in sales, see [Set up discounts for your customers](/training/modules/customer-discounts-dynamics-365-business-central/index).

### Calculating invoice discounts on sales

[!INCLUDE [sales-invoice-discounts](includes/sales-invoice-discounts.md)]

## To set up a sales line discount for a customer

These steps differ, depending on whether your administrator has turned on the **New sales pricing experience** feature update. If the feature update isn't turned on, follow the steps on the Current Experience tab.

#### [Current experience](#tab/current-experience/)

3. Fill in the fields on the line as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)] Fill a line for each combination that will grant a sales line discount to the customer.

> [!NOTE]
> When you open the **Sales Prices** and **Sales Line Discounts** pages from a specific customer, the **Sales Type Filter** and **Sales Code Filter** fields are set for the customer and can't be changed or removed.
>
> To set up prices or line discounts for all customers, a customer price group, or a campaign, you must open the pages from an item card. Alternatively, for sales prices, use the **Sales Price Worksheet** page. Learn more at [To bulk update item prices](sales-how-record-sales-price-discount-payment-agreements.md#to-bulk-update-item-prices).  

#### [New experience](#tab/new-experience/)

2. Choose the customer, and then choose the **Sales Price Lists** action.
3. Open the price list for which to specify the line discount.
4. Create a new line, or choose an existing line, and then fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
5. In the **Defines** field, choose either **Price & Discount**, or just **Discount**. 
6. In the **Line Discount %** field, specify the discount percentage.

    > [!TIP]
    > If you're editing an existing line, you can filter the lines by choosing the appropriate option in the **View Columns for** field.

    > [!NOTE]  
    > Invoice discount codes are represented by existing customer cards. This enables you to quickly assign invoice discount terms to customers by picking the name of another customer who will have the same terms. To set up customer-specific invoice discount terms, set the **Invoice Disc. Code** field to the customer's customer code, and then proceed to the next step.

# Apply payments automatically and reconciling bank accounts
You must regularly reconcile your bank, receivables, and payables accounts by applying payments recorded in the bank to their related open (unpaid) invoices and credit memos or other open entries in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

You can perform this task on the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page, for example, by importing a bank statement file or feed to quickly register the payments. Payments are applied to open customer or vendor ledger entries based on matches between payment text and entry information. You can review and change automatic applications before you post the journal. You can choose to close any open bank account ledger entries related to the applied ledger entries when you post the journal. The bank account is automatically reconciled when all payments are applied.

On the **Payment Application Rules** page, you can set up prioritized rules that govern how payment text is automatically matched with entry information.

You can also reconcile bank accounts without simultaneously applying payments. You perform this work on the **Bank Acc. Reconciliation** page. For more information, see [Reconcile Bank Accounts](bank-how-reconcile-bank-accounts-separately.md).

To import bank statements as a bank feed, you must first set up and enable the Envestnet Yodlee Bank Feed service, and then link your bank accounts to the related online bank accounts. For more information, see [set up the Envestnet Yodlee bank feeds service](bank-how-setup-bank-statement-service.md).  

> [!TIP]
> You can also import bank statement files in comma or semicolon delimited format (.CSV). Use the **Set up a bank statement file format** assisted setup to define bank statement import formats and attach the format to a bank account. You can then use these formats when you import bank statements in the **Bank Account Reconciliation** page.

Alternatively, you can use the AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals extension to convert a bank statement file, from any format, to a data stream that you can import into [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For more information, see [use the AMC banking 365 fundamentals extension](ui-extensions-amc-banking.md).

# Outbound Warehouse Processes

Outbound processes in warehouses start when you release a source document to take items out of a warehouse location. For example, either to ship the items somewhere or to move them to another company location. You can ship physical and non-inventory items. To learn more about receiving non-inventory items, go to [Post non-inventory items](#post-non-inventory-items). 

In principle, the process of shipping outbound orders consists of two activities:

* Picking items from the shelves.
* Shipping items out of the warehouse.

The source documents for outbound warehouse flow are:  

* Sales order  
* Outbound transfer order  
* Purchase return order  
* Service order  

> [!NOTE]
> Production and assembly orders with component needs also represent outbound source documents. Production and assembly orders are a little different because they're typically internal processes that don't involve shipping. Instead, they're used to put-away produced items or move the components needed to assemble an item to an assembly area. Learn more about these processes at [Design Details: Internal Warehouse Flows](design-details-internal-warehouse-flows.md).  

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you pick and ship items using one of four methods, as described in the following table.

|Method|Outbound Process|Require Pick|Require Shipment|Complexity Level (Learn more at [Warehouse Management Overview](design-details-warehouse-management.md))|  
|------|----------------|-----|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
|A|Post the pick and shipment from the order line|||No dedicated warehouse activity.|  
|B|Post the pick and shipment from an inventory pick document|Turned on||Basic: Order-by-order.|  
|C|Post the pick and shipment from a warehouse shipment document||Turned on|Basic: Consolidated receive/ship posting for multiple orders.|  
|D|Post the pick from a warehouse pick document, and post the shipment from a warehouse shipment document|Turned on|Turned on|Advanced|  

The approach to choose depends on your warehouse practices and level of organizational complexity. The following are some examples that might help you decide.

* In an order-by-order environment with straightforward processes and a simple bin structure, method A, picking and shipping from the order line is appropriate.
* If items for an order line come from more than one bin, or if warehouse workers can't work with order documents, the use of separate pick documents is appropriate, method B.
* If your picking and shipping processes involve multiple orders and require greater control and overview, you might choose to use a warehouse shipment document and warehouse pick document to separate the picking and shipping tasks, methods C and D.  

In methods A, B, and C, picking and shipping activities are combined in one step when posting the document as shipped. In method D, you first register the pick, and then post the shipment later from a different document.

> [!NOTE]
> While warehouse picks and inventory picks sound similar, they're different documents and are used in different processes.
> * The inventory pick used in method B, together with registering picking information, also posts the shipment of the source document.
> * The warehouse pick used in method D can't be posted and only registers the pick. The registration makes the items available for the warehouse shipment but doesn't post the shipment. In the outbound flow, the warehouse pick requires a warehouse shipment.

## No dedicated warehouse activity

The following articles provide information about how to process receipts for source documents if you don't have dedicated warehouse activities.

* [Create Service Orders](service-how-to-create-service-orders.md)

## Basic warehouse configurations

The following diagram illustrates the outbound warehouse processes for different types of documents in basic warehouse configurations. The numbers in the diagram correspond with the steps in the sections following the diagram.  

:::image type="content" source="media/design-details-warehouse-management-outbound-basic-flow.png" alt-text="Shows the steps in a basic outbound flow in a warehouse.":::

### 1: Release a source document

When you use the **Release** action on a source document, such as a sales or transfer order, the items on the document are ready to be handled in the warehouse. For example, picked and put in the bin specified on the document. Alternatively, you can create inventory pick documents for individual lines on orders, in a push fashion, based on specified bins and quantities to handle.  

### 2: Create an inventory pick

On the **Inventory Pick** page, the warehouse worker retrieves, in a pull fashion, the source document lines. Alternatively, the inventory pick lines are already created, in a push fashion, by the user who is responsible for the source document.  

### 3: Post an inventory pick

On each line for items that have been picked or moved, partially or fully, fill in the **Quantity** field, and then post the inventory pick. Source documents related to the inventory pick are posted as shipped or consumed.  

For inventory picks, negative item ledger entries are created, warehouse entries are created, and the pick request is deleted, if fully handled. For example, the **Quantity Shipped** field on the outbound source document line is updated. A posted shipment document is created  that reflects the sales order, for example, and the shipped items.  

## Advanced warehouse configurations

The following diagram illustrates the outbound warehouse processes for different types of documents in advanced warehouse configurations. The numbers in the diagram correspond with the steps in the sections following the diagram.  

:::image type="content" source="media/design_details_warehouse_management_outbound_advanced_flow.png" alt-text="Shows the steps in an advanced outbound warehouse flow.":::

### 1: Release a source document

Releasing a source document in advanced configurations does the same thing as for basic configurations. The items become available for handling in the warehouse. For example, they can be included in a shipment.  

### 2: Create a warehouse shipment

On the **Warehouse Shipment** page, get the lines from the released source document. You can combine lines from several source document in one warehouse shipment.  

### 3: Create a warehouse pick

On the **Warehouse Shipment** page, create warehouse pick activities for warehouse shipments in one of two ways:

- In a push fashion, where you use the **Create Pick** action. Select the lines to be picked and prepare the picks by specifying, for example, which bins to take from and place in, and how many units to handle. The bins can be predefined for the warehouse location or resource.
- In a pull fashion, where you use the **Release** action. On the **Pick Worksheet** page, warehouse workers can use the **Get Warehouse Documents** action to get their assigned picks. When the warehouse picks are fully registered, the lines in the **Pick Worksheet** are deleted.

### 4: Register a warehouse pick

On the **Warehouse Pick** page, a warehouse worker fills in the **Quantity** field for each line that they've fully or partially picked, and then registers the pick.

Warehouse entries are created, and the warehouse pick lines are deleted if the full quantity was picked. The warehouse pick document remains open until the full quantity of the warehouse shipment is registered. The **Qty. Picked** field on the warehouse shipment lines is updated accordingly.  

### 5: Post the warehouse shipment

When all items on the warehouse shipment document are registered as picked, the warehouse worker posts the shipment. Posting updates the item ledger entries to reflect the reduction in inventory. For example, the **Quantity Shipped** field on the outbound source document line is updated.

# Create Production Orders from Sales Orders

You can create production orders for produced items directly from sales orders.  

## To create a production order from a sales order  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the sales order you want to create a production order for.  
3. Choose the **Planning** action. The **Sales Order Planning** page shows the availability of the item.  
4. Choose the **Create Prod. Order** action.  
5. Select the status and order type.  
6. Choose the **Yes** button to create one or more production orders for the lines that have **Prod. Order** in their **Replenishment System** field.

    > [!NOTE]  
    > Demand lines that have **Prod. Order** in the **Replenishment System** field represent underlying production orders. After you generate these production orders, remember to identify any unfulfilled component demand for them. Use the **Order Planning** page or the **Replan** action to identify unfulfilled demand.
    >
    > When you create production orders for sales orders with the Sales Order Planning page, order-to-order links are applied between demand and supply. When order-to-order links exist, the planning system doesn't include linked supply or inventory in the balancing procedure. To learn more about balancing, go to [Order-to-order links](design-details-central-concepts-of-the-planning-system.md#order-to-order-links).

## Order type  

The following table describes two ways to create production orders.

|Option|Description|
|------|-----------|
|Item Order|One production order is created for each item represented by a line in the **Sales Order Planning** page.|
|Project Order|One multiline production order is created for all items represented by lines on the **Sales Order Planning** page. When you use project orders, the **Source Type** field of the production order contains **Sales Header**. The order has one line for each sales line item that must be produced.|

# Analyze list page and query data using data analysis feature

> **APPLIES TO:** Public preview in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] 2023 release wave 1 for analyzing list pages. Generally available in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] 2023 release wave 2 for analyzing data from list pages and queries.

This article explains how to use the data analysis feature from list pages and queries. The data analysis lets you analyze data directly from the page, without having to run a report or open another application, such as Excel. The feature provides an interactive and versatile way to calculate, summarize, and examine data. Instead of running reports using different options and filters, you can add multiple tabs that represent different tasks or views on the data. Some examples are: "My customers," "Follow up items," "Recently added vendors," "Sales statistics," or any other view you can imagine.

> [!TIP]
> A good thing about the data analysis feature is that it doesn't change the underlying data of a list page or query. It also doesn't change the layout of the page or query when it isn't in analysis mode. So the best way to learn about what you can do in analysis mode is to try things out.

## Prerequisites

- If you're using [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] version 22, the data analysis feature is in preview. So, an admin must enable it before you can use it. To enable it, go to the **Feature Management** page and switch on **Feature Update: Analysis mode, quickly analyze data directly in Business Central**. [Learn more about Feature Management](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/feature-management).
- In version 23 and later, your account must be assigned the **DATA ANALYSIS - EXEC** permission set or include execute permission on the system object **9640 Allow Data Analysis mode**. As an admin, you can exclude these permissions for users who you don't want to access the analysis mode.

> [!NOTE]
> Some list pages don't offer the **Enter analysis mode** toggle for turning on analysis mode. The reason is that developers can disable analysis mode on specific pages by using the [AnalysisModeEnabled property](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/properties/devenv-analysismodeenabled-property) in AL.

## Get started

Follow these steps to start using the analysis mode.

>[!TIP]
> Analysis mode also includes a Copilot feature called *analysis assist* that can help you get started. [Learn more about analysis assist with Copilot.](analysis-assist.md)

1. Open the list page or query.

   For example, to work with the **Customer Ledger Entries** page, select the ![Magnifying glass that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png) icon (<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Q</kbd>), enter *customer ledger entries*, and then choose the related link. 

1. In the action bar at the top of the page, select the **Enter analysis mode** ![Shows the button for turning on analysis mode](media/analysis-mode-icon.png) button.

    The analysis mode opens the data in an experience that's optimized for data analysis. While in analysis mode, the normal action bar is replaced with a special analysis mode bar. The following figure illustrates the different areas of a page in the analysis mode.

   [![Shows an overview of a page in the analysis mode](media/analysis-mode-overview-3.png)](media/analysis-mode-overview-3.png#lightbox)

   Each area is explained in the sections that follow.

1. Use the different areas to manipulate, summarize, and analyze data. See the sections that follow for details.

1. When you want to stop the analysis mode, select the **Leave analysis mode** ![Shows the button for turning off analysis mode](media/analysis-mode-exit-icon.png) button.

   The analysis tabs that you added remain until you delete them. If you return to the analysis mode again, you see them exactly as you left them.

> [!NOTE]
> The data shown in analysis mode is controlled by the filters or views set on the list page. This allows you to pre-filter data before entering analysis mode.

## Work with analysis mode

In the analysis mode, the page is divided into two areas:

- The main area, which consists of the data area (1), summary bar (2), and tabs bar (5).
- The data manipulation area, which consists of two panes: columns (3) and analysis filters (4).

### Data area (1)

The data area is where the rows and columns of the list page query are shown and data is summarized. The data area provides a versatile way to control the layout of columns and a quick way to get a summary of the data. For columns that contain numeric values, the sum of all values in the column is shown in the last row, unless you define row groups. In this case, the sums appear as a subtotal for the groups.  

:::image type="content" source="media/analysis-mode-data-area.png" alt-text="Shows an overview of a data area on a page in the analysis mode" lightbox="media/analysis-mode-data-area.png":::

- To move a column, select it and drag it to where it makes the most sense in your analysis.
- To sort on a column, select the column header. To sort on multiple columns, select and hold the <kbd>Shift</kbd> key while selecting the column headers you want to sort on.
- To access several actions that you can do on columns, right-click the column or hover over it and select the menu icon ![Shows the icon on a column in analysis mode that opens a menu of actions](media/analysis-mode-column-menu-icon.png). For example:

  - To pin a column to the data area so that it doesn't move off the screen when you scroll, select ![Shows the icon on a column in analysis mode that opens a menu of actions](media/analysis-mode-column-menu-icon.png) > **Pin column** > **Pin left** the column part.
  - Define data filters directly on the column definition instead of going to the **Analysis Filters** panes. You can still peek in on details about related data and for each line, and open the card to learn more about a given entity.   
- Use the data area to interact with the data. For columns that contain numeric, summable values, you can get descriptive statistics on a set of fields by marking them. The statistics appear in the status bar (2) along the bottom of the page.

Note that in the data area, you can filter on all columns, including totals such as sum or count. 

:::image type="content" source="media/analysis-mode-filter-on-totals.png" alt-text="Screenshot of how to filter on totals in analysis mode" lightbox="media/analysis-mode-filter-on-totals.png":::

### Summary bar (2)

The summary bar is along the bottom of the page and displays statistics about the data in the list page or query. As you interact with columns whose values can be summed, like selecting multiple rows in a column that displays amounts, the data updates.

:::image type="content" source="media/analysis-mode-totals-row.png" alt-text="Shows an overview of a summary bar on the analysis mode" lightbox="media/analysis-mode-totals-row.png":::

The following table describes the different numbers that are shown in the totals area:

|Number|Description|
|-|-|
|Rows|The number of selected rows as a part of the total number of available rows. |
|Total rows|The number of rows in the unfiltered list or query.|
|Filtered|The number of rows displayed as a result of the filters applied to the list or query.|
|Average|The average value in all the selected summable fields.|
|Count|The number of selected rows.|
|Min|The minimum value in all the selected summable fields.|
|Max|The maximum value in all the selected summable fields.|
|Sum|The sum total of all the values in the selected summable fields.|

### Columns (3)

The **Columns** pane is one of two panes that work together to define your analysis. The other area is the **Analysis filters** pane. The **Columns** pane is used to summarize the data. Use the **Columns** pane to define which columns should be included in the analysis.

:::image type="content" source="media/analysis-mode-columns-3.png" alt-text="Shows an overview of the columns pane in the analysis mode" lightbox="media/analysis-mode-columns-3.png":::

|Areas|Description|
|-|-|
|Search/check or clear all boxes|Search for columns. To select/clear all columns, select the checkbox.|
|Check boxes|This area includes a checkbox for each field in the list's or query's source table. Use this area to change what columns are shown. Select a checkbox to show a column for the field on the page; clear the checkbox to hide the column. |
|Row groups|Use this area to group and sum data by one or more fields. You can only include non-numeric fields, like text, date, and time fields. Row groups are used often in pivot mode.|
|Values|Use this area to specify fields that you want a sum total for. You can only include fields that contain numbers that can be added together; for example, not text, date, or time fields.|

To move a field from one area to another, select the grab icon ![Shows the button for grabbing a field in the analysis mode](media/column-grab-icon.png) next to the column in the list and drag it into the target area. You're prevented from moving a field to an area where it isn't allowed.

> [!NOTE]
> If you use personalization to add or remove fields from a list page, your choice of visibility is reflected in the **Columns** pane. An added field has the **Show** checkbox cleared. To include the added field in an analysis definition, select the checkbox in the **Columns** pane. To learn more about personalization, go to [Add/remove fields and columns on a page](ui-personalization-user.md#fields).

### Analysis filters (4)

The **Analysis filters** pane lets you set further data filters on columns to limit the entries in the list. Set filters on columns to limit the entries in the list and subsequent sums to only those entries you're interested in based on a criteria you define. For example, suppose you're only interested in data for a specific customer or sales orders that exceed a specific amount. To set a filter, select the column, choose the comparison operation from the list (like **Equals** or **Starts with**), and then enter the value.

:::image type="content" source="media/analysis-mode-filters-2.png" alt-text="Shows an overview of the filters pane in the analysis mode" lightbox="media/analysis-mode-filters-2.png":::

> [!NOTE]
> The additional filters only apply to the current analysis tab. This allows you to define exactly the extra data filters that are needed for a specific analysis.

### Tabs (5)

The tabs area at the top lets you create different configurations (columns and analysis filters) on separate tabs, where you can manipulate data on the tabs independently of each other. There's always at least one tab, called **Analysis 1** by default. Adding more tabs is beneficial for saving frequently used analysis configurations on a dataset. For example, you might have tabs for analyzing data in the pivot mode, and other tabs that filter to a subset of rows. Some tabs might show a detailed view with many columns, and others only display a few key columns.

Here are some pointers on working with multiple analysis tabs:

- To add a new tab, select the large **+** sign next to the last analysis tab.
- Select the down arrow on a tab to access a list of actions you can do on a tab, like rename, duplicate, delete, and move.

   - **Delete** deletes the tab you currently have open. **Delete All** deletes all tabs that you added, except the default **Analysis 1** tab.
- You can't completely remove the **Analysis 1**, but you can rename it by using the **Rename** action and clear the changes you made by using **Delete** or **Delete All**.  

- The analysis tabs that you add and configure remain until you delete them. If you return to the analysis mode, they're exactly as you left them.

   > [!TIP]
   > The tabs that you set up are only visible to you. Other users will only see tabs they've set up.
- You can copy analysis tabs. Copying can be useful, for example, for experimenting with changing a tab without changing the original. Copying is also useful if you want to create different variations of the same analysis.

## Date hierarchies

In analysis mode, date fields of the dataset are generated in a Year-Quarter-Month hierarchy of three separate fields. This hierarchy is based on the normal calendar, not any fiscal calendars defined in Business Central.

The extra fields are named *\<field name\> Year*, *\<field name\> Quarter*, and *\<field name\> Month*. For example, if the dataset includes a field called *Posting Date*, then the corresponding date hierarchy consists of fields called *Posting Date Year*, *Posting Date Quarter*, and *Posting Date Month*.

> [!NOTE]
> The date hierarchy currently only applies to fields of type date, not for fields of type datetime.

## Pivot mode

You can use pivot mode to analyze large amounts of numerical data, subtotaling data by categories and subcategories. The pivot mode is like [pivot tables in Microsoft Excel](https://support.microsoft.com/office/create-a-pivottable-to-analyze-worksheet-data-a9a84538-bfe9-40a9-a8e9-f99134456576).

To turn pivot mode on and off, turn on the **Pivot Mode** toggle on the **Columns** pane (3). When you turn on pivot mode, the **Column labels** area appears in the pane. Use the **Column labels** area to group sum totals for rows into categories. Fields that you add to the **Column labels** area show as columns in the data area (1).

Building out the data analysis in pivot mode involves moving fields into the three areas: **Row groups**, **Columns labels**, and **Values**. The following figure illustrates where the fields map to the data area (1), where `sum` is the calculated data, and optionally **Values**.

<table>
<tr><th></th><th>Column label</th><th></th><th>Column label</th><th></th></tr>
<tr><th>Row group</th><th>Value</th><th>Value</th><th>Value</th><th>Value</th></tr>
<tr><td>row</td><td>sum</td><td>sum</td><td>sum</td><td>sum</td></tr>
<tr><td>row</td><td>sum</td><td>sum</td><td>sum</td><td>sum</td></tr>
<tr><td>row</td><td>sum</td><td>sum</td><td>sum</td><td>sum</td></tr>
<tr><td>row</td><td>sum</td><td>sum</td><td>sum</td><td>sum</td></tr>
</table>

> [!TIP]
> Columns that only have a few possible values are the best candidates for using in column **Values**.

## Want to Export data to Excel?

Right-click on the data area or a selection of cells to export data.

:::image type="content" source="media/data-analysis-export-to-excel.png" alt-text="Screenshot of how to export data from an analysis to Excel":::


## Analyze large amounts of data

If the dataset you want to analyze exceeds 100,000 rows, we suggest you enter an analysis mode that's optimized for large datasets. There are currently two limitations if you switch to this mode: 

- Formatting of fields of the following four data types might change: 

   - currency 
   - decimals (always shown with two decimals) 
   - dates (always shown in the format YYYY-MM-DD)
   - timezones
- Fields that are used in pivot mode and added to column labels must have a low number of distinct values.

   If you enable pivot mode and drag a field into the **Column labels** area, where the underlying data for that field has too many distinct values, your browser tab might become unresponsive. The browser eventually closes, requiring you to start over in a new session. In this case, either don't pivot on that field or set a filter on the field before you add it to the **Column labels** area.

## Share data analysis

After you prepare an analysis on a tab, you can share it as a link with coworkers and others in your organization directly from the client. Only recipients who have permission to the company and the data can use the link.

1. On the analysis tab, select the down arrow, and then select **Copy link**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/analysis-mode-copy.png" alt-text="Shows the action for copying an analysis" lightbox="media/analysis-mode-copy.png":::

   The **Link to \<tab name\>** dialog opens.

1. By default, the analysis you share links to the page or query in the company you're currently working in, which is indicated by `company=<company_name>` in the URL field next to the **Copy** button. If you want to send a link to an analysis that isn't associated with a specific company, set the **Company:** field to **Do not link to a specific company**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/analysis-link-copied.svg" alt-text="Shows the copy link dialog for an analysis tab" lightbox="media/analysis-link-copied.svg":::

1. Select **Copy**.
1. Paste the link into the communication media of your choice, like Word, Outlook, Teams, or OneNote.
1. Recipients can select the link and open the analysis for the page or query in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. They're prompted to specify a name for the new analysis tab that they create.  

## Examples of how to analyze data

Use the **Data Analysis** feature for quick fact checking and ad hoc analysis:

- If you don't want to run a report.
- If a report for your specific need doesn't exist.
- If you want to quickly iterate to get a good overview on a part of your business.

The following sections provide examples of scenarios for many of the functional areas in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

### Example: Finance (Accounts Receivables)

To see what your customers owe you, maybe broken down into time intervals for when amounts are due, follow these steps:

1. Open the [Customer Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=25) list, and choose :::image type="content" source="media/analysis-mode-icon.png" alt-text="Enter analysis mode."::: to turn on analysis mode.
1. Go to the **Columns** menu and remove all columns (select the box next to the *Search* field on the right).
1. Turn on the **Pivot Mode** toggle (located above the **Search** field on the right).
1. Drag the **Customer Name** field to the **Row Groups** area, and drag **Remaining Amount** to the **Values** area.
1. Drag the **Due Date Month** field to the **Column Labels** area.
1. Use the **Analysis Filters** menu (located below the **Columns** menu on the right) to apply a filter and analyze data for a given year or quarter.
1. Rename your analysis tab to **Aged Accounts by Month**, or something that describes this analysis.

### Ad hoc data analysis examples by functional area

Many of the functional areas in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] have articles with ad hoc data analysis examples.

[!INCLUDE[ad-hoc-analysis-scenarios-table](includes/ad-hoc-analysis-scenarios-table.md)]

## Limitations in 2023 release wave 1 (preview)

The public preview of this feature has the following limitations:

- The analysis mode view has a limit of 100,000 rows. If you exceed this, you get a message telling you so. To work around this limitation, set filters on the page before you switch to analysis mode, if possible. For example, you want to analyze a certain group of customers or only want data from the current year. You can also choose a predefined view if it would work for your analysis.
- The share data analysis feature isn't available.
- The ability to save preferred data analysis choices on list pages and save analysis menus per analysis tab are currently not available.

# The Troubleshooting FA Ledger Entries Extension
Use the Troubleshooting FA Ledger Entries extension to round depreciation and acquisition amounts in fixed asset ledger entries to whole numbers. For example, to round an amount of 30,000.44 to 30,000. Typical causes of rounding issues are data migration, suddenly starting to post amounts to the general ledger, or customizations you've made to your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

The Troubleshooting FA Ledger Entries extension is pre-installed and ready to go. If you remove the extension, but want to install it again, you can find it on AppSource.

## Troubleshooting Fixed Asset Ledger Entries
When you open the **Fixed Asset Card** page for the first time, the **FA Ledger Entries Scan** job queue entry is scheduled to monitor amounts every Sunday. If it finds amounts that you might want to round, a notification will display the next time you open the Fixed Asset Card page. The notification provides a **See more** option that opens the **FA Ledger Entries with Rounding Issues** page, which lists the entries with amounts that you might want to round. To round the amounts, choose the entries, and then choose the **Accept Selection** action. You can use the **Find entries with issues** action to update the list with new issues that occurred after the job queue entry ran on the previous Sunday.

# Creating cost budgets

Budgeting in cost accounting resembles budgeting in the general ledger. A cost budget is created based on cost types just as a budget for the general ledger is created based on general ledger accounts.  

A cost budget is created for a certain period of time, for example, a fiscal year. You can create as many cost budgets as needed. You can create a new cost budget manually, or by importing a cost budget, or by copying an existing cost budget as the budget base. For more information, see [Create G/L Budgets](finance-how-create-budgets.md).

You use the following pages to create and analyze cost budgets. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon to find a page, and then read the tooltip for each.

# Process partial shipments

In a partial shipment, an order isn't all shipped at once. For example, from an order for 100 units, you ship 40 units immediately and 60 units later. There are no limits on the number of shipments that can be made for an order.

However, before you can use partial shipments in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you must specify that the customer accepts partial shipments by setting the **Shipping Advice** field on the **Customer Card** page. Alternatively, if the customer only accepts complete shipments but then requests or agrees with a partial shipment for a specific sales order, you can change the **Shipping Advice** field before posting.

By default, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] sets the field in the **Customer Card** page as **Partial**, which allows partial shipments. However, if the field is set to specify **Complete**, the **Qty. to Ship** field appears blocked in sales orders for that customer.

# Handling Lot Sizes in Production
In terms of quantity, the number of items you produce in a production operation might not correlate to how sell them. For example, you might produce hundreds of items in a single lot, but sell each item individually. When you configure your production routes and bills of materials (BOMs), there are few nuances you should consider with regards to lot sizes. This topic describes how lot sizes impact cost calculations and resource planning.

## Units of Measure in Production Bill of Materials
Although you specify the base unit of measure (UOM) for an item, your BOM might use a different UOM for the finished product. For example, the base UOM for an item might be PCS, but your BOM might call for pallet or ton. This comes in handy when your machines or raw components dictate the volume. For example, you probably wouldn't want to bake a single muffin because it is difficult to use a portion of an egg. Instead, you bake a batch of muffins to reduce waste. For more information, see [Create Production BOMs](production-how-to-create-production-boms.md).

## Lot size on routing lines
From a routing perspective, you can specify a lot size on routing lines to align with the capacity of the machines that produce the items. The run time on routing lines is reduced proportionally to the lot size. 

This works well when the quantity on a production order is a factor of the lot size on the route. For example, if your baking sheet can hold 10 muffins, you should bake 10, 20, 30, and so on, and not 5 nor 15.  This is much less of an issue if you are dealing with large quantities.

Lot size is also popular in manufacturing environments where output is measured as quantity you can make during fixed amount of time. Example, if Volume per 9 hour shift is 25000 cubic feet, you can set run time as 9 hours and lot size as 25000.
The production order quantity becomes less important as on the production order the run time gets calculated as the Run time / Lot size to get the run time per piece.
 
> [!NOTE]
> The value defined in Lot size doesn't have impact on time specified in **Setup Time** field of the routing line. The setup will happen only one time, even if there are several lots. For example, so that you don’t need to warm the oven for the second lot of muffins. For more information, see [Create Routings](production-how-to-create-routings.md).

## Lot Sizes for Items and Stockkeeping Units
Lot sizes defined for routings are not the same as lot sizes for items or stockkeeping units. Those values are used for a different purpose, and do not affect production capacity. 

## Lot size on item and stockkeeping units
For items and stockkeeping units, lot sizes have the following effects on cost calculation and supply planning:

* For standard cost calculation, if you enable **Cost Incl Setup** on the **Manufacturing Setup** page, the cost for the setup is added to the standard cost. If you specify a lot size, the setup cost for routing operation will be reduced according to one lot size. For example, if your lot size defined on item card is 10, and it takes 15 minutes to heat the oven, the cost of the fuel will be allocated to the 10 muffins as roughly 1.5 minutes. 

> [!NOTE]
> Setup costs are handled differently from a standard cost and capacity allocation perspectives. If produced quantity doesn't match lot size defined in the item card that will lead to variation. For more information, see [Managing Inventory Costs](finance-manage-inventory-costs.md). <!--not sure that I got this part right seems to repeat the first example.-->

For supply planning, the lot size setting on items works with the **Default Dampener %** on the **Manufacturing Setup** page. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will ignore changes in demand that are below the dampener percentage and will not create planning suggestions. For example, 15 is specified in the Default Dampener % field, and we have a production order for 20 muffins to feed 20 guests, but one guest cannot attend. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will ignore the single missing guest because it's only 10% of the lot size 10 defined on the item. However, if two guests cannot make it, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will suggest that we reduce the order quantity because two is 20% of the lot size. For more information about planning, see [Planning](production-planning.md).

# Track items with serial, lot, and package numbers

You can assign serial numbers, lot numbers, and package numbers to any outbound or inbound document, and its posted item tracking entries display on the related item ledger entries. You track items on the **Item Tracking Lines** page, which you can open from inbound or outbound documents.

The quantity fields at the top of the **Item Tracking Lines** page display the quantities and sums of item tracking numbers that are defined on the lines. The quantities must correspond to those on the document lines, which is indicated by *0* in the **Undefined** fields.

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] updates the availability information on the **Item Tracking Lines** page when you open the page. It doesn't update the information while you have the page open, even if changes occur in inventory or on other documents during that time.

> [!NOTE]  
> In order for the features described in this article to work, you must set up item tracking. To learn more, go to [Set Up Item Tracking with Serial, Lot, and Package Numbers](inventory-how-setup-item-tracking.md).

## Item tracking availability

When you work with serial, lot, and package numbers, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates availability information and shows it on various item tracking pages. It shows how much of a lot, package, or serial number is used on other documents. This information helps reduce errors and uncertainty caused by double allocations.

On the **Item Tracking Lines** page, a warning icon might display in the **Availability, Lot No.** or **Availability, Serial No.** field for the following reasons:

* If some or all of the quantity you've selected is already used in other documents.
* If the lot or serial number isn't available.

The **Lot No./Serial No.-List**, **Lot No./Serial No.-Availability**, and the **Item Tracking - Select Entries** pages show the quantity of an item that's in use. The following table lists the relevant fields.

|Field|Description|
|-----|-----------|  
|**Total Quantity**|The total number of an item currently in inventory.|
|**Total Requested Quantity**|The total number of items that are requested in this and other documents.|
|**Current Pending Quantity**|The number of items that are requested on the current document but that isn't posted.|
|**Current Requested Quantity**|The number of items that are requested that will be used on the current document|
|**Total Available Quantity**|The total number of items in inventory, minus the quantity of the item that's requested on this and other documents (total requested quantity), and minus the quantity that's requested but not yet posted on this document (current pending quantity).|

If you work on the **Item Tracking Lines** page for a long time, or if there's a lot of activities with the item you're working with, you can choose the **Refresh Availability** action. Also, the availability of the item is automatically rechecked when you close the page to confirm that there aren't availability problems.

## To assign serial or lot numbers during an inbound transaction

You might want to track items from the moment they arrive. In that case, the purchase order is often the central document. However, you can do item tracking from any inbound document and its posted entries display in the related item ledger entries.

The tracking numbers automatically transfer to all outbound warehouse activities.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Either open an existing purchase order or create a new purchase order.
3. Select the document line, and on the **Lines** FastTab, choose the **Line** action, and then choose the **Item Tracking Lines** action to open the **Edit - Item Tracking Lines** page.  

   You can assign serial or lot numbers in the following ways:  
   * Automatically, by selecting **Process** then choosing **Assign Serial No.** or **Assign Lot No.** to assign serial/lot numbers from predefined number series.  
   * Automatically, by selecting **Process** then choosing **Create Customized SN** to assign serial/lot numbers based on number series you define specifically for the arrived items.  
   * Manually, by entering serial or lot numbers directly, for example, the vendor's numbers.  
   * Manually, by assigning a specific number to each item unit.  

4. To assign automatically, choose the **Create Customized SN** action.  
5. In the **Customized SN** field, enter the starting number of a descriptive serial number series. For example **S/N-Vend0001**.  
6. In the **Increment** field, enter 1 to define that each sequential number increases by one.  

    The **Quantity to Create** field contains the line quantity by default, but you can modify it.  

7. Select the **Create New Lot No.** checkbox to organize the new serial numbers in a distinct lot.  
8. Choose the **OK** button.  

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates a lot number with individual serial numbers according to the item quantity on the document line. The number is prefixed with the value you entered in the **Customized SN** field. For example, starting from **S/N-Vend0001**.  

The quantity fields in the header dynamically display the quantities and sums of the item tracking numbers you define on the page. The quantities must correspond to those on the document lines, which is indicated by **0** in the **Undefined** field.  

When you post the document, the item tracking entries transfer to the item ledger entries.

### To handle serial and lot numbers when getting receipt lines from a purchase invoice

When you get posted receipt or shipment lines from related invoices or credit memos, item tracking lines on the warehouse documents transfer automatically. However, they're processed in a special way.

The functionality supports the following inbound processes:  

* **Get Receipt Lines** - from a purchase invoice.  
* **Get Return Shipment Lines** - from a purchase credit memo.  

The functionality supports the following outbound processes:  

* **Get Shipment Lines** - from a sales invoice or combined shipments.  
* **Get Return Receipt Lines** - from a sales credit memo.  

In these cases, the item tracking lines transfer to the invoice or credit memo, but the **Item Tracking Lines** page doesn't let you change the serial or lot numbers. You can only change the quantities.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Invoices**, and then select the related link.  
2. Open a purchase invoice for items that are purchase with serial or lot numbers.  
3. From a purchase invoice line, on the **Lines** FastTab, choose the **Get Receipt Lines** action.  
4. On the **Get Receipt Lines** page, select a receipt line that has item tracking lines, and then choose the **OK** button.  

    The source document is copied to the purchase invoice as a new line, and its item tracking lines are copied to the underlying **Item Tracking Lines** page.  

5. On the purchase invoice, select the transferred receipt line.  
6. On the **Lines** FastTab, choose the **Line** action, and then choose the **Item Tracking Lines** action to find the transferred item tracking lines.  

You can't change the **Serial No.** and **Lot No.** fields. However, you can delete complete lines or change the quantities to match changes on the source line.  

## To assign a serial or lot number during an outbound transaction

Outbound handling of serial or lot numbers is a frequent task in different warehouse processes. There are two ways to add serial and lot numbers to outbound transactions:  

* Select from existing serial or lot numbers. This applies when item tracking numbers are already assigned in an inbound transaction.
* Assign new serial or lot numbers for outbound transactions. This applies when item tracking numbers aren't assigned to items until they're sold and ready to ship.

### To select from existing serial or lot numbers  

When you work with items that require item tracking, and you're creating outbound transactions, you'll typically need to select lot or serial numbers that already exist.

1. From any outbound document, select the line that you want to select serial or lot numbers for.  
2. On the **Lines** FastTab, choose the **Line** action, then **Related Information**, and then select **Item Tracking Lines**.  
3. On the **Item Tracking Lines** page, you have three options for specifying lot or serial number:  

   * Select the **Serial No.** field, and then select a number on the **Serial No. List** page.
   * Select the **Lot No.** field, and then select a number on the **Lot No. List** page. Then, select the **Serial No.** field, and select a number on the **Serial No. List** page.
   * Select the **Process** action, and then choose **Select Entries**. The **Select Entries** page shows all lot and serial numbers along with availability information.

4. In the **Selected Quantity** field, enter the quantity of each lot or serial number to use.
5. Choose the **OK** button. The item tracking information transfers to the **Item Tracking Lines** page.  

The quantity fields in the header dynamically display the quantities and sums of the item tracking numbers you define on the page. The quantities must correspond to those of the document line, which is indicated by **0** in the **Undefined** field.  

When you post the document line, the item tracking information transfers to the associated item ledger entries.

### To assign new serial or lot numbers  

This process applies when items don't have serial or lot numbers while they're in inventory. Instead, you assign item tracking numbers when the items are sold and ready to be shipped. In this case, you'll typically assign numbers from a predefined number series.

1. Select the relevant document, for example a sales invoice or sales order, and on the **Lines** FastTab, choose the **Line** action, then **Related Information**, and then choose the **Item Tracking Lines** action.  

    You can assign item tracking numbers in the following ways:  
    * Automatically, from a predefined number series: Choose the **Assign Serial No.** or **Assign Lot No.** action.  
    * Automatically, based on parameters you define specifically for the outbound item: Choose the **Create Customized SN** action.  
    * Manually, by entering serial or lot numbers without using a number series.  

2. For this procedure, assign a serial number automatically by choosing **Assign Serial No.**  

    The **Quantity to Create** field contains the line quantity by default, but you can change it.  
3. Select the **Create New Lot No.** field to organize the new serial numbers in a distinct lot.  
4. Choose the **OK** button to create a lot number and new individual serial numbers according to the quantity to handle on the related document line.  

The quantity fields at the top dynamically display the quantities and sums of the item tracking numbers that you define on the page. The quantities must correspond to those of the document line, which is indicated by **0** in the **Undefined** field.  

When the document is posted, the item tracking entries transfer to the item ledger entries.

### Assign tracking numbers on source documents

Some companies define specific serial or lot numbers on source document, such as sales orders. For example, if a customer requests a specific lot. When you create the inventory pick or warehouse pick document from an outbound source document where serial or lot numbers are already defined, you can't change any fields on the **Item Tracking Lines** page under the inventory pick. The one exception is the **Qty. to Handle** field. In that case, the inventory pick lines specify the item tracking numbers on individual take and place lines. The quantity is already split into unique serial or lot number combinations because the sales order specifies the item tracking numbers to ship.

## To handle serial and lot numbers on transfer orders

Procedures for handling serial and lot numbers that are being transferred between different locations are similar to those applied when items are sold and purchased.  

However, transfer orders are unique in that shipment and receipt are both done from the same transfer line and use the same instance of the **Item Tracking Lines** page. Item tracking numbers that shipped from one location must be received unchanged at the other location.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Transfer Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the transfer order you want to process. On the **Lines** FastTab, choose the **Line** action, choose the **Item Tracking Lines** action, and then choose the **Shipment** action.  
3. On the **Item Tracking Lines** page, assign or select serial or lot numbers as for any other outbound item transaction.  

    When you handle serial and lot numbers for transfer items, numbers are typically already assigned numbers. Therefore, you'll often choose from existing serial or lot numbers.  

4. Post the transfer order, first ship and then receive, to record that the items are transferred and carry their item tracking entries.  

During the transfer, you can't change values on the **Item Tracking Lines** page.  

## To record additional serial or lot number information

If you need to link special information to an item tracking number, for example, for quality assurance, you can do so on a serial or lot number information card.

1. Open a document that has serial or lot numbers assigned.
2. Open the **Item Tracking Lines** page for the item you want to enter information for.
3. Choose the **Line** action and then, for example, the **Serial No. Information Card** action.  
4. Choose the plus sign **(+)** sign at the top of the list to create a new entry. The **Serial No.** and **Lot No.** fields are prefilled from the item tracking line.
5. Enter a short piece of information in the **Description** field, for example about the condition of the item.  
6. Choose the **Related** action, choose the **Serial No.** action, and then choose the **Comment** action to create a separate comment record.  
7. Select the **Blocked** field to exclude the serial or lot number from any transactions.  

<!--If you create serial numbers in bulk by using the **Create Customized SN** or **Assign Serial No.** actions, you can enable **Create SN Information** and an information card will be created for each tracking line.

Alternatively, you can create an information card when you post journals or documents. On the **Item Tracking Code** page, turn on the **Create SN Info. on posting** or **Create SN Info. on posting** toggles. -->

You can modify created serial or lot information cards later.

## To modify existing serial or lot number information

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select an item that has an item tracking code and has serial or lot number information.
3. From the **Item Card** page, choose the **Related** action, choose the **Related** action, choose the **Entries** action, and then choose **Ledger Entries**.
4. Choose the **Lot No.** or **Serial No.** field. If information exists for the item tracking number, then the **Lot No. Information List** or **Serial No. Information List** page opens.  
5. Select a card, and then choose the **Lot No./Serial No. Information Card** action.  
6. Modify the short description text, the comment record, or the **Blocked** field.  

You can't change the serial or lot numbers or quantities. To do that, you must reclassify the item ledger entry. To learn more about reclassification, go to [To reclassify lot or serial numbers](inventory-how-work-item-tracking.md#to-reclassify-serial-or-lot-numbers).

## To reclassify serial or lot numbers

Reclassifying item tracking for an item means changing a lot or serial number to a new lot or serial number, or changing the expiration date to a new expiration date. If you use lots, you can also merge multiple lots into one. Use an item reclassification journal to do these tasks.

> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] verifies that each line has a unique combination of serial, lot, and/or package numbers. If you want to split a lot, package, or a lot and package into several lots or packages, you must use multiple journal lines.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Item Reclassification Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the line with the relevant information. For more information, see [Count Inventory Using Documents](inventory-how-count-inventory-with-documents.md) or [Count, Adjust, and Reclassify Inventory Using Journals](inventory-how-count-adjust-reclassify.md).
3. Choose the **Item Tracking Lines** action.  
4. In the **Serial Nos.** or **Lot Nos.** field, select the current serial or lot number.  
5. If you want to enter a new item tracking number, enter it in the **New Serial No.** or **New Lot No.** field. If you want, you can merge one or more lots to one new or existing lot.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > When you reclassify expiration dates, items with the earliest expiration dates for outbound transactions are suggested first. To learn more, go to [Picking by FEFO](warehouse-picking-by-fefo.md).  

6. To specify a new expiration date for the serial or lot number, enter it in the **New Expiration Date** field.  

    > [!IMPORTANT]  
    > * If you're reclassifying a lot to the same lot number but with a different expiration date, you must reclassify the entire lot using one item reclassification journal line.
    > * If you're reclassifying more than one lot to one new lot number, meaning that you are merging more than one lot into one new lot, you must enter the same new expiration date for all the lots. 
    > * If you're reclassifying one existing lot to a second existing lot that has a different expiration date, you must use the expiration date from the second lot. 
    > * If you leave the **New Expiration Date** field blank, the lot or serial number will be reclassified with a blank expiration date.  

7. If you have existing information on the old serial or lot number, you can copy it to the new serial or lot number.  

    1. On the **Item Tracking Lines** page, choose the **New Serial No. Information** action or the **New Lot No. Information** action.  
    2. To copy information from the old lot or serial number, choose the **Copy Info** action.  
    3. In the information list page, select the lot or serial number that you would like to copy from, and choose the **OK** button.  

8. If you want to modify the existing information for the lot or serial number, you can record lot or serial information.  
9. Post the journal to link the renewed item tracking numbers or expiration dates to the associated item ledger entry

## Scan barcodes with the Business Central mobile app

[!INCLUDE [barcode-mobile-app](includes/barcode-mobile-app.md)]

On the **Item Tracking Lines** page, if you want to scan several serial, lot, or package barcodes, you can use the **Scan multiple** action. After you scan a barcode, its value is entered in the field on the page and the next quick-entry field becomes available. You can also use the barcode scanner icon to populate specific field.

The following tables list the pages that support barcode scanning for item tracking from the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] mobile app.

# Sales by Location (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Sales by Location** report provides an overview of sales performance at locations. It showcases key metrics such as total sales amount, total quantity sold, and cost of goods sold. You can break down the metrics further by specific items sold at each location.

:::image type="content" source="media/powerbi/sales/sales-by-location.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Sales by Location Power BI report" lightbox="media/powerbi/sales/sales-by-location.png":::

## Use the report

Leadership and management teams use the report to help them track revenue and cost breakdown per location. The report is valuable for any organization that operates across multiple locations.

For COOs of retail companies with multiple warehouse locations, it's important to have a high-level view of the sales performance of each location. The overview can help you make informed decisions about resource allocation and expansion plans. You can quickly view the total revenue generated by each location and identify under-performing locations. This information helps you make better decisions about resource allocation to ensure that the organization is operating efficiently and effectively across all locations.

Regional managers who oversee several warehouse locations can track revenue and cost breakdown per location, identify areas for improvement, and adjust sales strategies. Analyze the total sales amount, quantity sold, cost of goods sold, and gross profit for each location to find out which locations perform well and which ones need improvement.

## Key performance indicators

The report includes the following key performance indicators (KPIs) and measures:

- **[Sales Amount](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#sales-amount)**  
- **[Sales Quantity](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#sales-quantity)**  
- **[Cost Amount](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#cost-amount)**  
- **[Cost Amount Non-Inv](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#cost-amount-non-inv)**  
- **[Gross Profit](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#gross-profit)**  
- **[Gross Profit Margin](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#gross-profit-margin)**

# Entering Data

There are many general features that help you enter data easier, faster, and more precise. The basic principles and advanced features for entering data are described in this article.  

[!INCLUDE [about-ui-learn](includes/about-ui-learn.md)]

The examples in this article use the demonstration data.

## Work with editable fields

Fields in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] may contain different editable data, such as text or currency amounts. Editable fields typically display an input box where you can type or choose a value. Non-editable fields are typically displayed with a gray background.

Some editable fields provide a picker to help you specify a value.  

<!-- TODO: Add illustrations or images of each picker -->
|**Picker**        |**How it helps you specify a value**|
|------------------|------------------------------------|
|Date picker       |This picker displays a calendar that is based on your current regional settings. It helps you choose a single date.|
|Dropdown          |Dropdowns provide a choice of fixed values or reference records from another table|
|Switch or Checkbox|Some fields provide a simple choice of *Yes* or *No* values. The switch is used to specify this value, and is always displayed as a checkbox in lists|
|Assist edit       |Some fields provide custom pickers that are suited to looking up and choosing the best value for that field, such as popup window|

### Modifying a field value

To modify the value of a field, you must first set focus to that field. You set focus by doing the following actions:

- Use the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key. The action selects the entire value.
- Left-click your mouse or similar input device. This action will only select the entire field value if the field is in a list.  

When you interact with fields in the user interface, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] typically favors selecting the entire field value to make it easier for you to replace that value.

When the entire field value is selected:

- Replace the value by just typing to specify a new value. If the field offers a picker, you can activate it using the <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Down Arrow</kbd> keyboard shortcut.
- Use the <kbd>Delete</kbd> or <kbd>Backspace</kbd> key to clear the value.

select the <kbd>F2</kbd> key to toggle between selecting the entire field value or placing the cursor after the field's value. Placing the cursor at the end of the value makes it easier for you to append to the existing value.

When the cursor is shown at the end of the field value:
- Add to the value by just typing.
- Use the <kbd>Home</kbd>, <kbd>End</kbd>, <kbd>Left Arrow</kbd>, and <kbd>Right Arrow</kbd> keys to move the cursor within the value. If you're editing a field in a list, selecting the <kbd>Left Arrow</kbd> key again when the cursor is at the beginning of the value will set focus to the previous field. Similarly, selecting the <kbd>Right Arrow</kbd> key again when the cursor is at the end of the value will set focus to the next field.

> [!NOTE]
> After you specify a value, Business Central will only check that it's valid after you click outside the field or set focus to another element, such as the next field.  

[!INCLUDE [background_doc_journal_check](includes/background_doc_journal_check.md)]

## Use Copilot's autofill feature to assist in filling in fields (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner-section.md)]

When drafting a new record or editing an existing record, Copilot can suggest values for editable fields on the page. Learn more in [Autofill fields with Copilot (preview)](autofill-fields-with-copilot.md).

## Keyboard Shortcuts

There are several keyboard shortcuts that let you work "mouse-free" and speed up your data entry. These keyboard shortcuts are especially useful with large-scale entries and repetitive typing tasks.

For more information about shortcuts, see [Keyboard Shortcuts](keyboard-shortcuts.md). A few of the keyboard shortcuts are discussed in this article.

## <a name="QuickEntry"></a>Accelerating Data Entry Using Quick Entry

Quick Entry is a feature designed for data entry when using the keyboard. Quick Entry works on fields (like on card pages) and in lists (rows and columns). It's beneficial when doing repetitive typing tasks that require creating multiple records in sequence. Examples include a batch of sales orders or registering new items.

You can use the Tab key to navigate from one field on a page to the next editable field. A disadvantage of using Tab is that it always goes sequentially to the next field. <!-- even if the field is non-editable or seldom filled it in.-->Quick Entry lets you change this path. With Quick Entry, you use the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key to navigate through only those fields that you're interested in. Quick Entry skips non-editable fields and fields that you typically don't fill in. You might have already noticed this behavior on some pages. This behavior is because the fields to include when pressing Enter and which ones to skip have been predefined. You can customize Quick Entry by personalizing your workspace and optimizing how you enter data on each page.

### How Quick Entry Works

Every field can be marked as either *included in Quick Entry* or *excluded from Quick Entry*. Fields that are included in Quick Entry will be included in the path when you select <kbd>Enter</kbd>. Fields that are excluded from Quick Entry won't.

When you're finished entering data in a field, you simply select <kbd>Enter</kbd> to confirm the changes and go to the next field. If you want to reverse direction, and go the previous field, select <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd>. For more information about shortcuts, see [Quick Entry Shortcuts for Fields](keyboard-shortcuts.md#QuickEntry).

#### Tips and Tricks

The following list provides some useful information about using Quick Entry.

- It's available for any editable fields.
- It also works across columns and rows.
- It doesn't prevent accessing other elements of a page, such as actions. These elements are still accessible by using <kbd>Tab</kbd> and <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd>.  
- It's not required that FastTabs are expanded for Quick Entry to work. If the next Quick Entry field is located in a collapsed FastTab, that FastTab will automatically expand and focus on the chosen field. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will remember that the FastTab should be expanded next time you visit the page.  
- Quick Entry works no matter whether fields are mandatory. So it's a good idea to ensure that mandatory fields are included in Quick Entry.
- By default, most fields are automatically included in Quick Entry. So initially your task will most likely be excluding fields from Quick Entry.

### To change Quick Entry fields

To set up Quick Entry on fields, you use personalization.

1. Start personalization by selecting the ![Settings.](media/ui-experience/settings_icon_small.png "Settings icon for role center") icon, and then the **Personalize** action.
2. Select a field that you want change. In lists, select the corresponding column heading. Then, choose either **Include in Quick Entry** or **Exclude from Quick Entry**.

For more information about personalization, see [Personalize Your Workspace](ui-personalization-user.md).

## Mandatory Fields

When you enter data on pages, certain fields are marked with a red asterisk. The red asterisk means that the field must be filled to complete a certain process. An example is when you post a transaction that uses the value in the field.  

Although a field is mandatory, you aren't forced to fill the field before you continue to other fields or close the page. The red asterisk only serves as a reminder that you'll be blocked from completing a certain process.  

## Finding Data As You Type

 When you start to type characters in a field, a drop-down list is displayed and shows possible field values. The list changes as you type more characters, and you can select the correct value when it's displayed.  

 Many fields have a down arrow button that you can choose. You choose the arrow to get a list of data that is available to enter in the field. The button has two functions depending on the type of field:  

- Lookup - Displays information from another table that you can enter in the field. You can select one piece of data at a time.  

- Drop-down - Displays the set of options that exist for the field. You can select only one of the options.  

## Copying and Pasting FAQ Fields and Lines

You can copy one or more rows from a list or a single field on a page. Then paste what you copied into the same page, another page, or an external document. You could, for example, paste to Microsoft Excel or Outlook email. In short, to copy, select <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> (cmd+C in macOS) on your keyboard. To paste, select <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>V</kbd> or <kbd>cmd+V</kbd> in macOS.

In a list, to copy the field in the same column of the row above, and paste it into the current row, just select <kbd>F8</kbd>.

For more information, see [Copying and Pasting FAQ](faq-copy-paste.yml).

## Filtering Line Items

To start filtering, select ![Filter pane icon](media/open-filter-pane-icon.png "Filter pane icon") at the top of the list or select <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>F3</kbd> to open the filter pane. You work with the filter pane as you do on any other list. For more information, see [Filtering](ui-enter-criteria-filters.md#filtering).

Filtering is especially helpful when viewing and analyzing longer documents. Imagine you open a posted sales invoice. Then, you filter the line items to display all line items that have an individual discount above 5%. Or, you filter to display only bike accessories with 'pro' in the name.

## <a name="Focus"></a>Focusing on Line Items

When working on documents that include a line items part, you can switch your view to focus only on the line items. Example documents are sales order or invoice page. The line items part expands so that it occupies almost the entire workspace. It hides other parts of the page except the actions area at the top. This layout gives you a better overview of the lines items, and provides more room to work on them.

You'll benefit particularly when you work with large line item lists and you want to enter data fast. This feature also provides advanced filtering capability. Like on other lists, browsing and searching through line items becomes even easier.

### Switching the Focus On and Off

To focus on lines items, select anywhere in the line item part, and then choose ![Focus Mode icon.](media/focus-mode.png "Focus mode icon") in the upper right corner, or select <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>F12</kbd>.

To switch back to the normal view, choose ![Focus Mode icon.](media/focus-mode.png "Focus mode icon") or select <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>F12</kbd> again.

## Multitasking Across Multiple Pages

You can open a card or document page in a new window. Opening a new window lets you:

- Work on multiple tasks at the same time
- Manage interruptions to the current task, such as taking an incoming call.
- Keep a window open for an ongoing task while you start or complete another task in windows.

To open the current card or document in a new window, choose ![Open New Window.](media/open-new-window-icon.png "Open new window icon") in the upper right corner, or select <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>W</kbd>.

<!--
When working on multiple tasks at a time or when managing interruptions to the current task, such as taking an incoming call, you can open a card or document page in a new window. This allows you to keep a window open for an ongoing task while you start or complete another task in one or more other windows.
-->

> [!NOTE]
> When you open other pages from a card or document that is opened in a new window, those pages will open in a new window even though you don't choose ![Open New Window.](media/open-new-window-icon.png "Open new window icon").

> [!NOTE]
> If you work in the Safari browser, a pop-up blocker may cause the new window to not open. If this is the case, specify the product URL as an allowed website. For information see, [Change preferences in Safari](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=2102965).<br /><br />
> The same may happen in other browsers, such as Firefox. For more information, see [Pop-up blocker settings in Firefox](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=2116400).  

Another way to multitask is to open [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on two or more browser tabs. When you do it this way, you should create a new tab and then copy/paste the URL of the original tab into the new tab. This way creates a new session.   

> [!NOTE]
> Don't use the **Duplicate** function of the browser to create the new tab as this may cause actions on one tab to block actions on other tabs because they are part of the same session.

## Entering Quantities by Calculation

When entering numbers into quantity fields, such as the **Quantity** field on an item journal line, you can enter the formula instead of the sum quantity.  

### Examples  

- If you enter 19+19, the field is calculated to 38.  

- If you enter 41-9, the field is calculated to 32.  

- If you enter 12*4, the field is calculated to 48.  

- If you enter 12/4, the field is calculated to 3.  

## Entering Negative Numbers

You can enter negative numbers in two ways. The number -20.5 can be entered as:  

- -20.5  

  or
- 20.5-  

In both cases, the amount will be recorded in as -20.5.  

If the last character of the expression is a **+** or a **-**, the entire expression will be recorded with that sign. An example, **10-20+** will result in 10 and not -10.  

## Entering Dates and Times

You can enter dates and times in all the fields that are assigned to dates (date fields). You can enter dates with or without separators.

> [!NOTE]  
> How you enter dates and times depends on your **Region** settings. For more information, see [Change Basic Settings](ui-change-basic-settings.md).  

### Entering Dates

You can either use the data picker to select a date from a calendar, or you can enter dates manually. This section provides a brief overview of how to enter dates. For more information, see [Work with Calendar Dates and Times](ui-enter-date-ranges.md).

For manually date entry, you can enter two, four, six, or eight digits:  

- Two digits are interpreted as the day. It will add the month and the year of the work date.  

- Four digits are interpreted as the day and the month. It will add the year of the work date.  

- If the date you want is in the range 01/01/1950 through 12/31/2049, enter the year with two digits. Otherwise, enter the year with four digits.

  > [!NOTE]
  > If you're using [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, the two-digit year range may be different. Administrators can change the range by modifying the **CalendarTwoDigitYearMax** setting of the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] server. For more information, see [Configuring Business Central Server](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/configure-server-instance#General).

You can also enter a date as a weekday followed by a week number. Or, you can enter a year. For example, Mon25 or mon25 means Monday in week 25.  

Instead of entering a specific date, you can enter one of these codes.  

|Code|Result|  
|--------------|----------------|  
|t|Specifies today's date (the system date for the computer).|  
|p|Specifies an accounting period, where p means the first accounting period, p2 means the second accounting period, and so on. |
|w|Specifies the work date that is set up in the application. To change the work date, see [Changing Basic Settings](ui-change-basic-settings.md). You may want to use a work date if you have many transactions with a date other than today's date.|
|c|Specifies that the date after c is a closing date, for example C123101.|  

## Entering Times

When you enter times, you can insert any separator sign that you want between the units, but it isn't required. You don't have to write minutes, seconds, or AM/PM.  

The following table lists the various ways in which times can be entered and how they're interpreted.  

|Entry|Interpretation|  
|---------------|------------------------|  
|5|05:00:00|  
|5:30|05:30:00|  
|0530|05:30:00|  
|5:30:5|05:30:05|  
|053005|05:30:05|  
|5:30:5,50|05:30:05.5|  
|053005050|05:30:05.05|  

 You enter two digits for each unit of time if you don't enter a separator.  

## Entering Combined Datetimes

[!INCLUDE [datetimes](includes/datetimes.md)]

## Entering Duration

You enter a duration as a number followed by its unit of measure.  

Here are some examples.  

|Duration|Unit of measure**|  
|------------------|-------------------------|  
|2h|2 hrs|  
|6h 30 m|6 hrs 30 mins|  
|6.5h|6 hrs 30 mins|  
|90m|1 hr 30 mins|  
|2d 6h 30m|2 days 6 hrs 30 mins|  
|2d 6h 30m 56s 600ms|2 days 6 hrs 30 mins 56 secs 600 msecs|  

 You can also enter a number and it's automatically converted to a duration. The number you enter is converted according to the default unit of measure that has been specified for the duration field.  

 To see the unit of measure used in a duration field, enter a number and see which unit of measure it's converted to.  

 The number 5 is converted to 5 hrs, if the unit of measure is hours.  

## <a name="decimal"></a>Setting the decimal separator used by numeric keyboards

When using the <kbd>Decimal Separator</kbd> key on a numeric keypad to enter data, the actual decimal separator that's entered in the field is determined by your region setting in Business Central. Most regions use the period (.) or comma (,) symbol as a separator for decimal values, as you would typically see in currency amounts. The decimal key on your keypad adapts to your region. It's often different to the period or comma keys on the rest of your keyboard. You set the region in Business Central on the **My Settings**  page.

For example, suppose you're using a numeric keyboard that uses a period (.) as the <kbd>Decimal Separator</kbd> key. But you're entering data for a regional language that uses a comma (**,**) for the decimal separator, like French (France). So, you want decimals like "1.23" to be entered as "1,23". In this case, you can go to the **My Settings** page and set the **Region** to the target regional language to **French (France)**. For more information, see [Change Basic Settings](ui-change-basic-settings.md#region).

> [!TIP]
> There may be occasions when you want to use the decimal separator to enter a period (.). For example, suppose you were entering a date range in a filter, like `01/01/2022..04/01/2022`, or anything that requires a period. To accommodate this case, select the <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Decimal Separator</kbd> keys on the numeric keyboard. This key combination switches the decimal separator between outputting a period and the decimal separator as determined by the **Region** setting.

# Customize pages for profiles

Business Central provides both [personalization](ui-personalization-user.md) for users and customization for administrators. Personalization allows users to tailor their workspace by adjusting page layouts to suit their own preferences. Administrators can customize page layouts for a specific profile, based on business roles or departments, so that all assigned users see the same customized page. While personalization allows users to show, hide, and move fields and actions on a page, customization offers extra capabilities. For example, customization allows you to show fields that are in the page's source table or extension tables but aren't defined on the page object&mdash;this isn't possible personalization.  <!--For more information, see [Personalize Your Workspace](ui-personalization-user.md).-->

<!--Similarly, administrators can customize pages for a profile, according to the related business role or department, so that all users assigned the profile see the customized page layout. As an administrator, you customize pages by using the same functionality as users do when they personalize pages, except with few extra capabilities. Like personalization, you can show, hide, and move fields, actions, or parts on a page. But while personalization only allows you to work with fields that are defined on the page object, customization allows you add fields that are in the source table or table extension, but not defined on the page object. -->

> [!NOTE]
> The typical business use of a profile is a role. A profile is therefore named *Profile (Role)* in the UI.

Page customization starts from the **Profiles (Roles)** page, the administrator's starting point for managing users' profiles on individual profile cards. In addition to customizing the page layout, you control various other settings for profiles on the **Profile (Role)** page for each profile. For more information, see [Manage Profiles](admin-users-profiles-roles.md).

## Prerequisites

- Your Business Central account must have the **D365 Profile Mgt.** permission set or equivalent permissions. 

   The **D365 Profile Mgt.** permission set includes the execute permission on the system object **9026 Add Field to Table**. If you don't have this permission, you're not allowed to add fields on the page unless they're defined on the page object. 

## Customize pages for a profile

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Profiles (Roles)**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the line for the profile that you want to customize pages for, and then choose the **Edit** action.
3. Choose the **Customize pages** action.

    [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] opens on a new browser tab for the selected profile with the **Customizing** banner activated. The **Customizing** banner offers the same functionality as the **Personalizing** banner that is available to users.

4. Customize pages according to the needs of the role or department in question in the same way as a user would do when personalizing. For more information, see [Personalize Your Workspace](ui-personalization-user.md).

    > [!NOTE]
    > To navigate during personalization, use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Click</kbd> on an action if it is highlighted by the arrowhead.

5. When you have finished changing the layout on one or more pages, choose the **Done** button on the **Customizing** banner.
6. Close the browser tab.

The customization of pages is now recorded for the profile.

## View all customized pages for a profile

You can get an overview of which pages are customized for a profile, for example to plan which pages to customize further or delete.

- On the **Profile (Role)** page, choose the **Manage customized pages** action.

On the **Customized Pages** page, you can delete customizations, and you can troubleshoot by scanning for potential issues.  

## Delete all customizations for a profile

You can cancel all customizations that you have made for a profile. Customizations introduced with an extension and personalizations made by a user aren't deleted. You can delete all personalizations with another action. For more information, see [To delete all personalizations made by a user](admin-users-profiles-roles.md#delete-all-personalizations-made-by-a-specific-user).

- On the **Profile (Role)** page for a customized profile, choose the **Clear customized pages** action.

The layout on pages for the profile is reset to the default layout.  

## Delete customization for specific pages for a profile

You can delete individual page customizations that you have made for a profile. Customizations introduced with an extension and personalizations made by a user aren't deleted. You can delete specific page personalizations with another action. For more information, see [To delete personalizations for specific pages](admin-users-profiles-roles.md#delete-personalizations-for-specific-pages).

1. On the **Profile (Role)** page, choose the **Manage customized pages** action.
2. On the **Customized Pages** page, select one or more lines for page customizations that you want to delete, and then choose the **Delete** action.

The layout on the selected pages is adjusted to the changes you made.

## Add a field

You add fields to the page from the **Add field to page** pane, which you open by selecting the **+ Field** action when in the customization mode. It's important to understand that the **Add field to page**  pane is used to show fields that already exist&mdash;either on the page and its source tables,&mdash;but are currently hidden from view. You can't create new fields.

The **Add field to page** pane presents all fields that can be shown on the page. Fields are divided into the following categories, as determined by the underlying design of the page itself, its source table, and extensions:

|Category|Description|
|-|-|
|Table fields not on the page object|Includes fields that are defined in the base table or extension tables, but aren't defined on the page. The tooltip for these fields includes the label **Defined by the table**.<br><br>|
|Page fields bound to a table|Includes fields that are defined in the base table or table extensions and are also defined on the page as either shown or hidden. The tooltip for these fields includes the label **Defined by the page**.|
|Page fields that aren't bound to a table| Fields that are only defined on the page, not in the base table or extension tables. These fields typically used for variable or calculation. The tooltip for these fields includes the label **Defined by the page**.|

<!--
- Table fields not on the page object. Includes fields that are defined in the base table or extension tables, but aren't defined on the page, either as shown or hidden.   
- Page fields bound to a table. Includes fields that are defined in the base table or table extensions and are also defined on the page as either shown or hidden. 
 - Page fields that are not bound to a table. Fields that are Includes fields that are only defined on the page, not in base table or extension table. These fields typically used for variable or calculation. -->

Use the filter button above the list to change what category of fields are presented the **Add field to page** pane.  

:::image type="content" source="media/customization-filter.svg" alt-text="Shows the filter button in the Add a field pane in the customization mode.":::
 
### Add table field that's not on the page object

If you want to make a table-only field available on a page to users, you must first add it to the page. Once you've added the field, users can choose to show or hide the field by using personalization. There are couple ways to add a field.

- One way is to drag it from  **Add field to page** pane to the desired position.
- Another way is to select the field in the pane to display the recommended location on the page. Then go to the field location on the pages, select the arrowhead, then select **Add**. 

Once the field has been added, the tooltip for the field in the  **Add field to page** pane switches to **Defined by the page**.

> [!NOTE]
> The added field is locked from editing and can't be unlocked.

## Remove a field

If you've added a table field that originally wasn't on the page object, you can remove it again. Removing a field is different that hiding it. When you hide a field, users can still show it on their workspace through personalization. However, if you remove a field, the field is no longer available for users to show, or hide for that matter. If the field is currently displayed on a user's workspace, it disappears from their workspace when you remove it. 

To remove a field, select the arrowhead on the field in the page and then **Remove**. If you can't find the field, select it in the **Add field to page** pane to indicate its hidden location. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Removing a field doesn't delete data that's stored in the field or it's source tables. It just removes the field from view. 

## Lock and unlock editing

Customization allows you to lock (allow editing) or unlock editing (prevent editing) of most fields on a page. To lock or unlock editing, select the field on the page, select the arrowhead, and then select **Lock editing** or **Unlock editing**. It's important to keep in mind a few rules about locking and unlocking fields:

- Field's that were originally not on the page object but were added to the page by customization are always locked, and can't be unlocked using customization or personalization.
- The design of the field can also prevent it from being edited. If the AL developer set the field's [Editable property](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/properties/devenv-editable-property) to `false`, it's always locked and can't be unlocked.
- It's important to note that the lock editing feature is intended to aid in the accuracy, consistency, and reliability of data. It's not intended to secure data integrity.


<!--However, whatever option you choose for a field, users can always change the setting on their own workspace using personalization. For this reason, it's important to consider locking as a deterrence measure and not a preventative measure.--> 
## Important information and tips

- Not all table fields may be available for customization from the **Add field to page** pane. The developer of a table can choose to prevent a field from appearing in customization by setting the field's [AllowInCustomization property](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/properties/devenv-allowincustomizations-property) to `Never`.
- You can't customize a page that's in [analysis mode](analysis-mode.md). The **Analyze** switch is deactivated. If you switch to customization mode while the page is in analysis mode, then analyze mode is automatically switched off. 
- Some pages have multiple page fields that map to the same source table. The **Add field to page** pane shows all of these page fields independently. You can show, hide, or move these fields independently without affecting the others.
- If a part or group is hidden, you can still identify hidden fields inside the part or group, but you can't add, move or show fields in the part or group until they're made visible.

# Correct or cancel unpaid purchase invoices

You can correct or cancel a posted purchase invoice. This is useful if you want to correct a typing mistake, or if you want to change the purchase early in the order process.

If you have already paid for products on the posted purchase invoice, you can't correct or cancel it from the posted purchase invoice itself. Instead, you must manually create a purchase credit memo to reverse the purchase, optionally managed with a purchase return order. The same applies if you want to modify a posted purchase invoice that was based on combined purchase receipts. For more information, see [Process Purchase Returns or Cancellations](purchasing-how-process-purchase-returns-cancellations.md).

On the **Posted Purchase Invoice** page, you can choose the **Correct** button or the **Cancel** button. When you correct or cancel a posted purchase invoice, the corrective purchase credit memo is applied to all general ledger and inventory ledger entries that were created when the initial purchase invoice was posted. This reverses the posted purchase invoice in your financial records and leaves the corrective posted purchase credit memo for your audit trail. The video describes the use of **Correct** and **Cancel**.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Posted Purchase Invoices**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the posted purchase invoice that you want to correct.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >   If the **Canceled** check box is selected, then you cannot correct the posted purchase invoice because it has already been corrected or canceled.
3. On the **Posted Purchase Invoice** page, choose **Correct**.

    A new purchase invoice with the same information is created where you can make the correction. For more information, see [Record Purchases](purchasing-how-record-purchases.md). The **Canceled** field on the initial posted purchase invoice is changed to **Yes**.

    A purchase credit memo is automatically created and posted to void the initial posted purchase invoice.
4. Choose **Show Corrective Credit Memo** to view the posted purchase credit memo that voids the initial posted purchase invoice.

## To cancel a posted purchase invoice

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Posted Purchase Invoices**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the posted purchase invoice that you want to cancel.

    > [!NOTE]  
    >   If the **Canceled** check box is selected, then you cannot cancel the posted purchase invoice because it has already been canceled or corrected.
3. On the **Posted Purchase Invoice** page, choose **Cancel**.

    A purchase credit memo is automatically created and posted to void the initial posted purchase invoice. The **Canceled** field on the initial posted purchase invoice is changed to **Yes**.
4. Choose **Show Corrective Credit Memo** to view the posted purchase credit memo that voids the initial posted purchase invoice.

### Partial invoice posting also supported

If the cancellation is related to a partial invoice posting, then the originating purchase order line is updated to reflect the canceled invoiced quantity. The **Qty. to Invoice** and **Quantity Invoiced** fields on the related purchase order line are reset to the values before the partial posting.

# [!INCLUDE [power-bi-purchasing-app-name](includes/power-bi-purchasing-app-name.md)]

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The [!INCLUDE [power-bi-purchasing-app-name](includes/power-bi-purchasing-app-name.md)] for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides executives, purchasing managers, and procurement teams with valuable insights into purchasing activities. This app can help you streamline purchasing processes, improve decision-making at all levels of the organization, and optimize spending by offering detailed analytics and visualizations of purchasing data. Use its reports to increase transparency, efficiency, and cost savings in your daily operations.

## Purchases analytics for the leadership team

To fit this category, you might have a role such as:

- Chief Executive Officer
- Chief Procurement Officer

### Example scenario: preparing purchasing budgets

As the CEO of a manufacturing company, you need to stay on top of rising raw material costs to maintain profitability. For the leadership team, it's important to understand your organization's spending. The [Purchases Overview](purchases-powerbi-purchases-overview.md) and [Moving Annual Total](purchases-powerbi-moving-annual-total.md) reports can give you a better understanding of how much money you spend on purchasing activities and quickly spot increases in raw material costs.

:::image type="content" source="media/purchases/purchases-overview-metrics.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the key metrics on the Purchases Overview Power BI report" lightbox="media/purchases/purchases-overview-metrics.png":::

You can also use the [Actual and Budget](purchases-powerbi-actual-vs-budget.md) report to monitor the actual spending against the allocated budget. This comparison helps you make informed decisions to plan ahead for the coming months and years, giving you better budget control.

:::image type="content" source="media/purchases/purchases-actual-vs-budget-matrix.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Actual vs. Budget matrix" lightbox="media/purchases/purchases-actual-vs-budget-matrix.png":::

## Purchases analytics for the management team

To fit this category, you might have a role such as:

- Purchasing Manager
- Operations Manager

### Example scenario: reducing raw material costs

Purchase Managers in manufacturing ensure they have the materials they need to meet production demands. You notice an increase in the cost of a material, which could affect profitability. Using the [Purchases Decomposition](purchases-powerbi-purchases-decomposition.md) and [Purchases by Item](purchases-powerbi-purchases-by-item.md) reports, you can quickly identify the vendor that provides the material and analyze the purchase amount compared to the previous year. This information can help you negotiate better prices with the vendor.

:::image type="content" source="media/purchases/purchases-amount-by-item-category.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Purchases Amount by Item Category bar chart" lightbox="media/purchases/purchases-amount-by-item-category.png":::

To monitor purchasing activities and ensure compliance with weekly or monthly budgets, the [Daily Purchases](purchases-powerbi-daily-purchases.md) report provides a detailed breakdown of purchase amounts. It aggregates amounts by day, week, month, and year. Use this report to spot unexpected spikes in spending and take corrective action before it affects your budget.

:::image type="content" source="media/purchases/daily-purchases-matrix.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Daily Purchases matrix" lightbox="media/purchases/daily-purchases-matrix.png":::

Also, you can use the [Moving Averages](purchases-powerbi-moving-averages.md) report to analyze purchasing trends and identify opportunities to reduce costs and improve efficiency. The **Purchases by Location** report can help you find discrepancies in purchasing patterns across different locations and make decisions.

## Purchases analytics for daily purchasing work

To fit this category, you might have a role such as:

- Purchasing Agent
- Purchasing Officer

### Example scenario: selecting vendors for purchasing raw materials

As a purchaser for a manufacturing company, you source materials for production. Part of your role is to keep purchasing costs under control to maintain profitability in the allocated budget. Use the **Purchases by Item** report to see the breakdown of purchases by item and category.

You notice that the company spent significantly on a particular category of materials. The purchase amount increased compared to the previous year. You decide to investigate by looking at the [Purchases by Vendor](purchases-powerbi-purchases-by-vendor.md) report, which shows the breakdown of purchases by vendor.

You identify that one vendor consistently provided the materials at a higher price than other vendors. To analyze spending and manage your supplier relationship, use the [Purchases by Vendor](purchases-powerbi-purchases-by-vendor.md) report. The report shows the purchasing activities for each vendor, including the amount spent, the number of transactions, and the vendors that supplied a specific category of material.

:::image type="content" source="media/purchases/purchases-by-vendor-table.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Purchases by Vendor table" lightbox="media/purchases/purchases-by-vendor-table.png":::

# Audit changes to your setup

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] allows you to configure your system in many ways. This article explains ways to monitor changes to your setup for financial auditing.

## Set up the Change Log to capture changes

You can use the Change Log feature to capture changes to your setup. For example, you can find out what changed, who changed it, and when the change was made.

To use the Change Log to monitor your setup, you must specify the tables you want it to monitor. The following table lists some examples of finance setup tables where you might want to setup change tracking. To learn more about the Change Log, go to [Log changes](across-log-changes.md).

To learn more about setting up the finance area, go to [Setting Up Finance](finance-setup-finance.md).

> [!TIP]
> If you want to track changes to data that isn't shown in the table, you can use the page inspection tool on the page that shows the data to find the corresponding table name and ID. To learn more, go to [Inspecting and Troubleshooting Pages](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-inspecting-pages?tabs=table) in the [!INCLUDE[dev-itpro-docs](includes/dev-itpro-docs.md)].

## Get notified when system setup change

To add an extra layer of security to your setup, you can monitor changes to fields and get an email when someone changes a value. To learn more, go to [Monitor sensitive fields](across-log-changes.md#monitor-sensitive-fields).

## Analyze changes to your setup

You can use the Data Analysis feature to answer questions such as:

- Which definition changed?
- Who changed it, and when?

# Report selection for documents in Business Central

You can set up default reports to use to print sales, purchases, and service documents, such as orders, quotes, and invoices, and which layout is used. For example, if you have a specific layout for sales invoices, you can specify that report in the **Report Selections - Sales** page. You can then use the report when you send or print sales invoices.  

## Available report selections

The **Report Selections** pages specify the reports to print in different situations and the layout to use. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides default configurations, but you can change them if needed. You can also add reports to the **Report Selection** pages if you want to print more than one report per document type, for example.

The following table describes where you can find information about the different pages.  

|Area or task  |Learn more|
|--------------|----------|

|Define reports for value-added tax (VAT) reporting (Germany)|[Set Up Reports for VAT and Intrastat](LocalFunctionality/Germany/how-to-set-up-reports-for-vat-and-intrastat.md) |

> [!TIP]
> Your [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can include additional **Report Selection** pages, depending on your location and industry, for example. To check your setup, choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Report Selection**, then choose the relevant link.

The default version of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes the following **Report Selection** pages:

* **Report Selection - Sales**  
* **Report Selection - Project**  
* **Report Selection - Service**
* **Report Selection - Purchase**  
* **Report Selection - Cash Flow**  
* **Report Selection - Warehouse**  
* **Report Selection - Inventory**  
* **Report Selection - Bank Account**  
* **Report Selection - Production Order**  
* **Report Selection - Reminder/Finance Charge**  

## Example: Report selection for sales documents

The **Report Selection - Sales** page offers default reports to use in different scenarios for each related document type. Choose a document type in the **Usage** field, then add or review the report selection. You can set up more than one report and specify the sequence the reports must be sent or printed in.  

[!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

You can't send all document types as email attachments. For the document types you can, the **Report Selection** page contains extra fields.  

For example, on the **Report Selection - Sales** and **Report Selection - Purchase** pages, the following fields help you set up email:

|Field name |Description  |
|-----------|-------------|
|**Use for Email Body**| Insert summarized information, such as the invoice number, due date, or a link to a payment service in an email.|
|**Use for Email Attachment**| Attach the related document to the email.|
|**Email Body Layout Description**|Specify the email body layout to use. Typically, it's a custom report layout. |
|**Report Layout**|Specify the layout to use for the report. Typically, it's a custom report layout. |

# Sell Assemble-to-Order Items and Inventory Items Together

If the **Assembly Policy** field on the item card of an assembly item contains **Assemble-to-Stock**, the sales order process assumes that the item is already assembled and can be picked from inventory if it's available. Therefore, an assembly order isn't automatically created and linked to the sales order line. However, if some or all of the quantity isn't available, you can create an assembly order for the remaining quantity. To do that, fill in the **Qty. to Assemble to Order** field on the sales order line. This setting lets you assemble the item to order although it's set up to be assembled to stock.  

You have similar flexibility when you sell assemble-to-order items and some of the quantity is already in inventory. You'll want to deduct that quantity from the assembly order. To learn more about selling inventory items, go to [Sell Inventory Items in Assemble-to-Order Flows](assembly-how-to-sell-inventory-items-in-assemble-to-order-flows.md).  

> [!NOTE]  
> There are rules that apply to the **Qty. to Ship** field on sales order lines that contain a combination of assemble-to-order quantities and inventory quantities. To learn more about the rules, go to [Combination scenarios](assembly-assemble-to-order-or-assemble-to-stock.md#combination-scenarios).  

> [!NOTE]  
> The following procedure doesn't include the sales order steps that you need to follow before you create an assembly order for unavailable quantities.

## To sell assemble-to-order items and inventory items together

1. On a sales order line for an assemble-to-stock item, enter a quantity in the **Quantity** field that exceeds inventory. The **Check Availability** page appears. To learn more about item availability, go to [View the Availability of Items](inventory-how-availability-overview.md).
2. In the **Qty. to Assemble to Order** field, enter the value from the **Total Quantity** field.  
3. Make any changes needed to the assembly components. Learn more at [Sell Items Assembled to Order](assembly-how-to-sell-items-assembled-to-order.md).  
4. Release the sales order to make the items available for picking and for assembly of the unavailable items. To learn more about the standard assembly steps, go to [Assemble Items](assembly-how-to-assemble-items.md).  

> [!CAUTION]  
> The **Bin Code** field on the sales order might contain the value from the **Assemble-to-Order Shpt. Bin Code** or **From-Assembly Bin Code** fields on the location card. If it is, the **Bin Code** field on the sales order line might be incorrect for this combination of assemble-to-order and assemble-to-stock quantities. It's a good idea to double-check that the bin in the **Bin Code** field works for all quantities. Alternatively, enter the two different quantities on separate sales order lines.

# View a financial report on-screen, as a PDF, or in Excel

After you set up definitions for your financial reports, you can start using the data to support your finance and accounting processes. The Financial Reporting feature offers multiple ways to view the reports:

- On-screen, with drill-through to the underlying numbers.
- As PDF documents designed for sharing and printing.
- As Excel files that use the template or layout of your choice.

## View a financial report on-screen

You can view any report on-screen with drill-through to the underlying numbers.

To view a financial report, follow these steps:

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 4.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Financial Reports**, and then choose the related link.
1. On the **Financial Reports** page, select the financial report you want to view, and then choose the **View Financial Report** action.

The page has **Options** and **Dimensions** FastTabs. If the FastTabs aren't available, you might need to enable them with the **Show all options** action.

On the **Options** FastTab, specify how the report shows data. For example:

- Use the **View by** field to specify the period for which to summarize data. Specifying a period is a good way to make the data more granular.
- Use the **Date Filter** field to show amounts for a certain data or date range.
- The **Show All Lines** toggle specifies whether the page displays all lines, or excludes empty lines, as defined in the row definition.
- The **Negative Amount Format** field allows you to define how you want to format negative numbers.

On the **Dimensions** FastTab, you can choose to filter data according to global dimensions.

> [!TIP]
> If you change a setting, to refresh the data on the screen, use the **Recalculate** action.

### Show or hide the Row No. field on a report

The **Row No.** field might show when you view a report on-screen. The field doesn't show when you view the report in a PDF. To show or hide the field, personalize the page. To learn more, go to [Personalize your workspace](ui-personalization-user.md).

## Integrate financial reports with Excel

You can integrate a financial report with an Excel workbook template, adjust the layout to suit your needs, and then update the Excel template with data from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For example, this integration makes it easier to generate your monthly and yearly financial statements in a format that works for you.

### Set up Excel integration for a financial report (create an Excel template)

To set up Excel integration for a financial report, follow these steps to create an Excel template.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 4.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Financial Reports**, and then choose the related link.
1. On the **Financial Reports** page, select the financial report to enable with Excel, and then choose the **View Financial Report** action.
1. On the **Financial Report** page, choose the **Create New Excel Template** action. This action downloads a template Excel workbook with a single worksheet named after the report.
1. Copy the worksheet, and rename it to **Data**.
1. Rename the report worksheet to your liking.
1. In the report worksheet, mark all cells that show data from the financial report, including column and row headers. On the **Home** ribbon, find the **Number** menu and choose **General** as the category.
1. Choose the leftmost cell of the area with data from the financial report, and set a reference to the equivalent cell in the Data worksheet. Drag the formula to extend it to all cells in the first row, and then drag the row down to cover all rows in the financial report.
1. Hide the **Data** worksheet.
1. Format the report worksheet to suit your needs.
1. Save the workbook in OneDrive, or a similar place where the file is backed up and versioned.
1. Close the workbook.

> [!TIP]
> The **Row No.** field is shown on the data worksheet, but you might not want to include it on your worksheet.

> [!NOTE]
> If you make changes to the row or column definitions of the report you created a template for, you must update the template too. Each row and column in the Excel template must be in the same position as the generated report.

# Walkthrough: Tracing Serial/Lot Numbers

<!-- [!INCLUDE[complete_sample_data](includes/complete_sample_data.md)]   -->

When product defects occur, the errors must be identified and affected items must be prevented from leaving the company. If defective items have already been shipped, you must trace who received them and, if you need to, recall the items.  

The first task of defects management is to investigate where the defective items came from and where they were used. This investigation is based on historic data and is made easier by searching through item tracking entries using the **Item Tracing** page.  

The second task of defects management is to determine whether the traced items are planned for in open documents, such as non-posted sales orders or consumption journals. This work is performed on the **Find entries** page. You can use the Find Entries feature to search all kinds of database records.  

## About This Walkthrough

This walkthrough demonstrates how to identify which items are defective, which vendor supplied them, and where they are used so that those orders can be stopped or recalled.  

This walkthrough illustrates the following tasks:  

- Tracing usage to origin.  
- Tracing origin to usage.  
- Searching for all current records which hold the traced serial/lot number.  

## Roles

This walkthrough demonstrates tasks that are performed by the following user roles:  

- Quality Controller  
- Warehouse Manager  
- Order Processor  
- Purchasing Agent  

## Prerequisites

To complete this walkthrough, you will need:  

- The [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] company.  
<!-- - To create new items and several business transactions by following the [Prepare Sample Data](walkthrough-tracing-serial-lot-numbers.md#prepare-sample-data).   -->

## Story

Ricardo, the quality controller, is acting on a sales return of item 1002, Racing Bike. The customer, Selangorian Ltd., complained that the frame has cracked welding seams. Quality control engineers have confirmed that the racing frame of the returned bike is defective. The quality controller must now determine:  

- Which lot of racing frames was faulty.  
- On which purchase order the faulty lot was received.  

From the sales department, the quality controller knows that the returned racing bike, item 1002, had the serial number SN1. By using this basic information, they must determine where the finished racing bike was last used, and then they must trace backward to the earliest origin to establish which lot number the faulty component, the racing frame, came from.  

The results of this first item tracking task identify which racing frames were defective and which vendor supplied them. Afterward, but in the same overall tracking process, the quality controller must find all the sold racing bikes that contain racing frames from the faulty lot so that those orders can be stopped or recalled. Lastly, the quality controller must find any open documents where the faulty lot is used so that no additional transactions are made.  

The first two defects-management tasks are performed on the **Item Tracing** page. The last task is performed on the **Find entries** page in integration with the **Item Tracing** page.  

## Prepare Sample Data

You must create the following new items:  

- 2000, Racing Frame: lot-specific tracking, component of 1002

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  Do not post the last sales order for five racing frames.  

    This completes the preparation of data to demonstrate the Item Tracing and Find Entries features.  

## Tracing from Usage to Origin

 From the sales department, the quality controller knows that the returned racing bike, item 1002, has the serial number SN1. By using this basic information, they can determine where the finished racing bike was last used, in this case, on the sales shipment to Selangorian Ltd.. Then, the quality controller must trace backward to the earliest origin to establish which lot number the faulty racing frame came from and which vendor supplied it.  

### To determine which lot included the faulty frame and who supplied it

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Item Tracing**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  On the **Item Tracing** page, enter **SN1** in the **Serial No. Filter** field, and then enter **1002** in the **Item Filter** field.  
3.  Keep the default setting of **Item-Tracked Only** in the **Show Components** field, and keep the default trace method of **Usage – Origin** in the **Trace Method**.  
4.  Choose the **Trace** action.  

    Note that one sales shipment header matches the search criteria. Before you continue the trace, verify that the shipment is the one that shipped the faulty racing bike to Selangorian Ltd.  

5.  Select the trace line, and then choose the **Show Document** action.  

    Now continue to trace the origin of the sales shipment of the racing bike with number SN1.  
6.  Choose the + icon on the trace lines to gradually expand and trace backward in the chain of transactions that the sales shipment originates from.  

    You can trace the following transaction history:  

    - The first posted document backward in the chain of transactions is the output posting of SN1 from the first released production order.  
    - The next posted document backward after that is the consumption posting from the first released production order. Here the quality controller sees that a racing frame from LOT1 was used.  
    - The lowest posted document in this chain is the posted purchase receipt on which racing frames with LOT1 entered inventory.  

    The quality controller has now established which lot of racing frames was faulty and they can search for the last trace line to see which vendor supplied them, namely Custom Metals Incorporated.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  Do not make any additional modifications to the trace result, as you will use it in the next section.  

     This completes the first defects-management task using the **Item Tracing** page. The quality controller must now determine whether other posted documents have processed racing frames from LOT1.  

## Tracing from Origin to Usage

 The quality controller has established that the faulty racing frames came from LOT1. They must now find any other racing bikes that contain racing frames from the faulty lot so that those bikes can be stopped or recalled.  

 One way to prepare this trace task on the **Item Tracing** page is to manually enter LOT1 in the **Lot No. Filter** field and 2000 in the **Item Filter** field. However, this walkthrough will use the **Trace Opposite - from Line** function.  

### To find all usage of the faulty lot  

1.  On the **Item Tracing** page, select the line of the purchase receipt, the last trace line, and then choose **Trace Opposite – from Line**.  

    The trace result is now based on the filters of the trace line for the purchase receipt, LOT1 and item 2000, and the result is based on trace method **Origin - Usage**.  

    To obtain an overview of all usage of item 2000 with LOT1, continue to expand all trace lines.  

2.  Choose the **Expand All** action.  

    The first four trace lines refer to the sales shipment to Selangorian Ltd., which is already resolved. The last line indicates that one more racing bike, SN2, was produced in the same released production order and then sold and shipped on another sales shipment.  

    The quality controller immediately informs the sales department so that they can initiate a recall of the defective racing bike from the customer, Cannon Group PLC.  

    At the same time, they can see from the last three trace lines that another two items, SN3 and SN4, have been produced based on racing frames from LOT1. They take action to block these end items in inventory.  

    This completes the second defects management task using the **Item Tracing** page for defects management. Since the **Item Tracing** page is based on posted entries only, the quality controller must continue to the **Find entries** page to make sure that LOT1 is not used in non-posted documents.  

## Finding All Records of a Serial/Lot Number

 With the **Item Tracing** page, the quality controller learned that LOT1 contained the faulty racing frames, which vendor supplied them, and in which posted transaction they have been used. They must now determine whether LOT1 is in any open documents by integrating from the trace result to the **Find entries** page where they can perform a search through all database records.  

### To find all occurrences of LOT1 in non-posted records, such as open orders  

1.  On the **Item Tracing** page, select the first trace line, the purchase receipt of LOT1.  
2.  Choose the **Find entries** action.  

    The **Find entries** page is preset with search filters based on the trace result for LOT1. The quality controller recognizes most of the records as pertaining to documents already identified on the **Item Tracing** page. For example, the last Find Entries line of type Production Order refers to the two released production orders that consumed racing frames from LOT1.  

    However, the second Find Entries line of type **Sales Line** is a non-posted document line, so the quality controller proceeds to investigate.  

3.  To open the sales line record, select the second Find Entries line, choose the **Show** action. Alternatively, choose the value in the **No. of Records** field.  

    Here the quality controller sees one open sales line for the faulty racing frames. They immediately suggest to the sales department that this order be canceled and a new production order, based on good racing frames, be initiated.  

 This completes the walkthrough of how to use the **Find entries** page for defects management in integration with the **Item Tracing** page.

# Managing payables

A large part of managing accounts payable is paying your vendors, or reimbursing your employees for expenses. You can use functions to add payments lines for purchase invoices that are due on the **Payment Journal** page. To send transactions to your bank, you can export multiple payment journal lines to a file, and then upload the file to your bank. You can also make payments by check, including transmitting checks as electronic payments.

Another typical task is to apply outgoing payments to their related vendor or employee ledger entries in order to close purchase invoices, purchase credit memos, or employee accounts as paid. You can do this on the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page by importing a bank statement file to register the payments. The payments are applied to open vendor, customer, or employee ledger entries by matching payment text and entry information. There are various ways to review and change the matches before you post the journal. You can choose to close any open bank account ledger entries related to the applied ledger entries when you post the journal. The bank account is automatically reconciled when all payments are applied.

Alternatively, you can apply outgoing payments manually on the **Payment Journal** page or from the related vendor or employee ledger entries.

The following table describes a sequence of tasks within accounts payable, with links to the articles that describe them.

# Procurement Quick Start

To be able to buy products and services, you must first set up vendors. Once that is done, you can start registering purchase orders and receiving invoices.  

## Set up vendors

The following video shows you how to set up a vendor in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

<br><br>  

> [!Video https://learn-video.azurefd.net/vod/player?id=7188b662-bc49-45ef-8152-82898076b235]

### Set up a new vendor

[!INCLUDE[create_new_vendor](includes/create_new_vendor.md)]

For more information and additional things you can do when you register vendors, see [Register New Vendors](purchasing-how-register-new-vendors.md).  

## Create new purchase orders

When you buy something from a vendor you have two options. The first, and simplest, is to just create a purchase invoice. However, you must use purchase orders if your purchasing process requires that you record partial receipts of an order quantity, for example, because the full quantity was not available at the vendor.

The following video shows you how to create a purchase order in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

<br><br>

> [!Video https://learn-video.azurefd.net/vod/player?id=f04b1ed3-5cb0-4fa8-8cd0-24069ee893d2]

### To create a purchase order  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Orders**, and then choose the related link.  

2. On the **Purchase Orders** page, select the **New** action to create a new Purchase Order.

3. In the **Vendor Name** field, enter the name of an existing vendor.

    Other fields on the **Purchase Header** are now filled with the standard information about the selected vendor.  

4. Fill in the remaining fields on the **Purchase Order** page as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

    You are now ready to fill in the purchase order lines with items or resources that you have purchased from the vendor.

5. On the **Lines** FastTab, in the **Item No.** field, enter the number of an inventory item or service.

6. In the **Quantity** field, enter the number of items to be purchased.

    The **Line Amount** field is updated to show the value in the **Direct Unit Cost** field multiplied by the value in the **Quantity** field.

7. In the **Order Discount Amount** field, enter an amount that should be deducted from the value shown in the **Total Incl. Tax** field at the bottom of the order.

8. When you receive the purchased items or services, choose **Post**.

For more information and additional things you can do when creating a purchase order, see [Purchasing](purchasing-manage-purchasing.md).  

## Create a purchase invoice  

You create a purchase invoice to record the cost of purchases and to track accounts payable. Creating a purchase invoice is similar to creating a purchase order.

### How to create and post a purchase invoice  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 3.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Invoices**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Purchase Invoice** page, select the **New** action to create a new Purchase Invoice.
3. In the **Vendor** field, enter the name of an existing vendor.

    Other fields on the **Purchase Invoice** page are now filled with the standard information of the selected vendor.

4. Fill in the remaining fields on the **Purchase Invoice** page as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

    You are now ready to fill in the purchase invoice lines with items or resources that you have purchased from the vendor.

5. On the **Lines** FastTab, in the **Item No.** field, enter the number of an inventory item or service.
6. In the **Quantity** field, enter the number of items to be purchased.

    The **Line Amount** field is updated to show the value in the **Direct Unit Cost** field multiplied by the value in the **Quantity** field.

7. In the **Invoice Discount Amount** field, enter an amount that should be deducted from the value shown in the **Total Incl. Tax** field at the bottom of the invoice.

8. When you receive the purchased items or services, choose **Post**.

The purchase is now reflected in inventory, resource ledgers, and financial records, and the vendor payment is activated. The purchase invoice is removed from the list of purchase invoices and replaced with a new document in the list of posted purchase invoices.  

For more information and additional things you can do when creating a purchase invoice, see [Record Purchases with Purchase Invoices](purchasing-how-record-purchases.md).

# FAQ for Sales Line Suggestions with Copilot (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]

These frequently asked questions (FAQ) describe the AI impact of the sales line suggestions feature in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/production-ready-preview-dynamics365.md)]

## What is Sales Line Suggestions with Copilot?

Sales line suggestions with Copilot can assist with creating lines on sales documents such as sales quotes, orders, and invoices based on structured input or natural language. The feature isn't a general-purpose chat, but a highly specific and integrated experience that you can use on sales documents. The feature offers two distinct skills that help you find data about individual products or entire documents.

## What are the capabilities of sales line suggestions with Copilot?

* Find products

  Information that describes products is stored in multiple places in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For example, item numbers and descriptions are stored in the **Item** table, multiple barcodes are stored in the **Item Reference** table, and product properties are stored in the **Item Attributes** table. While you might prompt for *Red bicycle*, the actual product might be *Crimson tourer*, where *Bicycle* is a product category and *red* is an attribute.

* Find a document by reference

  People often repeat a previous order, or at least use it as a starting point. But it might be tricky to find the right order in a stack of orders. You might remember some of the order's ID, which can be a company-assigned number or a reference number received from a customer. Being able to use prompts such as *Need last invoice from April* should help you find an order faster.

* Find a document by reference and then find a product within the document

  Use a combination of the **Find product** and **Find document** capabilities. You can use a prompt such as, *Need red bicycle from last invoice from April*.

* Find products from attachments
  
  If your typical sale contains multiple products, your customer might send you an attachment with details about the products they want to buy. Being able to understand the attachment and generate suggestions based its content makes it faster to create sales lines.

## What is the intended use of sales line suggestions?

* Find products

  Intended to answer user prompts to find products based on vague, incomplete, or inaccurate descriptions.

  Because the average number of items (products/services) for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] customers is 10.000, finding the right ones might be tough without prior experience or knowledge. The way data is stored in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] doesn’t make things easier, because you need to do multiple searches or filtering exercises on the different pages that store product data.

  Copilot extracts the requested products and quantities and identifies the main search term and attributes, so you can enter your prompt more quickly. Then, Copilot does an advanced search through multiple related tables, applies synonyms, corrects typos, and evaluates the quality of the search output.

* Find a document by reference

  Quickly reply to inquiries by finding sales documents for a customer using partial or approximate information.

  In B2B environments, people often deal with recurring requests, and order processors often need to repeat a past document or at least use it as a starting point. However, finding the right document might be tricky:

  - Through its lifecycle, a sales document can evolve from quote to order to posted invoice or shipment. Documents can also be archived.
  - You might have an ID, but don't know what it represents. For example, is it order number, invoice number, or external reference?
  - Sometimes you have a date or a period, but not an ID for a document.

  To find a source document manually, you need to open multiple pages and use search and filter multiple times. Copilot simplifies this process with a single, natural language query that lets you express what you're looking for in your own way.

  *	*Get products from order 103031*
  *	*Need products from last invoice in August*

* Find products from attachment
  
  Intended to find product suggestions based on the content of a file.
  
  * Copilot analyzes an attached file to understand its format, such as the column separator and data type. It also identifies columns that contain a product, quantity, and unit of measure (optional). You can change review and change the mapping if needed.
  * Copilot passes the contents of columns that contain product details to the **Find product** capability to find the requested items.

## How was sales line suggestions evaluated? What metrics are used to measure performance?

The feature underwent extensive testing where numerous prompts in US English representing both typical use and use by bad actors. Testing was based on [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]'s demonstration data and a large labeled product catalog available as open source.

This feature is built in accordance with Microsoft's Responsible AI Standard. Learn more about responsible AI from Microsoft at [Empowering responsible AI practices](https://aka.ms/RAI).

## What are the limitations of sales line suggestions? How can users minimize the impact of the sales line suggestions limitations when using the system?

* Find products
  
  Find products works best in the English language. While you can use this feature in any of the languages that [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports, item searches in other languages might be less accurate.

If your industry or domain overlaps with what Microsoft considers sensitive topics (such as drugs, violence, adult entertainment, and so on) Copilot might defer to neutral, curated responses, or give inaccurate responses.

Sales line suggestions only populates fields where the **Type** is **Item**, and the **No.**, **Unit of Measure**, and **Quantity**. Other fields, including **Unit Price** and **Location**, use the current logic and are filled in either based on item settings or values from the document header.

The **Variant Code** isn't currently supported. If you can ship a product in two different colors, for example, Copilot finds the product but leaves the **Variant Code** field empty. You need to fill in the field manually.

How you name your items can affect output. For example, using cryptic abbreviations versus friendly names can reduce output quality.

For items, the following table lists the tables and fields that Copilot searches.

|Table  |Fields  |
|---------|---------|
|**Items**     |  * No.<br>* Description<br>* Description 2<br>* Search Description<br>* GTIN<br>* Vendor Item Number       |
|**Item Variant**     | * Code<br>* Description<br>* Description 2	        |
|**Item Reference**     | * Reference No.<br>* Description<br>* Description 2        |
|**Item Attributes**     | * Name<br>* Value        |
|**Item Category**     |  * Code<br>* Description<br>* Parent Category - 1 Level	       |
|**Item Translation**     | * Language<br>* Description<br>* Description 2	        |
|**Item Identifier**     |  * Code       |
|**Extended text Line**     |  * Text      |

* Find documents by reference

  Currently, you can start sales line suggestions from sales orders, invoices, and quotes, and search the following documents:

  * Sales orders
  * Sales quotes
  * Sales invoices
  * Posted sales invoices
  * Posted sales shipments
  * Blanket sales order

  Copilot searches the following fields:

  * Document No.
  * External Document No.
  * Your Reference
  * Quote No.
  * Document Date
  * Sell-to Customer No.

  Copilot doesn't return all lines of the type Item. It transfers only item numbers, variant codes, and quantities. Copilot converts quantities from the source document to the **Sales Unit of Measure**.

* Find products from attachment

Currently, this feature supports only CSV files. If you received files in a different format, for example Microsoft Excel, use the **Save As** action to save the worksheet as a CSV.

To safeguard against scenario where a large file is uploaded, the CSV file is limited to 10,000 characters.

## In which geographies and languages is sales line suggestions available?

[!INCLUDE[copilot-geo-and-language-availability-en-only](includes/copilot-geo-and-language-availability-en-only.md)]

## What operational factors and settings allow for effective and responsible use of the feature?

AI-powered suggestions might sometimes be incorrect or incomplete. You should always review the accuracy of Copilot's suggestions before you choose whether to keep them. Copilot’s suggestions aren't saved to the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] database until you choose the **Keep it** button and exit the Copilot window. You can edit and correct any suggestions before you choose to keep it, or after they're inserted in a sales document.

### What is expected of administrators and end-users when using Sales lines suggestions?

After an administrator enables the **Sales lines suggestions** feature, each user can choose whether to use it always, sometimes, or never.  

Administrators make the overall decision on whether to use Copilot capabilities in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. If administrators enable Copilot, they should be sure to grant access to the appropriate users.

> [!NOTE]
> * We don't support this feature in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises or private cloud.
> * Partners can't extend this feature. That means partner developers can't modify, replace, or extend it.

## Is Copilot the only means to create sales lines?  

No, use of Copilot is optional. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers non-AI-powered ways to insert sales lines or copy documents. Organizations can use both approaches at the same time.  

## How do I give feedback about AI-generated content?  

Each time Copilot provides suggestions, you can provide feedback to Microsoft directly from the Copilot window, using the Like and Dislike buttons. Your feedback remains anonymous and we use this data to improve the quality of the service.

title: General Journal Post Line Overview

# General Journal Post Line Overview

Codeunit 12, **Gen. Jnl.-Post Line**, is the major application object for general ledger posting and is the only place to insert general ledger, VAT, and customer and vendor ledger entries. This codeunit is also used for all Apply, Unapply and Reverse operations.  
  
In Microsoft Dynamics NAV 2013 R2, the codeunit was redesigned because it had become very large, with approximately 7,600 code lines. The architecture was changed and the codeunit has been made simpler and more maintainable. This documentation describes the changes and provides information that you will need for upgrade.  
  
## Old Architecture  
The old architecture had the following features:  
  
* There was extensive use of global variables, which increased the possibility of hidden errors due to use of variables with the wrong scope.  
* There were many long procedures (with more than 100 code lines) that also had high cyclomatic complexity (that is, a lot of CASE, REPEAT, IF nested statements), which made the code very difficult to read and maintain.  
* Several procedures that were only used locally and were only meant to be used locally were not marked as local.  
* Most procedures had no parameters and used global variables. Some used parameters and overrode global variables with locals.  
* Code patterns for searching the general ledger accounts and creating general ledger and VAT entries was not standardized and varied from place to place. In addition, there was a lot of code duplication and broken symmetry between customer and vendor code.  
* A large part of the code in codeunit 12, approximately 30 percent, related to payment discount and tolerance calculations, although these features are not needed in many countries or regions.  
* Posting, Apply, Unapply, Reverse, Payment Discount and Tolerance, and Exchange Rate Adjustment were married together in codeunit 12 using a long list of global variables.  
  
### New Architecture  
In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], codeunit 12 has had the following improvements:  
  
* Codeunit 12 has been refactored into smaller procedures (all less than 100 code lines).  
* Standardized patterns for the search of general ledger accounts have been implemented by using helper functions from Posting Group tables.  
* A Posting Engine Framework has been implemented to manage the start and finish of transactions and to isolate the creation to general ledger and VAT entries, the collection of VAT adjustment, and the calculation of additional currency amounts.  
* Code duplication has been eliminated.  
* Many helper functions have been transferred to corresponding customer and vendor ledger entry tables.  
* The use of global variables has been minimized, so that each procedure uses parameters and encapsulates its own application logic.

2. Create a new service order.  
3. In the **No.** field, enter a number for the service order.  

     Alternatively, if you have set up number series for service orders on the **Service Management Setup** page, you can select <kbd>Enter</kbd> to select the next available service order number.  

4. In the **Customer No.** field, select the relevant customer from the list. The customer-relevant fields are filled in with information from the **Customer** table.  

5. Depending on the settings on the **Mandatory Fields** FastTab on the **Service Management Setup** page, you may need to fill in the **Service Order Type** field and the **Salesperson Code** field.  
6. Optionally, fill in the rest of the fields.  
7. Register the service item lines.  

## To create a service order from a contract  
You can automatically create service orders for the maintenance of service items based on service contracts.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Create Contract Service Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Service Contract Header** FastTab, set the filters you want to apply.  
3. On the **Options** FastTab, fill in the **Starting Date** and **Ending Date** fields with the starting date and ending date for the period that you want to create contract service orders for. The batch job creates service orders that include service items in service contracts with next planned service dates within this period.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  There is a limit to the number of days you can use as the date range each time you use this batch job. You set this limit in the **Contract Serv. Ord. Max. Days** field on the **Service Management Setup** page.  

4. In the **Action** field, choose **Create Service Order**.  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  You will not be able to create order with multiple service item, if you set **One Service Item Line/Order** field on the **Service Management Setup** page. 

## To convert a service quote to a service order
When a customer has accepted a service quote, you convert it to a service order. The quote is deleted and a new service order is set up with the same description as the service quote. The response date and time are recalculated for the service order and the status is set to **Pending**. The repair status of the service items in the order are changed to **Initial**.  

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] searches for allocation entries for all the service items in the service quote that have the status **Active**. If it finds such allocation entries, their allocation status is updated to **Reallocation Needed**. When you reallocate the service items in the service order, the status of the allocation entries registered for the quote are updated to **Finished**.   

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Contract Quotes**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the service quote to convert to a service order.  
3. Choose the **Make Order** action.  

## To check item availability for one or more orders  
You can check and see if an item you need to fulfill an order is in stock, and if it is not, when the item will be in stock. In addition, if an item is available to reserve, you can reserve it to make sure it is available for your use. You can check availability for a particular order, or for all orders.  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Dispatch Board**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Do one of the following:  

    * For a particular order, choose the order, and then choose the **Demand Overview** action.  
    * For all orders, choose **Show Document**. The **Service Order** page opens.  

3. On the **Demand Overview** page, expand the item grouping, and view information about the availability of the item. For example, you can see how many items are in inventory. You can also see if and when an item will be available if it is on back order, that is, Source Type = Purchase, or whether it has been reserved.

## To reserve an item for a service order
If you need to be sure that an item is available for a service order, you can reserve the item.

1. In the **Search** box, enter **Service Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the service order, and then choose **Edit**.  
3. Choose **Actions**, choose **Order**, and then choose **Service Lines**.  
4. On the **Service Lines** page, choose the item to reserve, and then choose the **Reserve** action.  
5. On the **Reservation** page, choose **Reserve from Current Line**.

## To insert lines based on standard service codes  
If you have set up standard service codes and assigned them to service item groups, you can insert the standard lines linked to the standard service codes on service documents. For more information, see [Set Up Standard Service Codes](service-how-setup-service-coding.md).   

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Create a new service order.  
3. Fill in the fields as necessary..  
4. Fill in the service item lines with the required information.  
5. Choose the line with the service item that you want to create service lines for, and then choose **Get Std. Service Codes**. The **Standard Serv. Item Gr. Codes** page opens with the standard codes for the service item group specified on the line.  
6. Choose the appropriate code, and choose the **OK** button to enter standard service lines.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  If the **Service Item Group Code** field on the service item line of the document is blank, this means that the service item does not belong to any service item group. In this case, the **Standard Serv. Item Gr. Codes** page will contain a list of all standard service codes. You should select from the list to insert standard service lines in the document. You may also select from the list of standard service codes assigned to a specific service item group. To view the list, select the relevant code in the **Service Item Group Code** field on the **Standard Serv. Item Gr. Codes** page.  

## To register internal or public comments
You can add comments that will be printed on service orders and service quotes to provide additional information. You can add up to 80 characters, including spaces. If you need to enter additional text, choose another line. To register a comment, choose a line, and then choose the **Comments** action.  

## To delete invoiced service orders  
Orders are usually deleted automatically after having been fully invoiced. When an invoice is posted, a corresponding entry is created on the **Posted Service Invoices** page. The posted document can be viewed on the **Posted Service Invoice** page.  

Service orders are not deleted automatically, however, if the total quantity on the order has been posted not from the service order itself, but from the **Service Invoice** page. Then you may need to delete invoiced orders that were not deleted. You can do this by running the **Delete Invoiced Service Orders** batch job.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Delete Invoiced Service Orders**, and then choose the related link. The **Delete Invoiced Service Orders** batch job request page opens.  
2. To select the orders to be deleted, you can set filters in the **No.**, **Customer No.**, and **Bill-to Customer No.** fields.  
3. Choose **OK**.

# Design Details: Balancing supply and demand

To understand how the planning system works, it's important to understand its prioritized goals:  

* Any demand will be met by sufficient supply.  
* Any supply serves a purpose.  

Generally, these goals are achieved by balancing supply with demand.  

## Supply and demand

The term *supply* refers to any kind of positive or inbound quantity, such as:

* Inventory
* Purchases
* Assembly
* Production
* Inbound transfers
* Sales returns  

The term *demand* refers to any kind of gross demand, such as:

* An item for a sales order
* A component for a production order

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] also lets you use more technical types of demand, such as negative inventory and purchase returns.

To sort the sources of supply and demand, the planning system organizes them on two timelines called inventory profiles. One profile is for demand events, and the other is for the corresponding supply events. Each supply event represents one entity on an order, such as:

* A sales order line
* An item ledger entry
* A production order line

When inventory profiles are loaded, the demand-supply sets are balanced to output a supply plan that fulfills the listed goals.

Inventory levels and planning parameters are other types of supply and demand. These types undergo integrated balancing to replenish stock items. Learn more at [Design Details: Handling Reordering Policies](design-details-handling-reordering-policies.md).

## The concept of balancing, in brief

Demand comes from your customers. Supply is what you create and remove to establish balance. The planning system starts with the demand and then tracks backwards to the supply.  

Inventory profiles contain information about the demands and supplies, quantities, and timing. These profiles make up the two sides of the balancing scale.  

The objective of planning is to balance the supply and demand of an item to ensure that supply will match demand as defined by the planning parameters and rules.  

:::image type="content" source="media/nav_app_supply_planning_2_balancing.png" alt-text="Overview of balancing supply and demand.":::

## Process orders before the planning start date

To avoid that a supply plan shows unreasonable suggestions, the planning system won't plan anything in the period before the planning starting date. The following rule applies to that period:

* All supply and demand before the starting date of the planning period are considered part of inventory or shipped.  

With a few exceptions, the planning system won't suggest any changes to supply orders in the period or create order tracking links for that period. The following are exceptions to this rule:  

* The inventory that's projected to be available, including the sum of supply and demand in the period, is below zero.  
* Backdated orders require serial or lot numbers.  
* The supply-demand set is linked by an order-to-order policy. 

If the initial available inventory is below zero, the planning system suggests an emergency supply order on the day before the planning period to cover the missing quantity. So, the projected and available inventory will always be at least zero when planning for the future period begins. The planning line for this supply order will display an Emergency warning icon and provide additional information.

### Serial and lot numbers and order-to-order links are exempt from the previous period  

If serial or lot numbers are required or an order-to-order link exists, the planning system disregards the rule about the previous period. It will include back-dated quantities from the starting date and might suggest corrective actions if supply and demand aren't synchronized. These demand-supply sets must match to ensure that a specific demand is fulfilled.

## Load inventory profiles

To sort the sources of supply and demand, the planning system organizes them on two timelines called inventory profiles.  

Supply and demand with due dates on or after the planning starting date are loaded into each inventory profile. When loaded, the supply and demand types are sorted according to overall priorities, such as:

* Due date
* Low-level codes
* Location
* Variant

Order priorities are applied to the different types to fulfill the most important demand first. Learn more at [Prioritizing Orders](design-details-balancing-demand-and-supply.md#prioritize-orders).  

Demand can also be negative. Treat negative demand as supply. However, unlike typical supply, negative demand is considered fixed supply. The planning system can take it into account, but will not suggest changes to it.  

In general, the planning system considers all supply orders after the planning starting date as subject to change in order to fulfill demand. However, after a quantity is posted from a supply order the planning system can't change it. The following orders can't be replanned:  

* Released production orders where consumption or output has been posted.  
* Assembly orders where consumption or output has been posted.  
* Transfer orders where shipment has been posted.  
* Purchase orders where receipt has been posted.  

Apart from loading the supply and demand types, certain types are loaded with attention to special rules and dependencies. The following sections in this article describe these rules and dependencies.  

### Item dimensions are separated  

The supply plan must be calculated for each combination of the item dimensions, such as variant and location. Only the combinations that carry a demand and/or supply need to be calculated.  

The planning system looks for combinations in the inventory profile. When it finds a new combination, it creates an internal control record that holds the information about the combination. The planning system then inserts the SKU as the control record, or outer loop. As a result, the planning parameters are set according to a combination of variant and location, and the system can proceed to the inner loop. 

> [!NOTE]  
> You don't have to enter a SKU record when you enter demand and/or supply for a particular combination of variant and location. Therefore, if a SKU doesn't exist for a given combination, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates a temporary SKU record based on data from the item. If the **Location Mandatory** is toggle is turned on on the **Inventory Setup page**, you must either create a SKU or turn on the **Components at Location** toggle. Learn more at [Planning With or Without Locations](production-planning-with-without-locations.md).  

### Serial and lot numbers are loaded by specification level  

Serial and lot numbers are loaded into the inventory profiles along with the supply and demand they're assigned to.  

Supply and demand attributes are arranged by order priority and by their level of specification. Because serial and lot number matches reflect the level of specification, a more specific demand will match before a less specific demand. For example, a specific demand might be a lot number specified for a sale line. A less specific demand might be a sale from any lot number.

> [!NOTE]  
> The only dedicated prioritization rules for serial and lot-numbered supply and demand are the level of specification defined by their combinations and how item tracking is set up for the items.  

During balancing, the planning system regards supply that has serial and lot numbers as inflexible. The system won't increase or reschedule such supply orders. The one exception to this is if they're used in an order-to-order relation. Learn more at [Order-to-order links are never broken](#order-to-order-links-are-never-broken). This exception protects the supply from receiving several, possibly conflicting, action messages when it has varying attributes. For example, varying attributes might be when the supply has a collection of different serial numbers.  

Another reason why serial and lot-numbered supply are inflexible is because serial and lot numbers are often assigned late in the process. It could be confusing if changes are suggested at that point.  

Serial and lot number balancing doesn't respect the rule about not planning anything before the planning starting date. If supply and demand aren't synchronized, the planning system will suggest changes or new orders, regardless of the planning starting date.  

### Order-to-order links are never broken

When planning an order-to-order item, the linked supply must only be used for what it was originally intended. The linked demand shouldn't be covered by any other supply, even if the supply is available in time and quantity. For example, you can't use an assembly order that's linked to a sales order in an assemble-to-order scenario to cover another demand.  

Order-to-order supply and demand must balance precisely. The planning system will ensure the supply without regarding order sizing parameters, modifiers, and quantities in inventory (other than quantities relating to the linked orders). For the same reason, the system will suggest decreasing excess supplies if the linked demand is decreased.  

This balancing also affects the timing. The limited horizon that is given by the time bucket is not regarded; the supply will be rescheduled if the timing of the demand has changed. However, dampener time will be respected and will prevent order-to-order supplies from being scheduled out, except for the internal supplies of a multi-level production order (project order).  

> [!NOTE]  
> Serial and lot numbers can also be specified on order-to-order demand. In that case, the supply is not inflexible, which is normally is for serial and lot numbers. In this case, the system will increase or decrease according to changes in demand. If one demand has varying serial and lot numbers, such as more than one lot number, one supply order will be suggested for each lot.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Forecasts should not lead to creating supply orders that are bound by an order-to-order link. If the forecast is used, it should only be used as a generator of dependent demand in a manufacturing environment.

### Component need is loaded according to production order changes

When handling production orders, the planning system must monitor the needed components before loading them into the demand profile. Component lines that result from a changed production order will replace the lines of the original order. The change ensures that the planning system doesn't duplicate planning lines for a component need.  

### Consume safety stock

Safety stock quantity is a demand that's loaded into the inventory profile on the planning starting date.  

Safety stock is a quantity of inventory that's set aside to meet uncertainties in demand during replenishment. However, it can be consumed to fulfill a demand. In that case, the planning system will ensure that the safety stock is quickly replaced. The system suggests a supply order to replenish the safety stock quantity on the date it's consumed. The planning line will display an Exception warning icon explaining that the safety stock has been partly or fully consumed by an exception order for the missing quantity.  

### Forecast demand is reduced by sales orders

Demand forecasts express anticipated future demand. While actual demand is entered, typically as sales orders for produced items, it consumes the forecast.

The forecast itself is not reduced by sales orders. However, the forecast quantities that are used in the planning calculation are reduced by the sales order quantities before the remaining quantity enters the demand profile. For sales during a period, planning includes both open sales orders and item ledger entries from shipped sales. The exception to this rule is when they come from a blanket order.  

You must define a valid forecast period. The date on the forecasted quantity defines the start of the period, and the date on the next forecast defines the end of the period.  

The forecast for periods prior to the planning period isn't used, regardless of whether it was consumed. The first forecast figure of interest is either the planning starting date, or the closest date to it.  

The forecast can be for different types of demand:

* Independent demand, such as sales orders
* Dependent demand, such as production order components.

An item can have both types of forecast. During planning, consumption happens separately, first for independent demand and then for dependent demand.  

### Blanket order demand is reduced by sales orders

Forecasting is supplemented by blanket sales orders as a way to specify future demand from a specific customer. As with the (unspecified) forecast, actual sales should consume the anticipated demand, and the remaining quantity should enter the demand inventory profile. Consumption doesn't reduce the blanket order quantity.

The planning calculation includes open sales orders linked to the specific blanket order line, but it doesn't include any valid time period. Also, it doesn't include posted orders because the posting procedure has already reduced the outstanding blanket order quantity.

## Prioritize orders

Within a given SKU, the requested or available date represents the highest priority. Today's demand should be dealt with before the next week's demand. But, in addition to this overall priority, the planning system will make the following suggestions according to order priorities:

* Which type of demand you should fulfill first.
* What source of supply should be applied before applying other sources of supply.  

Loaded supply and demand contribute to a profile for projected inventory according to priorities.  

### Priorities on the demand side  

1. Already shipped: Item Ledger Entry  
2. Purchase return order  
3. Sales order  
4. Service order  
5. Production component needs  
6. Assembly order line  
7. Outbound transfer order  
8. Blanket order (that has not already been consumed by related sales orders)  
9. Forecast (that has not already been consumed by other sales orders)  

> [!NOTE]  
> Purchase returns aren't usually involved in supply planning; they should always be reserved from the lot that's going to be returned. If not reserved, purchase returns play a role in availability and are highly prioritized to avoid that the planning system suggests a supply order just to serve a purchase return.  

### Priorities on the supply side  

1. Already in inventory: Item Ledger Entry (Planning Flexibility = None)  
2. Sales return order (Planning Flexibility = None)  
3. Inbound transfer order  
4. Production order  
5. Assembly order  
6. Purchase order  

### Priority related to the state of supply and demand  

In addition to the priorities from the type of supply and demand, there are other things that affect planning flexibility. For example, warehouse activities, and the status of the following orders:

* Sales
* Purchase
* Transfer
* Assembly
* Production

The status of these orders has the following effects: 

1. Partly handled (Planning Flexibility = None)  
2. Already in process in the warehouse (Planning Flexibility = None)  
3. Released – all order types (Planning Flexibility = Unlimited)  
4. Firm Planned Production Order (Planning Flexibility = Unlimited)  
5. Planned/Open – all order types (Planning Flexibility = Unlimited)

## Balancing supply with demand

The planning system balances supply and demand by suggesting actions to revise supply orders that aren't balanced. This balance happens for each combination of variant and location.  

Imagine that each inventory profile contains two strings:

* A string of demand events, sorted by date and priority
* A corresponding string of supply events

Each event refers to its source type and identification. The rules for balancing the item are straightforward. Matching supply and demand can occur at any point in the process, as follows:  

1. No demand or supply exists for the item => the planning has finished (or should not start).  
2. Demand exists but there's no supply => supply should be suggested.  
3. Supply exists but there's no demand for it => supply should be canceled.  
4. Both supply and demand exist => questions should be asked and answered before [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can ensure that the supply can meet the demand.

    If the timing of the supply isn't suitable, perhaps the supply can be rescheduled, as follows:  

    1. If the supply is placed earlier than the demand, perhaps the supply can be scheduled out so that inventory is as low as possible.  
    2. If the supply is placed later than the demand, perhaps the supply can be scheduled forward. Otherwise, the system will suggest new supply.  
    3. If the supply meets the demand on the date, the planning system can investigate whether the quantity of the supply can cover the demand.  

    When the timing is in place, the quantity to supply can be calculated as follows:  

    1. If the supply quantity is less than the demand, the supply quantity could be increased (or not, if you have a maximum quantity policy).  
    2. If the supply quantity is greater than the demand, the supply quantity can be decreased (or not, if you have a minimum quantity policy).  

    At this point, one of these two situations exist:  

    1. The current demand can be covered, in which case it can be closed and planning for the next demand can start.  
    2. The supply has reached its maximum, leaving some of the demand quantity uncovered. In this case, the planning system can close the current supply and proceed to the next one.  

 The procedure starts all over with the next demand and the current supply, or vice versa. The current supply might be able to cover this next demand as well, or the current demand has not yet been fully covered.  

### Rules for actions for supply events

For top-down calculations in which supply must fulfill demand, the demand is taken as a given. It's outside the control of the planning system. However, the planning system can manage the supply side and will make the following suggestions:

* Create new supply orders
* Reschedule existing orders or change their quantities
* Cancel supply orders that are no longer needed  

To exclude a supply order from the planning suggestions, you can state that it has no planning flexibility (Planning Flexibility = None). Then, excess supply from that order will be used to cover demand, but no action will be suggested. 

In general, all supply has a planning flexibility that's limited by the conditions of each of the suggested actions.  

* **Reschedule Out**: The date of an existing supply order can be scheduled out to meet the demand due date unless:

  * It represents inventory (always on day zero).  
  * It has an order-to-order linked to another demand.  
  * It's outside the window for rescheduling in the time bucket.
  * There's a closer supply that could be used.  
  * On the other hand, the user may decide not to reschedule because:
  * The supply order is tied to another demand on a previous date.  
  * The needed rescheduling is so minimal it's negligible.  

* **Reschedule In**: The date of an existing supply order can be scheduled in, except under the following conditions:

  * It's linked directly to some other demand.  
  * It's outside the window for rescheduling defined by the time bucket.

> [!NOTE]  
> When planning an item using a reorder point, you can reschedule the supply order. This often happens in forward-scheduled supply orders triggered by a reorder point.

* **Increase Quantity**: The quantity of an existing supply order can be increased to meet the demand unless the supply order is linked directly to a demand by an order-to-order link.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Although you can increase the supply order, the increase might be limited due to a defined maximum order quantity.  

* **Decrease Quantity**: An existing supply order with a surplus compared to an existing demand can be decreased to meet the demand.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Although the quantity can be decreased, there might be surplus compared to the demand due to a defined minimum order quantity or order multiple. 

* **Cancel**: As a special incident of the decrease quantity action, the supply order can be canceled if it's been decreased to zero. 
* **New**: If there aren't any supply orders, or an existing order can't be changed to meet the quantity needed on the due date for the demand, a new supply order is suggested.  

### Determine the supply quantity  

You define the planning parameters that control the suggested quantity of each supply order.  

When the planning system calculates the quantity of a new supply order or the quantity to change on an existing order, the suggested quantity might differ from the actual demand.  

If a maximum inventory or fixed order quantities are selected, the suggested quantity might be increased to meet the fixed quantity or the maximum inventory. If a reordering policy uses a reorder point, the quantity may be increased at least to meet the reorder point. 

The suggested quantity might be modified in this sequence:  

1. Down to the maximum order quantity.  
2. Up to the minimum order quantity.  
3. Up to meet the nearest order multiple.

### Order tracking links during planning  

For order tracking during planning, the planning system rearranges the order tracking links for the combinations of items, variants, and locations. The system rearranges the tracking links for the following reasons:

* To verify its suggestions for covering all demand, and ensure that all supply orders are needed.  
* The order tracking links must be rebalanced regularly.  

Over time, order tracking links become out of balance. The links become out of balance because the order tracking network isn't rearranged until a demand or supply event is closed.

Before balancing supply by demand, the planning system deletes all order tracking links. During the balancing process, when a demand or supply event is closed, it creates new order tracking links between the supply and demand.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Even if the item isn't set up for dynamic order tracking, the planning system will create balanced order tracking links.

## Close balanced supply and demand

Balancing supply has three possible outcomes:

* The required quantity and date of the demand events are met and planning for them can be closed. The supply event stays open and might be able to cover the next demand. Keeping the supply event open lets the balancing procedure start over with the current supply event and the next demand.  
* The supply order can't be modified to cover all of the demand. The demand event is still open with an uncovered quantity that might be covered by the next supply event. Therefore the current supply event is closed, and balancing can start over with the current demand and the next supply event.  
* All of the demand is covered and there isn't a next demand (or there wasn't any demand at all). Surplus supply might be decreased (or canceled) and then closed. Any other supply events should also be canceled.  

Finally, the planning system will create an order tracking link between the supply and the demand.  

### Create the planning line (Suggested Action)  

If a **New**, **Change Quantity**, **Reschedule**, **Reschedule and Change Quantity**, or **Cancel** action is suggested to revise the supply order, the planning system creates a planning line in the planning worksheet. For order tracking, the planning line is created not only when the supply event is closed, but also if the demand event is closed. This is true even though the supply event is still open and might be changed when the next demand event is processed. The planning line may be changed again when it's created.

To reduce the load on the database when handling production orders, the planning line can be maintained in three levels:

* Create only the planning line with the current due date and quantity but without the routing and components.  
* Include routing: the planned routing includes calculation of starting and ending dates and times. Include routing is demanding in terms of database accesses. To determine the ending and due dates, it might be necessary to calculate the routing even if the supply event hasn't been closed. For example, if you're doing forward scheduling.  
* Include BOM explosion: can happen just before the supply event is closed.

# Moving Items

You can move items in your warehouse in different ways, depending on how you've configured your warehouse. The complexity can vary:

* Small warehouses might use basic warehouse configurations to handle orders individually, in a single or multiple steps.
* Large warehouses might use advanced configurations where all warehouse activities are coordinated by a directed workflow. Learn more at [Setting Up Warehouse Management](warehouse-setup-warehouse.md).

Items may need to be moved between bins, for example, due to internal operations:

* A production order needs components delivered, or its finished items put away.
* A warehouse manager wants to optimize space.
* Unplanned movements to and from operations.
* Replenish picking bins or shop floor bins.
* Update bin contents.

Counting, adjusting, and reclassifying items can involve warehouse tasks that must be performed on warehouse entries before they can be synchronized with item ledger entries. Learn more at [Count, Adjust, and Reclassify Inventory](inventory-how-count-adjust-reclassify.md).  

 The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the articles that describe them.

# Ad-hoc analysis of fixed assets data

This article explains how to use the **Data Analysis** feature to analyze fixed assets data directly from list pages and queries. You don't have to run a report or switch to another application, such as Excel. The feature provides an interactive and versatile way to calculate, summarize, and examine data. Instead of running reports using options and filters, you can add multiple tabs that represent different tasks or views on the data. Some examples are "Total assets," "Depreciations over time," or any other view you can imagine. To learn more about how to use the **Data Analysis** feature, go to [Analyze list and query data with analysis mode](analysis-mode.md).

Use the following list pages to start doing ad-hoc analysis of fixed assets processes:

- [FA Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=5604&layout=analysis)
- [General Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=20&layout=analysis)

<!-- TODO: add examples for 

insurance coverage ledger entries

-->

## Fixed assets ad-hoc analysis scenarios

Use the **Data Analysis** feature for quick fact checking and ad-hoc analysis:

- If you don't want to run a report.
- If a report for your specific need doesn't exist.
- If you want to quickly iterate to get a good overview on a part of your business.

The following sections provide examples of fixed assets scenarios in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

| Area | To... | Open this page in analysis mode | Using these fields |
| ---- | ----- | ------------------------------- |------------------- |
| [Fixed Assets (Current value)](#example-fixed-assets-current-value) | Track asset value, both across all assets and on a single asset. | [FA Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=5604&layout=analysis) | **Depreciation Book**, **FA No.**, **FA Posting Date**, **FA Posting Type**, and **Amount** |
| [Asset value changes over time](#example-asset-value-changes-over-time) | Track asset value changes over time. | [FA Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=5604&layout=analysis) | **FA Posting Type**, **FA Posting Date**, and **Amount** |
|[Fixed asset depreciations over time](#example-fixed-asset-depreciations-over-time) | Track depreciations over time, both across all assets and on a single asset. | [FA Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=5604&layout=analysis) | **Depreciation Book**, **FA No.**, **FA Posting Year**, **FA Posting Month**, **Amount**, and **FA Posting Type** |

### Example: fixed assets current value

To track the value of one or more fixed assets, follow these steps:

1. Open the [FA Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=5604&layout=analysis) list, and choose :::image type="content" source="media/analysis-mode-icon.png" alt-text="Enter analysis mode."::: to turn on analysis mode.
1. Go to the **Columns** menu and remove all columns (select the box next to the **Search** field on the right).
1. Drag the **Depreciation Book** and **FA No.** fields to the **Row Groups** area.
1. Choose the **FA Posting Date** and **FA Posting Type** fields.
1. Drag the **Amount** field to the **Values** area.
1. Rename your analysis tab to **Asset overview - value**, or something that describes this analysis.

The following image shows the result of these steps.

### Example: fixed asset depreciations over time

To track depreciation for one or more fixed assets, follow these steps:

1. Open the [FA Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=5604&layout=analysis) list, and choose :::image type="content" source="media/analysis-mode-icon.png" alt-text="Enter analysis mode."::: to turn on analysis mode.
1. Go to the **Columns** menu and remove all columns (select the box next to the **Search** field on the right).
1. Turn on the **Pivot Mode** toggle (located above the **Search** field on the right).
1. Drag the **Depreciation Book** and **FA No.** fields to the **Row Groups** area.
1. Drag the **FA Posting Year** and **FA Posting Month** fields to the **Column Labels** area.
1. Drag the **Amount** field to the **Values** area.
1. In the **FA Posting Type** filter field, choose **Depreciation**.
1. Rename your analysis tab to **Depreciations over time**, or something that describes this analysis.

The following image shows the result of these steps.

:::image type="content" source="media/data-analysis-fa-ledger-entries-depreciation-by-asset.png" alt-text="Example of how to do data analysis on the FA Ledger Entries page to see depreciation over time." lightbox="media/data-analysis-fa-ledger-entries-depreciation-by-asset.png":::

## Using the Fixed Assets Ad-hoc Analysis query

You can use the [Fixed Assets Ad-hoc Analysis](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?query=123) query to analyze fixed asset ledger entries. The query adds additional information to the ledger entries, such as the fixed asset class, subclass, location, and depreciation book.

## Data foundation for ad-hoc analysis on fixed assets

When you post fixed asset journals, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] creates entries in the **FA Entry** table. Therefore, ad-hoc analysis on fixed assets is typically done on the [FA Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=5604) page.

You might also want to use the [Fixed Assets Ad-hoc Analysis](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?query=123) query.

# Understanding the Chart of Accounts

A chart of accounts (COA) serves as a comprehensive directory of financial accounts and their corresponding reference numbers. A COA typically has of two main categories of accounts:

* Balance sheet accounts: These accounts track your company’s assets, debts, and net worth.
* Income statement accounts: These accounts record income from various sources and also track expenses.

Balance sheet accounts are further categorized into three groups:

* Asset accounts: These accounts track all the valuable resources owned by your company.
* Liability accounts: They record your company’s debts.
* Equity accounts: Represent the residual value in the business after subtracting liabilities from assets.

Income accounts are divided into two groups:

* Revenue accounts: These accounts capture your company’s income from various sources.
* Expense accounts: These accounts capture all your company’s expenses.

Use the COA to record transactions in your organization’s general ledger. Each account typically has an identifier (account number) and a descriptive caption or header, and they're systematically coded based on their account type.

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes a standard chart of accounts that is ready to support your business.

The composition of your company’s chart of accounts is a strategic decision made by your management (or by country-specific regulation). It varies based on your company’s industry, business model, and financial structure. For instance, depending on your industry, you might have specific asset accounts tailored to your company's unique operations and needs:

* A retail business might emphasize inventory and accounts receivable.
* A technology company might focus on intangible assets like patents and software.
* A manufacturing plant would track fixed assets and supplies.

## The chart of accounts page

The chart of accounts shows all general ledger accounts. From the chart of accounts, you can do things like:  

* View reports that show general ledger entries and balances.  
* Close your income statement.  
* Open the General Ledger Account Card, where you can add or change settings.  
* See a list of posting groups for that account.
* View separate debit and credit balances for a single account.

You can add, change, or delete general ledger accounts. However, to prevent discrepancies, you can't delete a general ledger account if its data is used in the chart of accounts. Also, you can block the accidental deletion of accounts in sensitive periods. To learn more about protecting accounts from deletion, go to [Deleting accounts](finance-setup-chart-accounts.md#delete-accounts).  

## The code hierarchy in G/L accounts

Businesses typically create a hierarchical structure in G/L account codes to reflect where they belong in the chart of accounts. For instance, in some implementations, G/L account codes that start with **1** denotes asset accounts, whereas G/L account codes that start with 3 denotes equity accounts. In some regions, there are local regulations for using a standard chart of accounts. To help users understand this hierarchy without the need to know the internal code structure, you can define headers and subtotals in your chart of accounts that encapsulate these internal structures.

## Designing your chart of accounts

Each line in the chart of accounts is a G/L account of one of the types:

* Posting (journals can post lines to these accounts)
* Heading (defines an overall heading in the chart of accounts)
* Total (defines a formula for a subtotal in the chart of accounts)
* Begin-Total (defines a beginning heading for a subtotal in the chart of accounts. All subsequent lines until an End-Total line are indented)
* End-Total (defines an ending heading for a subtotal and the formula for it in the chart of accounts. All subsequent lines after this End-Total line are outdented)

A minimalist chart of accounts can consist of only lines of posting accounts. You use the other four types to define how the chart of accounts also shows a financial statement with headers and subtotals. Totaling accounts are frequently used in financial reporting.

> [!TIP]
> If you use account types other than **Posting** in your chart of accounts, you can define different views to show the "raw" posting accounts without the reporting-type account types for totalling and headings. For example, Show only posting accounts and Hide blocked accounts.

## Use dimensions to simplify your chart of accounts

Dimensions are values that categorize entries so you can track and analyze them on documents, such as sales orders. Dimensions can, for example, indicate the project or department an entry came from. So, instead of setting up separate general ledger accounts for each department and project, you can use dimensions as a basis for analysis and avoid having to create a complicated chart of accounts.

To learn more about dimensions, go to [Work with Dimensions](finance-dimensions.md).

## Organize general ledger (G/L) data using account categories

The **G/L Account Categories** page lets you create simple financial reports based on your chart of accounts.  

By providing categories, subcategories, and account mapping to your chart of accounts, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes basic financial reporting out of the box. If you're just getting started with financial reporting, the standard reports are excellent options until you become more experienced.

For more information, see [Organize general ledger (G/L) data using account categories](bi-account-categories.md).

## Get a quick overview of your finances

The **Chart of Accounts** page displays accounts in a hierarchical list that offers fast access to the key information for each account. However, the list is static, and if you have many accounts, you might have to scroll to view different accounts. If you just want a quick overview of the basics, such as net changes and balances, the **Chart of Accounts Overview** page is a useful alternative. The column layout on the page is the same as the **Chart of Accounts** page (though with fewer columns), so it's easy to understand. You can expand or collapse the hierarchical levels. To make it easy to switch between the pages, the **Chart of Accounts Overview** page is available from the **Chart of Accounts** page.

## Access to create and edit the chart of accounts

In a small organization, such as the CRONUS demonstration company, most users can edit the chart of accounts, except those users with a TEAM MEMBER license. However, larger organizations typically use roles and permissions to limit access to editing the chart of accounts. If you're an administrator, or have the Business Manager or Accountant role, you can control user permissions to give the right people access to the relevant tables. To learn more, go to [Get an overview of a user's permissions](ui-define-granular-permissions.md#get-an-overview-of-a-users-permissions).  

## Audit changes to G/L accounts setup

You can use the Change Log feature to capture changes users make to your G/L accounts. [!INCLUDE [include-audit-what-who-when](includes/include-audit-what-who-when.md)] 

The following table lists the table for G/L accounts and its ID.

| Table | Table ID |
| ----- | -------- |
| G/L Account | 15 |

[!INCLUDE [include-audit-changes-to-setup-learn-more-link](includes/include-audit-changes-to-setup-learn-more-link.md)]



<!-- ## Standard chart of accounts in different regions
Uncomment when we have more examples added to our localization documentation

Some regions have defined standards for the chart of accounts structure you should use in your company. 

Here are some examples of such standards that have been implemented in localized versions of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]:

* [Standard chart of accounts in Denmark](localfunctionality/denmark/how-to-set-up-standard-coa.md)
-->

## Chart of accounts best practices

Here are some best practices that you might consider when you develop and maintaining your charts of accounts:

* Compose your company’s chart of accounts to support the financial reporting needs for your management to take strategic decisions.
* Consider starting simple with fewer G/L accounts. You can always add more detailed accounts if needed.
* Define headers and subtotals in your chart of accounts that summarize the internal structures in G/L accounts.
* Use dimensions to simplify your chart of accounts. Don't have specific G/L accounts for each product or department.
* Add new G/L accounts as they come in, but remove accounts from your chart of accounts only during period-end of your finance period.

# Export your business data to Excel

Excel is a powerful tool to work with data. From inside [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can open any list in Excel. You can even modify data in Excel and then submit it back to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The same capability makes it easy for you to take your data with you if you decide to cancel your subscription.

## Opening and exporting lists in Excel

You can open data in Excel from any journal, list, or worksheet. You just open the page that you want, and then choose **Open in Excel**. For example, open the list of customers (search for **Customers**), and then choose **Open in Excel**. Your browser prompts you to open or save the generated Excel workbook.  

> [!NOTE]
> Use this option when you don't want to publish your changes back to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

Each list includes some columns. The export to Excel includes any columns that are in your current view. Change the columns by opening the shortcut menu for any column, and then specifying which columns that you want to see. The list of columns is different for most lists. The columns reflect the structure in the database that stores your data. If you aren't sure what type of data a certain column contains, add it to your view. You can always remove it again.  

Learn more in [View and edit in Excel from Business Central](across-work-with-excel.md).

### Edit data in Excel

Your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] experience includes an add-in for Excel so you can edit data in Excel. Learn more in [Analyzing Financial Statements in Microsoft Excel](finance-analyze-excel.md).  

## Exporting data to other finance systems

If you decide to cancel your subscription for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can export your data to Excel and take it with you to your next finance system.  

You can export all pages, but that might be more than you really need. Consider exporting the following essential pages, and remember to add all columns:  

* Chart of Accounts  
* Customers  
* Vendors  
* Banks  
* Items  

If you want to export all your financial transactions, it's a large amount of data, so the export often takes more than a few minutes. The financial transactions are shown on the **General Ledger Entries** page.  

We recommend that you also consider exporting data from the following pages:  

* Customer Ledger Entries  
* Vendor Ledger Entries  
* Bank Account Ledger Entries  
* Item Ledger Entries  
* General Posting Setup  
* Customer Posting Groups  
* Vendor Posting Groups  
* Item Posting Groups  
* Bank Posting Group  
* G/L Budgets  
* G/L Budget Entries  
* Sales Quotes  
* Sales Invoices  
* Purchase Invoices  
* Contacts  
* Salespeople  

> [!NOTE]  
> If you have set up more than one company in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you must export the relevant data from each company.

> [!NOTE]
> You must have at least one of the following permissions to open or edit data in Excel:
>
> * Permission set *D365 Excel Export Action*  
> * System permission 6110 *Allow Action Export To Excel*.  

For more information, see [Get an overview of a user's permissions](ui-define-granular-permissions.md#get-an-overview-of-a-users-permissions).

# Make drop shipments

A drop shipment is the shipment of items from one of your vendors directly to one of your customers.

When a sales order is marked for drop shipment, and you create a purchase order specifying the customer in the **Ship-to** field, **Customer Address**, you can link the two documents to instruct the vendor to ship directly to the customer.
<br><br>  
  
> [!Video https://learn-video.azurefd.net/vod/player?id=58c81aa9-7190-476a-9fd9-75a9841549f7]

## To create a sales order for drop shipment

To prepare a drop shipment, you create a sales order for an item and indicate on the sales line that the sale requires drop shipment.

1. Create a sales order for an item. For more information, see [Sell Products](sales-how-sell-products.md).
2. On the sales order line for the drop shipment, select the **Drop Shipment** checkbox. Alternatively, in the **Purchasing Code** field, select a purchasing code that has the **Drop Shipment** field selected.

> [!TIP]
> By default, the Drop Shipment checkbox and Purchasing Code field aren't available on the lines. If they aren't, you can add them by personalizing the section of page that contains the lines. For more information, see [Personalize Your Workspace](ui-personalization-user.md).

## To create the purchase order for drop shipment

To prepare a drop shipment, you indicate on the purchase order that it must be shipped to your customer, not to yourself.

1. Create a purchase order. Don't fill any fields on the lines. For more information, see [Record Purchases](purchasing-how-record-purchases.md).
2. In the **Ship-to** field, select **Customer Address**.
3. In the **Customer** field, select the customer that you're selling to.
4. Choose the **Drop Shipments** action, and then choose the **Get Sales Order** action.
5. On the **Sales List** page, select the sales order that you prepared in [To create a sales order for drop shipment](#to-create-a-sales-order-for-drop-shipment).
6. Choose the **OK** button.

The line information from the sales order is inserted on the purchase order line(s).

You can now tell your vendor to ship the items directly to the customer. For example, you might send them the order by email.

If your vendor provides additional information, such as a tracking number, you can add that information as a comment on a purchase order line. To add a comment on a line, in the **Type** field, choose **Comment**, and then enter the information in the **Description** field.  

## To create multiple purchase orders for drop shipments

You can also use the requisition worksheet to create purchase orders. The advantage of using the requisition worksheet is that it can create purchase orders for all outstanding drop shipments. That means you won't have to create each order individually.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Requisition Worksheets**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **Drop Shipments** action, and then choose the **Get Sales Order** action.
3. If needed, enter filter criteria for the orders you wan to get, and then choose the **OK** button.

# View the availability of items

From the context of a business task, you can get advanced information about when and where an item is available, such as when talking to a customer about a delivery date.

You can view the availability of all items per location, and you can view the availability of each item by event or by period as well. An event is any scheduled item transaction, such as a sales shipment or an inbound transfer receipt.

> [!NOTE]  
>   Availability views by location require that you maintain inventory at more than one location. For more information, see [Set Up Locations](inventory-how-setup-locations.md).

If you use warehousing functionality, availability varies depending on allocations at the bin level when warehouse activities such as picks and movements occur and when the inventory reservation system imposes restrictions to comply with. A rather complex algorithm verifies that all conditions are met before allocating quantities to picks for outbound flows. For more information, see [Design Details: Availability in the Warehouse](design-details-availability-in-the-warehouse.md).

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], availability figures are typically shown in two different fields, each with a different definition:

* The **Quantity on Hand** field, in some places named **Inventory**, shows the actual quantity today according to posted item ledger entries.
* The **Projected Available Balance** field is calculated and shows the quantity on hand plus scheduled receipts minus gross requirements. (In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], scheduled receipts include quantities on purchase orders and inbound transfer orders. Gross requirements include quantities on sales orders and outbound transfer orders.)

> [!TIP]  
>   The projected available balance is especially relevant to view in the **Item Availability by Periods** and **Item Availability by Event** pages because they contain the date dimension.  

> [!NOTE]  
>   The following procedures describe how to view advanced availability information from the items list and item card. You can also access the information from sales document lines for the item on the line. For more information, see [Sell Products](sales-how-sell-products.md).

## To view the availability of an item according to when it will be received or shipped

You view the availability of an item according to scheduled item transactions on the **Availability by Event** page.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the card of an item that you want to view availability for.
3. Choose the **Item Availability by** action, and then choose the **Event** action.

    The **Item Availability by Event** page shows how the inventory quantity of the item will develop over time according to scheduled shipment and receipt events. The page gives a condensed view that shows one line of accumulated information per time interval in which inventory quantities change. Time intervals where no events occurred aren't shown. You can expand each line to show details about the event or events that caused the accumulated quantity on the line.
4. Choose the value in the **Projected Available Balance** field to view the item ledger entries or open documents that make up the value.

## To view the availability of an item in different periods

You view the availability of an item over time for specified time periods on the **Item Availability by Periods** page.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the card of an item that you want to view availability for.
3. Choose the **Item Availability by** action, and then choose the **Period** action.

    The **Item Availability by Periods** page shows how the inventory quantity of the item will develop over time, shown for a period that you select, such as Day, Week, or Quarter.
4. Choose the value in the **Projected Available Balance** field to view the item ledger entries or open documents that make up the value.

## To view the availability of an item at the locations where it's stored

You view the availability of an item at the different places where it's stored on the **Item Availability by Location** page.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the card of an item that you want to view availability for.
3. Choose the **Item Availability by** action, and then choose the **Location** action.

    The **Item Availability by Location** page shows how the inventory quantity of the item will develop in the future, shown for each location where it's stored.
4. Choose the value in the **Qty. on Hand** field to view the item ledger entries that make up the value.
5. Choose the value in the **Projected Available Balance** field to view the item ledger entries or open documents that make up the value.

## To view the availability of all items by the location where they're stored

You view the availability of all your items across all your locations on the **Items by Location** page.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **Items by Location** action.

    The **Items by Location** page shows for all your items how many are available at each location.
3. Choose the value in the **Qty. on Hand** field to view the item ledger entries that make up the value.

## To view the availability of an item by its use in assembly or production BOMs

If an item is part of assembly or production BOMs as either a parent item or a component, you can view how many units of it are required on the **Item Availability by BOM Level** page. The page shows how many units of a parent item you can make based on the availability of child items on underlying lines. Any item that has an assembly or production BOM is shown on the page as a collapsible line. You can expand this line to see the underlying components and lower-level subassemblies with their own BOMs.

For example, you can use the page to determine whether you can fulfill a sales order for an item on a specified date by looking at its current availability and the quantities that can be supplied by its components. You can also use the page to identify bottlenecks in related BOMs.

On each line on the page for both parent items and child items, the following key fields specify the availability figures. You can use these figures to promise how many units of a parent you can supply if you start the related assembly process.

|Field|Description|
|------|-----------|
|**Able to Make Parent**|Shows how many units of any subassembly in the top item you can make. The field specifies how many immediate parent units you can assemble. The value is based on availability of the item on the line.|
|**Able to Make Top Item**|Shows how many units of the top item you can make. The field specifies how many units of the top-line BOM item you can assemble. The value is based on availability of the item on the line.|

### To view the availability of an item according to demand for its parent

The **Item Availability by BOM Level** page shows information for the item on the card or document line that the page is opened for. The item is always shown on the top line. You can view information for other items or for all items by changing the value in the **Item Filter** field.

> [!NOTE]  
>   By default, availability figures on the lines show the total availability of all items under the top item. These figures are displayed in the **Available Quantity** field, and the focus is on the top item. However, information about how many subassemblies you can make may be skewed. To get a true indication of how many of the shown subassemblies you can make, you must clear the **Show Total Availability** check box and then see the figure in the **Able to Make Parent** field.

The **Bottleneck** field specifies which item in the BOM structure restricts you from making a larger quantity than the quantity that is shown in the **Able to Make Top Item** field. For example, the bottleneck item can be a purchased component with an expected receipt date that is too late to make additional units of the top item by the date in the **Needed by Date** field.

## To view the availability of an item by its units of measure

The **Item Availability by Unit of Measure** page shows the availability of an item in the units of measure that it's stored in.

> [!NOTE]  
> To keep this information accurate, you must convert item units of measure. For example, if you purchase an item in one unit of measure, such as boxes, and you sell items in another unit of measure, such as pieces, you must use an item journal to convert the units of measure, or "unbox" items. You can use a negative adjustment item journal line to reduce inventory in the purchase unit of measure, for example boxes, and a positive adjustment to increase inventory in the sales unit of measure, for example pieces. 

## To view the availability of an item by its variants

The **Item Availability by Variant** page shows the actual and projected availability of an item grouped according to variant code.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the card of an item that you want to view availability for.
3. Choose the **Item Availability by** action, and then choose the **Variant** action.

    The **Item Availability by Variant** page shows availability for every variant that exists for the item. The page is empty if no variants exist for the item.

4. In the **View by** field, select the length of the time period that you want to view.
5. View the availability figures in the different quantity fields for each line.

[!INCLUDE [inventory_variant-availability](includes/inventory_variant-availability.md)]

## Assembly availability page

The **Assembly Availability** page shows detailed availability information for the assembly item. It opens:

- Automatically from a sales order line in assemble-to-order scenarios when you enter a quantity that causes a component availability issue.
- Automatically from an assembly order header when you enter a value in the Quantity field that causes a component availability issue.
- Manually when you open it from an assembly order. On the Actions tab, in the Functions group, select Show Availability.

The **Details** FastTab shows detailed availability information for the assembly item, including how many of the assembly order quantity can be assembled by the due date based on availability of the required components. This is shown in the Able to Assemble field on the Details FastTab.

The value in the **Able to Assemble** field is shown in red font if the quantity is lower than the quantity in the **Remaining Quantity** field, indicating that there aren't enough components available to assemble the full quantity.

The **Lines** FastTab shows detailed availability information for the assembly components.

If one or more assembly components aren't available, then this is reflected in the **Able to Assemble** field on the line in question as a quantity less than the quantity in the **Remaining Quantity** field on the **Details** FastTab.

# Configuring OneDrive integration with Business Central on-premises

[!INCLUDE[azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id](~/../shared-content/shared/azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id.md)]

This article explains how to configure OneDrive for work or school (formerly known as OneDrive for Business) integration with Business Central on-premises. Unlike [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, the connection between Business Central and OneDrive isn't set up automatically. If the connection isn't configured, users can't use the features for OneDrive.

There are two tasks that need to be done to configure the OneDrive integration.

- The first task involves registering an application (app) on your Microsoft Entra tenant of your Microsoft 365 plan. The registered app is used for authentication purposes. This task is typically done in the Azure portal and in Business Central web client.
- The second task involves setting up the connection to the OneDrive URL and turning on the OneDrive features in the Business Central. This task in done in the Business Central web client. It's done differently for version 21 than for versions 19 and 20. Version 21 introduces a new **OneDrive Setup** that replaces the **SharePoint Connections Setup**.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises can only be connected to OneDrive hosted by Microsoft in the cloud. Connecting [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on premises to the My Sites repository of SharePoint Server isn't supported.

## <a name="registerapp"></a>Register an app in Microsoft Entra ID for OneDrive integration

In this task, you add a registered app for Business Central in the Microsoft Entra tenant of your Microsoft 365 plan. Like other Azure services that work with Business Central, OneDrive requires a registered app in Microsoft Entra ID. The registered app provides authentication and authorization services between Business Central and SharePoint, which is used by OneDrive.

For detailed steps for completing this step, see [Register an application in Microsoft Entra ID](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/register-app-azure#register-an-application-in-azure-active-directory) in the developer and IT pro help.

As you register the application, consider the following points:

- If you've already registered an application as part of an integration with another Microsoft product, such as Power BI, then you reuse that registered app. In this case, you'll just have to set the SharePoint permissions for the existing registered app.

- Be sure to configure the registered app with the following delegated permissions to the SharePoint API:

    - AllSites.FullControl
    - User.ReadWrite.All
    
    For Business Central 2021 release wave 2 (version 19), set these permissions instead:
    
    - AllSites.Write
    - MyFiles.Write
    - User.Read.All 

- If you're using Business Central version 19 or 20, copy the **Application (client) ID** and **client secret** used by the registered app. You'll need this information in the next task.

## <a name="url"></a>Get your OneDrive URL

[!INCLUDE[onedrive-url](includes/onedrive-url.md)]

## Set up the OneDrive connection in version 21 and later

Use this procedure if you're using Business Central 2022 release wave 2 (version 21) or later.

### Prerequisites

- Indirect, modify, and delete (imd) permission on table **Document Service Scenario** as a minimum

### Run OneDrive setup

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **OneDrive Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. The first time you run the assisted setup, you see the **Your privacy**. Read the information on the page, and if you agree to the terms choose **Agree** to continue.
3. On the **Configure file handling** page, you have the following options to choose from:

   [!INCLUDE[onedrive-feature-options](includes/onedrive-feature-options.md)]

4. On the **Configure Business Central** page, enter OneDrive's URL in the **OneDrive URL** field.

   [How do I find my OneDrive URL?](#url)
5. Choose **Test Connection** and wait for the results.
   - If the test succeeds, choose **Done**, then you're ready to go.
   - If the test fails, you get a message that describes the problem. Typically the problem has to do with the URL that you provided. Choose **OK** to return to the **Configure Business Central** page, verify the URL, and try again.
   - If you haven't already set up the Microsoft Entra ID registered app, the **Set Up Microsoft Entra ID** guide opens.
6. When completed, the privacy notice for OneDrive integration is agreed for all users. If you want to change it so users must agree or disagree for themselves, then go the **Privacy Notices Status** page and select **Let User Decide** for the OneDrive integration. Users will then be prompted to agree or disagree with the privacy notice the first time they use the OneDrive features. Learn more in [Privacy Notices](privacy-notices-status.md).

## Set up the connection in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] version 19 and 20

Use this procedure if you're using Business Central 2022 release wave 1 (version 20) or 2021 release wave 2 (version 19).
> [!IMPORTANT]
> By configuring this feature, you also enable legacy features that send files to OneDrive.  
>
>* The Open in Excel feature will automatically copy the Excel file to OneDrive, then open it in Excel Online. 
>* Exporting any report to a file will automatically copy the file to OneDrive, then open it in Excel Online, Word Online or OneDrive. 
>* Other features may also automatically open in OneDrive.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Microsoft SharePoint Connection Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. In the **Description** field, enter a description for the connection, like **OneDrive**.
3. In the **Folder** field, enter **Business Central**.
4. In the **Location** field, enter the URL for your OneDrive.

   [How do I find my OneDrive URL?](#url)
5. In the **Client ID** field, enter the client ID from your registered app.
6. In the **Client Secret** field, enter the secret from your registered app. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The **SharePoint Connection Setup** page is used to configure multiple legacy features. The **General** section configures the connection to OneDrive, and the **Shared Documents** section redirects files to SharePoint instead. The  **SharePoint Connection Setup** has been deprecated and will be removed in coming release. We recommend that you do not configure the **Shared Documents** section. Learn more in [Deprecated Features in the Base App ](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/upgrade/deprecated-features-w1#microsoft-sharepoint-connection-setup).

## After upgrade to version 21

When you upgrade to version 21 or later, the existing connection to OneDrive that's configured on the **SharePoint Connection Setup** page will still work. But because the **SharePoint Connection Setup** page will be removed in version 23, we recommend that you switch to the new OneDrive integration, as described in the next section. Making this switch now make it easier when the **SharePoint Connection Setup** is eventually removed. Plus, it enables you to use the **OneDrive Setup** assisted setup guide to manage the OneDrive features that are accessible to users.

## Switching from legacy SharePoint to new OneDrive integration 

To switch to the new OneDrive integration, you run the **OneDrive Setup** assisted setup guide, which you can open directly or from the legacy **SharePoint Connection Setup** page. The **OneDrive Setup** assisted setup leads you through the transition, providing information about the changes being made along the way.

Before you get started with the switch or as you're doing it, refer to the next section to learn about some aspects and considerations about the process. 

### <a name="onedrivesetupmigration"></a>About switching to the new OneDrive integration

In addition to OneDrive integration, Business Central can also integrate with other services, like Power BI and Universal print. Integration with these other services also requires a registered Microsoft Entra app for authentication. The Microsoft Entra app used by these other services is configured in the **Set up your Microsoft Entra accounts** assisted setup. When you switch from the legacy SharePoint connection setup, the new **OneDrive Setup** assisted setup changes your OneDrive integration to also use the **Set up your Microsoft Entra accounts** assisted setup&mdash;so all integrations use the same Microsoft Entra app.

This change has implications when switching to the new OneDrive integration, depending on whether there's already a Microsoft app configured in the **Set up your Microsoft Entra accounts** assisted setup. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> After you switch to the new OneDrive setup, you can no longer use the **SharePoint Connection Setup** page to configure OneDrive integration.

#### How the changes affect the integration

The **OneDrive Setup** assisted setup will always use the app that's configured in the **Set up your Microsoft Entra accounts** assisted setup, if there's one. When you run the **OneDrive Setup** assisted setup, it compares the app configured in **Set up your Microsoft Entra accounts** with your current app configured in **SharePoint Connection Setup**.

> [!TIP]
> In the **SharePoint Connection Setup** page and **Set up your Microsoft Entra accounts** assisted setup, the Microsoft Entra app is identified by the **client ID**.

- If the app in **Set up your Microsoft Entra accounts** is different than the app in **SharePoint Connection Setup**, the OneDrive integration changes to use the app in **Set up your Microsoft Entra accounts**.

   In **OneDrive Setup** while making the switch, you get a message similar to the following text: 

   **The Microsoft Entra application used for authentication will be configured for all Business Central integrations. This means the client id will change to NNNNNNNNN-NNNN-NNNN-NNNN-NNNNNNNNNNNN, you may want to test it has the correct permissions.**

  `NNNNNNNNN-NNNN-NNNN-NNNN-NNNNNNNNNNNN` represents the client ID of the app in **Set up your Microsoft Entra accounts** that OneDrive integration has been switched to. 

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > For new OneDrive integration to work after you make the switch, you have to grant the app permission to the SharePoint API in Azure portal. You can do this step before or after you switch to the new OneDrive setup. Learn more in the section [Register an app in Microsoft Entra ID for OneDrive integration](#registerapp).

- If the app in **Set up your Microsoft Entra accounts** is the same as the app in **SharePoint Connection Setup**, the OneDrive integration uses the same app as before, except from the configuration in the **Set up your Microsoft Entra accounts** setup.

   In **OneDrive Setup** while making the switch, you get a message similar to the following text:

   **The Microsoft Entra application used for authentication will be configured for all Business Central integrations. This has already been configured with the same client id (aaaabbbb-0000-cccc-1111-dddd2222eeee).**

- If there's no app configured in the **Set up your Microsoft Entra accounts** setup, the OneDrive integration uses the same app as before.

   The **OneDrive Setup** assisted setup copies app configuration to the **Set up your Microsoft Entra accounts** setup, so it's used for other integrations in that might set up later.

   In **OneDrive Setup** while making the switch, you get a message similar to the following text:

   **The Microsoft Entra application used for authentication will be configured for all Business Central integrations.**

### Run OneDrive setup to switch to the new OneDrive integration

1. Open either the **OneDrive Setup** page or the **SharePoint Connection Setup** page.
2. If you're using the **SharePoint Connection Setup** page, choose **Go to new OneDrive setup** in the notification at the top of the page.
3. Follow the **OneDrive Setup** assisted setup guide.
4. When you get to the **Configure file handling** page, choose one of the following options for turning on features:

   [!INCLUDE[onedrive-feature-options](includes/onedrive-feature-options.md)]

5. The **Configure Business Central** page shows the same URL that's used by the existing OneDrive integration. You can change the URL as needed.
6. Select **Test Connection** and follow the instructions.

   If the test succeeds, select **done**, and you're ready to go. Otherwise, use the messages on the page to help you fix the problem.

Service organizations require a front-to-back application in which finance, inventory, and procurement are tightly coupled with service delivery. They generate financial data with every transaction. Every work order represents cost and revenue, and every resource generates profit and loss. Customer interactions add entries on the general ledger. The integration between [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] streamlines the end-to-end process of managing service operations and ensures a smooth flow of information between the two systems.  

You can easily create and manage work orders in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)], track the progress of service tasks, assign resources, and capture consumption details. When you complete a work order in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)], the integration enables the smooth transfer of data to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] for further processing.  

The integration also facilitates the invoicing and fulfillment of work orders in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. You can generate accurate invoices based on the service activities and the consumption recorded in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)].  

By integrating [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)], you don't have to enter data manually or duplicate efforts. Integration also provides a comprehensive view of service operations and finances, enabling better decision-making and operational efficiency.

## Prerequisites

Because [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] is built on top of Dynamics 365 Sales, you must [set up a connection to Dataverse](/dynamics365/business-central/admin-how-to-set-up-a-dynamics-crm-connection#to-use-the-dataverse-connection-setup-assisted-setup-guide) and [enable integration to Dynamics 365 Sales](/dynamics365/business-central/admin-prepare-dynamics-365-for-sales-for-integration#connection-settings-in-the-setup-guide).

You must download the following apps from AppSource, and install them in your [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] environment:

- [Field Service Integration](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2277917)
- [Business Central Virtual Table](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2304910)

> [!NOTE]
> The [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Virtual Table app is optional. You only need it if you want to view information about item availability from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)]. To learn more, go to [View item availability in Business Central from Field Service](#view-item-availability-in-business-central-from-field-service).

### Permissions and security roles for user accounts

When you install the Integration Solution, permissions for the integration user account are configured. If those permissions change, you might need to reset them. To do that, reinstall the Integration Solution from the **Dynamics 365 Connection Setup** page by choosing **Redeploy Integration Solution**. The following sections list the permissions and security roles that the solution deploys for each app.

#### Sales

- Dynamics 365 [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Integration Administrator
- Dynamics 365 [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Integration User
- Dynamics 365 [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Product Availability User

#### Business Central

Users who post project journals must have the following permission set:

- Dynamics 365 Sales Integration

#### Field Service

To use the integrated data, users must have the following security role:

- Business Central Field Service Integration

For example, users must have this role to connect work orders to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] for processing.

> [!NOTE]
> Ensure that users are assigned to the standard security roles and profiles in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)].  
>
> To learn more about column security profiles in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)], go to [Field Service security roles](/dynamics365/field-service/users-licenses-permissions#field-service-security-roles).
>
> Administrators must add one of the appropriate column security profiles to users in Power Platform. To learn more, go to [Add teams or users to a column security profile to control access](/power-platform/admin/add-teams-users-field-security-profile).

> [!NOTE]
> To use the **Open in Business Central** action in Sales, you must have the following privileges for the following tables:
>
> - You must have **Read** permissions for the **Dynamics 365 Business Central Connection** (nav_connection) table.
> - You must have **Read**, **Write**, and **Delete** permissions for the **Default Dynamics 365 Business Central Connection** (nav_defaultconnection) table.

### Other settings in Field Service

On the **Field Service Setting** page, make the following changes:

- On the **Purchase** tab, clear the **Use of Products Out of Stock** field. Otherwise, you might get an "out of stock" warning when you choose a product that's out of stock in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)], but is in stock in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].
- On the **Work Order / Booking** tab, turn off the **Calculate Price** and **Calculate Cost** toggles. In the **Work Order Invoice Creation** field, choose **Never**.

> [!NOTE]
> Setting up a connection to [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] removes the coupling between resources and products. To make [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] items available in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)], update the **Field Service Product Type** field to match the **Type** field on the items in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. To learn more, go to [Create a product or service](/dynamics365/field-service/create-product-or-service#create-a-product-or-service).

## Set up the integration in Business Central

After you have a connection to Dataverse and Sales, you can set up your integration to [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)].

1. Download and install the **Field Service Integration** app from [AppSource](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2277917). Afterward, on the **Extension Management** page, find the Field Service Integration app, and choose the **Set up** action to run the assisted setup guide.
2. On the **Assisted Setup** page in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], choose **Set up integration to Dynamics 365 Field Service** to run the assisted setup guide.

This section describes the key settings in the guide.

Optionally, if you want to enable technicians to view information about item availability from work orders, choose the **Install Business Central Virtual Table app** link.

To let people post consumption of items and services in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] work orders, specify the **Project Journal Template** and **Project Journal Batch** to use to post consumption of products and services.

Because services are expressed in duration in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)], specify the **Hours Unit of Measure** to use to convert durations to quantities in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

You can also specify when work order products and service lines synchronize to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For example, they might synchronize when work order lines are used, or when someone completes a work order. Choose the appropriate option in the **Synchronize work order products/services** field.

After work order products and services synchronize to project journals in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can choose whether to post the project journals manually. Choose the appropriate option in the **Automatically post project journals lines** field:

- When a work order is complete
- When work order products or services are used

After you finish the setup, run a full synchronization from the **Dynamics 365 Field Service Integration Setup** page. This action synchronizes table mappings for things like:

- Project tasks for projects with the **Apply Usage Link** set. This synchronization makes [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] projects available for selection in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)].
- Resources that aren't blocked, don't have **Use Time Sheet** selected, and do have **Hours** specified as the unit of measure on the **Dynamics 365 Field Service Integration Setup** page.
- Service items (requires that you're using the Premium experience in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]).

## Integration table mappings for synchronization

The basis of synchronizing data is mapping the tables and fields in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with tables and columns in Dataverse, so they can exchange the data. Mapping happens through integration tables. To learn more about table mappings, go to [Mapping the Tables and Fields to Synchronize](/dynamics365/business-central/admin-how-to-modify-table-mappings-for-synchronization).

The following integration table mappings install if you choose the **Project (default)** integration type.

|Integration table mapping  |Data the mapping synchronizes  |
|---------|---------|
|**PJLINE-WORDERPRODUCT** | Maps work order products in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] to project journal lines in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  |
|**PJLINE-WORDERSERVICE** |  Maps work order services in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] to project journal lines in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  |
|**PROJECTTASK** |  Maps projects and project tasks in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to products in external projects in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)].  |
|**RESOURCE-BOOKABLERSC**  | Maps resources in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to bookable resources in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)].  |
|**SVCITEM-CUSTASSET**     | (Premium Experience only) Maps service items in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to customer assets in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)].        |
|**LOCATIONS**     |  Maps locations in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to warehouses in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)]. <br><br> **Note:** The **LOCATIONS** integration table mapping is available only if you turn on the **Location Mandatory** toggle on the **Inventory Setup** page.      |

In addition to those, the following integration table mappings install if you choose the **Project and Service** integration type.

|Integration table mapping  |Data the mapping synchronizes  |
|---------|---------|
|**SRVORDER**| Maps service orders in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to work orders in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)], including the status of the orders. |
|**SRVORDERITEMLINE**| Maps service item lines in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to work order incidents in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)].|
|**SRVORDERLINE-ITEM**| Maps items on service order lines in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with work order products in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)]. |
|**SRVORDERLINE-RESOURCE**| Maps resources on service order lines in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with bookable resource booking in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)].|
|**SRVORDERLINE-SERVICE**|Maps service lines in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with work order services in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)]. |
|**SRVORDERTYPE**| Maps service order types in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to work order types in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)].|
|**SVCITEM-CUSTASSET**|Maps service items in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with customer assets in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)].|

> [!NOTE]
> The integration also maps fields that show item availability information in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on work orders and products in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)]. However, the mapping happens through a virtual table, and not an integration table. Some setup is required. To learn more about virtual tables and viewing item availability, go to [View item availability in Business Central from Field Service](#view-item-availability-in-business-central-from-field-service).

### Synchronize location and warehouse data

You can integrate [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] warehouses with locations in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The integration gives technicians information about the availability of a product or item at a specific location.

The data synchronizes through a unidirectional (from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]) integration table mapping between locations in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and warehouses in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)]. To use the integration table mapping, you must turn on the **Location Mandatory** toggle on the **Inventory Setup** page in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] .

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] synchronizes locations with the following settings on the **Location Card** page:

- The **Use as In-Transit** toggle is turned off.
- **Project Consump. Whse. Handling** is different from Warehouse Pick (mandatory)
- **Assm. Consump. Whse. Handling** is different from Warehouse Pick (mandatory)

In [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], on the **Locations** and **Location Card** page, you can use the **Warehouse** action to open a coupled location in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)], synchronize it, set up and delete couplings, and view synchronization logs.

### View item availability in Business Central from Field Service

When technicians prepare work orders, it's helpful that they can be sure that the items they need to do the work are available. This section describes how to let people view item availability information from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)].

The first thing to do is to install the [Business Central Virtual Table](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2277917) app from AppSource.

Afterward, on the **Dynamics 365 Field Service Integration Setup** or **Set up integration to Dynamics 365 Field Service** pages in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], turn on the **Enable Inventory Availability by Location** toggle. When you enable inventory availability by location, a **dyn365bc_availabilitybylocation_v2_0** virtual table becomes available. You must create a synthetic relation between the following tables:

- The native **Product** and **Work Order Product** tables in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] and the **Item Availability** virtual table that shows item availability. 

There's an assisted setup guide to help you create the synthetic relation.

To create the synthetic relation, follow these steps:

1. In [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], on the **Dataverse Connection Setup** page, use the **Synthetic Relations** action
1. On the **Synthetic Relations** page, choose the **New** action to start the **New Synthetic Relation** assisted setup guide.
1. In the **Native Dataverse Table** field, choose the :::image type="content" source="media/assist-edit-icon.png" alt-text="The AssistEdit icon."::: button, and then choose **CRM Product**.
1. In the **Virtual Dataverse Table** field, choose the :::image type="content" source="media/assist-edit-icon.png" alt-text="The AssistEdit icon."::: button, and then choose **Inventory Availability by Location**.
1. On the **Synthetic Relations** page, choose the **New** action to start the **New Synthetic Relation** assisted setup guide again.
1. In the **Native Dataverse Table** field, choose the :::image type="content" source="media/assist-edit-icon.png" alt-text="The AssistEdit icon."::: button, and then choose **FS Work Order Product**.
1. In the **Virtual Dataverse Table** field, choose the :::image type="content" source="media/assist-edit-icon.png" alt-text="The AssistEdit icon."::: button, and then choose **Inventory Availability by Location**.
1. Choose **Next**.
1. In the **Field in the FS Work Order Product table** field, choose **Product Id**.
1. In the **Field in the Item Availability by Location table** field, choose **itemNo**.
1. Choose **Finish** to complete the guide.
1. To make your setup available in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)], in the **Power Apps admin center**, choose the view, and then choose the **Save and Publish** action.

> [!NOTE]
> It can take a few moments to create the synthetic relations.

To learn more about virtual tables and synthetic relationships, go to [Use virtual tables to get more data](admin-synchronizing-business-central-and-sales.md#use-virtual-tables-to-get-more-data).  

The next thing to do is to create and customize the associated view that people use in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] to check the inventory of products.

To create the view, follow these steps:

1. In **Power Apps admin center**, on the navigation pane, choose **Tables**.
1. Choose the **Item Availability by Location** table.
1. In the **Data experiences** part, choose **Views**.
1. Choose the **View column** action, and then choose the columns you want the view to include. The following columns are typical choices:

    - **Location Code** shows where the product is available.
    - **Item No.** confirms you're looking at the correct product.
    - **Item Description** provides information about the product.
    - **Unit of Measure Code** gives you an idea of the space you need.
    - **Remaining Quantity** shows how much of the product is available at each location.

### Integrate service management features

Integrating [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] lets you manage service tasks, consumption, and financial transactions to benefit service technicians, service managers, and finance teams. It's a powerful solution for managing work orders and consumption in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] and efficiently invoicing and fulfilling them in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The integration is bi-directional, meaning that when you enter or change data in either app, the data updates in the other.

> [!NOTE]
> When you enable the integration with service management features, you also enable the integration with projects. You can't enable only the service management integration.

#### Set up the integration with service management features

You must have a **Premium** license. When you do, on the **Company Information** page in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], set the **User Experience** field to **Premium**.

You can enable the integration in the **Integration Type** field by selecting **Project and Service** in the following places:

- In the **Set up integration to Dynamics 365 Field Service** assisted setup guide.
- On the **Dynamics 365 Field Service Integration Setup** page.

When the **Integration Type** field is set to **Project and Service**, the following things happen when you enable the integration:

- Creates a solution in Power Apps named **Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central Field Service Integration (service)**.
- Adds integration table mappings for service order types, service documents, service lines, and service item lines. To learn more about the table mappings, go to [Integration table mappings for synchronization](#integration-table-mappings-for-synchronization).
- Fields in the headers on service orders and work orders transfer information, such as the **Service Account**, **Billing Account**, and **Work Order Type**.
- **Service Item Lines** and **Work Order Incidents** in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] transfer information about the customer assets being repaired.
- **Service Line** fields and **Work Order Products** and **Work Order Services** fields, such as **Qty. to Ship**, **Qty. to Invoice**, and **Qty. to Consume**.

In [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], make the following settings on the **Service Management Setup** page:

- Turn on the **Service Order Type Mandatory** toggle. This setting is required because [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] requires a work order type.
- Make sure that the number series you use for service orders is set up to allow manual numbering. On the **No. Series** page, select the **Manual Nos.** checkbox for the number series. Manual numbering lets you create work orders in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] and synchronize them with service orders. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses the order number from [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)].
- Turn off the **One Service Item Line/Order** toggle. This setting lets you have more than one work item line.
- Turn on the **Archive Orders** toggle.
- Make the **Service Order Type** field on service orders mandatory because the **Work Order Type** is mandatory on [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] work orders.

If you choose **Enable Inventory Availability by Location** when you set up the integration, you can view the allocated product quantity from work orders in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] as part of the gross requirements in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]'s inventory availability calculation. Demand generated by orders in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] automatically becomes input for planning through synchronized service orders.

As service or work orders progress toward completion, their status changes. The following table shows how the statues align in both apps.

|[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] status  |[!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] status  | Alignment |
|---------|-----------|---------|
|Pending  |Unscheduled| Bidirectional per mapping to account for item demand. |
|Pending  |Scheduled  | [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Synchronizes the quantity to ship and the quantity to invoice.|
|In process | In progress | [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Synchronizes the quantity to ship and the quantity to invoice. |
|Finished | Completed     | [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Ready for posting in Business Central. |
|Finished | Posted        | [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. When fully invoiced or deleted after partial invoicing in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].|
|N/A     | Canceled      | Not synchronized. Manual alignment is needed for canceled work orders. |

### Upgrade your integration to include service management features

If you set up the integration to only include projects, but decide to add service management features later, that's easy to do in just a few steps. Remember that you must have a Premium license though.

1. On the **Dynamics 365 Field Service Integration Setup** page, turn off the **Enabled** toggle.
1. In the **Integration Type** field, choose **Project and Service**.
1. Turn on the **Enabled** toggle.

## Use data in both applications

The following sections describe the features where you can use the data that comes from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)].

### Field Service

You can [create work orders](/dynamics365/field-service/create-work-order) using the **Service Account** and **Billing Account** from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. On work orders, you must select the **Business Central Project Task** in the **External Project** field. Selecting a project lets you synchronize work order products and services to the appropriate project task in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

You can add inventory and noninventory items as **Work Order Products** on work orders and get the quantity on hand and costs and prices from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. To learn more, go to [Create a work order from the work order form and record list](/dynamics365/field-service/create-work-order#create-a-work-order-from-the-work-order-form-and-record-list).

You can add items of the type service as **Work Order Services**, and get costs and prices from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. To learn more, go to [Products and services tab](/dynamics365/field-service/work-order-experience#products-and-services-tab).

> [!NOTE]
> When a product or service's status on a work order changes from **Estimated** to **Used** in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)], they synchronize to project journal lines in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

You can book a resource and relate the **Bookings** to work order services using a **Bookable Resource** from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

You can use the **Open in Business Central** action in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] to open a location that's coupled to a warehouse.

Use the **Open in Business Central** action to open a location that's coupled to a warehouse. On the **Products** page, technicians can check how much of particular product is available at a warehouse they specify.

From the **Work Order** and **Product** pages, you can view where, and how much, of an item is available. On the **Related** menu, choose **Items Availability by Location**.

When you mark a work order product or service as **Used** on a work order with a specific work order type, the lines synchronize to a service order. Consumption is also posted, based on settings on the **Dynamics 365 Field Service Integration Setup** page.

During consumption and invoice posting in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the quantities are updated on the original work order product and work order service lines in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)].

### Business Central

Depending on your settings on the **Field Service Integration Setup** page, when work orders include products and services, consumption information is transferred and posted using a **Project Journal** in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

The **Quantity To Bill** and **Duration To Bill** values are copied to the **Qty- to Transfer to Invoice** field. Based on those values, you can create and post sales invoices in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to invoice the customer. After the invoice is posted and synchronized to the Dynamics 365 Sales environment, or consumption is processed in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the quantity invoiced and quantity consumed display on the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] tab on the **Work Order Product** and **Work Order Service** pages.  

Use the **Project Planning Lines** page to track posting and invoicing of consumption on work orders. From the **Project Planning Lines** page, you can create and post sales invoices in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Afterward, you can synchronize them with [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] and keep track of the status of the invoices.

> [!NOTE]
> Work order services with a booking that uses a bookable resource that's coupled to a [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] resource synchronize to two project journal lines:
>
> - One line of type **Budget** for the coupled resource
> - One line of type **Billable** for the item being serviced
>
> The product that's chosen on the work order service must be coupled to an item of the type **Service** in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Also, the base unit of measure for the item must be set to the **Hours Unit of Measure** that's chosen on the **Dynamics 365 Field Service Integration Setup** page.
>
> You can create an invoice for an item of the type **Service** from the billable project planning line, and use the budget project planning line to register cost with the resource.

Use the **Locations in Field Service** action on the **Locations** and **Location Card** pages to open a coupled location in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)], synchronize it, set up and delete couplings, and view synchronization logs. You can view the allocated product quantity from work orders in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] as part of the gross requirements in Business Central's inventory availability calculation. Demand generated by orders in [!INCLUDE [field-service-short](includes/field-service-short.md)] automatically become an input for planning.

# Set Up Statuses for Service Orders and Repairs

You must set up repair status options that identify the progress of repair and maintenance of service items in service orders. You must set up at least nine repair status options that identify situations or actions taken when servicing service items.  

You can set the priority level for service order status options. The four priorities are **High**, **Medium High**, **Medium Low**, and **Low**.  

When you change the repair status of a service item in a service order, the service order status is updated. The repair status of each service item is linked to the service order status. If the service items are linked to two or more service order status options, the service order status with the highest priority is selected.  

Before you can set up a repair status, you must set up service status priorities.

## To set up service status priorities

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Order Status**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the service order status you want to set a priority for.  
3. In the **Priority** field, choose the priority you want for this service order status.  

Repeat steps 2 and 3 until you have set the priority for each of the four status options: **Pending**, **In Process**, **Finished**, and **On Hold**.  

## To set up a repair status

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Repair Status**, and then choose the related link.
2. Create a new repair status.  
3. Fill in the **Code** and **Description** fields.  
4. In the **Service Order Status** field, choose the order status to link the repair status to. The **Priority** field displays the priority of the service order status you have chosen.  
5. Choose a repair status. You can choose only one. A repair status cannot be linked more than one repair status option.  
6. To be able to post service orders, including service items, with this repair status, choose the **Posting Allowed** field.  
7. To be able to manually change the service order status option to **Pending** in service orders including service items with this repair status, choose the **Pending Status Allowed** check box.  
8. Choose the **In Process Status Allowed**, **Finished Status Allowed**, and **On Hold Status Allowed** check boxes in the same way.

Repeat these steps for each of the repair status options you want to create.

# Modify planning suggestions in a graphical view

A typical planning activity is to change or add planning worksheet lines to modify the suggested supply orders before you commit them by running the **Carry out Action Message** function. An alternative to doing this in the planning worksheet is to use a graphical view. However, this is currently not supported in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

<!--On the **Item Availability by Timeline** page, you can modify certain supply orders and suggestions by dragging elements on the x-axis to change quantity or dragging elements on the y-axis to change due date.  

When you open the **Item Availability by Timeline** page from the **Planning Worksheet** page, you can make the following changes:  

- Modify a suggested supply order that only exists as a planning line.  
- Modify an existing supply order that the planning system suggests to change.  
- Create a new suggested supply order and modify it.  

For more information about the planning line types that are shown, see the Description field on the **Event Changes** FastTab.  

When you choose **Save Changes** on the **Item Availability by Timeline** page, the modifications that you have made are copied to the planning or requisition worksheet. You can now implement them using the **Carry Out Action Msg.-Plan.** function.  

The following procedure shows how to modify supply suggestions by drag and drop. As an alternative, you can change the **Due Date** and **Quantity** fields on the **Event Changes** FastTab and immediately see the changes graphically on the **Timeline** FastTab on the **Planning Worksheet** page.  

## To modify suggested supply orders in the graphical view

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Planning Worksheet**, and then choose the related link.  

2. Choose the line that you want to see item availability for, choose **Item Availability by**, and then choose **Timeline**.

    The **Item Availability by Timeline** page opens with the item number, location, and variant of the item on the selected planning line prefilled in the **Options** FastTab. The **Timeline** FastTab shows a graphical representation of the item’s projected inventory, including planning suggestions.  

<!--3. Make sure that the **Include Planning Suggestions** field is selected.  
3. Find the suggested supply order that you want to modify. You can identify modifiable elements by the green circle and the disk icon. For more information about the different symbols, see [Symbols and Icons on the Timeline FastTab](#symbols-and-icons-on-the-timeline-fasttab).  
4. Place the pointer over the green circle until it enlarges and the pointer changes to Move shape (four arrows).  
5. Press and hold the mouse button while you drag the pointer up or down to modify the quantity. Press and hold the mouse button while you drag the pointer left or right to modify the due date.  
6. In addition to moving elements by drag and drop, you can modify planning suggestions by using a number of drop-down menu functions. Access the drop-down menu for the green circle of a suggested supply element and select one the following functions  

    |Function|Description|  
    |--------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Create New Supply**|Creates a new element point where you access the drop-down menu, which represents a new suggested supply order. It becomes a new line in the planning worksheet when you choose **Save Changes**.<br /><br /> **NOTE:** If the **Location Filter** or **Variant Filter** fields on the **Options** FastTab are empty or have more than one filter value, then the new supply is created and later saved to the planning or requisition worksheet with the following codes:<br /><br /> * If the filter field is empty, then the new supply is created without a location or variant code.<br /><br /> * If more than one filter value is defined, then the new supply is created for the first filter value according to the sorting method.<br /><br /> If you want another variant or location code, then you must manually change it on the new planning line.|  
    |**Auto-Adjust Supply**|Optimizes a new supply that you have created in the graph by making sure that it results in zero inventory before the next supply.|  
    |**Delete Supply**|Deletes the element in the **Timeline** FastTab and deletes the planning line when you choose **Save Changes**. The icon changes to a disk that has a red cross when the supply has been deleted.<br /><br /> **NOTE:** You can only delete a supply of action message type **New**. After you choose **Save Changes**, you must manually delete the planning line in question in the planning or requisition worksheet.|  

7. Choose the **Reload** action if you want to reset all the changes that you have made after you last opened the **Item Availability by Timeline** page or selected **Reload**.  
8. When the elements are placed where you want them in the diagram, choose **Save Changes** to copy modified quantity and date changes to the planning or requisition lines that represent the graphical elements.  

To implement the supply plan changes, you must follow the resulting action messages from the planning or requisition worksheet. For more information, see Carry Out Action Msg.-Plan..

## Symbols and Icons on the Timeline FastTab
 |Symbol/Icon|Description|  
 |------------------|---------------------------------------|  
 |Black cross|Orders (both supply and demand).<br /><br /> -   Cannot be modified.<br />-   Visible when the **Show Projected Inventory** field is selected (orange graph).|

# Working with Microsoft Excel layouts

Microsoft Excel report layouts are based on Excel workbooks (.xlsx files). With them, you can create reports that include familiar Excel features for summarizing, analyzing, and presenting data such as formulas, PivotTables, and PivotCharts.

![Shows an example of an Excel layout.](media/excel-layout-2.png)

This article explains some important things you need to know to get started with Excel layouts.

## Why use Excel layouts?

Benefits of using Excel layouts:

- You can create your own report layouts with Excel, either from scratch or based on an existing layout.
- An Excel report layout can contain multiple worksheets, be interactive and use visualizations, pivot tables, and slicers.
- View raw data from the report dataset, which helps you understand how the report works and where the data in visuals comes from.
- Use built-in Microsoft Office features to do post-processing on rendered reports, including:
  - [Protecting worksheets](https://support.microsoft.com/office/protect-a-worksheet-3179efdb-1285-4d49-a9c3-f4ca36276de6)
  - [Applying sensitivity labels](https://support.microsoft.com/office/apply-sensitivity-labels-to-your-files-and-email-in-office-2f96e7cd-d5a4-403b-8bd7-4cc636bae0f9)
  - [Adding comments and notes](https://support.microsoft.com/office/insert-comments-and-notes-in-excel-65f504d8-160b-4a05-ac30-46fbd5227a52)
  - [Forecasting and analysis](https://support.microsoft.com/office/introduction-to-what-if-analysis-22bffa5f-e891-4acc-bf7a-e4645c446fb4)
- Use installed add-ins and app integrations, such as Power Automate flows or OneDrive.

> [!TIP]
> With OneDrive integration set up, when you run a report with an Excel layout, the Excel workbook file is copied to OneDrive and then opened in Excel online. For more information, see [Save Excel workbooks and report files in OneDrive](./across-onedrive-overview.md#save-excel-workbooks-and-report-files-in-onedrive)

## Get started

There are basically two tasks involved in setting up an Excel layout for a report:

1. Create the new Excel layout file.
2. Add the new layout to the report.

## Task 1: Create the Excel layout file

There are several ways to create an Excel layout file for a report:

* From any report.
* From an existing Excel report layout.
* From Visual Studio Code.

### [From any report](#tab/any-report)

Follow these steps to create an Excel layout from any report, regardless of the current layout type. The Excel layout contains the required **Data** sheet and table, and a **Report Metadata** sheet.

1. [!INCLUDE[open-report-layouts-page](includes/open-report-layouts-page.md)]
2. On the **Report Layouts** page, choose any layout for the report, then choose the **Run Report** action.
3. On the report's request page, choose **Send to**, then **Microsoft Excel Document (data only)**, and then **OK**.

   This step downloads an Excel workbook that contains the report dataset.
4. Open the downloaded file in Excel, make your changes, and then save the file.

### [From another Excel report layout](#tab/other-layout)

If there's already an Excel layout for a report, you can use the existing layout as a starting point. There are two approaches to getting a copy of the layout. You can either export the existing layout from the **Report Layouts** page or download the layout from the report's request page. Both ways download an Excel layout file that includes all the sheets of the existing file. The difference is when you download it from the request page, the layout includes actual data. The data isn't required, but it helps when you design the layout.

**Approach 1: Export the layout from the Report Layouts page**

1. [!INCLUDE[open-report-layouts-page](includes/open-report-layouts-page.md)]
2. Select the Excel layout from the list, and then choose the **Export Layout** action.
3. Open the file in Excel, make your changes, and then save the file.

**Approach 2: Download the layout from the report's request page**

1. [!INCLUDE[open-report-layouts-page](includes/open-report-layouts-page.md)]
2. On the **Report Layouts** page, choose any layout for the report, and then choose the **Run Report** action.
3. On the report's request page, choose **Download**.
4. Open the file in Excel, make your changes, and then save the file.

### [From Visual Studio Code](#tab/from-code)

Using Visual Studio Code is the most advanced way to create an Excel report layout. It requires knowledge of AL code and is intended for programmers. In this approach, the Excel layouts are part of an extension package you install. Learn more at [Creating an Excel Layout Report](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-howto-excel-report-layout) in the Developer and IT Pro help.

---

## Task 2: Add the Excel layout to the report

When you have the Excel layout file, the next task is to add it as a new layout for the report.

1. [!INCLUDE[open-report-layouts-page](includes/open-report-layouts-page.md)]
2. Choose **New Layout**.
3. Set **Report ID** to **Report**.
4. In the **Layout Name** field, enter a name.
5. In the **Format Options** field, choose **Excel**.
6. Select **OK**, and then do one of the following steps to upload the layout file for the report:

   [!INCLUDE[file-upload](includes/file-upload.md)]

   The selected file is uploaded to the layout, and the **Report Layouts** page opens.
8. To review the report in the new layout, choose the layout from the list, and then select **Run Report**.

<!--

**Data** sheet
  - An Excel layout must contain a sheet named **Data**.
  - The **Data** sheet must include a table named **Data**.

**Data** table
  - The **Data** sheet must include a table named **Data**.
  - The table must have at least one column and can only include columns that are also in the report dataset.
  - The table must start in the first cell **A1** of the **Data** sheet.

3. Report metadata 
-->

## Understanding Excel layouts

There are a few things you need to know or consider when you create or change Excel layouts. Every Excel layout must have a **Data** sheet and a **Data** table. These elements define the business data that you can work with from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The **Data** sheet links the layout to the business data, which is the basis for the calculations and visualizations that you present on other sheets.

For the layout to work, there are some requirements to the structure of the Excel workbook that must be met. The following diagram and table outline the elements of an Excel layout and the requirements.

[![Shows the different elements of an Excel layout.](media/excel-layout-callouts-2.png)](media/excel-layout-callouts-2.png#lightbox)

|No.|Element|Description|Mandatory|
|---|-------|----|---|
|1|**Data** sheet|<ul><li>Must have the name **Data**.</li><li>Can only include one table, which must be named **Data**.</li></ul>|![Is mandatory](media/check.png) | 
|2|**Data** table|<ul><li>Must have the name **Data**.</li><li>Must have at least one column.</li><li>Can only include columns that are in the report dataset.</li><li>Must start in the first cell **A1** of the **Data** sheet.</li></ul>|![Is mandatory](media/check.png)|
|3|Presentation sheets|<ul><li>Used to present data.</li><li>Data comes from the **Data** sheet. </li></ul>||
|4|**Report Metadata** sheet|<ul><li>Automatically included if the layout was created by exporting another Excel report.</li><li>Contains general information about the report.</li><li>Can be deleted.</li></ul>|

In summary, you can or shouldn't do the following things on the **Data** sheet:

- You can delete or hide columns.
- You can place the sheets in any order, with the **Data** sheet first or last.
- Don't change the name of **Data** sheet, **Data** table, or columns.
- Don't add any columns unless they're included in the report dataset.

# Planning

The production operations required to transform inputs into finished goods must be planned daily or weekly depending on the volume and nature of the products. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers features to supply for anticipated and actual demand from sale, assembly, and production as well as features for distribution planning using stockkeeping units and location transfers.

> [!NOTE]
> This topic mainly describes planning for companies involved in manufacturing or assembly management where the resulting supply orders can be either production, assembly, transfer, or purchase orders. The main interface for this planning work is the **Planning Worksheet** page.
>
> [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] also supports supply planning for wholesale companies where the resulting supply orders can only be transfer and purchase orders. The main interface for this planning work is the **Requisition Worksheet** page, which is described indirectly in this topic as most planning functionality applies to both worksheets.

Planning can be seen as the preparation of required supply orders in the purchasing, assembly, or manufacturing departments to fulfill sales or end-item demand. For more information, see [Purchasing](purchasing-manage-purchasing.md), [Assembly Management](assembly-assemble-items.md), and [Manufacturing](production-manage-manufacturing.md).

# Released Production Orders (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Released Production Orders** report provides detailed information about all released production orders, including expected versus finished quantities and the variance.

:::image type="content" source="media/manufacturing/released-production-orders.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Released Production Orders Power BI Report" lightbox="media/manufacturing/released-production-orders.png":::

## Use the report

The report is meant for manufacturing managers and supervisors.

Manufacturing managers use the report to track released production orders. By analyzing the expected versus finished quantities, you can find issues that might affect the production process. For example, if the finished quantity is much lower than the expected quantity, it might indicate a problem with the manufacturing process or materials. By identifying and addressing these issues, you can improve efficiency and reduce costs.

Production supervisors use this report to monitor expected and finished quantities. This information helps you prioritize and schedule the next items for production. For example, if the finished quantity is close to the expected quantity, you can prioritize the next item for production. If the finished quantity is much lower than the expected quantity, you might need to adjust the production schedule to ensure you compete the order on time.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The *Released Production Orders* report includes the following KPIs and measures: 

- [Expected Quantity (Base)](manufacturing-powerbi-kpis.md#expected-quantity-base)
- [Finished Quantity (Base)](manufacturing-powerbi-kpis.md#finished-quantity-base)
- [Qty. Variance](manufacturing-powerbi-kpis.md#qty-variance)

# FAQs for analysis assist (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]

These frequently asked questions (FAQ) describe the AI impact of the analysis assist feature in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/production-ready-preview-dynamics365.md)]

## What is analysis assist?

Analysis assist is a copilot that provides assistance for working with the [data analysis mode](analysis-mode.md) in Business Central. The data analysis mode enables you to organize, aggregate, and summarize data on pages and queries to make it more suitable for analyzing and extracting meaningful insights. With analysis assist, you can automatically construct the view of the data you want to analyze by expressing your needs in simple, natural language, like "show vendors by location sorted by number of purchases." Analysis assist makes it easier to work with data without the need for complex technical skills.

## What are capabilities of analysis assist?

Analysis assist converts natural language instructions into a structured design for displaying data in the analysis mode, without creating, modifying, or updating customer business data itself.

## What is the intended use of analysis assist?

Analysis assist helps create analysis tabs in the data analysis mode to present data in a manner that makes it easier for you to draw conclusions. However, it's important to note that analysis assist doesn't provide direct insights or conclusions about the data. It's a tool to help users organize and view their data. It's up to the user to extract actionable information, discover trends, and make informed decisions to drive business value.

## How was analysis assist evaluated? What metrics are used to measure performance?

- The feature underwent extensive testing based on [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]'s demonstration data and other fictitious business data. Copilot was given numerous prompts in the supported languages that covered a broad range of instructions and styles of expressing intent. The outcomes were evaluated against accuracy, relevance, and safety.

- The feature is built in accordance with Microsoft's Responsible AI Standard. [Learn more about responsible AI from Microsoft.](https://aka.ms/RAI)

## How does Microsoft monitor the quality of generated content?

Microsoft has various systems in place to ensure that content generated by Copilot is of the highest quality, detect abuse, and ensure safety for our customers and their data.

Users have the opportunity to provide feedback to every Copilot response and report inaccurate or inappropriate content to help Microsoft improve this feature.

- If you encounter inappropriate generated content, report it to Microsoft by using this feedback form: [Report abuse](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2249810)

- We analyze user feedback on the feature and use it to help us improve responses.

  You provide feedback by using the like (thumbs up) or dislike (thumbs down) icon on the **Copilot** pane in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

- Microsoft might disable the Copilot features for selected customers if abuse of the functionality is detected.

## What are the limitations of analysis assist? How can users minimize the impact of the analysis assist limitations when using the system?

- General AI limitations:

  AI systems are valuable tools but they're nondeterministic. The content they generate might not be accurate. It's important to use your judgment to review and verify responses before making decisions that could affect stakeholders like customers and partners.

- Geographic and language availability

   [!INCLUDE[copilot-geo-and-language-availability](includes/copilot-geo-and-language-availability.md)]

- Certain industry, product, and subject limitations:

  Organizations that operate in some business domains, such as medical, drugs, legal, and weapons, might experience lower quality of service.

## What data does analysis assist collect and how is it used?

The analysis assist capability collects the minimum data required by Business Central to offer the service. Microsoft doesn't use your company data, including the text you send to Copilot, to train the foundational models for the benefit of others. For more information, see [Dynamics 365 terms for Azure OpenAI-powered features](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2236010).

It also collects data from the feedback users can provide using the like (thumbs up) or dislike (thumbs down) icons in the analysis assist **Copilot** page. The data is anonymous and includes the choice of like or dislike, the dislike reason if provided, and the Copilot feature the feedback applies to.

# Handling missing option values

This article is intended for a technical audience. The processes it describes require the help of a developer.

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] contains three option set fields that contain values that you can map to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] fields of the Option type for automated synchronization. During synchronization, nonmapped options are ignored and the missing options are appended to the related [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] table and added to the **Dataverse Option Mapping** system table to handle manually later. For example, by adding the missing options in either product and then updating the mapping.

The **Integration Table Mapping** page contains three fields that contain one or more mapped option values. After a full synchronization, the **Dataverse Option Mapping** page contains the nonmapped options in the three fields.

|         Record             | Option Value | Option Value Caption |
|----------------------------|--------------|----------------------|
| Payment Terms: NET30	     | 1            | Net 30	           |
| Payment Terms: 2%10NET30   | 2            | 2% 10; Net 30        |
| Payment Terms: NET45	     | 3            | Net 45               |
| Payment Terms: NET60	     | 4            | Net 60               |
| Shipment Method: FOB	     | 1            | FOB                  |
| Shipment Method: NOCHARGE  | 2            | No Charge            |
| Shipping Agent: AIRBORNE   | 1            | Airborne             |
| Shipping Agent: DHL        | 2            | DHL                  |
| Shipping Agent: FEDEX      | 3            | FedEx                |
| Shipping Agent: UPS        | 4            | UPS                  |
| Shipping Agent: POSTALMAIL | 5            | Postal Mail          |
| Shipping Agent: FULLLOAD   | 6            | Full Load            |
| Shipping Agent: WILLCALL   | 7            | Will Call            |

The content of the **Dataverse Option Mapping** page is based on enum values in the **CRM Account** table. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)], the following fields on the account table are mapped to fields on the customer and vendor records:

- **Address 1: Freight Terms** of data type Enum, where values are defined as follows:

```
enum 5335 "CDS Shipment Method Code"
{
    Extensible = true;
    value(0; " ") { Caption = ' '; }
    value(1; "FOB") { Caption = 'FOB'; }
    value(2; "NoCharge") { Caption = 'No Charge'; }
}
```

- **Address 1: Shipping Method** of data type Enum, where values are defined as follows:

```
enum 5336 "CDS Shipping Agent Code"
{
    Extensible = true;
    value(0; " ") { Caption = ' '; }
    value(1; "Airborne") { Caption = 'Airborne'; }
    value(2; "DHL") { Caption = 'DHL'; }
    value(3; "FedEx") { Caption = 'FedEx'; }
    value(4; "UPS") { Caption = 'UPS'; }
    value(5; "PostalMail") { Caption = 'Postal Mail'; }
    value(6; "FullLoad") { Caption = 'Full Load'; }
    value(7; "WillCall") { Caption = 'Will Call'; }
}
```

- **Payment Terms** of data type Enum, where values are defined as follows:

```
enum 5334 "CDS Payment Terms Code"
{
    Extensible = true;
    value(0; " ") { Caption = ' '; }
    value(1; "Net30") { Caption = 'Net 30'; }
    value(2; "2%10Net30") { Caption = '2% 10; Net 30'; }
    value(3; "Net45") { Caption = 'Net 45'; }
    value(4; "Net60") { Caption = 'Net 60'; }
}
```

All of the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] enums are mapped to option sets in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)].

## Extending option sets in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]
1. Create a new AL extension.

2. Add an Enum extension for the options that you want to extend. Be sure that you use the same value. 

```
enumextension 50100 "CDS Payment Terms Code Extension" extends "CDS Payment Terms Code"
{
    value(779800001; "Cash Payment") { Caption = 'Cash Payment'; }
    value(779800002; "Transfer") { Caption = 'Transfer'; }
}
```

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> You must use the same option ID values from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] when you extend the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] enum. Otherwise synchronization will fail.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Do not use the ","  character in the enum values and captions. This is currently not supported by the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] runtime.

> [!NOTE]
> The first ten characters of the new option value names and captions must be unique. For example, two options named "Transfer 20 working days" and "Transfer 20 calendar days" will cause an error because both have the same first 10 characters, "Transfer 2". Name them, for example, "TRF20 WD" and "TRF20 CD."

## Update [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] option mapping
Now you can recreate the mapping between [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] options and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] records.

On the **Integration Table Mapping** page, choose the line for the **Payment Terms** map, and then choose the **Synchronize Modified Records** action. The **Dataverse Option Mapping** page is updated with the following records.

|         Record                 | Option Value   | Option Value Caption |
|--------------------------------|----------------|----------------------|
| Payment Terms: NET30	         | 1              | Net 30	             |
| Payment Terms: 2%10NET30       | 2              | 2% 10; Net 30        |
| Payment Terms: NET45 	         | 3              | Net 45               |
| Payment Terms: NET60	         | 4              | Net 60               | 
| **Payment Terms: CASH PAYME**  | **779800001**  | **Cash Payment**     |
| **Payment Terms: TRANSFER**    | **779800002**  | **Transfer**         |

The **Payment Terms** table in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] has new records for the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] options. In the following table, new options are in bold font. Italic rows represent all options that can now be synchronized. Remaining rows represent options aren't in use and are ignored during synchronization. You can remove them or extend Dataverse options with the same names.

# Sustainability scorecards and goals overview

This article offers guidance on how to create scorecards and goals, and how to update the status of goals. Scorecards and goals allow organizations to curate sustainability metrics and track them against key business objectives. Goals can be created based on current and target values, so users can keep track of the progress of current gas emissions, or water/waste intensity, compared to previous periods.  

## Create a scorecard  

To create a sustainability scorecard, follow these steps:

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sustainability Scorecards**, and then select the related link.
2. On the **Sustainability Scorecards** page, select **New** to create a new scorecard.  
3. Specify the **No.** and the **Name** fields on the **General** FastTab, and then add the **Owner**.

> [!NOTE]
> In the **Owner** field, you can only choose users who enabled the **Sustainability Manager** field on the **User Setup** page.

## Create goals  

To create a new sustainability goal, follow these steps:

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sustainability Scorecards**, and then select the related link.
2. Choose the **Goals** action to create a new sustainability goal for the scorecard.  
3. Select **New** to start creating a goal.
4. The **Scorecard No.** is automatically added based on the value from the sustainability scorecard, and you can't edit this field. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] also fills in the **Unit of Measure** field based on the **Emission Unit of Measure Code** on the **Sustainability Setup** page.  
5. Fill in **No.** and **Name** of the new sustainability goal. The **Owner** field is automatically filled in based on the value from the connected **Sustainability Scorecard**.
6. You can create a sustainability goal for the entire company, a specific country/region, or a facility. To create a specific goal, choose the country or region in the **Country/Region Code** field or the facility in the **Responsibility Center** field.  
7. Select the **Start Date** and **End Date** fields to set up a dedicated period for tracking current values. This configuration determines the values in the **Current Value for CO2**, **Current Value for CH4**, **Current Value for N2O**, **Current Value for Water Intensity**, and **Current Value for Waste Intensity** fields.  
8. Select the **Baseline Start Date** and **Baseline End Date** fields to set up a dedicated baseline period for comparing current values. This configuration determines the values in the **Baseline for CO2**, **Baseline for CH4**, **Baseline for N2O**, **Baseline for Water Intensity**, and **Baseline for Waste Intensity** fields.  
9. You can also add target values in the selected **Unit of Measure** field for the current period using the following **Target Value for CO2**, **Target Value for CH4**, **Target Value for N2O**, **Target Value for Water Intensity**, and **Target Value for Waste Intensity** fields.
10. You can specify one of these goals as a **Main Goal**. Values from the main goal are used on the **Sustainability Manager** Role Center.  

If you have many goals on the page, you can use the **Show My Goals** action to show only your goals. To show all, run the **Show All Goals** action.  

> [!NOTE]
> You can only create sustainability goals for a specific sustainability scorecard. You can't create goals that aren't related to a scorecard, but you can create more goals for one scorecard. You can only have one sustainability goal as the **Main Goal**.  

> [!NOTE]
> You can set up different combinations of goals for the whole company, specific countries or regions, and a responsibility center for a sustainability scorecard. You can also use different periods for the same model of tracking.

# Set up inventory valuation and costing

To make sure that inventory costs are recorded correctly, you must set up various fields and pages before you begin to make item transactions. Typically, businesses choose a specific costing method and apply that to inventory items, for example, to help them track the value of items on stock.  

> [!TIP]
> For an introduction to costing in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], see [About Inventory Costing](finance-learn-about-costing.md).

The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the articles that describe them.

# Work with intercompany documents and journals

Use intercompany documents or journals to post transactions with your intercompany partners. You can post transactions to G/L accounts, and if you set up intercompany bank accounts you can also post bank-to-bank transactions. To learn more about setting up intercompany bank accounts, go to [Specify the bank accounts to use for intercompany partners](intercompany-how-setup.md#specify-bank-accounts-for-intercompany-partners).  

When you post an intercompany document or journal line in your company, a corresponding document or journal line is created in your intercompany outbox. You transfer the line from your outbox to your partner. Your partner can then post the corresponding transaction in their company, without having to reenter the data.

For sales and purchase documents, the intercompany partner code on the customer or vendor ensures that all orders and invoices for transactions between the partners produce corresponding documents in the partner companies. The company accounts balance correctly.

The same is true for intercompany general journal lines. You don't need to specify accounts, you just choose the partner company. Corresponding intercompany general journal lines are then created in the partner company.

## Fill in and send an intercompany sales order

You can send sales and purchase orders and return orders before posting. Invoices and credit memos can't be sent until they're posted.

The following procedure describes how to create and send an intercompany sales order. The same steps apply to intercompany purchase orders and return orders, and to posted intercompany invoices and credit memos.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose **New** to create a new sales order. For more information, see [Sell Products](sales-how-sell-products.md).  
3. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
4. Make sure the customer is an intercompany partner.
5. To send the sales order before you post it, choose the **Send IC Sales Order** action.

> [!NOTE]
> If you do step 5, the sales order goes to your intercompany outbox, where you can send it later. To learn more about the intercompany inbox and outbox, go to [Manage the Intercompany Inbox and Outbox](intercompany-how-manage-intercompany-inbox.md).

## Fill in and post an intercompany journal

When you post an intercompany general journal line in your company, a corresponding journal line is created in your intercompany outbox that you can transfer to your partner. With 2022 release wave 1, you can also set up the company to automatically create received intercompany transactions that partners posted in intercompany general journals. Your partner can then post the corresponding transaction in their company, without having to reenter the data.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Intercompany General Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the journal batch. For more information, see [Work with General Journals](ui-work-general-journals.md).
3. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](../archive/invoicing/includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
4. In the **IC Partner G/L Acc. No.** field, enter the intercompany general ledger account that the amount posts to in your partner's company.

    > [!NOTE]
    > This field must be filled in on a line with a bank account or general ledger account in either the **Account No.** field or the **Bal. Account No.** field.  
5. Choose the **Post** action.

The entries are posted in your company and a journal with corresponding entries is created in your intercompany outbox. From there, you can send them to your partner.

# Work with calendar dates and times

You can enter dates and times in multiple ways. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_long.md)] includes powerful features that accelerate data entry, or help you write complex calendar expressions. There are various places throughout the application where you can enter dates and times in fields. For example, on a sales order, you can set the shipment date. When filtering lists or report data, you can enter dates and times to pinpoint only the data that you're interested in.

[!INCLUDE [about-ui-learn](includes/about-ui-learn.md)]

## Check your region and language settings

The **My Settings** page specifies the **Region** and **Language** that you're using in the application. These settings influence how you enter dates and times.

- The **Region** setting determines how dates, times, numbers, and currencies are shown or formatted.

- For date patterns that involve words, the language of the words that you use must correspond to the **Language** setting.

> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_long.md)] uses the Gregorian calendar system.

## Entering dates

In a date field, you can enter a date using the standard format for your region setting. Different regions can use different separators between the days, months, and years. For example, some regions use dashes (mm-dd-yyyy) and others use forward slashes (mm/dd/yyyy).  

> [!TIP]
> You can use any separators, even a space, and the date will automatically be changed to use separators that match your region.

> [!NOTE]
> The format in which dates are displayed on printed reports or emailed documents isn't influenced by your personal choice of region setting.

To work more productively with dates and times, you can use any of the methods or formats that are described in the following sections.

### Picking dates from the calendar

Any field displaying a calendar icon can be set using the calendar date picker. To display the calendar date picker, activate the calendar icon or select the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Home</kbd> keyboard shortcut in the field.

![Date fields.](media/ui-date-field.png "Example of a date field")

See also [Keyboard Shortcuts in the calendar date picker](keyboard-shortcuts.md#calendarshortcuts).

### Day\-week\-year pattern

You can enter a date as a weekday followed by a week number and, optionally, a year. For example, Mon25 or mon25 means Monday in week 25. If you don't enter a year, the year of the work date is used.

Instead of entering the entire word for the day of the week, you can enter part of the word, starting from the beginning. If there were conflicts (such as with s which could be Saturday or Sunday), the days are evaluated according to the region setting. The input is first evaluated against work date and today as well, which you want to keep in mind when abbreviating. For example, _t_ already means today, so it can't mean Tuesday or Thursday.

The week number scheme is always ISO 8601, where week 1 is the week with 4 January in it, or the week with the first Thursday of the year.

### Digit patterns

In a date field you can enter two, four, six, or eight digits:

- Two digits are interpreted as the day, and it adds the month and the year of the work date.

- Four digits are interpreted as the day and the month, and it adds the year of the work date. Your region settings determine the order of the day and month. Even if your region settings have the year before the day and month, four digits are interpreted as the day and month.

- If the date you want to enter is in the range 01/01/1950 through 12/31/2049, you can enter the year with two digits; otherwise, enter the year with four digits.

  > [!NOTE]
  > If you're using [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, the two-digit year range may be different. Administrators can change the range by modifying the **CalendarTwoDigitYearMax** setting of the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] server. For more information, see [Configuring Business Central Server](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/configure-server-instance#General).

### Today

Enter the word for _today_, in the language specified on the **My Settings** page, to set the date on a record to today's date. Instead of entering the entire word, you can enter part of the word, starting from the beginning. For example, in English, you can enter _t_ or _tod_, as long as it isn't also the start of another word.

### Period

To filter on a specific accounting period, in a date field enter the letter p, or the word period, followed by a number that identifies the accounting period, like p2 or period4. The accounting period is relative to the fiscal year of the current work date that set in your Role Center. For example, if the work date is **03/21/22**, then _p1_, or just _p_, filters on the first accounting period of the fiscal year 2022 (such as 01/01/22..01/31/22). _p15_ filters on the 15th accounting period from the start of fiscal year 2022 (such as 03/01/23..03/31/23).

The accounting periods are defined on the **Accounting Periods** page. To view or change the accounting periods, open the page [here](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=100).

### Work Date

Use a work date to specify a date that isn't today's date on records. For example, a work date is useful when you need to set a particular date for multiple records. You specify the work date on the **My Settings** page. 

A fast way to enter the work date on records is to enter some or all of the word _work_. Start from the beginning of the word in the language in which you use [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_long.md)]. For example, in English, you can enter _w_ or _work_. The language is also specified on the **My Settings** page.

If a work date isn't specified, today's date is used. To learn more, go to [Change Basic Settings, such as the Work Date](ui-change-basic-settings.md#work-date).

### Closing date

When you close a fiscal year, you can use closing dates to indicate that an entry is a closing entry. A closing date technically is between two dates, for example between December 31 and January 1.

To specify that a date is a closing date, put C just before the date, such as C123101. Use this format in combination with all the date patterns.

### Examples

The following table contains examples of dates using all the formats. It assumes region settings that format dates according to: **year.month.day.**, a week starting on Monday, and the English language.

|**Entry**      |**Interpretation**      |
|---------------|------------------------|
|2022.12.31.|2022.12.31.|
|221231|2022.12.31.|
|22.12.31.|2022.12.31.|
|22.12.31.|2022.12.31.|
|20221231|2022.12.31.|
|22/12,31|2022.12.31.|
|11|work date year.work date month.11.|
|1112|work date year.11.12.|
|t or today|today's date|
|p4|date range that includes the fourth accounting period, such as 04/01/20..04/30/20|
|w or work date|the working date|
|m or Monday|Monday of the work date week|
|tu or Tuesday|Tuesday of the work date week|
|sa or Saturday|Saturday of the work date week|
|s or Sunday|Sunday of the work date week|
|t23|Tuesday of week 23 of the work date year|
|t 23|Tuesday of week 23 of the work date year|
|t-1|Tuesday of week 1 of the work date year|

##  <a name="BKMK_SettingDateRanges"></a> Setting ranges

To display only the data contained in that range, on lists, totals, and reports you can filter on dates, times, and datetimes with a start value and optionally an end value. The standard rules apply to the way you set date ranges.

|**Meaning**|**Sample expression (Date)**|**Data included in the filter**|
|-----------|---------------------|--------------------|
|Interval|12 15 00..01 15 01<br /><br />..12 15 00<br /><br />p1..p4|Records with dates between and including 12 15 00 and 01 15 01.<br /><br />Records with dates of 12 15 00 or earlier.<br /><br />Date range that includes the second, third, and fourth accounting periods, such as 01/01/20..04/30/20.|
|Either/or|12 15 00\|12 16 00|Records with dates of either 12 15 00 or 12 16 00. If there are records with dates on both days, they all display.|
|Combination|12 15 00\|12 01 00..12 10 00  <br /><br />..12 14 00\|12 30 00..|Records with dates of 12 15 00 or on dates between and including 12 01 00 and 12 10 00.  <br /><br />Records with dates of 12 14 00 or earlier, or dates of 12 30 00 or later, that is, all records except records with dates between and including 12 15 00 and 12 29 00.|

You can use any of the valid formats in date range filters. For example, mon14 3..t 4p applied on a datetime field results in a filter from 3 AM on Monday in week 14 of the current work date year until today at 4PM.

## Use date formulas

A date formula is a short, abbreviated combination of letters and numbers that specifies how to calculate dates. You can enter date formulas in various date calculation fields or filters.

> [!NOTE]
> In all data formula fields, one day is automatically included to cover today as the day when the period starts. Accordingly, for example, if you enter 1W, then the period is actually eight days because today is included. To specify a period of seven days \(one true week\) including the period starting date, then you must enter 6D or 1W-1D.

Here are some examples of how date formulas can be used:

- The date formula in the recurring frequency field in recurring journals determines how often the entry on the journal line posts.
- The date formula in the **Grace Period** field for a specified reminder level determines the period of time that must pass from the due date (or from the date of the previous reminder) before a reminder is created.
- The date formula in the **Due Date Calculation** field determines how to calculate the due date on the reminder.

The date formula can contain a maximum of 20 characters, both numbers and letters. You can use the following letters, which are abbreviations for calendar units.

|  Letter  |  Meaning  |
|----------|----------------------|
|C|Current|
|D|Day\(s\)|
|W|Week\(s\)|
|M|Month\(s\)|
|Q|Quarter\(s\)|
|Y|Year\(s\)|

You can construct a date formula in three ways.

The following example shows how to use C, for current, and a time unit.

|  Expression  |  Meaning  |
|--------------|-----------|
|CW|Current week|
|CM|Current month (last day of the month)|

The following example shows how to use a number and a time unit. A number can't be larger than 9999.

|  Expression  |  Meaning  |
|--------------|-----------|
|10D|10 days from today|
|2W|2 weeks from today|

The following example shows how to use a time unit and a number.

|  Expression  |  Meaning  |
|--------------|-----------|
|D10|The next 10th day of a month|
|WD4|The next 4th day of a week \(Thursday\)|

The following example shows how you can combine these three forms as needed.

|  Expression  |  Meaning  |
|--------------|-----------|
|CM+10D|Current month \+ 10 days|

The following example shows how you can use a minus sign to indicate a date in the past.

|  Expression  |  Meaning  |
|--------------|-----------|
|-1Y|1 year ago from today|

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If the location uses a base calendar, then the date formula that you enter in, for example, the **Shipping Time** field is interpreted according to the calendar working days. For example, 1W  means seven working days.
<!--
# Entering Date Ranges
You can set filters containing a start date and an end date to display only the data contained in that date range or time interval. Special rules apply to the way you set date ranges. Let's take the **Customer Top 10** as an example:

![Setting a date range in the request page for the Customer Top 10 list.](./media/ui-enter-date-ranges/customer-top10-list.png)

Here you can limit the report to a date range such as the past 2 weeks, or a total of 6 weeks, or whatever range you want. To set date ranges, you enter dates and then use either **..** or **|** to set the range. In our example, to show the top 10 customers for the first two weeks of May, you would set the date filter to *05 01 17..05 14 17*.
Here are a couple of other examples:

| Meaning | Example | Entries included |
|---|---|---|
|Equal to| 12 15 16 |Only those posted on December 15 2016.|
|Interval| 12 15 16..01 15 17<br /><br />..12 15 16|Those posted on dates between and including December 15 2016 and January 15 2017.<br /><br />Those posted on December 15 2016 or earlier.|
|Either/or|12 15 16&#124;12 16 16|Those posted on either December 15 or December 16 2016. If there are entries posted on both days, they will all be displayed.|

You can also combine the various format types.

| Example | Entries included |
|---|---|
|12 15 16&#124;12 01 16..05 31 17 | Entries posted either on December 15 2016 or on dates between and including December 01 2016 and May 31 2017. |
|..12 14 16&#124;12 30 16.. | Entries posted on December 14 or earlier, or entries posted on December 30 or later - that is, all entries except those posted on dates between and including December 15 and 29. |

Note that we have used the US date format MMDDYY here. As [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] becomes available in other markets, you'll be able to use the formats that you are used to.

## Use Date Formulas
A date formula is a short, abbreviated combination of letters and numbers that specifies how to calculate dates. You can enter date formulas in various date calculation fields and in recurring frequency fields in recurring journals.

> [!NOTE]
> In all data formula fields, one day is automatically included to cover today as the day when the period starts. Accordingly, for example, if you enter **1W**, then the period is actually eight days because today is included. To specify a period of seven days (one true week) including the period starting date, then you must enter **6D** or **1W\-1D**.

Here are some examples of how date formulas can be used:

- The date formula in the recurring frequency field in recurring journals determines how often the entry on the journal line will be posted.

- The date formula in the **Grace Period** field for a specified reminder level determines the period of time that must pass from the due date (or from the due date of the previous reminder) before a reminder will be created.

- The date formula in the **Due Date Calculation** field determines how to calculate the due date on the reminder.

The date calculation formula can contain a maximum of 20 characters, both numbers and letters. You can use the following letters, which are abbreviations for time specifications.

|  Letter  |  Time specification  |
|----------|----------------------|
|C|Current|
|D|Day\(s\)|
|W|Week\(s\)|
|M|Month\(s\)|
|Q|Quarter\(s\)|
|Y|Year\(s\)|

You can construct a date formula in three ways.

The following example shows how to use **C**, for current, and a time unit.

|  Expression  |  Meaning  |
|--------------|-----------|
|CW|Current week|
|CM|Current month|

The following example shows how to use a number and a time unit. A number cannot be larger than 9999.

|  Expression  |  Meaning  |
|--------------|-----------|
|10D|10 days from today|
|2W|2 weeks from today|

The following example shows how to use a time unit and a number.

|  Expression  |  Meaning  |
|--------------|-----------|
|D10|The next 10th day of a month|
|WD4|The next 4th day of a week \(Thursday\)|

The following example shows how you can combine these three forms as needed.

|  Expression  |  Meaning  |
|--------------|-----------|
|CM\+10D|Current month \+ 10 days|

The following example shows how you can use a minus sign to indicate a date in the past.

|  Expression  |  Meaning  |
|--------------|-----------|
|-1Y|1 year ago from today|

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If the location uses a base calendar, then the date formula that you enter in, for example, the **Shipping Time** field is interpreted according to the calendar working days. For example, **1W**  means seven working days.

-->

## Entering times

When you enter times, you can insert any nonspace separators that you want between the units. If you use double digits for each unit up to milliseconds, then it isn't required.

You only have to write the largest units that you require; the rest are set to zero. You can also leave out any AM/PM indicator.

The following table lists the various ways in which times can be entered and how they're interpreted. It assumes region settings that format times according to **Hours:Minutes:Seconds.Milliseconds** and use the AM and PM indicators.

|**Entry**      |**Interpretation**      |
|---------------|------------------------|
|05:23:17|05:23:17|
|5|05:00:00|
|5AM|05:00:00|
|5P|17:00:00|
|12|12:00:00|
|12A|00:00:00|
|12P|12:00:00|
|17|17:00:00|
|5:30|05:30:00|
|0530|05:30:00|
|5:30:5|05:30:05|
|053005|05:30:05|
|5:30:5,50|05:30:05.5|
|053005050|05:30:05.05|

> [!NOTE]
> Milliseconds are interpreted as decimal notation. So, for example, 3, 30, and 300 all mean 300 milliseconds, while 03 means 30 and 003 means 3 milliseconds.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You can't use 24:00 to mean midnight, or use any value greater than 24:00.

The word for *time* in the language used by [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_long.md)] is the current time on your computer or mobile device. You can enter a part of the word starting from the beginning, such as **t** or **TIM**.

## Entering combined dates and times

[!INCLUDE [datetimes](includes/datetimes.md)]

## Entering duration

Some fields in the application represent a duration, or amount of elapsed time, instead of a specific date or time. You enter a duration as a number followed by its unit of measure.

Here are some examples.

|**Duration**|**Unit of measure**|
|------------|-------------------|
|2h|2 hrs|
|6h 30 m|6 hrs 30 mins|
|6.5h|6 hrs 30 mins|
|90m|1 hr 30 mins|
|2d 6h 30m|2 days 6 hrs 30 mins|
|2d 6h 30m 56s 600ms|2 days 6 hrs 30 mins 56 secs 600 msecs|

You can also enter a number that automatically converts to a duration. The number converts according to the default unit of measure that is specified for the duration field.

It's easy to find out which unit of measure a duration field uses. Enter a number, and then look at the unit of measure it converts to.

For example, if the unit of measure is hours, the number 5 converts to 5 hrs.

# Financial Information Quick Start

After entering basic company information in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], one of the next steps is completing the financial section. You do this not only to receive or make payments, but also to properly manage and report your business' numbers.

## The chart of accounts

The chart of accounts (COA) offers an overview of the company's finances, listing accounts in structured groups such as assets, liabilities, income, cost of goods sold, and expenses. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes a standard chart of accounts you can customize to your business' accounting practices.

## Set up the chart of accounts

The following video shows how to set up the chart of accounts in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

<br /><br />

> [!Video https://learn-video.azurefd.net/vod/player?id=944c65b0-9b0f-4d35-b330-de2fad57143a]

### Add an account to the chart of accounts

To add an account not included by default in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]—for example, gardening services—just follow these steps:

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Chart of Accounts**, then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action to open the **G/L Account Card** page.
3. Enter the following data in the corresponding fields on the **General** FastTab. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

   | Field | Data |
   | --- | --- |
   | **No.** | 61250 |
   | **Name** | Gardening services |
   | **Income/Balance** | Income Statement |
   | **Account Category** | Expense |
   | **Account Subcategory** | Repairs and Maintenance Expense |
   | **Debit/Credit** | Both |
   | **Account Type** | Posting |

4. On the **Posting** FastTab, enter the following data:

   | Field | Data |
   | --- | --- |
   | **Gen. Posting Type** | Purchase |
   | **Gen. Bus. Posting Group** | Domestic |
   | **Gen. Prod. Posting Group** | Services |

5. Fill in the remaining fields on the **G/L Account Card** page as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

### Get an overview of the chart of accounts

If you need a more compact view of the chart of accounts, without columns for posting groups, posting type, or cost type, for example, the **Chart of Accounts Overview** lists the main information for each account in a smaller table. Additionally, you can collapse or expand groups to hide the accounts inside them.

To display the overview, choose the **Chart of Accounts Overview** action on the **Chart of Accounts** page, or search for the feature using ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do").

Learn more about the chart of accounts and the general ledger at [Understanding the General Ledger and the Chart of Accounts](finance-general-ledger.md).

## Set up bank accounts

Bank accounts in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] register banking transactions and are associated with entries in the chart of accounts. The following video shows how to set up bank accounts.

<br /><br />

> [!Video https://learn-video.azurefd.net/vod/player?id=047a5a25-1f7d-423d-b96d-c4ea45042779]

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Bank Accounts**, then choose the related link.
2. On the **Bank Accounts** page, choose the **New** action.
3. In the **No.** field, an identifier such as *B010* will be entered automatically if there's a numbered series list set for bank accounts. If not, enter a unique combination.

   The field is different from the **Bank Account No.** field also available in the **General** FastTab.
4. Fill in the fields on the **Bank Account Card** page as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

# Bookmark a page or report on your role center

Using the bookmark icon, you can add an action that opens a page or report from the navigation menu of your role center. Bookmarks allow you to quickly reach your favorite content or business tasks. You add the bookmark from the target page or report, meaning the screen that you want the link on the role center to open.

The bookmark icon is shown in the top-right corner of a page and also in the **Tell Me** window where you can efficiently bookmark multiple pages or reports. If a bookmark already exists for the page, then the icon is dark, and the tooltip says "Bookmarked".

## Bookmark the target page

1. Open any page that you want a link for on your role center.
2. Choose the ![Bookmark.](media/ui_bookmark_icon.png "Bookmark") icon.

An action named after the page is now added to the navigation menu on your role center.

## Bookmark the target report

1. Open any report request page that you want a link for on your role center.
2. Choose the ![Bookmark.](media/ui_bookmark_icon.png "Bookmark") icon.

An action named after the report is now added to the navigation menu on your role center.

## Bookmark a page or report from the Tell Me window

1. Open the **Tell Me** window and enter, for example, **Sales Orders**.
2. Hover over the search result for the **Sales Orders** page or report, and then choose the ![Bookmark.](media/ui_bookmark_icon.png "Bookmark") icon.

An action named after the page or report is now added to the navigation menu on your role center.

## Frequently asked questions  

### Can I reorganize my bookmarks?

Yes. You can personalize your role center and move actions into a more optimal sequence or move them into existing groups or subgroups.  
Learn how to [Personalize Your Workspace](ui-personalization-user.md).

### How do I remove a bookmark?

On the target page or report, choose the bookmark icon again to remove the involved action from your role center. You can also personalize your role center and temporarily hide actions without fully removing them.

### Where do I find my bookmarks?

When adding a bookmark to a page or report, the new action is added to the top navigation menu on your current home screen (role center). If you happen to have many actions, you may need to activate the **More** button to display all of them because the new action is always appended at the end of those actions.
<!-- Should we add a screenshot here? -->

### I don't have a bookmark icon. Is something wrong?

The ability to bookmark a page or report is one of many user personalization features in Business Central. If the bookmark icon isn't displayed, it's likely that your administrator has disabled personalization.

### Why can't I bookmark certain pages or reports?

Not all pages and reports can be bookmarked. When a page or report is run within some special context governed by the business application, the bookmark icon isn't displayed. For example, pages that cannot be found in the **Tell Me** window but are launched from elsewhere will not display a bookmark icon. Similarly, report request pages that are only used to collect filters without running the report will not display a bookmark icon.

  See technical details about [RunRequestPage](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/methods-auto/report/reportinstance-runrequestpage-method) and [FilterPageBuilder](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/methods-auto/filterpagebuilder/filterpagebuilder-data-type).

### When clearing my personalization, will my bookmarks also be cleared?

Yes. Bookmarks reside in the navigation menu. If you clear changes to the navigation menu from any page, or clear all personalization on the role center, all your new actions will be permanently removed.

### Why does the bookmark icon continue to indicate it's still not bookmarked?

When you add a bookmark, the new action is added to the navigation menu on the role center and subsequent visits to the page or report show a dark bookmark icon. If you personalize your role center and reorganize your actions by moving them into groups, the bookmark icon will no longer be dark and you can add another bookmark to that same page or report. This allows you to add multiple actions to the same page or report and categorize them into different groups.

### Why does my link to a report display a different report?

Some reports may be substituted by other reports after applying an extension to Business Central. When substitution occurs, the text of the new action isn't updated and will continue to display the name of the original report, but navigate to the newer report. To correct the text of the new action, you can remove the new action and add it again.
<!-- For more information on report substitution, see this link UNAVAILABLE AT THIS TIME -->

### Is bookmarking available for XMLports?

No. At this time, adding actions to open XMLports isn't possible from the user interface.

### Will my bookmarks be translated when I change my language in Business Central?

When you add a new action, any translated text that was available at the time is used when bookmarking. If new translated text is added later, then the new action will not include the newer translations.

### Why can't I add text in a page right after opening it with the bookmark?

When a page is bookmarked, the page will always open in the view mode from the bookmark&mdash;even if it was in the edit mode when it was bookmarked. Selecting the **Make changes on the page** icon ![Shows the pencil icon for editing the page.](media/edit-pencil.png) will let you add text in the fields that are editable.

# Send Electronic Documents

> [!NOTE]
> The content in this article is only applicable for versions of Dynamics 365 Business Central that were released before 2023 release wave 2. In 2023 release wave 2, new functionality for E-Documents is included. To learn more, see [Set up e-documents](finance-how-setup-edocuments.md).  

The generic version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports sending electronic invoices and credit memos in the PEPPOL format, a format that the largest document exchange service providers support. A document exchange service provider dispatches electronic documents between trading partners. To provide support for other electronic document formats, you use the data exchange framework.  

 In the generic version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], a document exchange service is preconfigured and ready to be set up for your company. For more information, see [Set Up a Document Exchange Service](across-how-to-set-up-a-document-exchange-service.md). However, in some cases, you must install an app. For more information, see [Electronic Invoicing FAQ](faq-electronic-invoicing.yml).  

 To send a sales invoice as an electronic PEPPOL document, you select the **Electronic Document** option in the **Post and Send** dialog box. You can also set up the customer's default document sending profile from that dialog box. First, you must set up various master data, such as company information, customers, items, and units of measure. These are used to identify the business partners and items when converting data in fields in [Set Up Electronic Document Sending and Receiving](across-how-to-set-up-electronic-document-sending-and-receiving.md).  

### To send an electronic sales invoice

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Invoices**, and then choose the related link.  

2. Create a new sales invoice.  

3. When the sales invoice is ready to be invoiced, choose the **Post and Send** action.  

     If the customer's default sending profile is **Electronic Document**, then it will be shown in the **Post and Send Confirmation** dialog box. This way, you just have to choose the **Yes** button to post and send the invoice electronically in the selected format.  

4. In the **Post and Send Confirmation** dialog box, choose the AssistEdit button to the right of the **Send Document to** field.  

5. In the **Send Document to** dialog box, in the **Electronic Document** field, choose **Through Document Exchange Service**.  

6. In the **Format** field, choose **PEPPOL**.  

7. Choose the **OK** button. The **Post and Send Confirmation** dialog box appears. **Electronic Document (PEPPOL)** is added to the **Send Document to** field.  

8. Choose the **Yes** button.  

     The sales invoice is posted and sent to the customer in the PEPPOL format.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  You can also send a posted sales invoice as an electronic document. The procedure is the same as described in this topic for non-posted sales documents. On the **Posted Sales Invoice** page, choose the **Activity Log** action to view the status of the electronic document.

# Run Full Planning, MPS, or MRP

The terms "running the planning worksheet" or "running MRP" refer to calculating the master production schedule and material requirements. The calculation is based on actual and forecasted demand. The planning system can calculate either Master Production Schedule (MPS) or Material Requirements Planning (MRP) on request, or both at the same time.  

- MPS is the calculation of a master production schedule based on actual demand and the demand forecast. The MPS calculation is used for end items that have a forecast or a sales order line. These items are called MPS items and are identified dynamically when the calculation starts.  
- MRP is the calculation of material requirements based on actual demand for components and the demand forecast on the component level. MRP is calculated only for items that are not MPS items. The purpose of MRP is to provide time-phased formal plans, by item, to supply the appropriate item, at the appropriate time, in the appropriate location, and in the appropriate quantity.  

The planning algorithms for MPS and MRP are the same. The algorithms pertain to netting, reusing existing replenishment orders, and action messages. The planning system process examines what is, or will be, needed (demand) and what's on-hand or expected (supply). When you net these quantities against each other, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides action messages. Action messages are suggestions to create a new order, change an order (quantity or date), or cancel an order. The term "order" includes purchase orders, assembly orders, production orders, and transfer orders.

You can track the links that the planning creates between demand and supply on the **Order Tracking** page. For more information, see [Track Relations Between Demand and Supply](production-how-track-demand-supply.md).

Proper planning results depend on the set up done on item cards, assembly BOMs, production BOMs, and routings.  

## Methods for generating a plan  

- **Calculate Regenerative Plan:** Process or regenerate the material plan. This process starts by deleting all planned supply orders that are currently loaded. All items in the database are replanned.  
- **Calculate Net Change Plan**: Process a net change plan. Items are considered in net change planning from two types of changes:  
   - **Demand/supply changes:** These changes include modifications to quantities on sales orders, demand forecasts, assembly orders, production orders, or purchase orders. An unplanned inventory level change is also considered a quantity change.  
   - **Planning parameter changes:** These changes include changes in safety stock, reorder point, routing, bill of material, and changes to the time bucket or lead time calculation.  
- **Get Action Messages:** Serves as a short-term planning tool by issuing action messages to alert the user of modifications made since the last time you calculated a regenerative or net change plan.  

With each planned method, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] generates worksheet entries assuming infinite capacity. Work center and machine center capacity isn't considered when you develop schedules.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The Calculate Regenerative Plan is the most common process. The Calculate Plan and Carry out Action Messages, however, can be used to run the Calculate Net Change Plan process.  
>
> You can run the Get Action Messages Plan between regenerative and net change planning runs to obtain an immediate view of the effect of schedule changes. However, it isn't meant to replace the full regenerative or net change planning processes.  

## To calculate the planning worksheet
  
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Planning Worksheets**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **Calculate Regenerative Plan** action to open the **Calculate Plan** page.  
3. On the **Options** FastTab, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**MPS**|Calculate a master production schedule. Items with open sales orders or demand forecasts are considered in this run. <br/>If other demands, for example safety stock, reorder point, or open production component lines, also exist for such items these demands are included in the MPS calculation to ensure that the planning system deals with the complete inventory profile.  |  
    |**MRP**|Calculate material requirements planning. Items with dependent requirements are considered in this run. Typically, MPS and MRP are run at the same time. To run MPS and MRP at the same time, on the **Manufacturing Setup** page, on the **Planning** FastTab, select the **Combined MPS/MRP Calculation** field.|  
    |**Starting Date**|Evaluate inventory availability. If an item's on-hand quantity is below the reorder point, the system forward-schedules a replenishment order from this date. If an item is below its safety stock (as of the starting date), the system back-schedules a replenishment order due on the planning starting date.|  
    |**Ending Date**|The ending date of the planning horizon. Neither demand nor supply are considered after this date. If the reorder cycle for an item extends beyond the ending date, the effective planning horizon for that item is equal to the order date plus the reorder cycle.<br/><br/> The planning horizon is the time that the plan is extended to. If the horizon is too short, items with a longer lead time aren't ordered on time. If the horizon is too long, too much time is spent reviewing and processing information that likely changes before it's needed. You can set one planning horizon for production and a longer one for purchases, although it isn't required. A planning horizon for purchases and production should be set to cover the total lead time for components.|  
    |**Stop and Show First Error**|Select this option if you want the planning run to stop as soon as it encounters an error. A message displays with information about the error. If an error exists, only the successful planning lines made before the error was encountered are presented in the planning worksheet. If you don't select this field, the **Calculate Plan** batch job continues until it completes. Errors won't interrupt the batch job. If one or more errors exist, a message displays after completion with information about how many items are affected. The **Planning Error Log** page will then open to provide more details about the error and links to the affected item cards.|  
    |**Use Forecast**|Select a forecast to include as demand when you run the planning batch job. The default forecast is set up on the **Planning** FastTab on the **Manufacturing Setup** page.|  
    |**Exclude Forecast Before**|Define how much of the selected forecast to include in the planning run by entering a date before which forecast demand is not included.|  
    |**Respect Planning Parameters for Exception Warnings**|By default, this field is selected.<br/><br/> Supply on planning lines with warnings is normally not modified according to planning parameters. Instead, the planning system only suggests a supply to cover the exact demand quantity. However, you can define certain planning parameters for planning lines to be respected with certain warnings.<br/><br/>|  

4. On the **Item** FastTab, set filters to run the planning based on the item, item description, or location.  
5. Choose the **OK** button. The batch job runs and planning lines are added to the planning worksheet.  

## To perform action messages
  
1. On the **Planning Worksheet** page, choose the **Carry Out Action Message** action.  
2. On the **Options** FastTab, specify how to create the supplies. Fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Production Order**|Specify how to create production orders. You can do this directly from the planning line proposals. You can create either planned or firm planned production orders.|  
    |**Assembly Order**|Specify how to create assembly orders. You can do this directly from the planning line proposals.|  
    |**Purchase Order**|Specify how to create purchase orders. You can do this directly from the planning line proposals.<br/><br/> If you chose to copy the planning line proposals for purchase orders to the requisition worksheet, select the template and worksheet name.|  
    |**Transfer Order**|Specify how to create transfer orders. You can do this directly from the planning line proposals.<br/><br/> If you chose to copy the planning line proposals for transfer orders to the requisition worksheet, select the template and worksheet name.|  
    |**Combine Transfer Orders**|Select whether to combine transfer orders.|  
    |**Stop and Show First Error**|Select this option if you want the **Carry Out Action Msg. - Plan.** batch job to stop as soon as it finds an error. Aa message displays information about the error. If an error exists, only the planning lines processed before the error was found will create supply orders.|  

3. On the **Planning Line** FastTab, you can set filters to limit the perform action messages.  
4. Choose the **OK** button.  

The batch job deletes the lines in the planning worksheet after it has performed the action message. The other lines remain in the planning worksheet until they are either accepted at a later date or else deleted. You can also delete the lines manually.  

## Action messages
  
Action messages are issued by the order tracking system when balance is unattainable in the existing order network. The messages can be viewed as a suggestion for you to process changes that reestablish balance between supply and demand.  

The generation of action messages occurs one level at a time, for each item's low-level code. This makes sure that all items that experience or will experience changes in supply or demand are considered.  

To avoid small, unneeded, or unimportant action messages, you can set dampeners, which serve to restrict the generation of action messages to only those changes that exceed the defined quantity or number of days.  

After you review the action messages and determine whether to accept some or all of the suggested changes, select the **Accept Action Message** field. Next, update the schedules accordingly.  

> [!NOTE]  
> An action message is a suggestion to create a new order, cancel an order, or change the quantity or date of an order. An order is a purchase order, transfer order, or production order.  

In response to any supply/demand imbalances, the following action messages are generated.  

|Action Message|Description|  
|--------------------|---------------------------------------|  
|**New**|If a demand can't be fulfilled by suggesting action messages to **Change Qty.**, **Reschedule**, or **Reschedule & Change Qty.** on existing orders, the action message **New** is generated to suggest a new order. The message **New** is also generated if there aren't supply orders in the reorder cycle of the item. This option determines the number of periods forward and backward in the availability profile when it searches for an order to reschedule.|  
|**Change Quantity**|When the quantity changes for a demand that's tracked to a supply order, the action message **Change Qty.** is generated. The message indicates that the related supply should be changed relative to the change in demand. If a new demand emerges, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] searches for the nearest existing unreserved supply order in the reorder cycle, and issues a change of action message for that order.|  
|**Reschedule**|When a date change for a supply or demand order causes an imbalance in the order network, the action message **Reschedule** is generated. If there is a one-to-one relationship between demand and supply, an action message is generated to suggest that you move the supply order. If the supply-order covers demand from more than one sales order, the supply order is re-scheduled equal to the date of the first demand.|  
|**Resch. & Chg. Qty.**|If both the dates and quantities of an order change, you must change plans with regard to both. Action messaging gathers both actions in one message, **Resched. and Chg. Qty.**, to ensure that the order network returns to balance.|  
|**Cancel**|If a demand that has been covered on an order-to-order basis is deleted, an action message is generated to cancel the related supply order. If the relationship isn't order-to-order, an action message is generated to change in order to reduce the supply. If through other factors, such as inventory adjustments, a supply order isn't required at the time you generate the action messages, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] suggests an action message of **Cancel** in the worksheet.|

# Use Profile Questionnaires to Classify Business Contacts

You can rate a prospect so you can identify the ideal prospects to focus your sales campaign on. You can set up profile questionnaires that you want to use when entering information about your contacts' profiles. Within each questionnaire, you can set up the different questions you intend to ask your contacts. This way, you can group contacts so that your campaigns are more likely to target the right people based on the criteria that you define with the questionnaires.  

With the right questionnaires, you can rate your prospects and group them into categories. You can use existing questions and answers and combine them with new questions and answers to form the basis of your rating. Each answer in the rating is given a point value and, depending on the range you set up for the categories (*From Value* and *To Value*), the rating system will group your contacts in the categories you have defined. For example, *ABC* customers, *High/Low loyalty* vendors, or *Platinum/Gold/Silver* prospects.  

You can also run the questionnaire to answer some of the questions based on contact, customer, or vendor data automatically.  

## To add a profile questionnaire

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Questionnaire Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** Action.  
3. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  

## To add questions to a profile questionnaire

1. Choose the relevant profile questionnaire, and then choose the **Edit Questionnaire Setup** action.  
2. On the first empty line, in the **Type** field, choose **Question** and type your question in the **Description** field. Fill in the other fields on this line.  

    Optionally, add details to the question.

    1. Choose the line with the question, and then, choose the **Line** menu, and then choose **Question Details**.  

    2. On the **Classification** FastTab in the **Profile Question Details** page, select the **Auto Contact Classification** field.  

    3. In the **Contact Class. Field** field, select the **Rating** option.  

    4. Fill in the **Min. % Questions Answered** field. The default is **0**.  

        This specifies the number of questions in percentage that must be answered for this rating to be calculated.

    5. On the **Actions** tab, in the **Page** group, choose **Answer Points**. Enter the points you want to give each answer listed in the **Answer Points** page.

        If you want to get an overview of the points you have given each answer, choose the **Answer Points** action.

    6. To run an update, return to the **Profile Questionnaire Setup** page. On the **Actions** menu, in the **Functions** group, choose **Update Classification**.

    In the **Profile Questionnaire Setup** page, the number of contacts that meets this criteria is displayed in the **No. of Contacts** field, as well as on the **Contact Card** of each contact.

3. On the next empty line, in the **Type** field, choose **Answer** and type your answer in the **Description** field.  
4. In the **Priority** field, select the priority. In the **From Value** and **To Value** fields, define a point range. Contacts that receive points within the defined range will get the answer.  

Repeat these steps to enter all the questions and answers within the profile questionnaire.

After you have created a questionnaire, you can use it to rate and classify your contacts. You can also set up questions that are rated automatically based on information in the contact card.  

> [!NOTE]
> If you enter a question that is automatically answered, choose **Line**, and then choose **Question Details**, to enter the criteria to automatically answer the question.

## Apply questionnaires to contacts

You can apply your questionnaires to contacts manually. Just open the relevant contact card, and then choose the **Profile** action. Then, once you have applied the questionnaires that you want to apply, you can start using the categories in your campaigns.  

## The Automatic Classification of Contacts

You can automatically classify your contacts according to customer, vendor, and contact information, by setting up automatically answered profile questions on the **Profile Questionnaire Setup** page.  

> [!NOTE]
> Only contacts that are recorded as customers can be assigned a classification based on customer data and only contacts that are recorded as vendors can be assigned a classification based on vendor data. The automatic classification is not updated automatically. Consequently, you may want to update the profile questionnaires, after you have updated the customer, vendor or contact data they are based on.  

After you have set up automatically answered profile questions, if you assign the profile questionnaire containing these questions to a contact, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will automatically assign the right answers for the contact.  

## Example

You can classify your contacts according to how much they bought from you:

|Answer|Applies to|
|--- |--- |
|A|contacts who bought for 500,000 LCY or more|
|B|contacts who bought for 100,000 up to 499,999 LCY|
|C|contacts who bought for 99,999 LCY or less|

To do this, fill on the **Profile Questionnaire Setup** page as follows:

| Type     | Description        | Automatic Classification     | From Value | To Value |
|----------|--------------------|------------------------------|------------|----------|
| Question | ABC Classification | Click to insert a check mark |            |          |
| Answer   | A                  |                              | 500,000    |          |
| Answer   | B                  |                              | 100,000    | 499,999  |
| Answer   | C                  |                              |            | 99,999   |

Then fill on the **Profile Question Details** page as follows:

| Field                         | Value         |
|-------------------------------|---------------|
| Customer Classification Field | Sales (LCY)   |
| Classification Method         | Defined Value |

When you assign the profile questionnaire containing this question to a contact, application automatically enters the relevant answer for this contact on the profile lines of the contact card.

# Add Comments to Cards and Documents

You can add extra information to G/L accounts, customers cards, or sales orders to communicate exceptions or special agreements to other users.
Practically all cards and document have a **Comments** action, which opens the **Comment Sheet** page where you can write or read comments. On documents, you can also add comments to individual lines.

Comments on ongoing documents are transferred to the related posted document. For example, a comment on a sales order is transferred to a resulting posted sales shipment.

In addition, you can specify if you want comments to be transferred from one type of document to another resulting type of document, such as from a sales order to a sales invoice. You do this in the **Sales & Receivables** and the **Purchases & Payables** pages respectively.

> [!NOTE]
> Comments are not printed or output to reports or externally-facing documents.

The following describes how to add a comment to an item card. The steps are similar for all other cards and documents, except on document lines, the **Comments** action is placed on a lines action menu.

## To add a comments to an item card

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the relevant item card.
3. Choose the **Comments** action.
4. On the **Comment Sheet** page, enter any text, and then choose the **OK** button.

# About production orders

Use production orders to manage the conversion of purchased materials into manufactured items. Production orders route work through various work or machine centers on the shop floor.  

Before they start production, most companies do supply planning, typically once a week, to calculate how many production orders and purchase orders they need fulfill sales demand. Purchase orders supply the required components according to the end item's bill of materials (BOM).

Production orders are central components in manufacturing, and contain the following information:  

- Products planned for manufacturing  
- Materials required for the planned production orders  
- Materials that are already selected  
- Products that were manufactured in the past  
- Materials that were used in previous manufacturing operations  

Production orders are the starting points for:  

- Planning future manufacturing  
- Controlling current manufacturing  
- Tracking of finished manufacturing  

## Production order creation  

You can create production orders on an order-by-order basis manually on the **Production Order** page, or generate them from the **Sales Order Planning** or **Order Planning** pages. You can also create multiple orders from the **Planning Worksheet** page.  

You create production orders using information from:  

- Items  
- Production BOMs
- Routings  
- Machine centers  
- Work centers  

## Reserving and tracking production orders to their source

Production orders are automatically reserved and tracked to their source when you create them from:  

- The [Planning Worksheet](production-how-to-run-mps-and-mrp.md) page.
- The [Sales Order Planning](production-how-to-create-production-orders-from-sales-orders.md) page.
- The [Order Planning](production-how-to-plan-for-new-demand.md) page.  
- The [Replan](production-how-to-replan-refresh-production-orders.md) action on production orders.  

To learn more, go to [Track Relations Between Demand and Supply](production-how-track-demand-supply.md).

If you create production orders by other means, they aren't automatically reserved and tracked.

## Production order status  

A production order can have one of the following statuses:

- Simulated
- Planned
- Firm Planned
- Released
- Finished

The status of a production order controls what you can do with it, and the form and content of the production. Production orders display on different pages according to their status. You can't change the status of a production order manually. To change the status of an order, use the **Change Status** action on the production order or use the **Change Production Order Status** page to change the status of one or orders in one go.

The **Change Status** action is available for the following types of orders:

- Simulated production orders
- Planned production orders
- Firm planned production orders
- Released production orders

> [!TIP]
> A confirmation dialog with additional questions displays for each order individually. If there are multiple orders with partial output or consumption, confirm each one separately.

If the status of orders can't change, they're skipped. The **Error Message** page shows the orders that were skipped and the reasons.  

### Simulated production order  

A simulated production order is unique because of the following characteristics:  

- It's a simulation you can use for quotes and costing. For example, when the Research and Development department wants a cost estimate for a proposed item. A simulated production order serves as an example of a production order.  
- They don't influence the planning of orders. MPS and MRP don't consider and aren't affected by simulated production orders. Also, you can't use a simulated production order as a template because it disappears when you change its status.  

### Planned production order  

A planned production order is unique because of the following characteristics:  

- You can automatically create a planned production order from a sales order.  
- Planned production orders are like released production orders and provide input to planning by showing the total capacity requirements by work center or machine center.  
- A planned production order represents the best estimate of the future load for the work center or machine center load based on available information. Typically, they're generated from planning, but you can also manually create them. However, they're erased the next time you run planning so it isn't practical to create them manually.  
- Their generation in planning results in a suggested "planned order release" that includes the quantity, release date, and due date. The planning system logic is based on the replenishment system, reorder policies, and order modifiers that it encounters in the net requirement planning process.  
- The load for each work center or machine center on the planned production order's routing shows their effect.  

### Firm planned production order  

A firm planned production order is unique because of the following characteristics:  

- You can automatically create a firm planned production order from a sales order.  
- A firm planned production order acts as a placeholder in the planning schedule for a future project released to the floor.  
- You can generate them during planning, create them manually, or create them from sales orders. They aren't erased during subsequent planning.  
- Their generation in planning results in a suggested "planned order release" that includes the quantity, release date, and due date. The planning system logic is based on the replenishment system, reorder policies, and order modifiers that it encounters in the net requirement planning process.  
- The load for each work center or machine center on the firm planned production order's routing show their effect.  

### Released production order  

The released production order is unique, based on the following characteristics:  

- You can automatically create a released production order from a sales order.  
- A released production order doesn't necessarily mean that materials are picked or the project moves to its first operation.  
- People typically create a released production order immediately after they enter the sales order in make-to-order (MTO) environments.  
- You can use a released production order to record the actual material consumption and product output. In addition, automatic flushing of consumption and product output only occur for released production orders.  

### Finished production order  

A finished production order is unique, based on the following characteristics:  

- A finished production order is typically one that is manufactured.  
- Finishing the production order is an important task in completing the costing lifecycle of the produced item. After you finish a production order, you can adjust and reconcile costing.  
- Finished production orders are used for reporting and to support the ability to track back to other orders (for example, sales, production, and purchases). The ability to track back to a finished production order allows you to review the detailed history.  
- You can't change finished production orders.  

#### Reopen a finished production order to make corrections

After you complete a production order and set its status to **Finished**, you might discover a mistake. For example, you might find that consumption is missing or the item tracking information is incorrect. To make sure that your inventory and cost transactions are correct, use the **Reopen** action on the **Finished Production Orders** page to make adjustments. However, to protect your data there are a few restrictions:

- You can only reopen an order one time.
- You can't reopen an order that has no output and cost was written off to an adjustment account.

## Production order execution  

After you create and schedule a production order, you must release it to the shop floor so that work can start. While you work on an order, you record:  

- The materials that were picked or consumed.  
- The time spent working on the order.
- The quantity of the item produced.

You can record this information manually or through automatic reporting. The method depends on the selection in the **Flushing Method** field on the item and work center.  

### Material consumption  

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers options for how to record material consumption. For example, you can record material consumption manually, which can be useful if you often substitute components or generate more scrap than you expected.  

Consumption of materials can be processed through the [consumption journal](production-how-to-post-consumption.md), or [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can record it automatically, which is known as automatic reporting (flushing). The **Manual**, **Forward**, and **Backward** reporting methods are available.

Manual consumption reporting uses consumption journals to specify material picking.  

Forward consumption reporting assumes the expected quantity of all materials for the entire order is consumed at the release of a production order, unless you use routing link codes. When you use routing link codes, the material consumed after the start of the operational step is recorded in the output journal. To forward flush the entire production order, you need to do two things:  

- All items in the top-level production BOM need to have forward flushing selected on their respective item card.  
- All routing link codes on the production BOM must be removed.  

Backward consumption reporting records the actual quantity of all material picked or consumed when the status of a production order is changed to *Finished,* unless using routing link codes. When you use routing link codes, the material is consumed after a quantity of the parent item is recorded for the operational step in the output journal.  

When you refresh the production order, the flushing method is copied from the item card. The flushing method for each production order component controls how and when you record consumption. Therefore, it's important to note that you can change flushing method for specific items directly on the production order. To learn more, go to [Flush Components According to Operation Output](production-how-to-flush-components-according-to-operation-output.md).

### Production output  

You can track the time spent working on a production order and the quantity produced. This information can help you determine the costs of production. Also, manufacturers who use a standard costing system might want to record actual information in order to help them develop better standards.  

Output can be processed through [output journals](production-how-to-post-output-quantity.md), but can also be recorded automatically. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] copies the flushing method from the machine center or work center card to the production order routing when refreshing. As with material consumption, there are **Manual**, **Forward**, and **Backward** reporting methods for output.

The Manual method uses the output journal to specify time consumed and quantity produced.  

The Forward method records the expected output (and time), which is automatically recorded at the release of a production order. Routing link codes aren't a factor in the forward flushing of the output.  

Backward method records the expected output (and time), which is automatically recorded at the finish of a production order. Routing link codes aren't a factor in the back flushing of the output.  

### Posting consumption and output  

You can use any combination of automatic flushing and manually recorded information for both consumption and output. For example, you might want to automatically forward flush components, but still use a consumption journal to record scrap. Similarly, you might want to automatically record output, but use an output journal to record scrap of the parent item or extra time spent on the order.  

Finally, if you enter consumption and output manually, you need to determine the sequence in which you're going to record this information. You can record consumption first and use a shortcut method to enter the information, which is based on expected quantity of output. Or, you can enter output first, using the **Explode Routing** action. You would then record consumption based on actual quantity of output.  

### Production journals  

The [Production Journal](production-how-to-register-consumption-and-output.md) combines the functions of a consumption journal and output journals into one journal, which is accessed directly from the released production order.  

The purpose of a production journal is to provide a single interface for you to register consumption and output from a production order.  

Production journals have a simple view and provide you with the ability to:  

- Easily record output and consumption related to a production order  
- Relate the components to operations  
- Relate actual operation data with the standard estimates on a production order routing and component lines  
- Post and print an overview of registered operation data for a production order  

Production journals do many of the same things as consumption and output journals. Dimensions, item tracking, and bin contents are handled in the same way.  

However, production journals differ from the consumption and output journals in the following ways:  

- You open them directly from a released production order line and they're preset with the relevant data.
- They let you define which types of components to handle based on a flushing method filter on the journal.  
- Quantities and times already posted for the order display at the bottom of the journal as actual entries.  
- Fields where data entry is irrelevant are blank and noneditable.  
- You can specify how output quantities are preset in the journal. For example, that the last operation must have zero as the output quantity.  
- A confirmation message displays if you exit a journal without posting your changes.  
- They display operations and components together in a structure that provides an overview of the production process.  

In the production journal, consumption quantities are posted as negative item ledger entries, output quantities are posted as positive ledger entries, and times spent are posted as capacity ledger entries.

# Troubleshoot your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automated workflows

When you connect [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with Power Automate to create automated workflows, you might run into error messages. This article provides suggested solutions to recurring problems.

## Flow doesn't run on all records created or changed

### Problem

If an event creates or changes many records, the flow doesn't run on some or all records.

### Possible cause

Currently, there's a limit on how many records a flow can process. If more than 1000 records are created or changed within 30 seconds, the flow isn't triggered.

> [!NOTE]
> For developers, the flow triggering is done via webhook notifications, and this limitation is due to the way the Business Central connector handles `collection` notifications. Learn more at [Working with Webhooks in Dynamics 365 Business Central](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/api-reference/v2.0/dynamics-subscriptions#notes-for-power-automate-flows) in the Developer and Admin help.

## "The response from the Business Central service is too large" error

### Problem

When using an action that interacts with records (such as *Create record (V3)* and *Get record (V3)*), Power Automate might display an error similar to this one:

`The response from the Business Central service is too large`

### Possible cause

Even though Business Central has no set limit on the size of records returned by APIs, the Dynamics 365 Business Central connector for Power Automate can handle only records up to 8 MB.

All the Business Central APIs provided by Microsoft return records under this limit, but APIs provided by partners might not. If you see an error "The response from the Business Central service is too large," reach out to the partner who created the API you're using.

## "Entity set not found" error

### Problem

When you create a new Power Automate flow using a [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] approval trigger, such as *When a purchase document approval is requested*, you might get an error message similar to this one:

`Entity set not found: \<name\>`

The placeholder, `\<name\>`, is the service name of the missing web service, such as *workflowWebhookSubscriptions* or *workflowPurchaseDocumentLines*.

### Possible cause

Using Power Automate for approvals requires certain page and codeunit objects to be published as web services. By default, most of the required objects are published as web services. But in some cases, your environment might have been customized so these objects are no longer published.

### Fix

Go to the **Web Services** page and make sure the following objects are published as web services. There should be an entry in the list for each object, with the **Published** check box selected.  

| Object Type | Object ID | Object Name | Service Name |
|--|--|--|--|
| Codeunit | 1544 | WorkflowWebhookSubscription | WorkflowActionResponse |
| Page | 6408 | workflowCustomers | workflowCustomers |
| Page | 6406 | workflowGenJournalBatches | workflowGenJournalBatches |
| Page | 6407 | workflowGenJournalLines | workflowGenJournalLines |
| Page | 6409 | workflowItems | workflowItems |
| Page | 6405 | Purchase Document Line Entity | workflowPurchaseDocumentLines |
| Page | 6404 | workflowPurchaseDocuments | workflowPurchaseDocuments |
| Page | 6403 | Sales Document Line Entity | workflowSalesDocumentLines |
| Page | 6402 | workflowSalesDocuments | workflowSalesDocuments |
| Page | 6410 | workflowVendors | workflowVendors |
| Page | 831 | workflowWebhookSubscriptions | workflowWebhookSubscriptions |

> [!NOTE]
> The **Service Name** value must be exactly as shown in the table. Don't change or translate the service name.

# Create incoming document records

On the **Incoming Documents** page, you can use different functions to review expense receipts, manage OCR tasks, and convert incoming document files, manually or automatically, to the relevant documents or journal lines. The external files can be attached at any process stage, including to posted documents and to the resulting vendor, customer, and general ledger entries.

To record an external document in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], first create or complete an incoming document record. You can do those tasks manually, or you can take a photo of the external document to create the incoming document record with the image file attached.

Before you can use the **Incoming Documents** feature, you must perform the required setup. For more information, see [Set Up Incoming Documents](across-how-setup-income-documents.md).

## Approve or reject an incoming document

If you have set up the **Incoming Documents** feature to require approval to create documents, users with the appropriate rights must approve the records before they're processed. For more information, see [Set up approvers of incoming document records](across-how-setup-income-documents.md#to-set-up-approvers-of-incoming-document-records).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Incoming Documents**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the line with the document that you want to approve or reject, and then choose the **Approve** or **Reject** actions.

If you approve the incoming document record, the **Released** check box on the incoming document line is selected. The user in charge of creating, for example, purchase invoices can proceed to process the record.

## Create an incoming document record by taking a photo

# Set up and report Intrastat

All companies in the European Union must report their trade with other EU countries/regions. You must report the movement of goods to the statistics authorities in your country/region every month, and the report must be delivered to the tax authorities. This is referred to as Intrastat Reporting. You use the **Intrastat Journal** page to complete periodic Intrastat reports.

[!INCLUDE[intrastat-2022w2](includes/intrastat-2022w2.md)]

## Required and optional Setups

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Customer cards and Vendor cards include a field, **Intrastat Partner Type**, that has the same option values as the **Partner Type** field: *"" (blank)*, *Company*, and *Person*. The **Intrastat Partner Type** field has replaced the **Partner Type** field in Intrastat reporting. **Partner Type** is used in SEPA to define the SEPA Direct Debit Scheme (Core or B2B). **Intrastat Partner Type** is used for Intrastat reporting only. This way, you can specify different values for the two fields, if you need to.
>
> However, note that if the **Intrastat Partner Type** field is left blank, the value from the **Partner Type** field is used for Intrastat reporting.

Before you can use the Intrastat journal to report Intrastat information, there are several things you must set up:  

* **Intrastat Setup**: Intrastat Setup page is used to enable intrastat reporting and set defaults for it. You can specify whether you need to report Intrastat from shipments (dispatches), receipts (arrivals) or both depending on thresholds set by your local regulations. You can also set default transaction types for regular and return documents, used for nature of transaction reporting.
* **Intrastat journal templates**: You must set up the Intrastat journal templates and batches you will use. Because Intrastat is reported monthly, you must create 12 Intrastat journal batches based on the same template.  
* **Commodity codes**: Customs and tax authorities have established numerical codes that classify items and services. You specify these codes on items.
* **Transaction nature codes**: Countries and regions have different codes for types of Intrastat transactions, such as ordinary purchase and sale, exchange of returned goods, and exchange of non-returned goods. Set up all of the codes that apply to your country/region. You use these codes on the **Foreign Trade** FastTab on sales and purchase documents, and when you process returns.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Starting in January 2022, Intrastat requires different transaction nature code for dispatches to private individuals or non-VAT registered businesses and VAT registered businesses. To comply with this requirement, we recommend that you review and/or add new transaction nature codes in the **Transaction Types** page according to the requirements in your country. You should also review and update the **Intrastat Partner Type** field to *Person* for private individual or non-VAT registered businesses customers in the relevant **Customer** page. If you are unsure about the correct intrastat partner type or transaction type to use, we recommend that you ask an expert in your country or region.

* **Transport methods**: There are seven, one-digit codes for Intrastat transport methods. **1** for sea, **2** for rail, **3** for road, **4** for air, **5** for post, **7** for fixed installations, and **9** for own propulsion (for example, transporting a car by driving it). [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] does not require these codes, however, we recommend that the descriptions provide a similar meaning.  
* **Transaction specifications**: Use these to supplement the descriptions from the transaction types.  
* **Country of origin**: Use the two-letter ISO Alpha Codes for the country/region where the good was obtained or produced. If the good was produced in more than one country/region, the country/region of origin is the last country where it was significantly processed.
* **VAT identification number of the partner operator in the Member State of import**: This is the VAT-ID number of the partner operator in the Member State of import. The VAT-ID is also used in the exchange of intra-EU-export data among Member States, and allows Member States to allocate the received data to the importing company in their own country/region. Reporting units must report the VAT-ID of the company that declared the intra-Union acquisition of goods in the Member State of import.

> [!NOTE]
> The business partner VAT-ID to use can differ, depending on the business circumstance. For example, the ID to use differs for scenarios such as chain sales, where a supplier sells a product to another country, and then that company resells the item to another business in the same country, triangular trade, and so on. If you are unsure about the correct VAT-ID to use, we recommend that you ask an expert in your country or region.

Optionally, you can also set up:

* **Areas**: Use these to supplement information about countries and regions.  
* **Entry/exit points**: Use these to specify the locations where you ship or receive items to or from other countries/regions. Heathrow Airport is an example of an entry or exit point. You enter entry or exit points on sales and purchase documents on the **Foreign Trade** FastTab. This information will also be copied from the item entries when you create the Intrastat journal.  

### To set up Intrastat templates and batches

The Intrastat batch jobs include only item entries, and not general ledger entries. If you have general ledger entries that qualify for Intrastat reporting, you must enter them manually. For example, if you purchase a computer from another EU country or region, the computer is not placed in inventory, but is posted to a general ledger account. You must manually enter this type of entry in the Intrastat journal.  

You can export the entries to a file that you can send to your Intrastat authorities. You can also print a report, manually enter the information on the forms from your authorities, and then submit the information.

> [!NOTE]
> We recommended that you set up an Intrastat journal batch for each month.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Intrastat Journal Templates**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)] Create a template for each Intrastat form you use.  
3. To create batches, choose the **Batches** action.  
4. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]. Create a template for each Intrastat form you use.

> [!NOTE]
> In the **Statistics Period** field, enter the statistics period as a four-digit number, where the first two digits represent the year and the next two digits represent the month. For example, enter 1706 for June, 2017.

### To set up transport methods

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Transport Methods**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

### To set up which Intrastat report fields are mandatory

In some countries/regions, such as Spain and UK, the authorities require that Intrastat reports include, for example, the shipment method for purchases or some other values when sales are over a certain threshold. On the **Intrastat Setup** page, you can select to make **Intrastat Checklist Setup** to set mandatory fields on the **Intrastat Journal** page.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Intrastat Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **Intrastat Checklist Setup** action.
3. On the **Intrastat Checklist Setup** page, select in the **Field Name** to pick Intrastat report field you want to make mandatory.

### Czechia

Specifically for Czech businesses, you must also set up commodity codes and transaction nature codes.  

#### To set up commodity codes

All items that you buy or sell must have a commodity code.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Commodity Codes**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  
3. To assign a commodity code to an item, go to the **Item Card** page, expand the **Costs & Posting** FastTab, and then enter the code in the **Commodity Code** field.

### Italy

Specifically for Italian businesses, you must also set up commodity codes and transaction nature codes.  

#### To set up transaction nature codes

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Transaction Nature Codes**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  

> [!TIP]
> If you frequently use a particular transaction nature code, you can make it the default. To do this, go to the **Intrastat Setup** page, and choose the code.

## To report Intrastat

After you fill in the Intrastat journal, you can run the **Checklist report** action to make sure that all information in the journal is correct. Mandatory fields you have set in **Intrastat Checklist Setup** page that are missing values will be shown in Errors and warning fact box on the **Intrastat Journal** page. Afterward, you can print an Intrastat report as a form, or create a file to submit to the tax authority in your country/region.  

### To fill in Intrastat journals

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Intrastat Journal** and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Intrastat Journal** page, in the **Batch Name** field, choose the relevant journal batch, and then choose **OK**.  
3. Choose the **Suggest Lines** action. The **Starting Date** and **Ending Date** fields will already contain the dates specified for the statistics period on the journal batch.  
4. In the **Cost Regulation %** field, you can enter a percentage to cover transport and insurance. If you enter a percentage, the content of the **Statistical Value** field in the journal is proportionally higher.  
5. Choose **OK** to start the batch job.  

The batch job retrieves all the item entries in the statistics period and inserts them as lines in the Intrastat journal. You can edit the lines if needed.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The batch job retrieves only the entries that contain a country/region code for which an Intrastat code has been entered on the **Countries/Regions** page. Therefore, you must enter Intrastat codes for the country/region codes for which you will run the batch job. The batch job sets the **Partner VAT ID** field to *QV999999999999* for private individuals or non-VAT registered businesses (customers with the **Intrastat Partner Type** field set to *Person*), and it uses the value of the **Transaction Type** field on the posted item ledger entry or job ledger entry.

### To modify Intrastat journals lines

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Intrastat Journal**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Intrastat Journal** page, in the **Batch Name** field, choose the relevant journal batch, and then choose **OK**.  
3. User filter pane to filter Intrastat Journal lines based on some criteria. For example, filter on **Partner VAT ID** fields with the value *QV999999999999*.
4. Choose **Share** icon ![Share a page in another app.](media/share-icon.png) and select **Edit in Excel**
5. In Excel, modify the Intrastat journal lines that you filtered out. For example, modify **Transaction Type** field values.  
6. Publish the changes that you have made in Excel back to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] versions that do not support [**Edit in Excel**](across-work-with-excel.md#edit-in-excel) for journals, you can create configuration packages to export and import Intrastat journal lines to Excel. For more information, see [Migrate On-Premises Data to Business Central Online](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/migrate-data) in the administration content.

### Report Intrastat on a form or a file

To get the information that is required on the Intrastat form from the statistical authorities, you must print the **Intrastat – Form** report. Before you can do this, you must prepare the Intrastat journal and fill it in. If you have both sales and purchase transactions, you must complete a separate form for each type, so that you must print the report two times.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Intrastat Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Intrastat Journal** page, choose the relevant journal batch in the **Batch Name** field.  
3. If you have not already done this, fill in the journal manually or choose **Suggest Lines** action.  
4. Choose the **Prints Intrastat Journal** action.  
5. On the **Intrastat Jnl. Line** FastTab, add a **Type** filter and then specify whether this is a **Receipt** or a **Shipment**.  
6. Choose **Send to** to print the report.  

### Report Intrastat in a file

You can submit the Intrastat report as a file. Before creating the file, you can print a checklist that contains the same information that will be in the file.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Intrastat Journal**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Intrastat Journal** page, select the relevant journal batch in the **Batch Name** field.  
3. If you have not already done this, fill in the journal manually or by choosing the **Suggest Lines** action.  
4. Choose the **Create File** action.  
5. On the batch job page, choose the **OK** button.  
6. Choose **Save**.  
7. Browse to the location where you want to save the file, enter the file name, and then choose **Save**.

> [!NOTE]
> When a line in the Intrastat report has a supplementary unit of measure, the weight of the item will not be shown, since this value is not required.

## Reorganize Intrastat journals

Because you must submit an Intrastat report every month, and you create a new journal batch for each report, you will eventually have many journal batches. The journal lines are not deleted automatically. You may want to reorganize the journal batch names periodically. You do this by deleting the journal batches that you no longer need. The journal lines in these batches are also deleted.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Intrastat Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
2. To view the options, choose the **Batch Name** field.  
3. Choose the journal batches to be deleted, and then choose the **Delete** button.  

## Tariff numbers

In many countries/regions, the customs and tax authorities establish 8-digit item codes for various items. In order for item entries to contain the necessary information when the program imports them to the Intrastat journal line, you must have entered the information about the tariff number in the **Tariff Numbers** page. Find the codes for the items that your company deals with and enter them in the **Tariff Numbers** page.

In the **Tariff Numbers** page, add all the codes that you use. You must enter the codes on the item card before you begin to post. When you have set up the codes, enter them in the **Tariff No.** field on the item card. You must also fill in the **Net Weight** field on the item card.

# Maintain fixed assets

Maintenance costs are operating expenses for the things you do to preserve the condition of your fixed assets. Unlike capital improvements, maintenance doesn't increase the value of your assets.

Each time you send a fixed asset for service, you record information such as the service date, the vendor who did the work, and the service agent's phone number. You enter maintenance information on several pages:

* Fixed Asset Card
* Purchase Order
* Purchase Invoice
* Fixed Asset G/L Journal

Indexation is used to adjust values for general price-level changes. Use the **Index Fixed Assets** action to recalculate maintenance costs.

## Record a maintenance cost directly on a fixed asset

Every time you do maintenance for an asset, such as a service visit, you can record it on the **Maintenance Registrations** page.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Fixed Assets**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the fixed asset that you want to record maintenance for, and then choose the **Maintenance Registration** action.
3. On the **Maintenance Registration** page, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  

## Post maintenance costs from a fixed asset G/L journal

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Depreciation Book List**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the depreciation book that is assigned to the fixed asset, and then choose the **Edit** action.
3. On the **Depreciation Book Card** page, make sure the **Maintenance** checkbox isn't selected so that you don't post maintenance costs to the general ledger.
4. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **FA G/L Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
5. Create an initial journal line and fill in the fields as necessary.

# Design Details: Expected Cost Posting
Expected costs represent the estimation of, for example, a purchased item’s cost that you record before you receive the invoice for the item.  

 You can post expected cost to inventory and to the general ledger. When you post a quantity that is only received or shipped but not invoiced, then a value entry is created with the expected cost. This expected cost affects the inventory value, but is not posted to the general ledger unless you set up the system up to do so.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  Expected costs are only managed for item transactions. Expected costs are not for immaterial transaction types, such as capacity and item charges.  

 If only the quantity part of an inventory increase has been posted, then the inventory value in the general ledger does not change unless you have selected the **Expected Cost Posting to G/L** check box on the **Inventory Setup** page. In that case, the expected cost is posted to interim accounts at the time of receipt. After the receipt has been fully invoiced, the interim accounts are then balanced and the actual cost is posted to the inventory account.  

 To support reconciliation and traceability work, the invoiced value entry shows the expected cost amount that has been posted to balance the interim accounts.  

## Prerequisites for posting expected costs

To make it possible to post expected costs you need to do the following:
1. On the **Inventory Setup** page, select the **Automatic Cost Posting** check box and the **Expected Cost Posting to G/L** check box.
2. Set up which interim accounts to use during the expected cost posting process.  

  On the **Inventory Posting Setup** page, verify the **Inventory Account** and the **Inventory Account (Interim)** fields for the **Location Code and Invt. Posting Group Code** of the item you will be purchasing. To learn more about these accounts see [Design Details - Accounts in the General Ledger](design-details-accounts-in-the-general-ledger.md).
3. On the **General Posting Setup** page, verify the **Invt. Accrual Acc. (Interim)** field for the **Gen. Bus. Posting Group** and the **Gen. Prod. Posting Group** you will be using.
4. When you create a purchase order the default is that the **Vendor Invoice No.** field is required. You need to turn that off on the **Purchase & Payables Setup** page, by unselecting the **Ext. Doc. No. Mandatory** field.

## Example  

> [!NOTE]  
> The account numbers used in this example are there for reference only, and will be different in your system. Set them up as directed in the Prerequisites above.

You post a purchase order as received. The expected cost is LCY 95.00.  

 **Value Entries**

 At a later date, you post the purchase order as invoiced. The invoiced cost is LCY 100.00.

# Purchases by Location (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Purchases by Location** report provides an overview of purchasing activities for each warehouse location. It helps you find out which item categories and items are most frequently purchased in each location, and how much money you're spending on the purchases.

:::image type="content" source="media/purchases/purchases-by-location.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Purchases by Location Power BI report" lightbox="media/purchases/purchases-by-location.png":::

## Use the report

The report is especially useful for purchasing managers and purchasers.

Purchasing managers can use the report to analyze purchasing trends across different warehouse locations. For example, you can use the report to find the most frequently bought items and item categories in each warehouse. You and the warehousing team can gain insights into warehouses with consistently high or low purchasing activities.

Purchasers can use this report to monitor purchasing activities across warehouse locations. For example, you can find item categories and items with low quantities that require attention to prevent stock-outs or disruptions in production. Use this information to plan ahead and work with your team to ensure that you meet purchase demand across locations.


## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The *Purchases by Location* report includes the following KPIs and measures: 

- [**Purchase Amount**](purchases-powerbi-kpis.md#purchase-amount)
- [**Purchase Quantity**](purchases-powerbi-kpis.md#purchase-quantity)
- [**% GT Purchase Amount**](purchases-powerbi-kpis.md#-gt-purchase-amount)
- [**% GT Purchase Quantity**](purchases-powerbi-kpis.md#-gt-purchase-quantity)

[!INCLUDE[click-on-a-kpi-link](includes/click-on-a-kpi-link.md)] 

[!INCLUDE[powerbi-tip-track-kpis](includes/powerbi-tip-track-kpis.md)]

# Process Sales Opportunities

After you create an opportunity, there are several features for managing the opportunity and moving it through to completion.

## View opportunities

Existing sale opportunities are available on the **Opportunity List** page. The following table describes ways to access the page to process sales opportunities.

| To view opportunities for | Then |
| --- | --- |
| All salespeople and contacts |Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Opportunity List**, and then choose the related link. |
| A specific sales person |Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Salespeople**, and then choose the related link. Select the salesperson, choose the **Opportunities** action, and then choose the **List** action. |
| A specific contact |Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Contacts**, and then choose the related link. Select the contact from the list, and then choose the **Opportunities** action. |

Each of these tasks opens the **Opportunity List** page.

## Close opportunities

You can close opportunities when the negotiations are over. When you close an opportunity, you can specify whether it was won or lost, and the reasons for closing it. To specify a reason, you must set up closed opportunity codes.

1. On the **Opportunity List** page, select the opportunity, and the choose the **Close** action. The **Close Opportunity** page opens.
2. Fill in the relevant fields, and then choose the **OK** button.

   The **Close Opportunity Code** and **Date Closed** fields are required fields and must be filled in before you can choose the **OK** button.

   In the **Close Opportunity Code** field, you can choose from one of the existing close opportunity codes or add a new code. To add a new code, from the drop-down list, choose **Select from full list**, and then choose **new**. On the new blank line, fill in the **Code**, **Type**, and **Description** fields, and then choose the **OK** button.

## Create quotes for opportunities

> [!NOTE]
> You can only create sales quotes from opportunities where the contact type is Company.

1. On the **Opportunity List** page, select the opportunity, and then choose the **Assign Sales Quote** action. The **Sales Quote** page opens.
2. Fill in the relevant fields.

## Create sales orders for opportunities

You can make sales orders from the sales quotes that you have created for your opportunities. Before you can create sales orders for your contacts, you must create the contact as a customer. For more information, see [Create Contacts](marketing-create-contact-companies.md).

1. On the **Opportunity List** page, find the opportunity that you have created a sales quote for.
2. Choose the **Assign Sales Quote** action. The **Sales Quote** page opens to show the sales quote that you have assigned to the opportunity.
3. Fill in the additional fields, and then choose the **Make Order** action.

When handling sales opportunities, you may need to create a quote for the contact that the opportunity is linked to.

## Delete opportunities

You can delete opportunities, for example, after you conclude a deal. However, you can only delete closed opportunities. There are two ways to delete closed opportunities. You can delete individual closed opportunities from the **Opportunity List** page or you can run the **Delete Opportunities** batch job to delete multiple opportunities based on specified criteria.

To delete closed opportunities from the **Opportunity List** page, select the opportunity, and then choose the **Delete** action.

To delete closed opportunities by using the **Delete Opportunities** batch job, follow these steps:

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Data Administration**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **Delete Opportunities** action, and then set the filters that specify the closed opportunities to delete.
3. Choose the **OK** button.

After you delete an opportunity, it's removed it from the **Opportunity List** page.

## Move an opportunity through sales cycle stages

If an opportunity follows a sales cycle, you can move it to the next or previous stage, and even skip a stage.

1. On the **Opportunity List** page, choose the **Update** action. The **Update Opportunity** opens,
2. Use the **Action Type** field to move the opportunity through the sales cycle stages:
   * **Next** moves the opportunity forward one stage.
   * **Skip** moves the opportunity forward one or several stages in the sales cycle, which you specify in the **Presentation** field. You can only skip stages that have been set up to allow skipping.
   * **Previous** moves the opportunity back one stage.
   * **Jump** moves the opportunity back one or several stages in the sales cycle, which you specify in the **Presentation** field.
   * **Update** enables you to change information (such as to modify your evaluation of their chances of success and estimated values) without moving to another stage.
3. Fill in the other fields as needed, and then choose the **OK** button.

# Work with catalog items

Catalog items are items that you don't manage in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] until you sell them. When you use the **Select Catalog Item** action to add a catalog item to a line on a sales order, quote, or blanket sales order, the catalog item is converted to a regular item.

> [!NOTE]  
> You can't select a catalog item from the **Sales Invoice** page.

A catalog item typically has the item number of the vendor who supplies it. Before you can convert a catalog item to a normal item, you must specify how to convert vendor item numbers to your item numbering. To learn more about item numbering, go to [Specify how catalog item numbers are converted to your own numbering](#specify-how-catalog-item-numbers-are-converted-to-your-own-numbering).  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Catalog items are not to be mistaken with non-inventory items, which are regular items that are given the type **Non-Inventory** to keep them out of availability and costing calculations, for example, because they are only used internally and have a low cost. To learn move about non-inventory items, go to [About Item Types](inventory-about-item-types.md).

## Create a catalog item

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Catalog Items**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Catalog Items** page, choose the **New** action.
3. On the **Catalog Item Card** page, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

## Specify how catalog item numbers are converted to your own numbering

Before you can convert a catalog item to a regular item, you must specify how to convert vendor item numbers to the structure you use for item numbers.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Catalog Item Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. In the **No. Format** field, choose the option you prefer.

## Convert a catalog item to a normal item

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Catalog Items**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the card for a catalog item that you want to convert to a normal item.
3. On the **Catalog Item Card** page, choose the **Create Item** action.

A new item card prefilled with information from the catalog item and an item template is created. You can edit the information about the new item if needed. To learn more about creating items, go to [Register New Items](inventory-how-register-new-items.md).

> [!NOTE]  
> An item reference is automatically created between the vendor's item number and your new item number. To learn more about item references, go to [Use Item References](inventory-how-use-item-cross-refs.md).

## To sell a catalog item and convert it to a normal item

The following process uses a sales order, but the steps are the same for blanket sales orders and quotes.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Orders**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action. Fill in the fields on the **General** FastTab as for any sales order. For more information, see [Sell Products](sales-how-sell-products.md).
3. On a new sales line, in the **Type** field, select **Item**, but leave the **No.** field empty.
4. Choose the **Line** action, and then choose the **Select Catalog Items** action.
5. On the **Catalog Items** page, select the catalog item that you want to sell, and then choose the **OK** button.
   The catalog item automatically converts to a normal item, and the new normal item is selected on the sales line.
6. When the sales order is complete, choose the **Post** action.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you change you mind and delete the sales line, the automatically created item is also deleted. Deleting the item helps reduce clutter in you list of items.
>
> The item is also deleted if you convert the item manually, or make changes such as adding new units of measure or updating prices or cost. However, the item won't be deleted if it's already used in sales or purchase lines, assembly BOMs, or has ledger entries.

# Change the Annual Amount on Service Contracts or Contract Quotes
You can change the annual amount of the service contract or contract quote to correct the amount that will be invoiced annually.  

## To change the annual amount of the service contract or contract quote  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Contracts** or **Service Contract Quotes**,and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the contract or contract quote.  
3. Choose the **Open Contract** action to open the contract or contract quote for editing.  
4. Choose the **Allow Unbalanced Amounts** check box if you want to change the annual amount and distribute the annual amount difference manually on the contract lines. Otherwise, clear the check box to automatically distribute the annual amount difference on the contract lines after you change the annual amount.  
5. Change the contents of the **Annual Amount** field. You cannot sign, that is, convert into a service contract if you are working on a contract quote, or lock a service contract that has a negative annual amount. If you set the annual amount to zero, the contents of the **Invoice Period** field must be **None** when either signing or locking the service contract.  
6. Depending on whether the **Allow Unbalanced Amounts** check box is selected, run either the manual or automatic distribution of the annual amount difference. The contract lines will be updated so that the **Calcd. Annual Amount** field value is equal to the new annual amount.  

## Distributing Differences Between New and Calculated Annual Amounts
If you change the annual amount of a service contract or contract quote, you may want to distribute the difference between its new and calculated annual amounts on the contract lines. There are three ways to distribute amounts:

* Even distribution  
* Distribution based on line amounts  
* Distribution based on Profit

### Even Distribution
If you change the annual amount of the service contract or contract quote, you may want to distribute the difference between its new and calculated annual amounts on the contract lines. Even distribution is one of the automatic distribution methods that can help you spread equally the new and calculated annual amounts difference between line amounts on the contract lines. The following list of distribution procedure steps describe the main idea of this method:  

1. The difference between the new **Annual Amount** and **Calcd. Annual Amount** field values is divided by the number of the contract lines in the service contract or contract quote.  
2. The **Line Amount** field value is updated by adding the result of the previous operation.  
3. The contents in the **Line Discount Amount**, **Line Discount %**, and **Profit** fields are updated with regard to the new value in the **Line Amount** field in the following way:   
    * Line Discount Amount = Line Value - Line Amount.  
    * Line Discount % = Line Discount Amount / Line Value * 100.  
    * Profit = Line Amount - Line Cost.  

 The steps are repeated for each contract line.  

#### Example  
The **Allow Unbalanced Amounts** check box is not selected in the service contract that contains three contract lines with such information.  

|Item|Line Cost|Line Value|Line Discount %|Line Discount Amount|Line Amount|Profit|  
|----------|---------------|----------------|---------------------|--------------------------|-----------------|------------|  
|Item 1|30.00|40.00|0.00|0.00|40.00|10.00|  
|Item 2|40.00|50.00|10.00|5.00|45.00|5.00|  
|Item 3|50.00|70.00|10.00|7.00|63.00|13.00|  

The **Annual Amount** field value is equal to the contents of the **Calcd. Annual Amount** field, which is always set to the sum of the line amounts. In this case, it is equal to the following:  40 + 45 + 63 = 148.  

If you change the **Annual Amount** to 139, the amount is calculated that should be added to each **Line Amount** field value. This amount is calculated by subtracting the **Calcd. Annual Amount** from the new **Annual Amount** field value and dividing the result by the number of the contract lines in the service contract. In this case, it will be equal to the following: (139 - 148) / 3 = -3. Then, the last calculated figure is added to each **Line Amount** field value and the **Line Discount %**, **Line Discount Amount**, and **Profit** field values are updated using the formulas in the procedure described above.  

Finally, the contract lines will contain this data.  

|Item|Line Cost|Line Value|Line Discount %|Line Discount Amount|Line Amount|Profit|  
|----------|---------------|----------------|---------------------|--------------------------|-----------------|------------|  
|Item 1|30.00|40.00|7.50|3.00|37.00|7.00|  
|Item 2|40.00|50.00|16.00|8.00|42.00|2.00|  
|Item 3|50.00|70.00|14.29|10.00|60.00|10.00|  

### Distribution Based on Line Amount
If you change the annual amount of the service contract or contract quote, you may want to distribute the difference between its new and calculated annual amounts on the contract lines. Distribution Based on Line Amount is an automatic method that can help you spread the new and calculated annual amounts difference between the line amounts on the contract lines. This distribution will be performed proportionally to their line amount shares in the calculated annual amount. The following list of distribution procedure steps for each contract line describe the main idea of this method:  

1. The line amount percentage contribution is calculated as follows: the contents of the **Line Amount** field is divided by the **Calcd. Annual Amount** field values on all contract lines.  
2. The **Line Amount** field value is updated by adding to it the difference between the new and calculated annual amounts, which is multiplied by the line amount percentage contribution.  
3. The contents in the **Line Discount Amount**, **Line Discount %**, and **Profit** fields are updated with regard to the new value in the **Line Discount Amount** field in the following way:  

    * Line Discount Amount = Line Value - Line Amount  
    * Line Discount % = Line Discount Amount / Line Value * 100  
    * Profit = Line Amount - Line Cost  

The steps are repeated for each contract line.  

#### Example  
The **Allow Unbalanced Amounts** check box is not selected in the service contract that contains three contract lines with such information.  

|Item|Line Cost|Line Value|Line Discount %|Line Discount Amount|Line Amount|Profit|  
|----------|---------------|----------------|---------------------|--------------------------|-----------------|------------|  
|Item 1|15.00|17.00|3.00|0.51|25.00|1.49|  
|Item 2|20.00|23.00|None|0.00|55.10|3.00|  
|Item 3|24.00|27.00|3.00|0.81|112.70|2.19|  

The **Annual Amount** field value is equal to the contents of the **Calcd. Annual Amount** field which is always set to the sum of the line amounts. In this case, it is equal to the following: 16.49 + 23.00 + 26.19 = 65.68.  

If you change the **Annual Amount** to 60, the profit percentage contributions for each contract line is calculated:  

* Item 1 – 5 / (5 + 5.1 +12.7) = 0.2193 %  
* Item 2 – 5.1 / (5 + 5.1 + 12.7) = 0.2237  
* Item 3 – 12.7 / (5 + 5.1 + 12.7) = 0.557  

The **Line Amount** field value is updated on each contract line using the following formula: Line Amount = Line Amount + difference between the new and calculated annual amounts * Percentage Contribution. After that, the **Line Discount Amount**, **Line Discount %**, and **Profit** field values are updated using the formulas described in the procedure above.  

Finally, the contract lines will contain this data.  

|Item|Line Cost|Line Value|Line Discount %|Line Discount Amount|Line Amount|Profit|  
|----------|---------------|----------------|---------------------|--------------------------|-----------------|------------|  
|Item 1|15.00|17.00|11.41|1.94|15.06|0.06|  
|Item 2|20.00|23.00|8.65|1.99|21.01|1.01|  
|Item 3|24.00|27.00|11.37|3.07|23.93|-0.07|  

### Distribution Based on Profit
If you change the annual amount of the service contract or contract quote, you may want to distribute the difference between its new and calculated annual amounts on the contract lines. Distribution Based on Profit is one of the automatic methods that can help you spread the new and calculated annual amounts difference between the line amounts on the contract lines. This distribution will be performed proportionally to their profit shares in the total contract or contract quote profit. The following list of distribution procedure steps for each contract line describe the main idea of this method:  

1. The profit percentage contribution is calculated as follows: the contents of the **Profit** field is divided by the sum of **Profit** field values on all contract lines.  
2. The **Line Amount** field value is updated by adding to it the difference between the new and calculated annual amounts, which is multiplied by the profit percentage contribution.  
3. The contents in the Line Discount Amount, Line Discount %, and Profit fields are updated with regard to the new value in the **Line Amount** field in the following way:  

    * Line Discount Amount = Line Value - Line Amount  
    * Line Discount % = Line Discount Amount / Line Value * 100  
    * Profit = Line Amount - Line Cost  

#### Example  
The **Allow Unbalanced Amounts** check box is not selected in the service contract that contains three contract lines with such information.  

|Item|Line Cost|Line Value|Line Discount %|Line Discount Amount|Line Amount|Profit|  
|----------|---------------|----------------|---------------------|--------------------------|-----------------|------------|  
|Item 1|20.00|25.00|0.00|0.00|25.00|5.00|  
|Item 2|50.00|58.00|5.00|2.90|55.10|5.10|  
|Item 3|100.00|115.00|2.00|2.30|112.70|12.70|  

The **Annual Amount** field value is equal to the contents of the **Calcd. Annual Amount** field, which is always set to the sum of the line amounts. In this case, it is equal to the following:  25.00 + 55.10 + 112.70 = 192.80.  

 If you change the **Annual Amount** to 180, the profit percentage contributions for each contract line are calculated:  

* Item 1 – 5 / (5 + 5.1 +1 2.7) = 0.2193 %  
* Item 2 – 5.1 / (5 + 5.1 + 12.7) = 0.2237  
* Item 3 – 12.7 / (5 + 5.1 + 12.7) = 0.557  

The **Line Amount** field value is updated on each contract line using the following formula: Line Amount = Line Amount + difference between the new and calculated annual amounts * Percentage Contribution. After that, the **Line Discount Amount**, **Line Discount %**, and **Profit** field values are updated using the formulas in the step 3 of the procedure described above.  

Finally, the contract lines will contain this data.  

|Item|Line Cost|Line Value|Line Discount %|Line Discount Amount|Line Amount|Profit|  
|----------|---------------|----------------|---------------------|--------------------------|-----------------|------------|  
|Item 1|20.00|25.00|11.24|2.81|22.19|2.19|  
|Item 2|50.00|58.00|9.93|5.76|52.24|2.24|  
|Item 3|100.00|115.00|8.20|9.43|105.57|5.57|

# Reconcile payments using automatic application

The **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page specifies payments, either incoming or outgoing, that have been recorded as transactions on your online bank account or on a payment service. You can apply the payments to related open customer, vendor, and bank account ledger entries. Fill in the journal by importing a bank statement as a bank feed or file or by manually entering transactions that you make through your payment service.

> [!NOTE]
> The page offers automatic matching functionality that applies payments to their related open entries based on a matching of data on a bank statement line (journal line) with data on one or more open entries. Note that you can overwrite the suggested automatic applications, and you can choose to not use automatic application at all. For more information, see step 7.

A payment reconciliation journal is related to one bank account in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The bank account represents the online bank account where the payment transactions are recorded. Any open bank account ledger entries related to the applied customer or vendor ledger entries will be closed when you choose the **Post Payments and Reconcile Bank Account** action. The bank account will be automatically reconciled for payments that you post with the journal.

If you use the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page to register and apply customer payments, you can set up the journal to use a specific number series. Afterward, you can specify the number series in the **Payment Reconciliation No. Series** field on a bank account. Using a dedicated number series can make it easier to identify any entries that were posted through the journal.

Similar to other journals, when you correct posted entries you can reverse entries that were posted through the payment reconciliation journal from the **G/L Register** page. For example, you might want to reverse entries for payments you applied to the wrong customer. You must first un-apply the posted customer ledger entries. Then you can use the **Reverse Register** action in the **G/L Register** page to reverse the journal that posted the payments. Alternatively, on the **Posted General Journals** page, you can use the **Copy Selected Lines to Journal** action to reverse specific lines from the posted payment reconciliaiton journal. 

When you use automatic application, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] recognizes bank ledger entries that have already been posted, which helps prevent double-posting.

You can import bank transactions as .csv bank files or other format that your bank provides. If you want to import bank statements as bank feeds, you must first enable a dedicated bank integration service, and then link the bank account to its related online bank account. The payment reconciliation journal will then automatically detect bank feeds when you choose the **Import Bank Transactions** action. In addition, you can set a bank account up to automatically import new bank statement feeds every hour. Transactions for payments that have already been posted as applied and/or reconciled won't be imported. You can use the Envestnet Yodlee Bank Feeds service for to get those transactions, which is preinstalled in some country versions of [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)]. For more information, see [Set Up the Envestnet Yodlee Bank Feeds Service](bank-how-setup-bank-statement-service.md). Alternatively, a Microsoft partner can help you meet your business or country requirements.

The **Map Text to Account** action lets you set up mappings between text on payments and specific debit, credit, and balancing accounts so that such payments are posted to the specified accounts when you post the payment reconciliation journal. Mapping is useful, for example, for recurring cash receipts or expenses, such as frequent purchases of car fuel or bank fees and interest, that regularly occur on the bank statement and don't need a related business document. (See step 10) For more information, see [Map text on recurring payments to accounts for automatic reconciliation](receivables-how-map-text-recurring-payments-accounts-auto-reconcilliation.md).

Journal lines might have no suggested application, which can happen for various reason. For example, because a document is missing, or a customer overpaid and there's an excess amount after applying the payment on another journal line. For such cases, you can use the **Transfer Difference to Account** action to create and post the missing general ledger entry, for example for a refund, that is needed to apply the payment to. (See step 11) For more information, see [Reconcile payments that can't be applied](receivables-how-reconcile-payments-cannot-apply-auto.md).

You use the **Apply Automatically** function either automatically when you import a bank file or feed with payment transactions or when you activate it, to apply payments to their related open entries based on a matching of text on a bank statement line (journal line) with text on one or more open entries. This automation is based on rules that you define on the **Payment Application Rules** page, where you also define whether an application suggestion requires review. For more information, see [Set up rules for automatic application of payments](receivables-how-set-up-payment-application-rules.md).

On journal lines where a payment has been applied automatically to one or more open entries, the **Match Confidence** field has a value of **Low**, **Medium**, or **High** to indicate the quality of the data matching that the suggested payment application is based on.

Some payment applications require your review as defined by the used matching rule, such as lines with **Low** match confidence. Other lines require your review and manual change because there's a value in the **Difference** field. To review one or more payment applications, choose the **Lines to Review** or **Lines with Difference** field at the bottom. The **Payment Application Review** page opens showing all relevant information about the customer or vendor that the payment is applied to, the matching details, and actions to process the line, such as the **Accept Application** action. (See steps 7 and 8)

For each journal line on the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page, you can open the **Payment Application** page to see all candidate open entries for the payment and view detailed information for each entry about the data matching that a payment application is based on. Here, you can manually apply payments or reapply payments that were applied automatically to a wrong entry. (See step 10) For more information, see [Review, or apply payments after automatic application](receivables-how-review-apply-payments-auto-application.md).

> [!NOTE]  
> You can start the bank transactions import at the same time as you open the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page for an existing journal. The following procedure describes how to import bank transactions into the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page after you have created a new journal.

## To reconcile payments using automatic application
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Payment Reconciliation Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. To work in a new payment reconciliation journal, choose the **New Journal** action.
3. On the **Payment Bank Account List** page, select the bank account that you want to reconcile payments for, and then choose the **OK** button.
   The **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page opens prepared for the selected bank account.
4. Choose the **Import Bank Transactions** action.
   If the bank account for the selected journal isn't set up for importing bank transactions, [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] will help you do that.
5. On the **Select a file to import** page, select the file that contains the bank transactions for payments that you want to reconcile, and then choose the **Open** button.  
6. If the Envestnet Yodlee Bank Feeds service is enabled, on the **Bank Statement Filter** page that opens automatically, specify the date interval for the bank statements to be imported.

    The **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page is filled with lines for payments representing bank transactions in the imported bank statement.

     On lines for payments that have been automatically applied to related open entries, the **Match Confidence** field indicates the quality of the data matching on which the suggested payment application is based. Also, the **Account Name**, **Account Type**, and **Account No.** fields show information about the customer or vendor that the payment is applied to.

    The automatic applications, the matching qualities, and whether lines require review are controlled by rules. You can edit the rules to adjust the results. For more information, see [Set Up Rules for Automatic Application of Payments](receivables-how-set-up-payment-application-rules.md).

7. To review, accept/remove, or manually change multiple payment applications that have a value in the **Difference** field, choose the **Lines with Difference** action at the bottom.

    The **Payment Application Review** page opens and shows the first application to review. The next application to review will be shown on the page as you process the preceding one. The review includes information about the customer or vendor that the payment is applied to, the matching details, and actions to process the line, such as the **Accept Application** and **Apply Manually** actions.

8. To review, accept or remove, or manually change multiple payment applications that the rule has set to be reviewed, choose the **Lines to Review** action. 

9. To change an automatic application, select a journal line, and then choose the **Apply Manually** action to reapply or apply the payment manually on the **Payment Application** page. For more information, see [Review or apply payments after automatic application](receivables-how-review-apply-payments-auto-application.md).

10. Select an unapplied journal line for a recurring cash receipt or expense, such as a car gasoline purchase, and then choose the **Map Text to Account** action. For more information, see [Map text on recurring payments to accounts for automatic reconciliation](receivables-how-map-text-recurring-payments-accounts-auto-reconcilliation.md).

    When you've finished your mapping of payment text to accounts, choose the **Apply Manually** action.

    When text-to-account mapping is set up, the resulting automatic payment application will contain **High - Text-to-Account Mapping** in the **Match Confidence** field.

11. For a journal line has no suggested application because no ledger entry exists that it can be applied to, choose the **Transfer Difference to Account** action to create and post the missing general ledger entry that is needed to apply the payment to. For more information, see [Reconcile payments that can't be applied.](receivables-how-reconcile-payments-cannot-apply-auto.md)

12. When no more lines require review and the **Difference** field is blank on all lines, choose the **Post** action, and then choose one of the following options:

    - **Post Payments and Reconcile Bank Accounts** - To post the payments as applied and also close the related bank account ledger entries as reconciled.
    - **Post Payments Only** - To only post the payments as applied, but leave the related bank account ledger entries open. Required that you reconcile the bank account separately,  for example: For more information, see [Reconcile bank accounts](bank-how-reconcile-bank-accounts-separately.md).
    - **Test Report** - To review the result of posting before you post. The **Bank Account Statement** report opens and shows the same fields as at the bottom of the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page.

When you post the payment reconciliation journal, the applied open entries are closed. The customer, vendor, or general ledger accounts are updated. For payments on journal lines based on text-to-account mapping, the specified customer, vendor, and general ledger accounts are updated. For all journal lines, bank account ledger entries are created. If you choose the **Post Payments and Reconcile Bank Account** action, any open bank account ledger entries related to the applied customer or vendor ledger entries will be closed. This means that the bank account is automatically reconciled for payments that you post with the journal.

You can compare the value in the **Balance on Bank Account After Posting** field together with the value in the **Statement Ending Balance** field to track when the bank account is reconciled based on payments that you post.

> [!NOTE]  
>   If you do not want to reconcile the bank account from the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page, then you must use the **Bank Account Reconciliation** page. For more information, see [Reconcile bank accounts](bank-how-reconcile-bank-accounts-separately.md).

# Multiple VAT registration numbers 

For businesses with warehouses in multiple EU countries, managing VAT (Value Added Tax) can be challenging, as each warehouse location requires a different VAT number to comply with the specific regulations of each country. This article provides information about this requirement and explains the functionality for multiple value-added tax (VAT) registration numbers. This functionality allows users to set up tax registration numbers for their customers in different countries/regions.  

> [!NOTE]
> The *Multiple VAT numbers for customers* functionality is available only from Business Central 2024 release wave 2 (version 25).

## How to set up the alternative VAT registration numbers  

To set up the alternative VAT registration numbers for different countries/regions, follow these steps: 

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Alternative Customer VAT Registration**, and then select the related link. 
2. Add the customer in the **Customer No** field and the country/region related to this VAT registration in the **VAT Country/Region Code**.  
3. You must add the VAT number in the **VAT Registration No.** field. You must stick to the format when you use **Country/Region Code**. 
4. If you want to use different VAT or general posting groups, you can alternatively add them to the setup in the **VAT Bus. Posting Group** and **Gen. Bus. Posting Group** fields. 
5. Close the page.   

To create an alternative address for your customer, follow these steps:  

1. Open the **Customer** card for the customer you want to add new **Ship-to Address**. 
2. Select **Customer**, and choose the **Ship-to Addresses** action.   
3. The **Ship-to Address List** page opens, and select **New**. 
4. Fill in the information about your customer's ship-to destination.  
5. Choose the proper **Country/Region Code**.   
6. If you have already configured a new **VAT Registration No.** on the **Alternative Customer VAT Registration** for this country or region, nothing will happen. 
  - But if you didn't configure the **VAT Registration No.** previously on the **Alternative Customer VAT Registration** for this country or region, the following notification appears: **Click Add if you want to insert the Alternative VAT Registration for this Ship-To Country Code.**
  - Choose the **Add** action on the notification and the **Alternative Customer VAT Registration** page opens.
This page populates your **Customer No.** and the **VAT Country/Region Code**. So, you just need to add the setup that you want to use. 

## Work with the sales documents   

You can create new [sales invoice](sales-how-invoice-sales.md) or [sales order](sales-how-sell-products.md) in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. If you need to use a ship-to address that differs from the customer's address and is located in a different country, follow the steps:  

### Alternate shipping address  

1. Expand the **Shipping and Billing** FastTab.   
2. In the Ship-to field, choose the **Alternate Shipping Address** option. 
3. The **Ship-to Address List** page with available alternate addresses appears. 
4. Choose one of the addresses with a different **Country/Region Code**. 
5. The **Confirm Alternative Customer VAT Registration** dialog page appears with a list of fields that you have modified because of the **Alternative Customer VAT Registration** setup change. 
6. Select **OK** to confirm.   

> [!NOTE]
> If you don't want to confirm such a choice anymore, you can select the **Don't show again** field, and in the future you won't see this type of notification about changes. But if you want to enable it again, you can do it by enabling the **Confirm Alternative VAT Registration** field on the **VAT Setup**.  
   
7. Once you confirm, the values are overwritten with the values from the **Alternative Customer VAT Registration** setup. You can check all the VAT related fields that are under the **Invoice Details** FastTab.  
8. Post the document.  

### Custom address  

In case you don't have the ship-to address configured but still want to use a different address for shipping, you can use this option.  

1. Expand the **Shipping and Billing** FastTab.   
2. In the Ship-to field, choose the **Custom Address** option.  
3. Change the country in the **Country/Region** field.  
4. Once you change the country/region code to match the **VAT Country/Region Code** of the **Alternative Customer VAT Registration**, the **Confirm Alternative Customer VAT Registration** dialog page appears with a list of fields that have been changed. 
5. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will also change all the VAT related fields that are under the **Invoice Details** FastTab.  

### Work with no shipment 

If there's no shipment as a process, you still can leverage the **Alternative Customer VAT Registration** setup.

In the sales order or invoice, you can find the **VAT Country/Region Code** under the **Invoice Details** FastTab and specify the value that matches the **Alternative Customer VAT Registration** setup. You should see the same confirmation dialog page as above. 

In this situation, you can post a sales invoice with the proper **VAT Registration No.** for your customer even if you don't ship items with this document. 

### Work with the sales credit memo  

Once you post the invoice with a **Ship-to address** or **VAT Country/Region Code** that has different posting data, the corrective **Sales credit memo** takes the values from the **Posted sales invoice** header where these values are taken from the **Alternative customer VAT registration**, so no other actions required.

# Inventory Power BI app

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The Power BI Inventory app is designed to pull data directly from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to give leadership, managers, and warehouse staff key information about inventory. This app has various reports that offer insights into business operations. Use the information from these reports to make informed decisions that ensure you meet demand, keep costs low, and don't delay production.

## Inventory analytics for the leadership team

To fit this category, you might have a role such as:

- Chief Operations Officer
- Chief Finance Officer

### Example scenario: maintaining stock turnover

COOs want to ensure that stock moves so you don't have aging stock on hand. The [Inventory by Lot](inventory-powerbi-inventory-by-lot.md) report shows how much stock is in each lot and where stock is expired. You can also compare this report with the information on the [Purchase and Sales Quantity](inventory-powerbi-purchase-and-sales-qty.md) report to ensure you aren't over-purchasing and increasing storage costs.

## Inventory analytics for the management team

To fit this category, you might have a role such as:

- Warehouse Manager
- Procurement Manager
- Supply Chain Manager
- Production Manager

### Example scenario: maintaining stock on hand

Warehouse managers want to ensure that each location has adequate stock levels. The [Inventory by Location](inventory-powerbi-inventory-by-location.md) report helps you ensure adequate stock levels at each location. It also indicates where to move stock around to supply locations.

Production or procurement managers can use the [Gross Requirement](inventory-powerbi-gross-requirement.md) to ensure that production planning is supplied by stock.

## Inventory analytics for the warehouse team

To fit this category, you might have a role such as:

- Order picker
- Order shipping

### Example scenario: tracking stock

Order pickers in a warehouse want to ensure that each bin contains enough stock to meet orders. Use the [Bin Contents](inventory-powerbi-bin-contents.md) report to be sure that bins contain the right amount of stock. To see tracking information, use the [Bin Contents by Item Tracking](inventory-powerbi-bin-contents-by-item-tracking.md) report.

To see lot and serial information on an item by item basis, other staff in the warehouse can use either the [Inventory by Lot](inventory-powerbi-inventory-by-lot.md) or [Inventory by Serial](inventory-powerbi-inventory-by-serial-no.md) reports.

## Use the reports

The following table provides descriptions on how you can use each report in the Power BI Inventory app.

# (Obsolete) Update Custom Report Layouts

[!INCLUDE[legacy-custom-layouts](includes/legacy-custom-layouts.md)]

Occasionally, you may need to update a custom report layout that is used on a report. This is required when there has been a design change to the report's data set, for example, a field that is used in the layout has been removed from the report data set. If a report layout requires updating, you will get an error message when you try to preview, print or save the report.  

You can automatically update a report layout from the error message that appears when you run the report by choosing the **Yes** button on the error message. Or, in advance of running reports, you can update specific report layouts or all custom report layouts that might be affected by dataset changes.  

You also have the option to test updates without applying the required changes to the custom report layouts. This enables you to see what changes will be applied to the report layout and identify possible issues in the process. From the test results, you can open the custom report layouts directly for editing to fix any issues. We recommend that you test the report layout update before you apply the updates.  

Not all report dataset changes can be automatically updated in the report layouts. Some changes will require that you manually edit the report layout. For more information, see [Limitations of the Custom Report Layout Update](ui-update-report-layouts.md#UpdateLimitations).  

## To update one or more custom report layouts  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Report Layout Selection**, and then choose the related link.  

2.  On the **Report Layout Selection** page, if you want to update a specific report, select the layout from the list, and then choose the **Update Layout** action. Or, if you want to update all custom report layouts for the company, choose the **Update All Layouts** action.  

If no errors occur, then the updates is applied to the report layouts. If errors occur, then a message that contains the errors appears. You will then have to manually edit the custom report layout to fix the error. For more information, see [Fixing Errors](ui-update-report-layouts.md#FixErrors).  

## To test custom report layout updates  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Report Layout Selection**, and then choose the related link.  

2.  On the **Report Layout Selection** page, choose the **Test Layout Updates** action.  

 Changes to the report layouts are tested but not applied to the actual report layouts. A **Report Layout Update Log** page appears that provides the status a potential updates for each report layout. If there are errors for a report layout, you can access the report layout directly for editing from the message to fix any issues. For more information, see [Fixing Errors](ui-update-report-layouts.md#FixErrors).  

##  <a name="UpdateLimitations"></a> Limitations of the Custom Report Layout Update  
 There are several types of changes that the automatic update can apply to custom report layouts, for example, a field that is used in the layout has been removed from the report data set. However, the automatic update cannot handle the following changes to a report dataset.  

1.  Deleted fields, labels, or data items.  

2.  Duplicate field names in the report layout after a field has been renamed in the dataset. This should be treated as a design error.  

3.  Upgrade scenarios where there are multiple iterations of a report layout that causes multiple rename actions on the same fields, labels or data items.  

 If the update process detects any one of these issues, the update cannot be applied. You will have to fix the issues manually, for example by editing the report layout in Word, or programmatically by using upgrade codeunits.  

##  <a name="FixErrors"></a> Fixing Errors  
 If you get an error message when you update or test report layout updates, you most likely will have to modify the report layout to fix the problem. Read the error message to help determine the cause of the problem.  

 The most typical problem occurs when a field that is used on the layout has been removed from the report dataset. In this case, you will see a line in the error message that states that an item has been removed. To fix this issue, you will have to modify the layout and remove the field in question.  

 For more information, see [Create and Modify a Custom Report Layout](ui-how-create-custom-report-layout.md#ModifyCustomLayout).  

After you modify the layout, try to update the layout again.

# Allocate Resources
The key element to service management is the people who supply service. You can set up [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to assign the appropriate people to the appropriate projects. Assignments can be based on service zones where the people are located or where the service occurs. In addition, you can group resources together when responding to service requests. For more information, see [Set Up Resource Allocation](service-how-setup-resource-allocation.md).

You can allocate resources, for example, technicians, by using the **Dispatch Board**, or from a service order. You can use resource availability to allocate resources to perform the service tasks in the orders or quotes.

You can allocate the same resource, for example, a technician, or resource group to all the service items in a service order. Allocation entries are created for the other service items in the order with the same resource number and allocation date as the line you allocated. The allocated hours are the hours you allocated divided by the number of service items in the order. The **Status** field is automatically set to **Active** for all the entries that were created.

## To see an overview of service orders and service quotes  
You may often need to see the list of service orders or service quotes that meet certain requirements to be able to perform specific actions with them one by one. For example,you may need to allocate resources to service orders that belong to a specific customer.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Dispatch Board**, and then choose the related link.  
2. In the **Document Filter** field, choose the type of the documents you want to see.
3. To get a list of documents that contain service tasks a certain resource or resource group is allocated to, fill in the **Resource Filter** and **Resource Group Filter** fields and select <kbd>Enter</kbd>.  
4. To get a list of documents with a certain response date or response dates within a certain date period, fill in the **Response Date Filter** field and select <kbd>Enter</kbd>.  
5. To get a list of documents with a specified allocation state or document status, fill in the **Allocation Filter/Status Filter** field and select <kbd>Enter</kbd>.  
6. To get a list of documents that belong to a certain contract, customer, or zone, fill in the **Contract Filter/Customer Filter/Zone Filter** field and select <kbd>Enter</kbd>.  
7. Choose a line that corresponds to a service order or service quote, and then choose the **Show Document** action.  

    The **Service Order** or **Service Quote** page opens, and you can work with the document. To return to the **Dispatch Board** page, choose **OK**.

## To allocate a resource using resource or resource group availability    
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Dispatch Board**, and choose the related link.  
2. Choose the service order, and then choose the **Resource Allocations** action.  
3. Choose the entry with the service task to which you want to allocate a resource.  
4. Choose either the **Resource Availability** or **Res. Group Availability** action.  
5. On the **Res. Availability (Service)** page, choose **Show Matrix**.  
6. Choose a resource to allocate. You can base your selection on whether the resource is skilled for the task, whether it is located in the customer zone, and/or whether it is preferred by the customer.  
7. Specify a date on which the resource has enough available hours for the task, and which is close to the response date of the service order.  
8. In the **Qty. to Allocate** field, enter the number of hours you want to allocate the resource to the service task for.  
9. Choose the **Allocate** action to allocate the selected resource on the selected date.  

     The **Status** field is automatically set to **Active**.  

 Repeat these steps for each date that you want to allocate the resource to the service task.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  For a service item in a service order, there can only be **Active** allocation entries with one resource or resource group at a time.  

## To allocate a resource using a service order  
After you have created and filled in a service order or service quote, you can allocate resources, for example, technicians, to perform service tasks registered as service item lines in the document.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the service order, and then choose **Edit**.  
3. Choose the service item line corresponding to the service task you want to allocate a resource to.  
4. Choose **Resource Allocations**.
5. On the **Resource Allocations** page, choose a nonactive allocation entry with the service task you want to allocate the resource to. If the allocation entry does not exist, you can create a new one by choosing **New**.  
7. Specify the service task by filling in the **Service Item No.** field on the same line.  
8. In the **Resource No.** field, choose the resource. If the resource is a member of a resource group, the number of the resource group is entered automatically into the **Resource Group No.** field.  
9. Fill in the **Allocation Date** and **Allocated Hours** fields. The **Status** field is set to **Active**. This means that the resource is allocated to the service task.  
10. Optionally, to assign the resource to all items, choose **Allocate to All Service Items**.

> [!NOTE]  
>  For a service item in a service order, there can only be active allocation entries with one resource or resource group at a time.

## To reallocate resources on a service order  
You can reallocate resources directly from a service order or service quote when you are working with it. The original entry will still exist, but its status is updated as follows:  

* If service was started while the allocation was **Active**, that is, if the repair status of the service item in the entry was changed to **In Process**, the allocation status changes from **Reallocation Needed** to **Finished**.  
* If service was not started while the allocation was **Active**, allocation status changes from **Reallocation Needed** to **Canceled**.  
* If you are reallocating a service order that you have converted from a quote, the status of the allocation entries registered for the quote always changes to **Finished** when you reallocate the service items in the service order.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the relevant service order.  
3. Select the service item line corresponding to the service task you want to allocate a resource to, and then choose the **Resource Allocations** action.  
4. On the **Resource Allocations** page, select an allocation entry with the service task you want to reallocate the resource to. In the **Resource No.** field, select the relevant resource. This overwrites the resource number already in the field.  
5. Select <kbd>Enter</kbd>. A dialog box opens, asking whether you want to reallocate this entry. Fill in the **Reason Code** field if appropriate and choose the **Yes** button to confirm the reallocation.  
6. Fill in the **Allocation Date** and **Allocated Hours** fields. The entry now contains the new resource and its status is **Active**.

## To reallocate a resource using the dispatch board  
If the resource allocated to a service task cannot accomplish the work, it means that this service task needs reallocation. Usually you reallocate resources to a service task by using the **Dispatch Board**.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Dispatch Board**, and then choose the related link.  
2. In the **Allocation Filter** field, select **Reallocation Needed**. The **Dispatch Board** page now shows the list of service orders that include service tasks that need reallocation.  
3. Select the relevant service order, and then choose the **Resource Allocations** action. The **Resource Allocations** page opens.  
4. Select the allocation entry with the service task you want to reallocate a resource to.  
5. In the **Resource No.** field, select the relevant resource. It overwrites the resource number already in the field.  
6. Select <kbd>Enter</kbd>. The **Reallocation Entry Reasons** dialog box opens, asking whether you want to reallocate this entry. Fill in the **Reason Code** field if appropriate and choose the **Yes** button to confirm the reallocation.  
7.  Fill in the **Allocation Date** and **Allocated Hours** fields. The entry now contains the new resource and its status is **Active**.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  The old entry still exists but the status is updated in the following ways:  
    >   
    >  * If service was started while the allocation was **Active**, that is, if the repair status of the service item in the entry was changed to **In Process**, the allocation status changes from **Reallocation Needed** to **Finished**.  
    > * If service was not started while the allocation was **Active**, the allocation status changes from **Reallocation Needed** to **Canceled**.  
    > * If you are reallocating a service order that you have converted from a quote, the status of the allocation entries registered for the quote always changes to **Finished** when you reallocate the service items in the service order.  

## To register resource hours  
When working on service items in service orders, you need to register the resource hours used for the service. The following procedure shows how to register the resource hours on the **Service Item Worksheet** page.  

You can use the same procedure to register the hours on the **Service Lines** page, which you can open from the Service Order page. Open the relevant service card, and then choose the **Service Lines** action.  

If the same resource works on all the service items in the service order, you can register the total resource hours for one service item only and then split the resource line to assign the resource hours to the other service items.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Tasks**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the line that includes the relevant service item, and then choose the **Item Worksheet** action.  
3. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

## To assign a resource to all service items in an order
If the same resource, for example a technician, works on all the service items in the service order, you can register the total resource hours for one service item only and then split the resource line to divide the resource hours onto the resource lines for the other service items.  

The following procedure shows how to split resource lines on the **Service Invoice Lines** page.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the relevant service order.  
3. On the **Lines** FastTab, choose the **Service Lines** action. The **Service Lines** page opens.  
4. Select the resource line you want to split. The contents of the **Quantity** field is divided between all the service items in the order.  
5. Choose the **Split Resource Line** action. Choose **Yes** to confirm.  

    Resource lines for the other service items in the order are created with the same resource number as the line you split. The quantity is the quantity for the line you split divided by the number of service items in the order.  

## To cancel an allocation  
You can cancel resource allocations for service tasks without reallocating the tasks.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Dispatch Board**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the service order, and then choose the **Resource Allocations** action.  
3. Choose the allocation entry with the service task that you want to cancel allocation for.  
4. Choose the **Cancel Allocation** action.  
5. In the **Reason Code** field, select the appropriate reason code.  
6. Choose **Yes** to confirm the cancellation.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > In the **Status** field, the **Reallocation Needed** option is automatically selected. If the repair status of the service item in the entry is **Initial**, the repair status is changed to **Referred**, that is, no service has been started. If the repair status is **In Process**, it is changed to **Partly Serviced**, that is, some service has been completed.

# Flush components according to operation output

You can define different flushing strategies to automate the registration of consumption of components.

This feature is useful for the following reasons:  

- **Inventory Valuation**

    Value entries for output and consumption are created in parallel as the production order progresses. Without routing link codes, the inventory value increases as output is posted and decreases later when you post the consumption with the finished production order.  
- **Inventory Availability**

    With gradual consumption posting, the availability of component items is more up-to-date, which is important to maintain the internal balance between demand and supply. Without routing link codes, other demands for the component might believe that it's available as long as it's pending a delayed consumption posting.  
- **Just-in-Time**

    With the ability to customize products to customer requests, you can minimize waste by making sure that work and system changes only occur when it's necessary.  

- **Reduce data entry**

    The ability to automatically flush an operation lets you automate the entire process of recording consumption and output. The disadvantage of using automatic flushing is that you might not accurately record, or even be aware of, scrap.

## Automatic consumption posting (flushing) methods  

- Forward Flush the Entire Order  
- Forward Flushing by Operation  
- Back Flushing by Operation  
- Back Flushing the Entire Order  

### Forward flush an entire order  

Forward flushing a production order at the start of the job is similar to a manual consumption. The significant difference is that consumption happens automatically.  

- The entire contents of the production BOM are consumed and deducted from inventory at the time the released production order is refreshed.  
- The consumption quantity is the quantity per assembly stated on the production BOM, multiplied by the number of parent items you're building.  
- There's no need to record any information in the consumption journal if all of the items are to be flushed.  
- When you consume items from inventory, it doesn't matter when output journal entries are made because the output journal has no effect on this mode of consumption posting.  
- No routing link codes can be set.  

Forward flushing an entire order is suited in production environments with:  

- A low number of defects.  
- A low number of operations.  
- High component consumption in early operations.  

### Forward flushing by operation  

Flushing by operation allows you to deduct inventory during a specific operation in the routing of the parent item. Material is tied to the routing using routing link codes, which correspond to routing link codes applied to components in the production BOM.  

The flush takes place when the operation that has the same routing link code is started. Started means that some activity is recorded in the output journal for that operation. And that activity might just be that a setup time is entered.  

The amount of the flush is for the quantity per assembly on the production BOM multiplied by the number of parent items you're building (expected quantity).  

This technique is best employed when there are many operations and certain components aren't needed until late in the assembly sequence. In fact, a Just-in-Time (JIT) setup might not even have the items on hand when the RPO is begun.  

Material can be consumed during operations by using routing link codes. Some components might not be used until final assembly operations and shouldn't be withdrawn from stock until that time.  

### Back flushing by operation  

Back flushing by operation records consumption after the operation is posted in the output journal.  

The advantage of this method is that the number of parent parts finished in the operation is known.  

Material in the production BOM is linked to the routing records using routing link codes. The back flush takes place when an operation with a particular routing link code is posted with a finished quantity.  

The amount is the quantity per assembly on the production BOM multiplied by the number of parent items posted as output for the operation. This quantity might be different than the expected quantity.  

### Back flushing an entire order  

This reporting method doesn't consider routing link codes.  

No components are picked until the released production order status is changed to *Finished*. The amount is the quantity per assembly on the production BOM multiplied by the number of parent items that you finished and put in inventory.  

Backward flushing the entire production order requires the same setup as for forward flushing: The reporting method must be set to backward on each item card for all items within the parent BOM to be reported. In addition, all routing link codes must be removed from the production BOM. 

For example, if a production order to produce 800 meters requires 8 kg of a component, then when you post 200 meters as output, 2 kg are automatically posted as consumption.

You can achieve that by combining backward flushing method and routing link codes so that the quantity that is flushed for each operation is proportional to the actual output of the finished operation. For items that are set up with backward flushing method, the default behavior is to calculate and post component consumption when you change the status of a released production order to **Finished**. If you also define routing link codes, then calculation and posting occurs when each operation is finished, and the quantity that was consumed in the operation is posted. For more information, see [Create Routings](production-how-to-create-routings.md).  

## To flush components according to operation output

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **Edit** action.  
3. On the **Replenishment** FastTab, in the **Flushing Method** field, select **Backward**.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > Select **Pick + Backward** if the component is used in a location that is set up for directed put-away and pick.  

4. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Routings**, and then choose the related link.  
5. Define routing link codes for every operation that consumes the component. For more information, see [Create Routings](production-how-to-create-routings.md).  
    > [!IMPORTANT]  
    > Don't use the same routing link for different operations in the routing. Using the same routing link would lead to registration of consumption of component for each linked operation.  
6. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Production BOM**, and then choose the related link.  
7. Define routing link codes from each instance of the component to the operation that consumes it.

The consumption is posted automatically when you register output. To learn more, go to [Batch Post Output and Run Times](production-how-to-post-output-quantity.md).

## Flushing methods

The following table describes the flushing method options that you can specify on **Item** cards and **Stockkeeping Unit** cards.

|Option|Description|
|------------|-------------|  
|Manual|You can manually consume items without picking. For each item, stockkeeping unit, or production order component line you can ignore the **Prod. Consumption Whse. Handling** setting in the **Location Card** page. Skipping warehouse or inventory picks is typical for automatic flushing methods, such as **Backward** and **Forward**. It might be useful for components which, due to their nature, you store in the shop floor zone so there's no need to pick. However, they might require manual posting of consumption, for example, because the consumed quantity can very or they require item tracking.<br><br>To start using this feature, on the **Feature Management** page, activate **Feature Update: 'Manual' flushing method without requiring pick**. Existing records upgrade from **Manual** to the **Pick + Manual** flushing method. The **Pick + Manual** option is added immediately and works, regardless of whether you enable the feature key. If the feature isn't enabled, **Manual** and **Pick + Manual** both require picking due to the original behavior. When the feature key is enabled, the **Manual** option doesn't require picking.|
|Forward|Automatically posts consumption according to the production order component lines. <br><br>By default, the posting of component consumption occurs when you change the status of a production order to **Released**. However, if you use the **Routing Link** Code field on production order component lines, then posting occurs per operation when the operation starts. For more information, see [How to: Create Routing Links](production-how-to-create-routings.md#to-create-routing-links). <br><br> **Note**<br>For the forward flushing option, the operation-specific posting that you get with routing link codes is based on the expected quantity that is defined on the component line. For information about operation-specific flushing based on actual output, see the description of **Backward** in this article.<br><br>If the location or resources where this component is consumed are set up with a default bin structure, then the item is consumed from the **Open Shop Floor Bin Code**. For more information, see [How to: Set Up Basic Warehouses with Operations Areas](warehouse-how-to-set-up-basic-warehouses-with-operations-areas.md). <br><br> **Important** <br>Forward flushing also occurs when you choose **Refresh** on a released production order that was created from scratch. On the released production orders, you can't change bin information because you generate the production order component lines when you refresh the order. Refreshing the order forward flushes the components. Therefore, if you want to change bin information on production order component lines before forward flushing occurs, then that order must be created with the *Planned* or *Firm Planned* status.|
|Backward|Automatically calculates and posts consumption according to the production order component lines.<br><br> By default, the calculation and posting of component consumption occurs when you change the status of a released production order to **Finished**. However, if you use the **Routing Link Code** field on the production order component lines, then calculation and posting occurs when each operation is finished.<br><br> **Note** <br>Backward flushing and routing link codes can be combined so that the quantity that is flushed per operation is proportional to the actual output of that operation. For more information, see [How to: Flush Components According to Operation Output](#to-flush-components-according-to-operation-output).<br><br> If the location or machine center where this component is consumed are set up with a default bin structure, then the item is consumed from the **Open Shop Floor Bin Code**.|
|Pick + Forward|Same as for Forward flushing method, except it only works for locations that use either advanced warehouse configuration or basic warehouse configuration with mandatory bins.<br><br> Consumption is calculated and posted from the bin that is defined in the **To-Production Bin Code** field on the location or machine center after the component is picked in the warehouse.<br><br> **Note** <br>If a component uses the Pick + Forward flushing method, it can't have a routing link code to an operation that uses the forward flushing method. The component would then be automatically flushed when the operation starts, which makes it impossible to request the pick activity.|
|Pick + Backward|Same as for Backward flushing method, except it only works for locations use either advanced warehouse configuration or basic warehouse configuration with mandatory bins.<br><br> Consumption is calculated and posted from the bin that is defined in the **To-Production Bin Code** field on the location or machine center after the component is picked in the warehouse.|
|Pick + Manual|Require picking if consumption needs to happen at a location where warehouse handling is enabled.|

# Design Details: Variance
Variance is defined as the difference between the actual cost and the standard cost, as described in the following formula.  

 actual cost – standard cost = variance  

 If the actual cost changes, for example, because you post an item charge on a later date, then the variance is updated accordingly.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  Revaluation does not affect the variance calculation, because revaluation only changes the inventory value.  

## Example  
 The following example illustrates how variance is calculated for purchased items. It is based on the following scenario:  

1.  The user purchases an item at LCY 90.00, but the standard cost is LCY 100.00. Accordingly, the purchase variance is LCY –10.00.  
2.  LCY 10.00 is credited to the purchase variance account.  
3.  The user posts an item charge of LCY 20.00. Accordingly, the actual cost is increased to LCY 110.00, and the value of the purchase variance becomes LCY 10.00.  
4.  LCY 20.00 is debited to the purchase variance account. Accordingly, the net purchase variance becomes LCY 10.00.  
5.  The user revalues the item from LCY 100.00 to LCY 70.00. This does not affect the variance calculation, only the inventory value.  

 The following table shows the resulting value entries.  

 ![Purchase variance calculation.](media/design_details_inventory_costing_11_purchase_variance.png "Purchase variance calculation")  

## Determining the Standard Cost  
 The standard cost is used when calculating variance and the amount to capitalize. Since the standard cost can be changed over time because of manual update calculation, you need a point in time when the standard cost is fixed for variance calculation. This point is when the inventory increase is invoiced. For produced or assembled items, the point when standard cost is determined is when the cost is adjusted.  

 The following table shows how different cost shares are calculated for produced and assembled items when you use the Calculate Standard Cost function.  

|Cost Share|Purchased Item|Produced/Assembled Item|  
|----------------|--------------------|------------------------------|

# Setting up sales

Before you can manage sales processes, you must configure the rules and values that define the company's sales policies.

You must define the general setup on the **Sales & Receivables** page, such as which sales documents are required, how their values are posted, and the type of lines to create by default. This general setup is typically performed once during the initial implementation.

A separate series of tasks related to registering new customers is to record any special price or discount agreements that you have with each customer. For more information, see [Record Special Sales Prices and Discounts](sales-how-record-sales-price-discount-payment-agreements.md).

Finance-related sales setup, such as payment methods and currencies, are covered in the Finance Setup section. For more information, see [Setting Up Finance](finance-setup-finance.md).

# Setting up service management
Before you can start using Service Management features in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], there are a few things to set up. For example, you can establish coding for standard services, symptoms, and fault codes, and the service items and service item types based on your company’s customer service requirements.  

When you set up Service Management, you must decide what services to offer customers and the schedule for those services. A service is a type of work performed by one or more resources and provided to a customer. For example, a service could be a type of computer repair. A service item is the equipment or item needing servicing, for example, the computer needing repair, installed at a specific customer. You can set up services as part of a group of related repair or maintenance items.  
  
When you define a service, you can associate it with the skills required to perform the service. To help your service representatives be efficient, you can also set up real time troubleshooting guidelines and assign typical startup costs, such as travel costs or other fees.  

The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the articles that describe them.

# Period-Over-Period Growth (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Period-Over-Period Growth** report provides valuable insights into your organization's sales performance over time. The report compares sales amounts for different time periods to the same period in the previous year, providing insight into growth trends and areas for improvement.

For example, if the analysis scope is fiscal months, the report compares the sales amount in September 2023 to the sales amount in September 2022. If the analysis scope is fiscal years, the report compares the sales amount in fiscal year 2023 to the sale amount in fiscal year 2022.

## Use the report

The report is meant for business leaders and managers.

CEOs are responsible for making strategic decisions that drive growth for organizations. The report provides valuable insights into your organization's sales performance over time. By comparing sales amounts for different time periods to the same period in the previous year, this report helps you identify growth trends and areas for improvement.

For example, you might notice that sales consistently declined in a particular region or product category. You can use this information to make decisions about investments or changes to your sales strategy. Changes might include increasing your marketing efforts in that region, or improving your product offerings to be more competitive.

For sales managers who oversee daily sales activities, the report can help you identify areas where the sales team is excelling, and areas where they need more support. By analyzing the growth amount and growth percentage, you can evaluate your team's performance over the current fiscal year compared to the previous fiscal year. This information can help you adjust sales strategies, coach team members, and improve overall sales performance.

## Key performance indicators

The report includes the following key performance indicators (KPIs) and measures:

- [**Sales Amount**](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#sales-amount)

# The Late Payment Prediction extension

Effectively managing receivables is important to the overall financial health of a business. To reduce outstanding receivables and help you fine-tune your collections strategy, the extension predicts whether to expect late payments. For example, if a payment is predicted to be late, you might decide to adjust the terms of payment or the payment method for the customer.

## Get started

When you open a posted sales document, a notification displays at the top of the page. To use the Late Payment Prediction Extension, opt in by choosing **Enable** in the notification. Alternatively, you can set up the extension manually. For example, if you regret dismissing the notification.

To enable the extension manually, follow these steps:

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Late Payment Prediction Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary.

> [!NOTE]
> If you decide to enable the extension manually, be aware that [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will not allow you to do so if the quality of the model is low. The quality of the model indicates how accurate the model's predictions are likely to be. Several factors can impact the quality of a model. For example, there might not have been enough data, or there wasn't enough variation in the data. You can view the quality of the model you're currently using on the **Late Payment Prediction Setup** page. You can also specify a minimum threshold for the model quality.

## View all payment predictions

If you enable the extension, a **Payments Predicted to be Late** tile is available in the **Business Manager** Role Center. The tile displays the number of payments that are predicted to be late, and lets you open the **Customer Ledger Entries** page where you can dig deeper into the posted invoices. There are three columns to pay attention to:  

* **Late Payment** - Indicates whether the payment for the invoice is predicted to be late.
* **Prediction Confidence** - Indicates how reliable you should consider the prediction to be. **High** means that the prediction is at least 90% sure, **Medium** is between 80% and 90%, and **Low** is below 80%.
* **Prediction Confidence %** - Shows the actual percentage behind the confidence rating. By default, this column is hidden, but you can add it if you want. For more information, see [Personalize Your Workspace](ui-personalization-user.md).

> [!TIP]
> The Customer Ledger Entries page shows a FactBox. While you're reviewing predictions, the information in the **Customer Details** section can be helpful. When you choose the invoice in the list, the section shows information about the customer. It also lets you take immediate action. For example, if a customer frequently misplaces their wallet, you can open the Customer card from the FactBox and block the customer for future sales.  

## Design details

Microsoft deploys and operates predictive web services in all regions where [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is available. Access to these web services is included in your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] subscription. For more information, see the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central Licensing Guide. The guide is available for download on the [Business Central](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/business-central/overview/) website.

The web services work in three modes:

* Train model. The web service trains the model based on the provided dataset.
* Evaluate model. The web service checks whether the model returns reliable data for the provided dataset.
* Predict. Web-service applies the model to the provided dataset to make a prediction.

These web services are stateless, meaning they use data only to calculate predictions on demand. They don't store data.

> [!NOTE]  
> You can use your own predictive web service instead of ours. For more information, see [Create and use your own predictive web service late payment prediction](#AnchorText).

### Data required to train and evaluate the model

For each **Customer ledger entry** that has a related **Posted Sales Invoice**:

* Amount in local currency, including tax
* Payment terms in days are calculated as **Due Date** minus **Posting Date**
* Whether there's an applied credit memo

Additionally, the record has aggregated data from other invoices that are related to the same customer.

- Total number and amounts on paid invoices
- Total number and amounts on invoices that were paid late
- Total number and amounts on outstanding invoices
- Total number and amounts on outstanding invoices that are already late
- Average days late
- Ratio: Number of paid late/paid invoices
- Ratio: Amount paid late/paid invoices
- Ratio: Number of outstanding late/outstanding invoices
- Ratio: Amounts on outstanding late/outstanding invoices

> [!NOTE]
> The information about the customer isn't included in the dataset.

### Standard model and My model

The Late Payment Prediction extension's predictive model is trained on data that represents a range of small to medium-sized businesses. When you start posting invoices and receiving payments, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] evaluates whether the standard model fits your business flow.

If your processes don't match the standard model, you can use the extension but you need to get more data. Just continue to use [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

> [!NOTE]
> We use a bit of your compute time each week when we evaluate and re-train the model.

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] runs training and evaluation automatically when enough paid and late invoices are available. However, you can run it manually whenever you want.

#### To train and use your model

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Late Payment Prediction Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. In the **Selected Model** field, choose **My Model**.
3. Choose the **Create My Model** action, to train model on your data.  

## <a name="AnchorText"> </a>Create and use your own predictive web service for late payment prediction

For [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, the model is published by Microsoft and connected to the Microsoft subscription. For other deployment options, you have to create Machine Learning resources in your own Azure subscription. You can find sample steps in the [sample repo](https://github.com/microsoft/BCTech/tree/master/samples/MachineLearning). The purpose of this task is to get the API URI and API key.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Late Payment Prediction Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **Use My Azure Subscription** check box.
3. On the **Use My Azure Subscription** FastTab, enter the API URL and API key for your model.

# Building [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports for displaying [!INCLUDE [prod_long](includes/prod_long.md)] data

You can make your [!INCLUDE[prod_long](includes/prod_long.md)] data available as a data source in [!INCLUDE [powerbi-desktop-name](includes/powerbi-desktop-name.md)] and build powerful reports about the state of your business.

This article describes how to start using [!INCLUDE [powerbi-desktop-name](includes/powerbi-desktop-name.md)] to create reports that display [!INCLUDE[prod_long](includes/prod_long.md)] data. After you create reports, you can publish them to your [!INCLUDE [powerbi-service-name](includes/powerbi-service-name.md)] or share them with all users in your organization. When the reports are in the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-service-name](includes/powerbi-service-name.md)], users with access can view the reports in [!INCLUDE[prod_long](includes/prod_long.md)].

## Get ready

- Sign up for the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-service-name](includes/powerbi-service-name.md)].

  If you aren't signed up, go to [https://powerbi.microsoft.com](https://powerbi.microsoft.com). When you sign up, use your work email address and password.

- Download [Power BI Desktop](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/desktop/).

  [!INCLUDE [powerbi-desktop-name](includes/powerbi-desktop-name.md)] is a free application you install on your local computer. Learn more at [Quickstart: Connect to data in Power BI Desktop](/power-bi/desktop-quickstart-connect-to-data).

- Make sure the data you want in the report is available as an API (recommended) or published as a web service. Learn more in [Expose data through API pages or OData web services](admin-powerbi-setup.md#exposedata).

<!--- For [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, get the following information:

  - The OData URL for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].
  
    Typically, this URL has the format `http[s]://[computer]:[port]/[serverinstance]/ODataV4`, for example, `https://localhost:7048/BC190/ODataV4`. If you have a multi-tenant deployment, include the tenant in the URL, for example, `https://localhost:7048/BC190/ODataV4?tenant=tenant1`.
  - A username and web service access key of a [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] account.

    To get data from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], Power BI uses basic authentication. So, you'll need a username and web service access key to connect. The account might be your own user account, or your organization may have a specific account for this purpose.-->

- Download the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] report theme (optional).

  Learn more in [Use the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] report theme](#theme) in this article.

[!INCLUDE[note-multicompany-reports](includes/note-multicompany-reports.md)]

## <a name="getdata"></a>Add [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] as a data source in Power BI Desktop

The first task in creating reports is to add [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] as a data source in [!INCLUDE [powerbi-desktop-name](includes/powerbi-desktop-name.md)]. Once connected, you can start to build the report.

1. Start [!INCLUDE [powerbi-desktop-name](includes/powerbi-desktop-name.md)].
1. Select **Get Data**.

    If you don't see **Get Data**, select the **File** menu, then **Get Data**.
1. On the **Get Data** page, select **Online Services**.
1. In the **Online Services** pane, do one of the following steps:

    - To connect to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, select **Dynamics 365 Business Central**, then **Connect**.
    <!--- To connect to  [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, select **Dynamics 365 Business Central (on-premises)**, then **Connect**.-->

1. Sign in to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] (one-time only).

    If you aren't signed in to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] from [!INCLUDE [powerbi-desktop-name](includes/powerbi-desktop-name.md)], you're prompted to sign in.

    - For [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, select **Sign in**, and then choose the relevant account. Use the same account that you use to sign into [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. When done, select **Connect**.

    <!--- For [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, first enter the OData URL for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], then select **OK**. When prompted, enter the username and password of the account to use for connecting to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. In the **Password** box, enter the web service access key. When done, select **Connect**.-->

    > [!NOTE]  
    > After you connect to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you won't be prompted again to sign in. [How do I change or clear the account I'm currently using to connect to Business Central from Power BI Desktop?](/dynamics365/business-central/power-bi-faq?tabs=designer#perms)

6. When connected, [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] contacts the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] service. The **Navigator** window displays the data sources that are available for building reports. Select a folder to expand it and show the available data sources.

   These data sources represent all APIs and web services that are published for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], grouped by environments and companies. With [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, **Navigator** has the following structure:

    - **Environment name**
      - **Company name**
        - **Advanced APIs**

          This folder lists advanced APIs published by Microsoft, like the [Business Central automation APIs](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/itpro-introduction-to-automation-apis) and APIs published by other organizations (these APIs are called Custom APIs). Custom APIs are further grouped in folders according to the [APIPublisher](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/properties/devenv-apipublisher-property)/[APIGroup](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/properties/devenv-apigroup-property) properties of the API source code.

        - **Standard APIs v2.0**

          This folder lists the data APIs exposed in the [Business Central API V2.0](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/api-reference/v2.0/). You use these APIs to read data from the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] database, such as master data (customer, vendor, item, and so on), transactions (general ledger entries, customer entries, and so on), or setup data (dimensions, payment methods, unit of measure, and so on).

        - **Web services \(legacy)**

          This folder lists pages, codeunits, and queries that are published as web services in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Using this legacy method to read data from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is discouraged. We suggest using APIs instead.

    <!--
    > [!NOTE]
    > The structure for Business Central on-premises is different because it doesn't support API pages.-->

7. Select the data source or sources that you want to add to your data model, and then select the **Load** button.
8. If later you want to add more Business Central data, you can repeat the previous steps.

Once the data is loaded, you can see it in the right navigation on the page. At this point, you're connected to your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] data, and you can begin building your [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] report.  

> [!TIP]
> For more information about using [!INCLUDE [powerbi-desktop-name](includes/powerbi-desktop-name.md)], go to [Get started with Power BI Desktop](/power-bi/fundamentals/desktop-getting-started).

## Creating accessible reports

It's important to make your reports usable for as many people as possible. Try to design reports so that they don't require any special adaptation to meet the specific needs of different users. Make sure the design lets users take advantage of assistive technologies, like screen readers. [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] includes various accessibility features, tools, and guidelines to help. To learn more, go to [Design Power BI reports for accessibility](/power-bi/create-reports/desktop-accessibility-creating-reports) in the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] documentation.

## Creating reports to display data associated with a list in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]

You can create reports that display in a FactBox on a [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] list page, and change when different rows are selected in the list. Creating these reports is similar to other reports, except there are a few things to do to make sure the reports display as expected. To learn more, go to [Creating Power BI Reports for Displaying List Data in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]](across-how-use-powerbi-reports-factbox.md).

## <a name="theme"></a>Using the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] report theme (optional)

Before building your report, we recommend that you download and import the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] theme file. The theme file creates a color palette so you can build reports with the same color styling as the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] apps, without requiring you to define custom colors for each visual.

> [!NOTE]
> This task is optional. You can always create your reports and then download and apply the style template later.

### Download the theme

The theme file is available as a json file on Microsoft Power BI Community Themes Gallery. To download the theme file, do the following steps:

1. Go to [Microsoft Power BI Community Themes Gallery for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central](https://community.powerbi.com/t5/Themes-Gallery/Microsoft-Dynamics-365-Business-Central/m-p/385875).
2. Select the download attachment **Microsoft Dynamics Business Central.json**.

### Import the theme on a report

After you download the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] report theme, you can import it to your reports. To import the theme, Select the **View** > **Themes** > **Browse for themes**. Learn more in [Power BI Desktop - Import custom report themes](/power-bi/create-reports/desktop-report-themes#import-custom-report-theme-files).

## Publish reports

After you create or modify a report, you can publish the report to your [!INCLUDE [powerbi-service-name](includes/powerbi-service-name.md)] and also share it with others in your organization. After you publish a report, it's available in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The report also becomes available for selection in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

To publish a report, select **Publish** on the **Home** tab of the ribbon or from the **File** menu. If you're signed into the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-service-name](includes/powerbi-service-name.md)], the report is published to this service. Otherwise, you're prompted to sign in. 

## Distribute or share a report

There are a couple of ways to share reports:

- Share a report from your [!INCLUDE [powerbi-service-name](includes/powerbi-service-name.md)] (recommended)

    If you have a [!INCLUDE [powerbi-pro-license-name](includes/powerbi-pro-license-name.md)] license or use [!INCLUDE [powerbi-premium-capacity-name](includes/powerbi-premium-capacity-name.md)], you can share the report directly from your [!INCLUDE [powerbi-service-name](includes/powerbi-service-name.md)]. To learn more, go to [Power BI - Share a dashboard or report](/power-bi/collaborate-share/service-share-dashboards#share-a-dashboard-or-report).

- Distribute reports as .pbix files.

    Reports are stored on your computer as .pbix files. You can distribute the .pbix file to users, like any other file. Then, the people you shared the file with can upload it to their [!INCLUDE [powerbi-service-name](includes/powerbi-service-name.md)]. To learn more, go to [Upload reports from files](across-working-with-powerbi.md#upload).

    > [!NOTE]
    > Distributing reports in this way means that refreshing data for reports is done individually by each user. This situation might impact [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] performance.

## How to develop cross-company or cross-environment [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports

The [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] API endpoints all have the prefix `https://api.businesscentral.dynamics.com/v2.0/<environment_name>/api/v2.0` followed by `/companies({company_id})/accounts({id})` (here we use the `accounts` API as an illustration). You can use this structure to create PowerQuery queries that load data for multiple companies or multiple environments if the user who is reading data can access them.

To set up a query to load data for multiple companies, follow these steps:

1. Take the PowerQuery query that loads data for a single company. Convert it to a custom Power Query function that takes the company ID (or maybe the environment name) as parameters. To learn more, go to [Using custom Power Query functions](/power-query/custom-function).
1. Now use the new custom function in a PowerQuery query, where you map the function over a list of companies and then merge the datasets using the [Table.Combine](/powerquery-m/table-combine) Power Query function.

## <a name="advancedopts"></a>Advanced: Customize language, timeout, database replica, or page size for your Business Central data source

The [!INCLUDE [powerbi-connector-name](includes/powerbi-connector-name.md)] supports several advanced properties for connecting to a Business Central data source that you can set in your Power Query queries. The following table describes the parameters.

|Parameter|Description|Default|Learn more at|
|-|-|-|-|
|AcceptLanguage|This parameter allows you to specify preferred languages for responses, ensuring users receive messages and translatable strings in their desired language. It sets the language in which the Business Central API session runs. It influences the language of error messages, formatted values in AL, and other values that depend on language or culture.<br><br>Setting this parameter improves user satisfaction and makes the data more accessible and relevant.|*not specified*|[Use locale values in multiple-language Power BI reports](/power-bi/guidance/multiple-language-locale#load-a-report-in-power-bi).|
|ODataMaxPageSize|This parameter limits the number of entities per results page, which allows for more flexibility when connecting to large datasets or using complex queries. It sets the maximum number of records to return for each page when calling an API. For example, if your table **Customers** has 13,000 records and ODataMaxPageSize is set to 5000, Power BI makes 3 API calls to get your customers. The first call gets 5,000 records, the next one gets 5000 more, and the last call gets the remaining 3000.

## Fixing problems

### "Expression.Error: The environment 'Production' does not exist." error when specifying a Business Central environment

> **APPLIES TO:** [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online

When you connect to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online from [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)], or when you install a [!INCLUDE [powerbi-desktop-name](includes/powerbi-desktop-name.md)] app from Microsoft AppSource that uses [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] data, you might be prompted to input the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] environment you want to connect to.

If you get an error similar to "Expression.Error: The environment 'Production' does not exist.", follow these steps to troubleshoot:

1. Make sure you're using the right credentials to access [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. These credentials might not be the same credentials you use to access [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)]. [How do I change or clear the account I'm currently using to connect to Business Central from Power BI Desktop?](/dynamics365/business-central/power-bi-faq?tabs=designer#perms)
2. If your environment is an embedded ISV environment, you need to specify the embedded ISV name in parenthesis as part of the environment name. For example, if you want to connect to an environment named Production from the embedded ISV named Fabrikam, you must specify "PRODUCTION (fabrikam)" as environment name.

### "Can't insert a record. Current connection intent is Read-Only." error connecting to custom API page

> **APPLIES TO:** Business Central online

By default, reports that use [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] data connect to a read-only replica of the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] database. In rare cases, depending on the API design, you might get an error when you try to connect to and get data from the API. The error looks like this:

`Dynamics365BusinessCentral: Request failed: The remote server returned an error: (400) Bad Request. (Can't insert a record. Current connection intent is Read-Only. CorrelationId: [...])".`

If you're using a custom API, we recommend you rework the AL code to make sure it doesn't make database modifications when it's just reading data. But in case your scenario requires it, you can [configure the connector to use a read-write connection instead](#advancedopts).

# Revalue Fixed Assets

Revaluation of fixed assets can consist of appreciations, write-downs, or general value adjustments.

When the value of a fixed asset increases, you post a journal line with appreciation to the depreciation book. The new amount is recorded as appreciation according to the fixed asset posting setup.

When the value of a fixed asset decreases, you post a journal line with a lower amount, a write-down, to the depreciation book. The new amount is recorded as a write-down according to the fixed asset posting setup.

Indexation is used to adjust multiple fixed asset values, for example per general price changes. The **Index Fixed Assets** batch job can be used to change various amounts, such as write-down and appreciation amounts.

## To post appreciation from the fixed asset G/L journal

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **FA G/L Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Create an initial journal line and fill in the fields as necessary.
3. In the **FA Posting Type** field, select **Revaluation**.
4. Choose the **Insert FA Bal. Account** action. A second journal line is created for the balancing account that is set up for appreciation posting.

    > [!NOTE]  
    >   Step 4 only works if you have set up the following: On the **FA Posting Group Card** page for the posting group of the fixed asset, the **Appreciation Account** field contains the general ledger debit account and the **Appreciation Bal. Account** field contains the general ledger account to which you want to post balancing entries for appreciation. For more information, see [To set up fixed asset posting groups](fa-how-setup-general.md#to-set-up-fixed-asset-posting-groups).  
5. Choose the **Post** action.

## To post a write-down from the fixed asset G/L journal

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **FA G/L Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Create an initial journal line, and fill in the fields as necessary.
3. In the **FA Posting Type** field, select **Write-Down**.
4. Choose the **Insert FA Bal. Account** action. A second journal line is created for the balancing account that is set up for write-down posting.

    > [!NOTE]  
    >   Step 4 only works if you have set up the following: On the **FA Posting Group Card** page for the posting group of the fixed asset, the **Write-Down Account** field contains the general ledger credit account and the **Write-Down Expense Account** field contains the general ledger debit account to which you want to post balancing entries for write-downs. For more information, see [To set up fixed asset posting groups](fa-how-setup-general.md#to-set-up-fixed-asset-posting-groups).
5. Choose the **Post** action.

## To perform general revaluation of fixed assets

Indexation is used to adjust multiple fixed asset values, for example per general price changes. The **Index Fixed Assets** batch job can be used to change various amounts, such as write-down and appreciation amounts. The **Allow Indexation** checkbox on the **Depreciation Book** page must be selected.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Index Fixed Assets**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary.
3. Choose the **OK** button.

    Revaluation lines are created per your settings in step 2. The lines are created in either the fixed asset journal or the fixed asset G/L journal, depending on your template and batch setup on the **FA Journal Setup** page. For more information, see [Set Up General Fixed Asset Information](fa-how-setup-general.md).
4. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **FA G/L Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
5. Select the journal with the fixed assets that you want to revalue, and then choose the **Ledger Entries** action.  
6. Check the created entries, and then choose the **Post** action to post the journal.

    > [!TIP]  
    >   If the index figures are for simulation purposes only, you can create a special depreciation book to store them in. Then these entries will not affect any of the other depreciation books.

## To post other acquisition costs

You post other acquisition cost for a fixed asset from a purchase invoice or from a fixed asset journal in the same way as you post the original acquisition cost. For more information, see [Acquire Fixed Assets](fa-how-acquire.md).  

If depreciation is already calculated for the fixed asset, select the **Depr. Acquisition Cost** checkbox to have the other acquisition cost less the salvage value depreciated in proportion to the amount by which the previously acquired fixed asset is depreciated. This method ensures that the depreciation period isn't changed.  

The depreciation percentage is calculated as:  

*P = (total depreciation x 100) / depreciable basis*

*Depreciation amount = (P/100) x (extra acquisition cost - salvage value)*  

Remember to select the **Depr. until FA Posting Date** checkbox on the invoice, the fixed asset G/L journal, or the fixed asset journal lines to ensure that depreciation is calculated from the last fixed asset posting date to the posting date of the other acquisition cost.

### Example - Posting Other Acquisition Costs

A machine is purchased on August 1, 2000. The acquisition cost is 4,800. The depreciation method is straight-line over four years.

On August 31, 2000, the **Calculate Depreciation** batch job is run. Depreciation is calculated as:

*book value x number of depreciation days / total number of depreciation days = 4800 x 30 / 1440 = 100*  

On September 15, 2000, an invoice is posted for painting the machine. The invoice amount is 480.

If you selected the **Depr. until FA Posting Date** checkbox on the invoice before posting, the following calculation is made:  

15 days of depreciation (from 09/01/00 to 09/15/00) is calculated as:

*book value x number of depreciation days / remaining number of depreciation days = (4800 - 100) x 15 / 1410 = 50*

If you selected the **Depr. Acquisition Cost** checkbox on the invoice before posting, the following calculation is made:  

*The other acquisition cost is depreciated as ((150 x 100) / 4800) / 100 x 480 = 15*

The depreciable basis is now *5280 = (4800 + 480)*, and the accumulated depreciation is *165 = (100 + 50 + 15)*, corresponding to 45 days of depreciation of the total acquisition cost. This calculation means that the asset is totally depreciated within the estimated lifetime of four years.  

When the **Calculate Depreciation** batch job is run on 09/30/00, the following calculation is made:  

*Remaining depreciable life is 3 years, 10 months, and 15 days = 1395 days*  

*Book value is (5280 - 165) = 5115*  

*Depreciation amount for September 2000: 5115 x 15 / 1395 = 55.00*  

*Total of depreciation = 165 + 55 = 220*  

If you didn't select the **Depr. until FA Posting Date** checkbox, the asset would lose 15 days of depreciation because the **Calculate Depreciation** batch job run on 09/30/00 would calculate depreciation from 09/15/00 to 09/30/00. This means that when the **Calculate Depreciation** batch job is run on 09/30/00, the calculation is as follows:  

*Remaining life time is 3 years, 10 months, and 15 days = 1395 days*  

*Book value is (4800 + 480 - 100 - 15) = 5165*

*Depreciation amount for September 2000: 5165 x 15 / 1395 = 55.54*  

*Total of depreciation = 100 + 15 + 55.54 = 170.54*

# Design Details: Planning Assignment Table
All items should be planned for, however, there is no reason to calculate a plan for an item unless there has been a change in the demand or supply pattern since the last time a plan was calculated.  

If the user has entered a new sales order or changed an existing one, there is reason to recalculate the plan. Other reasons include a change in forecast or the desired safety stock quantity. Changing a bill of material by adding or removing a component would most likely indicate a change, but for the component item only.  

For multiple locations, the assignment takes place at the level of item per location combination. If, for example, a sales order has been created at only one location, application will assign the item at that specific location for planning.  

The reason for selecting items for planning is a matter of system performance. If no change in an item’s demand-supply pattern has occurred, the planning system will not suggest any actions to be taken. Without the planning assignment, the system would have to perform the calculations for all items in order to find out what to plan for, and that would drain system resources.  

The **Planning Assignment** table monitors demand and supply events and assigns the appropriate items for planning. The following events are monitored:  

* A new sales order, forecast, component, purchase order, production order, assembly order, or transfer order.  
* Change of item, quantity, location, variant, or date on a sales order, forecast, component, purchase order, production order, assembly order, or transfer order.  
* Cancellation of a sales order, forecast, component, purchase order, production order, assembly order, or transfer order.  
* Consumption of items other than planned.  
* Output of items other than planned.  
* Unplanned changes in inventory.  

For these direct supply-demand displacements, the order tracking and action messaging system maintains the Planning Assignment table and states a planning reason as an action message.  

The following changes in master data can also cause a planning imbalance:  

* Change of status to Certified in the production BOM header (for all items using that header).  
* Deleted line (child item).  
* Change of status to Certified in the routing header (for all items using that routing).  
* Changes in the following item card fields.  
* Safety Stock Quantity or Safety Lead Time.  
* Lead Time Calculation.  
* Reorder Point.  
* Production BOM No. (and all children of old BOM reference).  
* Routing No.  
* Reordering Policy.  

In these cases, a new function, Planning Assignment Management, maintains the table and states the planning reason as Net Change.  

The following changes do not cause a planning assignment:  

* Calendars  
* Other planning parameters on the item card  

When calculating an MPS or an MRP, the following restrictions apply:  

* MPS: The planning system checks that the item carries a demand forecast or a sales order. If not, the item is not included in the plan.  
* MRP: If the planning system detects that the item is being replenished by an MPS planning line or MPS supply order, the item will be left out of the planning. However, any demand from relevant components is included.

# Consolidate financial data from multiple companies

Some organizations use [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in multiple business units or legal entities. Others use [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in subsidiaries that must report into parent organizations. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] gives accountants tools that help them transfer general ledger entries from two or more companies (subsidiaries) into a consolidated company.  

Each company involved in a consolidation is called a business unit. The company in which you combine the data is called the consolidated company.  

You can transfer financial data from subsidiaries to the consolidated company, even if the subsidiaries use [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in different environments. To learn more about how to connect to other environments, go to [Set Up Company Consolidation](finance-consolidated-company-reporting-setup.md#busunit).

If the financial statements of a business unit use a different currency than the consolidated company, you must set up exchange rates for consolidation. To learn more about exchange rates for consolidations, go to [Set Up Company Consolidation](finance-consolidated-company-reporting-setup.md#exchrates).  

You can consolidate:  

* Across companies that have different charts of accounts.  
* Companies that use different fiscal years and different currencies.  
* Either the full amount or a percentage of a company's financial information.
* Using different currency exchange rates in individual G/L accounts.
* Companies in other accounting and business management programs.
* Companies in different [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] environments.

You set up the consolidated company in the same way that you set up other companies. The chart of accounts is independent of the chart of accounts in the business units. The chart of accounts in the business units can differ from one another. To learn more about setting up a consolidation, go to [Set Up Company Consolidation](finance-consolidated-company-reporting-setup.md).  

> [!TIP]
> Consolidating financial data can be especially relevant for intercompany processes. To learn more about intercompany features, go to [Managing Intercompany Transactions](intercompany-manage.md).

## Consolidate data

Before you consolidate, it's a good idea to test your data before you transfer it to the consolidated company. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] looks for differences in the information in the business units and the consolidated company. For example, whether account numbers or dimension codes are different. Correct any errors you find before you run the report. You can test the database or, if you're importing data from an XML file, the file.

### Test the data before you consolidate

1. Open the consolidated company.  
2. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Business Units**, and then choose the related link.  
3. Test the file and database, as follows:  

    * To test a file, choose the **Test File** action, enter the name of the file to test, and then choose **Print**.  
    * To test the database, choose **Test Database**.  

### Run the consolidation

After you've tested the data, you can transfer it to the consolidated company. An assisted setup guide will help you through the process.

> [!NOTE]
> When you run the consolidation you can choose the companies to include. If your consolidated company doesn't have access to one or more subsidiaries, the guide will let you grant access to them.

1. Sign in to the consolidated company.  
2. On the **Business Units** page, choose the **Consolidate** action.  
3. Fill in the required fields.  

## Use the Consolidated Trial Balance report

The **Consolidated Trial Balance** report can give you an overview of the overall financial health of your business. The report combines general ledger entries from each of your companies in a new company that you created for the consolidated data. The consolidated company is just a container for the consolidated data, and doesn't have any live business data. The companies that you include in the consolidated company become **Business Units** in the report. If you have four business units or fewer, you can also use the **Consolidated Trial Balance (4)** report.  

The report shows a line for each account, and follows the structure of the chart of accounts. An account isn't shown if all the amounts on the line are 0. The report shows the following information for each account:

* The account number and the name of the account.
* The totals for the consolidated company and for each business unit. Totals can display either as a net change or the balance to date.
* The eliminations made in the consolidated company. Eliminations always show for a period corresponding to the consolidated company's fiscal year.
* The total for the consolidated company after the eliminations show either as a net change or the balance to date.

## Eliminate repeated transactions

After you consolidate the companies, you must find and eliminate any transactions that are recorded more than once across companies. Processing consolidation eliminations is a manual process.  

To eliminate repeated transactions:

1. Find transactions that might need to be adjusted, and enter general journal lines to eliminate them.
2. Run the **G/L Consolidation Eliminations** report to help you assess the effect of the general journal lines before posting.
3. Post the adjusting transactions.

The **G/L Consolidation Eliminations** report displays a tentative trial balance where you can simulate the consequences of eliminating entries. The report compares the entries in the consolidated company with the eliminations entered in the general journal.

Before you can include a business unit in the report, you must set up the unit on the **Business Units** page. Make sure to turn on the **Consolidate** toggle.

A line is created for each account, following the structure of the chart of accounts. An account isn't shown if all amounts on the line are 0. The report shows the following information for each account:

* Account number.
* Account name.
* If you selected one or more business unit codes in the **Business Unit Code** field on the request page, a total shown for the consolidated company excludes the selected business units and eliminations. If you didn't fill in **Business Unit Code** field, the total for the consolidated company excludes eliminations.
* If you selected a business unit code in the **Business Unit Code** field on the request page, a total shows for the imported entries from the business unit. If you didn't fill in the **Business Unit Code** field, a total shows for the posted eliminations in the consolidated company.
* The total for the consolidated company with all the business units and all posted eliminations.
* The eliminations to make in the consolidated company. That is, the entries in the general journal that is selected on the request page.
* The posting text copied from the general journal.
* The consolidated company's total after the eliminations, if they're posted.

## Export and import consolidated data between databases

If data for a business unit is in another database, you can do a manual file-based transfer or automate the process by using an API. To learn more about the API, go to [Use our API to automatically share data across environments](#use-our-api-to-automatically-share-data-across-environments).

This section describes the manual, file-based process.

You export the data to a file before you include it in the consolidation. Export each company separately by using the **Export Consolidation** batch job.  

> [!TIP]
> Use the same process to export consolidated data that you must submit to Dynamics 365 Finance. For example, if the business unit is a subsidiary and the parent company uses Dynamics 365 Finance.

After you run the batch job, all entries in general ledger accounts are processed. For every combination of selected dimensions and date, the contents of the entries' **Amount** fields are totaled and exported. The next combination of the selected dimensions and date with the same account number is processed. Then the combinations in the next account number are processed, and so on.  

The exported entries contain the following fields: **Account No.**, **Posting Date**, and **Amount**. If dimensions information was also exported, dimension codes and dimension values are also included.  

1. For each exported line, if the total of the **Amount** fields is a debit, the account number that is set up in the business unit's **Consol. Debit Acc.** field is exported to the line. If the total is a credit, the corresponding number in the **Consol. Credit Acc.** field is exported to the line.  
2. The date used for each exported line is either the period's ending date or, if the transfer occurs each day, the exact date of the calculation.  
3. The dimension value exported for the entry will be the consolidated company dimension value that is specified in the **Consolidation Code** field for that dimension value. If a consolidated company dimension value hasn't been entered in the **Consolidated Code** field for the dimension value, the dimension value itself will be exported to the line.  
4. The XML files also contain the currency exchange rates in the consolidation period. These rates are included in a separate section at the beginning of the file.  

## Use our API to automatically share data across environments

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides an API that let's you automate the process of sharing financial data from business units to the consolidated company. The API is free to use and easy to set up. It even let's you share data across [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] environments. For example, you might need to share across environments when business units are not in the same Azure geographies. To learn more about using the API to automate the consolidation process, go to [Set Up Company Consolidation](finance-consolidated-company-reporting-setup.md#busunit).

# Work with assembly BOMs

You use assembly bills of materials (BOMs) to structure parent items that must be assembled from components with little to no resource use. An assembly BOM can be used, for example, to sell a parent item as a kit consisting of component items.

Use assembly orders to make finished items from components in a process that one or more basic resources can perform, which aren't machine or work centers, or without any resources. For example, an assembly process could be to pick two wine bottles and one coffee sack and pack them as a gift item.  

An assembly BOM is the master data that defines which component items go into an assembled end item and which resources are used to assemble the assembly item. When you enter an assembly item and a quantity on an assembly order, the assembly order lines are filled in according to the assembly BOM. The order has one assembly order line per component or resource. Learn more at [Assembly Management](assembly-assemble-items.md).

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] also supports production BOMs. Production BOMs differ from assembly BOMs because they involve more complex procedures, such as resource usage, production routing, and work or machine centers. Learn more about the differences at [Work with Bills of Material](inventory-how-work-BOMs.md) and [Create Production BOMs](production-how-to-create-production-boms.md).

## To create an assembly BOM

To define an item that consists of other items, and perhaps the resources that assemble the item, you must create an assembly BOM.  

Assembly BOMs can have multiple levels, which means that a component on the assembly BOM can be an assembly item itself. In that case, the **Assembly BOM** field on the assembly BOM line contains **Yes**.

Special requirements apply to items on assembly BOMs regarding availability. Learn more at [To see the availability of an item by its use in assembly BOMs](inventory-how-availability-overview.md#to-view-the-availability-of-an-item-by-its-use-in-assembly-or-production-boms).

There are two parts to creating an assembly BOM:

- Setting up a new item.
- Defining the BOM structure of the assembly item.

1. Set up a new item. Learn more at [Register New Items](inventory-how-register-new-items.md).

   Proceed to enter components or resources on the assembly BOM.  
2. On the **Item Card** page for an assembly item, choose the **Assembly** action, then choose the **Assembly BOM** action.
3. On the **Assembly BOM** page, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

> [!TIP]
> Assembly items can have variants, just like any other item, which helps you keep your list of products shorter. Learn more about the feature at [Manage Product Variants](inventory-item-variants.md).

## To edit assembly BOMs

You can edit the lines on an assembly BOM at any time. However, the BOM might be in use by ongoing sales or assemblies of the parent. Changing the BOM might affect those activities. Choose the **Where-Used** action to explore the items that use it and whether sales or assembly orders might be affected.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **Yes** value in the **Assembly BOM** column.
3. On the **Assembly BOM** page, choose the **Edit List** action, then change any field as needed.

## To view components and resources indented according to the BOM structure

From the **Assembly BOM** page, you can open a separate page that shows the components and any resources indented according to their BOM position under the assembly item.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, then choose the related link.
2. Open the card for an assembly item. (The **Assembly BOM** field on the **Items** page contains **Yes**.)
3. On the **Item Card** page, choose the **Assembly** action, then choose the **Assembly BOM** action.
4. On the **Assembly BOM** page, choose the **Show BOM** action.

## To replace the assembly item with its components on document lines

From any sales and purchase document that contains an assembly item, you can use a special action to replace the line for the assembly item with new lines for its components. This action is useful, for example, if you want to sell the components as a kit that represents the assembly item.

The **Explode BOM** action is also available on the **Assembly BOM** page as a way to view subassembly items on an assembly BOM.

> [!CAUTION]  
> When you have used the **Explode BOM** action, you can't easily undo it. You must delete the sales order lines for the components and then reenter a sales order line for the assembly item.

The following procedure is based on a sales invoice. The same steps apply to other sales documents and all purchase documents.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Invoices**, then choose the related link.
2. Open a sales invoice that contains a line for an assembly item.
3. Choose the line for an assembly item, then **Explode BOM** line action.

All fields on the sales invoice line for the assembly item are cleared except for the **Item** and **Description** fields. Complete sales invoice lines are inserted for the components and possible resources that comprise the assembly item.

> [!NOTE]
> The **Picking List by Order** report is also changed to show the components only. This means that a warehouse worker picking the parent item, the assembly item, will not see it in the picking list. Learn more at [Print the Picking List](sales-how-print-picking-list.md).

## To calculate the standard cost of an assembly item

You calculate the unit cost of an assembly item by rolling up the unit cost of each component and resource in the item's assembly BOM.

The unit cost of an assembly BOM always equals the total of the unit costs of its components, including other assembly BOMs, and any resources.  

> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE [bom-standard-cost](includes/bom-standard-cost.md)]

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Items**, then choose the related link.
2. Open the card for an assembly item. (The **Assembly BOM** field on the **Items** page contains **Yes**.)
3. On the **Item Card** page, choose the **Assembly BOM** action.
4. On the **Assembly BOM** page, choose the **Calc. Standard Cost** action.
5. Select one of the following options, then choose the **OK** button.

|Option |Description |
|-------|------------|
|**Top Level**|Calculates the assembly item's standard cost as the total cost of all purchased or assembled items on that assembly BOM regardless of any underlying assembly BOMs.|
|**All Levels**|Calculates the assembly's item standard cost as the sum of:</br></br>* The calculated cost of all underlying assembly BOMs on the assembly BOM.</br>* The cost of all purchased items on the assembly BOM.|

The costs of the items that make up the assembly BOM are copied from the component item cards. The cost of each item is multiplied by the quantity, and the total cost is shown in the **Unit Cost** field on the item card.

You can also calculate and update the standard cost for one or many items on the **Standard Cost Worksheet** page. Learn more at [Update Standard Costs](finance-about-calculating-standard-cost.md#updating-standard-costs-with-standard-cost-worksheet).

# Setting up cash flow analysis

If you want some help to decide what to do with your cash, have a look at the charts on the Accountant Role Center:

* **Cash Cycle**  
* **Income & Expense**  
* **Cash Flow**  
* **Cash Flow Forecasts**  

This article describes where the data in the charts comes from and, if necessary, what to do to start using the charts.
<br><br>  

> [!Video https://learn-video.azurefd.net/vod/player?id=4ecab63b-f107-4666-b88f-656a133a0f78]

## The Cash Cycle and Income & Expense charts

The **Cash Cycle** and **Income & Expense** charts are ready to go, based on the Chart of Accounts and financial reports. The accounts are where the data comes from, and financial reports calculate the relationship between sales and receivables. Some accounts and financial reports are provided. You can use them as-is, change them, and add new ones. If you add G/L accounts to your chart of accounts, for example, by importing them from QuickBooks, map the accounts on the **Financial Reports** page for the following reports:

| Financial report name | Where it's used |
| --- | --- |
| **I_CACYCLE** |Cash Cycle |
| **I_CASHFLOW** |Cash Flow |
| **I_INCEXP** |Income & Expense |
| **I_MINTRIAL** |As an income statement if you don't use the chart of accounts |

> [!NOTE]
> It's a good idea to keep the calculations that are provided for the financial report.

Enter accounts in the **Totaling** field for **Total Revenue**, **Total Receivables**, **Total Payables**, and **Total Inventory**. To map to a range of accounts, enter the account numbers separated by ".." as in **1111..4444**. Alternately, to map to specific accounts, enter the account numbers separated by a vertical bar as in **2222|3333|5555**.  

> [!TIP] 
> Verify your mapping by choosing the **Overview** action.  

## Set up the Cash Flow chart

The Cash Flow chart is based on:  

* A chart of cash flow accounts.
* One or more cash flow setups. These setups specify the accounts to use for general ledger, purchases, sales, services, and fixed assets.  

To help you get going, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides some accounts and cash flow setups. You can add, change, or remove them.  

To set up the accounts, search for **Chart of Cash Flow Accounts**, choose the link, and then fill in the fields. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)] Repeat these steps for **Cash Flow Setup**.

## Set up cash flow forecasts

The **Cash Flow Forecast** chart uses cash flow accounts, cash flow setups, and cash flow forecasts. Some are provided, however, you can set up your own by using an assisted setup guide. The guide helps you specify things like:

* When to update the forecast
* Which accounts to base it on
* When you pay taxes
* Whether to turn on [Azure AI](https://azure.microsoft.com/overview/ai-platform/).  

Cash flow forecasts can use Azure AI to create a more comprehensive forecast. The connection to Azure AI is already set up for you. You just need to turn it on. When you sign in to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], a notification displays in a blue bar and provides a link to the default cash flow setup. The notification displays only once. If you close it, but then decide to turn on Azure AI, you can use the assisted setup guide or a manual process.  

> [!NOTE]
>
> Alternatively, you can use your own predictive web service. For more information, see [Create and use your own predictive web service for cash flow forecasts](#AnchorText).  

To use the assisted setup guide:  

1. In the Accountant Role Center, under the **Cash Flow Forecast** chart, choose the **Open Assisted Setup** action.
2. Fill in the fields in each step of the guide. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
3. Back in the Accountant Role Center, choose the **Recalculate Forecast** action under the **Cash Flow Forecast** chart.

To use a manual process:  

1. In the Accountant Role Center, choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Cash Flow Setup**, then choose the related link.
2. Expand the **Azure AI** FastTab, then choose the **Azure AI Enabled** field.
3. Back in the Accountant Role Center, choose the **Recalculate Forecast** action under the **Cash Flow Forecast** chart.

> [!TIP]  
> Consider the length of the periods that the service will use in its calculations. The more data you provide, the more accurate the predictions will be. Also, watch out for large variances in periods. They will also impact predictions. If Azure AI does not find enough data, or the data varies a lot, the service will not make a prediction.  

## Design details

Subscriptions for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] come with access to several predictive web services in all regions where [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is available. Learn more at the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central Licensing Guide. The guide is available for download on the [Business Central](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/business-central/overview/) website.

These web services are stateless, meaning they use data only to calculate predictions on demand. They don't store data.

> [!NOTE]
>
> You can use your own predictive web service instead of ours. For more information, see [Create and use your own predictive web service for cash flow forecasts](#AnchorText).

### Data required for forecast

To make predictions about future revenue and expenses, web services require historical data from receivables, payables, and taxes.

#### Receivables

**Due Date**, **Amount (LCY)** fields of the **Customer Ledger Entries** page, where:

* The document type is *Invoice* or *Credit Memo*.
* The due date is between date that is calculated based on the values in the **Historical Periods** and **Period Type** fields on the **Cash Flow Setup** page and the work date.

Before it uses the predictive web-service, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] compresses transactions by **Due Date** based on the value in the **Period Type** field on the **Cash Flow Setup** page.

#### Payables

**Due Date**, **Amount (LCY)** fields on the **Vendor Ledger Entries** page, where:

* The document type is *Invoice* or *Credit Memo*.
* The due date is between date that is calculated based on values in the **Historical Periods** and **Period Type** fields on the **Cash Flow Setup** page and the work date.

Before it uses the predictive web-service, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] compresses transactions by **Due Date** based on the value in the **Period Type** field on the **Cash Flow Setup** page.

#### Tax

**Document Date**, **Amount** fields on the **VAT (Tax) Ledger Entries** page, where:

* The document type is *sales*.
* The document date is between the date that is calculated based on values in the **Historical Periods** and **Period Type** fields on the **Cash Flow Setup** page and the work date.

Before it uses the predictive web-service, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] compresses transactions by **Document Date** based on value in the **Period Type** field in the **Cash Flow Setup** page.

## <a name="AnchorText"></a>Create and use your own predictive web service for cash flow forecasts

For [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, the model is published by Microsoft and connected to the Microsoft subscription. For other deployment options, you have to create Machine Learning resources in your own Azure subscription. You can find sample steps in the [sample repo](https://github.com/microsoft/BCTech/tree/master/samples/MachineLearning). The purpose of this task is to get the API URI and API key.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Cash Flow Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Expand the **Azure AI** FastTab, and then fill in the fields, including the API URL and API key provided from Azure Machine Learning studio. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
3. In the Accountant Role Center, choose the **Recalculate Forecast** action under the **Cash Flow Forecast** chart.

# Control Access to Business Central Using Security Groups

[!INCLUDE[azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id](~/../shared-content/shared/azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id.md)]

Security groups make it easier for administrators to manage user permissions. For example, for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, they're reusable across Dynamics 365 applications, such as SharePoint Online, CRM Online, and [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Administrators add permissions to their [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] security groups, and when they add users to the group the permissions apply to all members. For example, an administrator can create a [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] security group that gives salespeople the ability to create and post sales orders. Or, let purchasers do the same for purchase orders.

> [!NOTE]
> This article describes how to grant certain permissions to users based on their membership of a security group. To control whether users can access an environment based on their membership of a security group, see [Manage Access to Environments](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/tenant-admin-center-manage-access).

## Business Central online and on-premises

You can use security groups for the online and on-premises versions of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Depending on your version, create groups in one of the following ways:

* For the online version, use Microsoft Entra security groups. To learn more about creating the group, go to [Create, edit, or delete a security group in the Microsoft 365 admin center](/microsoft-365/admin/email/create-edit-or-delete-a-security-group).
* For on-premises, security groups are only supported if the deployment is using Windows authentication. To create security groups for on-premises, use Windows Active Directory groups. To learn more, go to [Create a Group Account in Windows Active Directory](/windows/security/operating-system-security/network-security/windows-firewall/create-a-group-account-in-active-directory). 

Afterward, create a corresponding security group in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], and then link it to the group you created. To learn more, go to [Add a security group in Business Central](#add-a-security-group-in-business-central).

> [!NOTE]
> If you've set up a special type of user with a Windows Group license type in a version of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-prem that's earlier than 2023 release wave 1, when you upgrade [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] converts the user to a security group. The new security group has the same name as the Windows group name. The security group gives you a better overview of the group members and their effective permissions.

## Add a security group in Business Central

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature 1.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Security Groups**, and then choose the related link.
1. Choose **New** to create a group.
1. Create the link to your group, as follows:

    * For [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, choose the group in the **Microsoft Entra security group name** field.
    * For [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, choose the group in the **Windows group name** field.

> [!NOTE]
> The users show in the **Members** card on the FactBox pane or the **Security Group Members** page only if they're added as users in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. To learn more about adding users, go to [To add users or update user information and license assignments in Business Central](ui-how-users-permissions.md#adduser).  

### Assign permissions to a security group

1. On the **Security Groups** page, choose the group, and then choose the **Permissions** action.
1. Assign permissions in the following ways:

    * To assign permission sets individually, in the **Permission Set** field, choose the permissions to assign.
    * To assign multiple permission sets, choose the **Add multiple** action, and then choose the sets to assign.
1. If you want the permission sets to apply only to a specific company, set the **Company** column to that company. If you want the permission set to apply to all companies, leave the **Company** column blank. [Learn more](ui-define-granular-permissions.md#control-access-to-specific-companies).

## Review the permissions in a security group

On the **Security Groups** page, the FactBox pane shows the **Permission Sets** that are assigned to the group. Each user listed in the **Members** card has those permissions. The **Permission Set by Security Group** action provides a more detailed view. There you can also explore the individual permissions in each security group.

Permissions are also available on the **Users** page. The FactBox pane shows the **Permission Sets from Security Group** and **Security Group Memberships** cards for the selected user.

## Security groups and user groups

> [!NOTE]
> User groups will no longer be available in a future release.

Security groups are very similar to the user groups that are currently available. However, user groups are only relevant for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Security groups are based on groups in Microsoft Entra ID or Windows Active Directory, depending on whether you're using [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online or on-premises, respectively. Groups benefit administrators because they can use them with other Dynamics 365 apps. For example, if salespeople use [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and SharePoint, administrators don't have to recreate the group and its members.

### Optional: Convert user groups to permission sets

In 2023 release wave 1 and later, you can convert user groups to permission sets in your tenant. The permission sets provide the same functionality as user groups. Here are some examples:

* You can use the **Users** FactBox to manage permissions for users.
* You can drill down on the permission set name to add other permission sets to the set you're working on. To learn more, go to [To add other permission sets](ui-define-granular-permissions.md#to-add-other-permission-sets).

Use the **User Group Migration** assisted setup guide to convert your groups. To start the guide, on the **Feature Management** page, find **Feature: Convert user group permissions**, and then choose **All Users** in the **Enabled For** field. The assisted setup guide offers the following options for the conversion.

|Option  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|Assign to user     | Assign the permissions in user groups directly to the users who were assigned to the group, and remove their user group assignments.        |
|Convert to a permission set     | Create a new permission for the permissions in each user group. The new permission set is assigned to all members of each user group.          |

### License configurations still apply

You can configure permissions in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] based on licenses. Those permissions are directly assigned to new users. These configurations still apply, even if you start using security groups.

To use security groups exclusively, we recommend that you remove the license configurations. To learn more about license configurations, go to [Create Users According to Licenses](ui-how-users-permissions.md).

You can remove license configurations on the **License Configuration** page. Choose a license, and then delete all permission sets assigned to it.

# Moving Averages (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Moving Averages** report provides a comprehensive overview of your average purchases over a 30-day period. This report focuses on the purchase amount and compares the current purchase amount to a 30-day average. The comparison lets you quickly identify deviations from the norm. Use this information to address issues and ensure that purchasing activities align with business operations and profitability.

:::image type="content" source="media/purchases/purchases-moving-averages.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Moving Averages Power BI report" lightbox="media/purchases/purchases-moving-averages.png":::

## Use the report

The report helps management teams find key trends and make changes based on average purchase metrics.

CEOs need to track the moving average of purchase amounts over a specific period. Use this report to see performance trends and get help to make short term strategic decisions based on the trends.

Purchasing managers want to know which periods have a higher demand than others to plan purchasing schedules and budget accordingly. Use the report to analyze historical data and forecast upcoming trends so you can optimize inventory levels and reduce stock-outs.

For example, you might notice that purchasing demands are often higher towards the end of the year. You can work with your team to plan ahead and allocate staff to handle workload spikes.


## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The *Moving Averages* report includes the following KPIs and measures: 

- [**Purchase Amount**](purchases-powerbi-kpis.md#purchase-amount)
- [**Purchase Amount Average 30D**](purchases-powerbi-kpis.md#purchase-amount-avg-30d-fiscal)

# Design details: Inbound warehouse flow

The inbound flow in a warehouse begins when items arrive in the warehouse of the company location, either received from external sources or from another company location. You can receive physical and non-inventory items. To learn more about receiving non-inventory items, go to [Post non-inventory items](#post-non-inventory-items).

In principle, the process of receiving inbound orders consists of two activities:

* Receive items at the dock, identify them, match them to a source document, and record the received quantity.
* Put away items in stock, and record the place you put them.

The source documents for inbound warehouse flow are:

* Purchase orders  
* Inbound transfer orders  
* Sales return orders  

> [!NOTE]
> Production and assembly output also represent inbound source documents. Learn more about handling production and assembly output for internal processes at [Design Details: Internal Warehouse Flows](design-details-internal-warehouse-flows.md).  

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you receive items and put them away using one of four methods, as described in the following table.

|Method|Inbound Process|Require Receipts|Require Put-aways|Complexity Level (Learn more at [Warehouse Management Overview](design-details-warehouse-management.md))|  
|------------|---------------------|--------------|----------------|------------|  
|A|Post receipt and put-away from the order line|||No dedicated warehouse activity.|  
|B|Post receipt and put-away from an inventory put-away document||Turned on|Basic: Order-by-order.|  
|C|Post receipt and put-away from a warehouse receipt document|Turned on||Basic: Consolidated receive/ship posting for multiple orders.|  
|D|Post receipt from a warehouse receipt document and post put-away from a warehouse put-away document|Turned on|Turned on|Advanced|  

Selecting an approach depends on your company's practices and level of organizational complexity. The following are some examples that might help you decide.

* In an order-by-order warehouse environment, where most of the warehouse staff works directly with order documents, you might decide to use method A. 
* An order-by-order warehouse that has a more complex put-away process, or where warehouse staff separates their put-away activities from the order document, might use method B.
* Companies that need to plan the handling of multiple orders may find it helpful to use warehouse receipt documents, methods C and D.  

In methods A, B, and C, receiving and putting away are combined in one step when posting documents as received. In method D, the receipt is posted first to record the increase of inventory and that items are available for sale. The warehouse worker then registers the put-away to make the items available to pick for outbound orders. 

> [!NOTE]
> While warehouse put-aways and inventory put-aways sound similar, they're different documents and are used in different processes.
> * The inventory put-away used in method B, together with registering put-away information, also posts the receipt of the source document.
> * The warehouse put-away used in method D can't be posted and only registers the put-away. The registration makes the items available for the further processing but doesn't post the receipt. In the inbound flow, the warehouse put-away requires a warehouse receipt.

## No dedicated warehouse activity

The following articles provide information about how to process receipts for source documents if you don't have dedicated warehouse activities.

* [Record Purchases](purchasing-how-record-purchases.md)
* [Transfer Orders](inventory-how-transfer-between-locations.md)
* [Process Sales Return Orders](sales-how-process-sales-returns-orders.md)

## Basic warehouse configurations  

In a basic warehouse configuration, the **Require Put-away** toggle is turned on, but the **Require Receipt** toggle is turned off on the **Location Card** page for the location.

The following diagram illustrates the inbound warehouse flows by document type in basic warehouse configurations. The numbers in the diagram correspond with the steps in the sections following the diagram.  

:::image type="content" source="media/design_details_warehouse_management_inbound_basic_flow.png" alt-text="The basic inbound flow in a warehouse.":::

### 1: Release a source document to create a request for an inventory put-away  

When you receive items, release the source document, such as a purchase order or an inbound transfer order. Releasing the document makes the items available to be put away. You can also create inventory put-away documents for individual order lines, in a push fashion, based on bins and quantities to handle.  

### 2: Create an inventory put-away  

On the **Inventory Put-away** page, in a pull fashion, you can get the pending source document lines based on inbound warehouse requests. In a push fashion, you can also create inventory put-away lines when you create the source document.  

### 3: Post an inventory put-away  

On each line for items that have been put away, partially or fully, fill in the **Quantity** field and then post the inventory put-away. Source documents that are related to the inventory put-away are posted as received.  

* Positive item ledger entries are created.
* Warehouse entries are created for locations that require a bin code on all item transactions.
* The put-away request is deleted, if it's fully handled. For example, the **Quantity Received** field on the inbound source document line is updated.
* A posted receipt document is created that reflects the purchase order, for example, and the received items.  

## Advanced warehouse configurations  

To use an advanced warehouse configuration, turn on the **Require Receipt** toggle on the Location Card page for the location. The **Require Put-away** toggle is optional.

The following diagram illustrates the inbound warehouse flow by document type. The numbers in the diagram correspond with the steps in the sections following the diagram.  

:::image type="content" source="media/design_details_warehouse_management_inbound_advanced_flow.png" alt-text="The advanced inbound flow in a warehouse.":::

### 1: Release the source document  

When you receive items, release the source document, such as the purchase order or an inbound transfer order. Releasing the document makes the items available to be put away. The put away will contain references to the source document type and number.

### 2: Create a warehouse receipt  

On the **Warehouse Receipt** page, get the inbound source document lines. You can combine several source document lines in one warehouse receipt document. Fill in the **Qty. to Handle** field and select the receiving zone and bin, if necessary.  

### 3: Post the warehouse receipt  

Post the warehouse receipt to create positive item ledger entries. The **Quantity Received** field on the inbound source document line is updated.  

If the **Require Put-away** toggle is not turned on on the location card, this is where the process stops. Otherwise, posting the inbound source document makes the items available to be put away. The put away contains references the source document type and number.  

### 4: (Optional) Generate put-away worksheet lines

Get warehouse put-away lines in the **Put-away Worksheet** based on posted warehouse receipts or operations that produce output. On the lines you'll put-away, specify the following information:

* The bins to take items from.
* The bins to put items in.
* How many units to handle.

The bins can be predefined by the setup of the warehouse location or the resource that performed the operation.  

When all put-aways are planned and assigned to warehouse workers, generate the warehouse put-away documents. Fully assigned put-away lines are deleted from the **Put-away Worksheet**.  

> [!NOTE]  
> If the **Use Put-away Worksheet** toggle is not turned on on the location card, warehouse put-away documents are created directly based on posted warehouse receipts. In that case, this step isn't needed.  

### 5: Create a warehouse put-away document

Create a warehouse put-away document in a pull fashion, based on the posted warehouse receipt. Alternatively, create the warehouse put-away document and assign it to a warehouse worker in a push fashion.  

### 6: Register a warehouse put-away

On each line for items that have been put away, partially or fully, fill in the **Quantity** field on the **Warehouse Put-away** page, and then register the warehouse put-away.  

* Warehouse entries are created for locations that require a bin code on all item transactions.
* The warehouse put-away lines are deleted, if they're fully handled.
* The warehouse put-away document remains open until you register the full quantity of the related posted warehouse receipt.
* The **Qty. Put Away** field on posted warehouse receipt order lines is updated.

# Integrate with Microsoft Dataverse via data sync

Business apps often use data from more than one source. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] combines data into a single set of logic that makes it easier to connect [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to other Dynamics 365 applications. For example, [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] or your own application built on [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)]. To learn more about [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)], go to [What is Dataverse?](/powerapps/maker/common-data-service/data-platform-intro).

The following steps provide an overview of the steps to integrate [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

> [!Note]  
> These tasks require the **System Administrator** security role in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

1. Assign licenses for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] to the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] users who will use the integrated apps.

2. Set up a connection to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)]. For more information, see [Connect to Dataverse](admin-how-to-set-up-a-dynamics-crm-connection.md).  

3. Synchronize data between the apps. For more information, see [Synchronizing Business Central and Dataverse](admin-synchronizing-business-central-and-sales.md). 

## Get started with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)]

To get started with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)], you'll need a Microsoft Power Apps account. If you don't already have a Power Apps account, you can get one for free by visiting [powerapps.com](https://make.powerapps.com/?utm_source=padocs&utm_medium=linkinadoc&utm_campaign=referralsfromdoc) and choosing the **Get started free** link. To learn more about how to get started with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)], go to the [Get started with Dataverse](/training/modules/get-started-with-powerapps-common-data-service/) module from Microsoft training.

## Bi-directional or uni-directional data synchronization

You can synchronize data either to or from one Dynamics 365 business app to another, or in both directions in near-real time, through [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)]. For example, if you integrate [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)], a salesperson can create a sales order in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] and the order synchronizes to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Conversely, from [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)], the salesperson can check the availability of the item on the order in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. 

## Standard and custom entities

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] securely stores data in a set of tables, which are sets of records similar to how a table stores data within a database. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] includes a base set of standard tables that cover typical scenarios, but you can also create custom tables specific to your organization. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can view standard and custom tables being synchronized on the Integration Table Mappings page.

## About the Business Central Base Integration Solution

The Base Integration Solution is a key component of the integration. The solution adds the required roles and access levels to the user accounts for the integration, and it creates tables needed to map [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] company to business unit in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)]. 

By default, the **Set up [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] connection** assisted setup guide imports the solution. To do that, the setup guide uses an administrator user account that you specify. This account must be a valid user in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] with the **System Administrator** security role.  

To learn more about user accounts, go to the following articles:

* [Setting Up User Accounts for Integrating with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)]](admin-setting-up-integration-with-dynamics-sales.md) 
* [Create users in Microsoft Dynamics 365 (online) and assign security roles](/dynamics365/customer-engagement/admin/create-users-assign-online-security-roles). 

The administrator account is used only one time during the setup for the configuration changes that the Base Integration Solution makes in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)]. After the solution imports, the account is no longer needed. Integration will continue to use the user account that is automatically created specifically for the integration.

In addition to customizing [!INCLUDE [cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)], the solution also creates a security role in [!INCLUDE [cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)] for the integration:

* **Business Central Dataverse Integration** - Allows you to manage the connection between [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and [!INCLUDE [cds_long_md](includes/cds_long_md.md)]. Typically, this role is assigned only to the user account that's automatically created for synchronization. To learn more about this role, go to [Setting Up User Accounts for Integrating with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)]](admin-setting-up-integration-with-dynamics-sales.md).

When you set up the connection, you create the integration table mappings that you need to synchronize data. Entities in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] are mapped to tables and table fields in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] through integration tables. To learn more about mappings, go to [Standard Entity Mapping for Synchronization](admin-synchronizing-business-central-and-sales.md#standard-table-mapping-for-synchronization).

## Handle differences in local and base transaction currencies

You can connect to a [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] environment that has a different base currency than the local currency in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. You make the connection in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on the **Dataverse Connection Setup** page or by using the **Set up connection to Dataverse** assisted setup guide.

To be able to connect, ensure that the base transaction currency setting in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] has the currency that set on the **Currencies** page in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], and at least one exchange rate is specified for the currency on the **Currency Exchange Rates** page.

Here's an example. You're connecting [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] with Euro (EUR) set as the local currency on the **General Ledger Setup** page to a [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] environment that has a base transaction currency set to US dollar (USD). You'll need to have USD on the **Currencies** page in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and the appropriate exchange rate. 

When you enable the connection to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)], [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] adds its local currency to the **Currency** entity in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] with the exchange rate from the **Currency Factor** field on the **Currency Exchange Rates** page.

Currency synchronization is unidirectional, from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to [!INCLUDE [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)], monetary amounts convert and synchronize as follows:

* Amounts in the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] base currency convert to the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] local currency based on the latest exchange rate synchronized from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].
* Amounts in the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] local currency synchronize with the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] local currency in one of the other (non-base) currencies in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)].

## What happens when you copy a company

You can safely copy companies that integrate with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]. Copying companies helps reduce the risk of data inconsistencies and can save you valuable time. To learn more about copying companies, go to [Copy a company](about-new-company.md#copy-a-company).

# Connect E-Documents to external access points

[!INCLUDE [e-documents connectors](includes/edocuments-connectors-include.md)]

You can use E-Documents in Business Central to send and receive electronic documents with your business partners. To receive documents, you need to connect E-Documents to an external access point that handles the communication and validation of the documents. 

 > [!NOTE]
 > These connections require communication with external service providers who might be subject to additional payment and require contracts with them. To obtain all the necessary credentials, contact the service providers.

The steps to connect E-Documents to an external access point depend on the type of connector you choose.    

> [!NOTE]
> Ask your service provider for all the necessary details to establish a connection with their access point that follows.  

## Pagero service

1. On the **E-Document External Connection Setup** page, select the **Open OAuth 2.0 setup** action to open the **OAuth 2.0 Setup** page.  
2. On the **OAuth 2.0 setup** page, select the **Request Authorization Code** action. You're redirected to the external service authorization webpage and prompted for your sign-in details.
3. Copy the authorization code into the **Enter Authorization Code** field.  
4. Select **Refresh Access Token** to make sure that you can refresh the token. 
5. On the **E-Document External Connection Setup** page, fill in the following fields:

    | Field name | Description |
    |---|---|
    | FileAPI URL | Specify the file API URL. |
    | Fileparts URL | Specify the fileparts URL. |
    | DocumentAPI URL | Specify the document API URL. |
    | Company ID | Specify the company ID. |
    | Send Mode | Specify the send mode. You can select **Production**, **Test**, or **Certification**. |

6. Continue with the [nonservice provider setup steps](finance-how-setup-edocuments-external.md).  

## Avalara service

> [!NOTE]
> The Avalara connector in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is available from version 25.1

1. On the **Avalara Connection Setup** page, enter the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** fields. In the **Send Mode** field, choose the **Production**, **Test**, or **Certification** option, based on your plans. 
2. Select the **Select Avalara Company Id** action, and choose the right company. Make sure you enter values into the **Company Name** and **Company ID** fields.  
3. Select the **Select Avalara Mandate** action, and select the right **E-Document Service**, and then pick appropriate **Country Mandate** code on the **Avalara Mandate List** page. 
4. Navigate back to the **E-Document Service** page, and validate that the **Avalara Mandate** field in the **Avalara** FastTab is set with the value you chose. 
5. Continue with the [non-service provider setup steps](finance-how-setup-edocuments-external.md).

## Available service providers

At this moment, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports Pagero and Avalara access points for e-documents, but more access points are in the process of development. This page is updated with the parameters for new connectors when they're ready. You can also find more connectors on AppSource.

> [!NOTE]
> This page doesn't show how to connect with the local service providers. If [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] support some of them, it will be explained in the country-specific documentation.  

Microsoft doesn't have a contractual obligation with Pagero and Avalara. That means, if you want to use their connectors, you must have a contract with them.

# Set up payment terms

Payment terms determine how you manage due dates and payment discounts. You can use date formulas to define the payment terms. When you first sign up for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the demonstration company provides a few payment methods that businesses often use. You can, however, add as many as you need.  

If you assign payment terms to customers and vendors, the same terms are always used on the sales and purchase documents you create for them. The document dates on sales and purchase documents, not their posting dates, are used to calculate due dates for payments. If needed, you can change the terms on the sales or purchase document. For example, if you want a particular customer to pay you within seven days rather than the default 14 days. Changing the terms on the document doesn't change the default payment term assigned to the customer. The same payment terms are available for sales and purchase documents.

When you post an invoice, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates the payment discounts based on the payment terms. The payment discount date is the last date that the customer can receive a discount. The date is also calculated when you post an invoice.  

Similarly, when you post a credit memo, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] calculates payment discounts based on the payment terms. It calculates the discount on credit memos in the same way as discounts on invoices. When you apply a credit memo to an invoice, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] reduces the discount amount for the invoice by the credit memo's discount amount.  

If you want to send your customers reminders of overdue payments, you must set up reminder levels and terms. To learn more about reminders, go to [Set Up Reminder Terms and Levels](finance-setup-reminders.md).  

## To set up payment terms

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Payment Terms**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  

After you set up the payment terms, you assign them to customers and vendors. Optionally, assign payment terms to your payment methods.  

> [!TIP]
> In the base version of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], payment terms don't support partial payments. Instead, you must use the prepayments functionality. To learn more about prepayments, go to [Set Up Prepayments](finance-set-up-prepayments.md).
>
> In some countries/regions, you *can* set up payment terms with partial payments. To learn whether your country/region supports this capability, go to the **Local Functionality** section in the table of contents on the left side of a [Microsoft Learn](about-localization.md) article.

## Audit changes to payment terms

You can use the Change Log feature to capture changes users make to your payment terms setup. [!INCLUDE [include-audit-what-who-when](includes/include-audit-what-who-when.md)]

The following table lists the table for payment terms and its ID.

| Table | Table ID |

# Moving Annual Total (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Moving Annual Total (MAT)** report calculates a total of sales over the last 12 months. This is a rolling calculation where the date is continually moving.

The report showcases the sales amount moving annual total (MAT), and compares it to the MAT for the previous period.

## How to use the report

Business leaders and managers use the report to identify how the MAT is performing across the period.

Business leaders can use the report to monitor the overall sales performance of your organization over the last 12 months. By analyzing the [Moving Annual Total (MAT)](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#sales-amount-mat-fiscal) and [Previous Year Moving Annual Total (PYMAT)](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#sales-amount-pymat-fiscal) figures, you can identify trends in sales growth and compare your organization's performance to the previous year. You can also use the [Moving Annual Total Growth Amount](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#sales-amount-matg-fiscal) and [Growth %](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#sales-amount-matg--fiscal) figures to identify periods that performed well or didn't meet the growth expectation.

For example, if you notice that your organization's sales growth is stagnant or declining, you can use this information to develop a plan that focuses on improving sales and increasing marketing efforts during these periods.

Sales managers can use the report to analyze sales data over the last 12 months and gain insights into sales trends. By drilling down into the sales figures for specific categories, you can identify areas of strength and weakness in your sales performance. For example, you might notice that sales of some items have declined over the last few months while the sales of other items are increasing.

The monthly analysis helps you identify when sales started to decline and take necessary actions to introduce products that align with the new trend to increase sales and meet customer demand. With this information, you can make data-driven decisions to optimize your sales strategy and drive revenue growth for your company.

## Key performance indicators

The report includes the following key performance indicators (KPIs) and measures:

- [**Moving Annual Total (MAT)**](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#sales-amount-mat-fiscal)
- [**Previous Year Moving Annual Total (PYMAT)**](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#sales-amount-pymat-fiscal)
- [**Moving Annual Total Growth Amount**](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#sales-amount-matg-fiscal)
- [**Moving Annual Total Growth %**](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#sales-amount-matg--fiscal)
- [**Sales Amount**](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md#sales-amount)

# Set Up Incoming Documents

If you create general journal lines from incoming document records, you must specify on the **Incoming Documents Setup** page which journal template and batch to use.

When the **Incoming Documents** feature is set up, you can use different functions to review expense receipts, manage OCR tasks, and convert incoming document files, manually or automatically, to the relevant documents or journal lines. The external files can be attached at any process stage, including to posted documents and to the resulting vendor, customer, and general ledger entries. For more information, see [Create Incoming Documents Records](across-how-create-income-document-records.md).

## To set up the Incoming Documents feature

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Incoming Document Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

As part of the setup, you must decide if you want to require approval of incoming documents. To require approval, you must [set up approvers and approval workflows](#to-set-up-approvers-of-incoming-document-records). If your organization doesn't intend to require approval, you can skip the next section.

Finally, if you use an OCR service to convert PDF or image files representing incoming documents, [you must it set up](#to-set-up-an-ocr-service). Otherwise, you can also skip that section.

## To set up approvers of incoming document records

If you don't want users to create invoices or general journal lines from incoming document records unless the documents are first approved, set up an approval process for the incoming documents. Approvers of incoming documents must be set up as approval workflow users.

Before you can create workflows that involve approval steps, you must set up the workflow users who are involved in approval processes. On the **Approval User Setup** page, you also set amount limits for specific types of requests and define substitute approvers to whom approval requests are delegated when the original approver is absent. For more information, see [Set Up Approval Users](across-how-to-set-up-approval-users.md).

## To set up an OCR service

To turn PDF and image files into electronic documents that you can convert to invoices, credit memos, or journal lines, set up the OCR feature. Alternatively, you can create entries manually to represent the external documents.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **OCR Service Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

# Specify posting periods

Use posting periods to specify when users can post to the general ledger.  

## To specify posting periods

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Ledger Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **General Ledger Setup** page, define the period by entering dates in the **Allow Posting From** and **Allow Posting To** fields.  

> [!NOTE]  
> These posting periods apply to the company and to all users. To allow for exceptions, you can define different posting periods for specific users on the **User Setup** page. These posting periods overrule those specified on the **General Ledger Setup** page. For more information, see [Set up time constraints for users](ui-define-granular-permissions.md#set-up-time-constraints-for-users).

## Video guidance

When you're closing an accounting period, you might want to prevent new posts from coming in, or allow only certain people to post transactions. The following video shows how to control when, and who, can post transactions to your general ledger.

# Receive and convert electronic documents

> [!NOTE]
> The content in this article is only applicable for versions of Dynamics 365 Business Central that were released before 2023 release wave 2. In 2023 release wave 2, new functionality for E-Documents is included. To learn more, see [Set up e-documents](finance-how-setup-edocuments.md). 


The generic version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports receiving electronic invoices and credit memos in the PEPPOL format, which is supported by the largest providers of document exchange services. To receive an invoice from a vendor as an electronic PEPPOL document, you process the document in the Incoming Documents page to convert it to a purchase invoice or general journal line in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

In addition to receiving electronic documents directly from trading partners, you can receive electronic documents from an OCR service that has turned your PDF or image files into electronic documents.  

Before you can receive electronic documents through the document exchange service, you must set up various master data, such as company information, vendors, items, and units of measure. These are used to identify the business partners and items when converting data in elements in the incoming document file to fields in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For more information, see [Set Up a Document Exchange Service](across-how-to-set-up-a-document-exchange-service.md).  

Before you can receive electronic documents through the OCR service, you must set up and enable the preconfigured service connection. For more information, see [Set Up Incoming Documents](across-how-setup-income-documents.md).  

The traffic of electronic documents in and out of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is managed by the Job Queue feature. Before you can receive electronic documents, the relevant job queue must be started.  

You can either start the conversion of electronic documents manually, as described in this procedure, or you can enable a workflow to convert electronic documents automatically when they're received. The generic version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes a workflow template, *From Incoming Electronic through OCR to Open Purchase Invoice Workflow*, which is ready to be copied to a workflow and enabled. For more information, see [Workflow](across-workflow.md).  

> [!NOTE]  
> When you convert electronic documents received from the OCR service to documents or journal lines in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], multiple lines on the source document will be summed on one line. The single line will be of type G/L Account and the **Description** and (G/L account) **No.** fields will be empty. The value in the **Amount** field will equal the total amount excluding VAT of all lines in the source document.  
>
> To make sure that the **Description** and **No.** fields are filled, you can choose the **Map Text to Account** button on the **Incoming Documents** page to define that a certain invoice text is always mapped to a certain debit or credit account in the general ledger. Going forward, the **Description** field on document or journal lines created from an electronic document for that vendor or customer will be filled with the text in question and the (G/L account) **No.** field with the account in question.  
>
> Instead of mapping to a G/L account, you can also map to a bank account. This is practical, for example, for electronic documents for expenses that are already paid where you want to create a general journal line that is ready to post to a bank account.  

The following procedure describes how to receive a vendor invoice and convert it to a purchase invoice in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The procedure is the same when you convert a vendor invoice to a general journal line.  

### To receive and convert an electronic invoice to a purchase invoice

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Incoming Documents**, and then choose the related link.  

2. Select the line for the incoming document record that represents a new incoming electronic invoice, and then choose the **Edit** action.  

    On the **Incoming Document Card** page, the related XML file is attached, and most of the fields are prefilled with information from the electronic invoice. For more information, see [Create Incoming Document Records](across-how-create-income-document-records.md).  

3. In the **Data Exchange Type** field, choose **PEPPOL - Invoice** or **OCR – Invoice** depending on the source of the electronic document.  

4. To map text on the vendor invoice to a specific debit account, on the **Actions** tab, in the **General** group, choose **Map Text to Account**, and then fill the **Text-to-Account Mapping Worksheet** page.  

5. Choose the **Create Document** action.  

    A purchase invoice will be created in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] based on the information in the electronic document.  

    Any validation errors, typically related to wrong or missing master data in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will be shown on the **Error Messages** FastTab.

# Work with blanket sales orders or blanket purchase orders

A blanket sales order represents a framework for a long-term agreement between you and your customer. Similarly, you use blanket purchase orders to manage long-term agreements between you and your vendor.

A blanket order is typically made when a customer has committed to purchasing large quantities that are to be delivered in several smaller shipments over a certain period of time. Often blanket orders cover only one item with predetermined delivery dates. The main reason for using a blanket order rather than a sales order is that quantities entered on a blanket order don't affect item availability and thus can be used as a worksheet for monitoring, forecasting, and planning purposes.

On the blanket order, each separate shipment can be set up as an order line, which can then be converted into a sales order at the time of shipping.

An example of when a blanket sales order could be used is if a customer calls and places an order of 1000 units of an item and they want the items to be delivered in 250 units every week over the next month.

> [!NOTE]
> Blanket purchase orders work in a similar way as blanket sales orders. This documentation covers blanket sales orders only.

## To create a blanket sales order

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Blanket Sales Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
4. Leave the **Order Date** field blank. When the separate sales orders are created from the blanket order, the order date of the sales order is set to equal the actual work date.
5. On the **Lines** FastTab, create separate lines for each shipment. For instance, if your customer wants 1000 units split out equally between four weeks, you would enter four separate lines of 250 units each.  

## To create a sales order from a blanket sales order  

1. To create an order for any of the lines in the blanket sales order, remove the quantity in the **Qty. to Ship** field on all the lines that you don't wish to ship at this time.  
2. When you're ready to create orders, choose the **Make Order** action, and then choose **Yes**. A message appears informing you that the blanket order has been assigned an order number. Note that the blanket order hasn't been deleted.  
3. Choose the **OK** button.  
4. To see the results of the preceding steps, choose the **Line** action, choose the **Unposted Lines** action, and then choose the **Orders** action.  
5. On the **Sales Lines** page, select the appropriate sales order, choose the **Line** action, and then choose the **Show Document** action.  

The following applies to sales orders after they have been created from blanket sales orders:  

- After the blanket order is converted into a sales order, the sales order contains all the lines from the blanket order. The lines where the quantity in the **Qty. to Ship** field was deleted appear, but with blank **Quantity** fields. You may choose to leave, edit, or delete the lines.  
- It's important to remember that the sales order line quantity must not exceed the quantity of the associated blanket order line. Otherwise, posting of the sales order won't be possible.  
- When the sales order is posted as shipped and/or invoiced, the **Quantity Shipped** and **Quantity Invoiced** fields are updated on the related blanket order.  
- The blanket order number and line number are recorded as properties of the sales lines when created from a blanket order.  
- When sales orders aren't created directly from the blanket order but still relate to it, a link between a sales order and a blanket order can be established by entering the associated blanket order number in the **Blanket Order No.** field on the sales order line.  
- After the sales order has been created for the total quantity of a blanket order line, no other sales order can be created for the same line. Users are prevented from entering a quantity in the **Qty. to Ship** field. If, however, additional quantities need to be added to a blanket order, the value in the **Quantity** field can be increased and additional orders can then be created.  
- The invoiced blanket sales order remains in the system until it's deleted, either by deleting individual blanket orders or by running the **Delete Invoiced Blanket Sales Orders** batch job.  
- If a customer is also recorded as a contact in the Marketing application area, and if you have specified an interaction template code for blanket sales order on the **Marketing Setup** page, an interaction is recorded in the Interaction Log Entry table when you select **Print** to print the blanket sales order.

## To view the status of a blanket sales order

You can see the status of a blanket sales order on the **Sales Blanket Order Statistics** page. This might be relevant when you start to invoice the order that is created from the blanket sales order.  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Blanket Sales Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Select a blanket sales order, and then choose the **Statistics** action.  
3.  On the **Sales Blanket Order Statistics** page, on the **General** FastTab, you can see summary information about the entire order based on the total quantity in the various **Quantity fields** on the blanket sales order lines.  

- On the **Invoicing** FastTab, you can see summary information based on the total quantity in the **Qty. to Invoice** fields on the sales blanket order lines.  
- On the **Shipping** FastTab, you can see summary information based on the total quantity in the **Qty. to Receive** fields on the sales blanket order lines.  
- On the **Prepayment** FastTab, you can see summary information about any prepaid amounts.  
- On the **Vendor** FastTab, you can see certain basic information about the vendor.

## To view unposted and posted blanket sales order lines

The link between the blanket sales order and the originating sales order, and any other sales document, is retained after posting as a list of posted and unposted sales order invoice lines.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon enter **Blanket Sales Orders**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the blanket sales order you want to view.
3. To view unposted entries, select the line in question, choose the **Line** action, and then choose the **Unposted Lines** action. Choose one of the following options.  

|Option|Description|
|--|--|
|**Orders**|Specifies open orders associated with the selected line.|
|**Invoices**|Specifies open invoices that have been associated with the selected line. Open invoices are manually associated with a blanket order by entering the blanket order number on the sales invoice line.|
|**Return Orders**|Specifies open return orders that have been associated with the selected line.|
|**Credit Memos**|Specifies open credit memos that have been associated with the selected line.|

4. To view posted entries, select the line in question, choose the **Line** action, and then choose the **Posted Lines** action. Choose one of the following options.  

|Option|Description|
|---|----|
|**Shipments**|Posted shipments associated with the selected line.|
|**Invoices**|Posted invoices associated with the selected line.|
|**Return Receipts**|Posted return receipts that have been associated with the selected line.|
|**Credit Memos**|Posted credit memos that have been associated with the selected line.|

5. On the **Sales Lines** page, choose the **Show Document** action to view the entry.

# Develop Business Central report layouts and datasets

Reports in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] have a report object that defines their dataset and layouts. The dataset provides the data in the report, and the layouts control how the data is presented.  

## Developing report layouts

Want to modify the layout of a report? For Excel and Word layouts, you can do that yourself. If you want pixel-perfect RDLC layouts though, you might need help from a developer. 

The following table provides links to articles that describe options for customizing reports.

# Manually Synchronize Table Mappings


An integration table mapping associates a [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] table, such as customer, with a [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] table, such as account. Synchronizing an integration table mapping enables you to synchronize data in all records of the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] table and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] table that are coupled. Additionally, depending on the configuration of the table mapping, synchronization can create and couple new records in the destination solution for uncoupled records in the source.  

Manually synchronizing integration table mappings can be useful during the initial set up of an integration, and when diagnosing synchronization errors.  

This article describes three methods for manually synchronizing integration table mappings. Each method provides a different level of synchronization.

## Run a Full Synchronization
A full synchronization runs all the default integration synchronization jobs for synchronizing [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] records and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] tables, as defined on the **Integration Table Mappings** page. 

A full synchronization performs the following operations For [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] or [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] records that are:

* Not coupled, a new matching row will be created and coupled in the opposing solution.
Whether and where a row gets created depends on the synchronization direction. For example, when synchronizing data from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] customers to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] accounts, if there is a customer that is not coupled to an account, then a new account will be automatically added in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] and coupled to the customer in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The opposite holds true when the synchronization direction is from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For each account that is not already coupled to a customer, a new matching customer will be created in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and coupled to the account in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)].  

     > [!NOTE]  
     >  To achieve this, the full synchronization operation temporarily clears the **Synch. Only Coupled Records** option on the integration table mapping that is used by the synchronization job. At the end of the full synchronization process, you will be prompted whether you want to keep this option cleared for all jobs.  

* Coupled, the synchronization direction (for example, from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] or from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]) is predetermined by the integration table mappings. For more information, see [Standard Table Mapping for Synchronization](admin-synchronizing-business-central-and-sales.md#standard-table-mapping-for-synchronization).  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  You typically only use the full synchronization when you initially set up integration between [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] and only one of solutions contains data, which you want to copy to the other solution. A full synchronization can be useful in a demonstration environment. Because the full synchronization automatically creates and couples records between the solutions, it makes it faster to start working with synchronizing data between records. On the other hand, you should only run a full synchronization if you want a row in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] for each row in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] for the given table mappings. Otherwise, you can have unwanted or duplicate records in either [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] or [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)].  

### To run a full synchronization  
1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Dataverse Connection Setup**, and then choose the related link.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you want to run a full synchronization for tables through Dynamics 365 Sales, use the **Microsoft Dynamics 365 Sales Connection Setup** page instead.

2.  Choose the **Run Full Synchronization** action, and then choose the **Yes** button.  
3.  When the full synchronization is completed, you can specify whether to allow scheduled synchronization jobs to create new records.  

    If you want all synchronization jobs to create new records in the destination for uncoupled records in the source, choose **Yes**. This sets the **Synch. Only Coupled Records** field on the table mappings that are used by the synchronization jobs.  

    If you want synchronization jobs to run as they did before the full synchronization with regard to creating new records, choose **No**. This sets the **Synch. Only Coupled Records** field to the setting it had before the full synchronization.  

You can view the results of the full synchronization on the **Integration Synchronization Jobs** page. For more information, see [View the Status of a Synchronization](admin-how-to-view-synchronization-status.md).  

## Synchronizing All Modified Records
You can use the **Common Data Service Connection Setup** page to synchronize changes to data in all integration table mappings. This is similar to a full synchronization. It will synchronize data in all coupled records in the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] tables that are defined in the table mappings. By default, only data that has been modified since the last synchronization will be synchronized. Synchronization jobs synchronize table mappings in the following order to avoid coupling dependencies between the tables:  

1.  CURRENCY  
2.  SALESPEOPLE  
3.  VENDOR  
4.  CUSTOMER  
5.  CONTACTS  

You can view the results of the synchronization on the **Integration Synchronization Jobs** page. For more information, see [View the Status of a Synchronization](admin-how-to-view-synchronization-status.md).  

> [!TIP]  
>  By modifying the integration table mapping in advance, you can create filters to control the data to synchronize, or configure mappings to create new data in the destination solution for uncoupled records or rows in the source. For more information, see [Modify Table Mappings for Synchronization](admin-how-to-modify-table-mappings-for-synchronization.md).

### To synchronize data for all tables  
1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Microsoft Dynamics 365 Sales Connection Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2.  Choose the **Synchronize Modified Records** action, and then choose **Yes**.  

## Synchronize Individual Table Mappings
You can use the **Integration Table Mappings** page to run a synchronization job for table mappings. This will synchronize data for all coupled records and rows in the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] tables that are defined by the table mapping. By default, only data that has been modified since the last synchronization will be synchronized.  

### To synchronize records of an integration table mapping  
1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Integration Table Mappings**, and then choose the related link.
2.  Choose the **Synchronize Modified Records** action, and then choose **Yes**.

# Set Up Put-away Templates

With directed put-away and pick functionality, the most appropriate bin for your items at any given time is suggested, according to the put-away template that you have set up for the warehouse, the bin rankings you have given to the bins, and the minimum and maximum quantities that you have set up for fixed bins.  

You can set up a number of put-away templates and select one of them to govern put-aways in general in your warehouse. You can also select a put-away template for any item or stockkeeping unit that might have special put-away requirements.  

## To set up put-away templates

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Put-away Templates**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. Enter a code that is the unique identifier of the template you are about to create.  
4. Enter a short description, if you wish.  
5. Fill in the first line with the bin requirements that you want fulfilled first and foremost when suggesting a put-away.

    For example, if want the default put-away method to be based on fixed bins, then choose the **Find Fixed Bin** field. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  
6. Fill in the second line with the bin requirements that would be your second choice to fulfill in finding a bin for put-away. The second line is used only if a bin that meets the requirements of the first line cannot be found.  
7. Continue to fill in the lines until you have described all the acceptable bin placements that you want to use in the put-away process.  
8. On the last line in the put-away template, select the **Find Floating Bin** check box.  

You can create various put-away templates and then apply them as you see fit. The put-away template that you selected for the item or stockkeeping unit, if any is used first. If these fields are not filled in, then the put-away template that you selected for the warehouse on the **Bin Policies** FastTab on the location card is used.

# Settle purchase invoices promptly

If you need to pay the vendor by cash or check, you can post the payment when you post the invoice.  

> [!NOTE]  
> If you frequently pay purchase invoices in cash, check, or bank transfer, it is a good idea to set up a specific payment method with a balancing account and enter this method in the **Payment Method** field on the vendor card. The balancing account number is inserted automatically on the invoice header every time you create a new invoice. For more information, see [Defining Payment Methods](finance-payment-methods.md).  

## To settle purchase invoices promptly

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Invoices**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. To pay either in cash or by bank transfer, enter the number of the general ledger cash account or the bank account in the **Bal. Account No.** field.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The **Bal. Account Type** and **Bal. Account No.** fields are not included in the standard layout of the invoice header. In order to post the payment of an invoice, you must contact a Microsoft partner who can add the fields through code.  
>
> This customization is only required if you do not specify balancing accounts on the payment methods as describe above.

# Sharing Business Data from Business Central

Collaboration among people inside and outside an organization is integral part of most businesses. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers several features for sharing business data, like a list of records, specific records, or documents. <!--, with others&mdash;even those people who don't have a Business Central license in some cases.-->

With all these features, access to data is protected by the license and permissions of Business Central.

## Copying a link

![Supported](media/check.png) Business Central Online ![Supported](media/check.png) Business Central On-premises

From any page, you can copy the page's URL, then paste and distribute it in other forms of media like emails, Teams chats, or text messages. The easiest way to copy a link is by selecting **Share** > **Copy Link** from the top of the page. Another way is to copy the URL directly from the browser's address box.

When you paste the URL into a rich text editor like Word, Outlook, or Teams, instead of displaying the full URL, the link is given a more readable name that clearly indicates context of the target. The name and pattern vary depending on what page you're linking to. Consider the following examples:

|Pattern|Page example|Link name|
|-|-|-|
|List pages|**Items** list page | **Items**|
|List view|	**Open** filtered view on **Sales Orders** list|**Sales Orders - Open**|
| Single record|Item card showing single record|"Item Card - 1896 ∙ ATHENS Desk"|
|Draft records|	New customer card|**New - Customer card**|
|Company that uses badge|**Items** list page for company with badge **CRONUS**| **Items (CRONUS)**|

> [!TIP]
> A similar naming convention is used on browser tabs.

### Share data analysis
If you're viewing a page or query in the data analysis mode, you can share a specific analysis tab by selecting the down arrowhead on the tab, and then selecting **Copy link**. [Learn more about data analysis mode](analysis-mode.md). 

### Modify the page link

After you copy a link, before you send it, you can modify the URL to manipulate what shows when the page opens. You can, for example, add filters or specify a different company.

[Learn more about the web client URL](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-web-client-urls).

### About filtered lists

Using the filter pane on list pages, you can apply filters to narrow-down the records shown in the list. If you use the **Copy Link** action or copy the URL from the browser, the page link won't include your filter changes. Users that open the link see the full collection. The way to keep the filtering on a collection page link is to save the filtered page as a **View** first. Then, open the view and copy the link from there.

[Learn more about sorting, searching, and filtering](ui-enter-criteria-filters.md).

## Sharing to Teams

![Supported](media/check.png) Business Central Online ![Not Supported](media/x-icon.png) Business Central On-premises

Directly from most collection pages and details pages, you can send a link to the page to people, group chats or channels. For example, share a link to a filtered view of your records. If you've installed the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams, the link will automatically expand into a compact card for you to include with your message. Recipients then select the link or card to open the page in Business Central.

[Learn more about sharing records and page links in Teams](across-working-with-teams.md).

## Sharing Through OneDrive

![Supported](media/check.png) Business Central Online ![Supported](media/check.png) Business Central On-premises

Business Central makes it easy to store, manage, and share files with other people through OneDrive for Business. On most pages where files are available, such as the Report Inbox or files that are attached to records, you find the **Open in OneDrive** and **Share** actions. Both actions save a copy of a file to OneDrive. Once in OneDrive, you can use its sharing and contribution features on the file. The difference in the actions is that **Open in OneDrive** opens the file in OneDrive. **Share** opens a page the let's you select who you want to share the file with. Recipients get a notification email to access the file from your OneDrive.

[Learn more about sharing files in OneDrive](across-share-onedrive.md).

## Opening in Excel

![Supported](media/check.png) Business Central Online ![Supported](media/check.png) Business Central On-premises

For list pages and lists embedded on a page, you can use the **Open in Excel** action. This action exports the list of records to an Excel workbook (.xlsx file), which you can share with others. In the workbook, you can also use the Share feature that's part of Excel.

[Learn more about viewing and editing in Excel](across-work-with-excel.md).

## Sharing rows or tables

![Supported](media/check.png) Business Central Online ![Supported](media/check.png) Business Central On-premises

You can share one or more records in a list. Just select the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> keyboard shortcut to copy to your clipboard. Then paste what you copied into another application by pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>V</kbd>. For example, copying three sales orders and pasting that into an email will display the orders in a nicely formatted table.

# Install [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] apps for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

This article describes how to install [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] apps for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The apps are specific to each functional area of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The apps include:

- APIs for reading data.
- [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] semantic models and reports.
- Pages that embed the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].
- Navigation links on Role Centers and Role Explorer.

## Prerequisites

To install [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] apps for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you must have:

- An environment in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online (it comes ready to integrate with [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)].)

- Entitlements/permissions in [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] to:

    - Install template apps from AppSource.
    - Use shared workspaces.

The prerequisites for [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] can be met with a [!INCLUDE [powerbi-pro](includes/powerbi-pro-license-name.md)] license for the following users:

   - The user who installs the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] template app.
   - The user who refreshes the data.
   - Each user who accesses the reports, either in the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] service or embedded in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

An alternative to using [!INCLUDE [powerbi-pro](includes/powerbi-pro-license-name.md)] licenses is to use [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] or [!INCLUDE [fabric-name](includes/fabric-name.md)] Premium capacity.

To learn more, go to [Get started with [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]](across-working-with-powerbi.md#get-started).

## Installing a [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] app

[!INCLUDE [powerbi-apps-overview](includes/powerbi-apps-overview.md)]

Each app consists of two parts:

- A connector (AL) app that contains APIs, setup pages, and embed pages. Connectors are preinstalled with [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].
- A [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] template app that contains a [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] semantic model and [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports.

You must install and configure both apps for the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports to work.

### Installing the connector (AL) app

The connector apps are preinstalled with [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

### Installing a [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] template app

Template apps are available to install from Microsoft AppSource. To install or update one or more of the template apps, go to one of the install links in the following table and select **Get it now**.

| To get the template app for... | Use this install link             |
|--------------------------------| --------------------------------- |
| Finance                        | https://aka.ms/bc-pbi-finance-app                 |
| Sales                          | https://aka.ms/bc-pbi-sales-app                   |
| Purchasing                     | https://aka.ms/bc-pbi-purchase-app                |
| Inventory                      | https://aka.ms/bc-pbi-inventory-app               |
| Inventory Valuation            | https://aka.ms/bc-pbi-inventory-valuation-app     | 
| Manufacturing                  | https://aka.ms/bc-pbi-manufacturing-app |
| Projects                       | https://aka.ms/bc-pbi-projects-app      |

Sign in to Microsoft AppSource using your [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] account credentials. Follow the instructions to install the app in [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)].

After you install it, the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] app appears under **Apps** in [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)], and there's a workspace with the same name that you can use to configure the app.

When you install the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] template app in your [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] subscription, you must choose a workspace for the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] semantic model and reports. We recommend that you use one workspace for each app because it's easier to set up functional boundaries with access controls for users and user groups.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To install a [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] template app, you need a [!INCLUDE [powerbi-pro](includes/powerbi-pro-license-name.md)] license.

### Need Power BI apps for multiple companies?

[!INCLUDE [powerbi-apps-per-company-include](includes/powerbi-apps-per-company-include.md)]

## Run the Connect to Power BI assisted setup guide

After you install your [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] apps, you can configure them to suit your business:

- Get help with the set-up process by using the **Connect to Power BI** assisted setup guide.
- Set up things yourself on the [Power BI Connector Setup](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com?page=36951) page.

The assisted setup guide helps you configure the following components:

1. [Calendar Type](#configure-the-calendar-type)
1. [UTC Offset](#specify-the-utc-offset)
1. [Date Table Range](#set-up-a-date-table-range)
1. [Work Days](#specify-work-days)
1. [Report Mapping](#map-embedded-reports)

### Configure the calendar type

Choose the type of calendar the year boundaries apply to.

- **Fiscal**: A 12-month calendar that begins in any month and ends 12 months after.
- **Standard**: A 12-month calendar that begins on January 1 and ends on December 31.
- **Weekly**: A calendar that supports 445, 454, or 544 week groupings. The first and last day of the year might not correspond to a first and last day of a month, respectively.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> By default, all [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports are configured to use Fiscal Calendar date fields and Fiscal Time Intelligence measures.

<!-- If you choose a calendar type other than Fiscal, you will need to edit the Power BI reports and change the date field references and measure references accordingly.  -->

### Specify the UTC offset

The UTC offset defines the UTC time zone in the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] date table.

The UTC offset allows your [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] semantic model to accurately calculate what the current day is in respect to your geographical location. This setting is necessary because your [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] apps might be hosted in a data center located in a different region.

UTC offsets are based on [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] time zones.

### Set up a date table range

The **Starting Date** and **Ending Date** fields are set automatically based on your accounting periods in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Based on these dates, [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] generates a series of continuous dates for your date table.

> [!NOTE]
> If your budgets extend past the last date in your Account Period table, you must manually set the ending date to accommodate the extended range.

### Specify work days

You can define the days of the week you consider as work days. The default setting is Monday to Friday.

### Map embedded reports

To enable the embedded report pages in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you must set up links to the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] apps in the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] service.

1. For each functional area in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], select the ellipsis to open the **Select Power BI Workspace** page.
1. Select the workspace where you store the corresponding [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] app.
1. Select the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] report (app) you want to map.

## Restrict the amount of data that loads to Power BI

If you want to restrict the amount of data that loads to the semantic model in [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)], you can define filters on each app.

On the [Power BI Connector Setup](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com?page=36951) page, choose an app for which you want to set up data filtering. The semantic models use these settings when they refresh the data.

All apps support start and end date filtering, where you specify the start and end date of an interval.

Some apps also support other filter options, such as *Start/End Date* or *Relative Date*. With the *Relative Date* type, you can apply a custom date formula.

## Connect the Power BI semantic models to Business Central

Do this part of the configuration in the semantic models in your [Power BI service](https://app.powerbi.com).

Each semantic model requires two parameters:

- Environment (holds the environment name)
- Company (holds the company name. The company parameter is case sensitive. )

You can find these values in the connection details of the assisted setup guide or on the [Power BI Connector Setup](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com?page=36951) page.

To set or change values for the parameters, open the app workspace in your [!INCLUDE [powerbi-service-name](includes/powerbi-service-name.md)]. Locate the semantic model, and choose **More options**. Now choose **Settings**, and then **Parameters**.

## Get the latest data (refresh the semantic model)

Each [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] app is based on a semantic model (also known as a dataset) that gets data from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] APIs. Make sure that the data in your [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] reports is up to date with the data in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. This concept is referred to as *refreshing* the model. Depending on your [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] setup, refreshing might not happen automatically. You can refresh data manually, or by scheduling a refresh. You can do a manual refresh at any time. A scheduled refresh lets you refresh data automatically at defined time intervals.

To learn more, go to [Refresh [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] semantic models](/dynamics365/business-central/across-working-with-powerbi#work-with-power-bi-reports).

## Job queue entry for updating dimension set entries

For dimension set entries to show up in the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] apps, the job queue entry that runs the *Update Dim. Set Entries* codeunit must run at least one time. If you change dimension sets or values, the codeunit must run again. Therefore, we recommend that you run the corresponding job queue entry one time each week, or maybe once a night outside normal working hours.

## Want links to show up in Report Explorer?

The profiles (roles) selected to display in the Role Explorer control the functional areas that show in Report Explorer. To specify whether profiles display, turn on or turn off the **Enabled** and **Show in Role Explorer** toggles on the **Profiles** page.

> [!TIP]
> For the built-in profiles that show in Report Explorer, the **Description** field contains **Navigation menu only**.

## Permissions

In [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the user account you use to refresh the semantic model in [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] must have **Read** permissions to the tables in the model. The tables are documented in the KPI article for the app. For example, for the [!INCLUDE [power-bi-sales-app-name](includes/power-bi-sales-app-name.md)], to explore the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] tables that a user needs Read permissions for, go to [KPIs and measures in the Power BI Sales app](sales-powerbi-sales-kpis.md).

In the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-service-name](includes/powerbi-service-name.md)], we recommend that you add multiple admins for each [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] app workspace. Grant Read permissions to users who should be able to view report pages in an app.

For the embedded pages in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], there are permission sets for each [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] app. If you need to exclude read access to all or some of these pages, you can exclude the permission set (or permission on individual pages) for the users.

## Governance of [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] workspaces

Consider having the template app workspaces highly governed and not used directly for the embedded experience. To learn more, go to [Workspace governance level](/power-bi/guidance/powerbi-implementation-planning-workspaces-tenant-level-planning#workspace-governance-level).

Instead, consider having a single workspace per company that you use for the embed experience. In this workspace, keep copies or custom versions of the template reports. This helps mitigate the problem of losing report customizations when you upgrade the template app workspace. To learn more about how to copy a report to another workspace, go to [Copy reports from other workspaces](/power-bi/connect-data/service-datasets-copy-reports).

## Updating a Power BI app

The [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] [!INCLUDE [powerbi-name](includes/powerbi-name.md)] apps are available as template app on AppSource. When a new version of a template app becomes available, we notify you in two ways:

- An update banner displays in the [!INCLUDE [powerbi-service-name](includes/powerbi-service-name.md)] informing you that a new version is available.
- A notification displays in Power BI's notification pane.

When you update a template app, it's important that you're aware of your options and how they might overwrite earlier changes to the reports. You can choose to:

- Update the workspace and the app.
- Update workspace content only, without updating the app.
- Install another copy of the app in a new workspace.

To learn more, go to [Install, share, and update template apps in your organization](/power-bi/connect-data/service-template-apps-install-distribute#update-a-template-app).

# Power BI Sales app semantic model

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The semantic model in the Power BI sales app is organized in a [Star Schema Model](/power-bi/guidance/star-schema#star-schema-overview).

The fact tables contains information about individual transactions from sources such as sales orders, posted sales invoices, and posted credit memos from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

The dimension tables provide more context and attributes to the transactional data, such as customer and product information.

## Fact tables

Fact tables store transactional data and support summarizations such as SUM, AVG, COUNT, and more. There are two fact tables in the Power BI Sales app:

- [Sales](#sales)
- [Sales Budget](#sales-budget)

### Sales

The app uses data from the following tables:

- Value Entries
- Sales Lines

Sales lines are broken down into **Shipped Not Invoiced** and **Outstanding Sales Lines**. Use the **Source Type** field to filter on these sources.

#### Table Definition

# Sales analytics

Businesses capture lots of data during daily activities that supports business intelligence (BI) for sales managers:

- Opportunities
- Sales quotes
- Sales orders
- Sales invoices

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides features to help you gather, analyze, and share your organization's sales data:

- Power BI reports for sales
- Ad-hoc analysis on lists
- Ad-hoc analysis of data in Excel (using Open in Excel)
- Built-in sales analytics tools
- Built-in sales reports

Each of these features has its advantages and disadvantages, depending on the type of data analysis and the role of the user. To learn more, go to [Analytics, business intelligence, and reporting overview](reports-bi-reporting.md).

This article introduces how you can use these analytical features to gain sales insights.

## Analytics needs in sales

When you think about the analytics needs in sales management, it might help to use a persona-based model that describes different analytics needs at a high-level.

:::image type="content" source="/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/media/analytics-personas.svg" alt-text="Illustration of different personas for analytics" lightbox="/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/media/analytics-personas.svg":::

People in different roles have different needs when it comes to data, and they use the data in different ways. For example, people in asset management and finance interact with data differently than people in sales.

:::image type="content" source="/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/media/analytics-personas-scenarios.svg" alt-text="Illustration of how different personas have different analytics needs." lightbox="/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/media/analytics-personas-scenarios.svg":::

| Role              | Data aggregation  | Typical ways to consume data                          | 
|-------------------|-------------------| ----------------------------------------------------- |
|CCO / CFO / CEO    | Performance data  | KPIs <br> Dashboards <br> Financial reports           |
|Sales Manager      | Trends, summaries | Built-in managerial reports <br> Ad-hoc analysis      | 
|Account Manager / Sales Person | Detailed data     | Built-in operational reports <br> On-screen task data |

<!-- 
## Sales KPIs

A key performance indicator (KPI) is a measurable value that shows how effectively you’re meeting your goals. In sales management, people often use the following KPIs to monitor their organization's sales performance:

- TODO  
-->

## Using Power BI to monitor sales KPIs

A key performance indicator (KPI) is a measurable value that shows how effectively you’re meeting your goals. In sales, people often use the following KPIs to monitor their sales organization's performance:

- Gross Profit
- Gross Profit Margin
- Sales by period
- Sales vs. budget
- Number of new customers
- Period-over-Period Sales Amount Growth
- Sales by item/customer/location/sales person

:::image type="content" source="media/powerbi/sales/sales-overview.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Sales Overview Power BI report" lightbox="media/powerbi/sales/sales-overview.png":::

These sales KPIs, and more, are available in the Power BI Sales app for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. To learn more, go to [Power BI sales app](sales-powerbi-app.md).

[!INCLUDE [power-bi-sales-app](includes/power-bi-sales-app.md)]

## Use financial reporting to produce financial statements and KPIs related to sales

The **Financial Reporting** feature gives you insights into the financial data shown on your chart of accounts (COA). You can set up financial reports to analyze figures in general ledger (G/L) accounts, and compare general ledger entries with budget entries. Specifically for sales management, you can set up financial reports on the general ledger (G/L) accounts that you use to track sales postings.

Dimensions play an important role in business intelligence. A dimension is data that you add to an entry as a parameter. Dimensions let you group entries that have similar characteristics, such as customers, regions, products, and salesperson. Among other purposes, use dimensions when you define analysis views and create financial reports. To learn more, go to [Work with Dimensions](finance-dimensions.md).

To learn more about financial reports, go to [Prepare Financial Reports with Financial Data and Account Categories](bi-how-work-account-schedule.md).

## Finance reporting across business units or legal entities related to sales

Some organizations use [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in multiple business units or legal entities. Others use [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in subsidiaries that report to parent organizations. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] gives accountants tools that help them transfer general ledger entries from two or more companies (subsidiaries) into a consolidated company. Specifically for sales management, you might want to consolidate general ledger entries for your sales accounts to be able to track sales KPIs across business units or legal entities.

To learn more, go to [Company consolidation](finance-consolidated-company-reporting.md).

## Ad-hoc analysis of sales data

Sometimes, you just need to check whether the numbers add up correctly, or quickly confirm a figure. The following features are great for ad-hoc analyses:

- Data analysis on ledger list pages
- Open in Excel

The Data Analysis feature lets you open almost any list page, such as **General Ledger Entries**, **Customer Ledger Entries**, **Item Ledger Entries**, or **Posted Invoices**, enter analysis mode, and then group, filter, and pivot data as you see fit.

:::image type="content" source="media/data-analysis-customer-ledger-entries.png" alt-text="Example of how to do data analysis on the Customer Ledger Entries page." lightbox="media/data-analysis-customer-ledger-entries.png":::

Similarly, you can use the **Open in Excel** action to open a list page, optionally filter the list to a subset of the data, and then use Excel to work with the data. For example, by using features such as Analyze Data, What-If Analysis, or Forecast Sheet.

:::image type="content" source="media/open-in-excel-customer-ledger-entries.png" alt-text="Example of how to do data analysis on the Customer Ledger Entries data using Excel." lightbox="media/open-in-excel-customer-ledger-entries.png":::

> [!TIP]
> If you configure OneDrive for system features, the Excel workbook opens in your browser.

To learn more about how to do ad-hoc analysis on sales data, go to [Ad hoc analysis of sales data](ad-hoc-analysis-sales.md).

## Built-in reports for sales

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes several built-in reports, tracing functions, and tools to help sales organizations report on their data.

[!INCLUDE [sales_reports_report_explorer](includes/sales-reports-report-explorer-include.md)]

## On-screen sales analytics

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] has several pages that give you sales overviews and tasks to do. Here are some examples to get you started:

- [Open the Sales Quotes list](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=9300)
- [Open the Sales Orders list](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=9305)
- [Open the Posted Sales Invoices list](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=143)
- [Open the Sales Return Orders list](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=9304)
- [Calculate order promising dates](sales-how-to-calculate-order-promising-dates.md)
- [Calculate delivery dates for sales orders](sales-date-calculation-for-sales.md)
- [Track packages](sales-how-track-packages.md)
- [View the Availability of Items](inventory-how-availability-overview.md)
- [Blanket sales order status](sales-how-to-create-blanket-sales-orders.md#to-view-the-status-of-a-blanket-sales-order)
- [View unposted and posted blanket sales order lines](sales-how-to-create-blanket-sales-orders.md#to-view-unposted-and-posted-blanket-sales-order-lines)

### Show sales-related general ledger entries and balances from the Chart of Accounts page

The **Chart of Accounts** page shows all general ledger accounts with aggregated numbers posted to the general ledger. From this page, you can do things like:  

- View reports that show general ledger entries and balances.  
- Review a list of posting groups for that account.
- View separate debit and credit balances for a single account.

Specifically for sales, you can create a view that only shows the accounts you use for posting sales entries.

:::image type="content" source="media/chart-of-accounts-page.png" alt-text="Example of how the Chart of Accounts page shows finance insights" lightbox="media/chart-of-accounts-page.png":::

To learn more, go to [Understand the Chart of Accounts](finance-general-ledger.md#the-chart-of-accounts).

### Analyze data by dimensions (related to sales)

Dimensions are values that categorize entries so you can track and analyze them on documents, such as sales orders. Dimensions can, for example, indicate the project or department an entry came from.  

So, instead of setting up separate general ledger accounts for each department or location, you can use dimensions as a basis for analysis and avoid having to create a complicated chart of accounts structure.

To learn more, go to [Analyze Data by Dimensions](bi-how-analyze-data-dimension.md).

# Summarize records with Copilot (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]

Use Copilot to get a quick summary of a record, such as a customer, item, or sales order, directly in the page's FactBox pane. Copilot uses AI to generate two or three concise bullet points that provide details and insights about the data tailored to your role in Business Central. The summary helps you understand the data and identify areas that need attention. Interact with the summary to link to data sources and open related pages, so you can act on your data.

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/production-ready-preview-dynamics365.md)]

## Prerequisites

The **Summarize** capability is active, and you have the required permissions to use it. Learn more in [Configure Copilot and agent capabilities](enable-ai.md)

## Supported languages

[!INCLUDE[copilot-language-support-en-only](includes/copilot-language-support-en-only.md)]

## Availability

This feature is available on most card and document pages, like a **Customer card** or a **Sales Order**. If it's not available on a page as expected, it might be hidden. [Learn how to show or hide the summary](#show-or-hide-the-summary).

## Summarize a record

1. Open the record.
1. In the **Summary** part at the top of the FactBox pane on the right side, select the ![Shows the down arrow head icon to expand the FactBox pane.](media/down-arrow-head.png) **Expand summary** icon to generate the summary.

   ![Shows the summary part in the FactBox pane.](media/summary-with-copilot-collapsed.svg)

   > [!TIP]
   > If the **Summary** part is expanded when the page opens, Copilot generates the summary immediately without your interaction. If the **Summary** is expanded when you close the page, Copilot automatically generates the summary the next time you open the page for a record.

1. The summary appears in a moment for you to review and interact with.

   ![Shows the summary part opened in the FactBox pane.](media/summary-with-copilot-opened.svg)

   Review the summary before making any decisions. The content is AI-generated and might be incorrect or inaccurate.

   - Explore the data

     Summaries are based on data from the record, FactBoxes that display related information, and related pages that show aggregated information like statistics pages. Some summary text is linked, so you can go to the data source. Select the links to view details or take action based on the summarized data.

   - Get more insights

     Select the **Show more** button to get more information about the record. The Copilot pane opens on the right side and generates more points of interest.

   - Regenerate the summary

     Select the **Regenerate summary** icon to generate a new summary, updated with changes to the record and related data. The same summary appears for a few minutes before a new one is automatically generated, but you can request a summary from the latest data at any time.

## Show or hide the summary

Business Central remembers whether you collapsed, expanded, or hid the **Summary** the last time you had the page open.

- To show the **Summary** part, select <kbd>...</kbd> **Show more options for FactBox pane** > **Summary** at the top of the FactBox pane.
- To hide the **Summary** part, select <kbd>...</kbd> **Show more options for FactBox pane** > **Summary** at the top of the **Summary** part.
- Because the **Summary** part is in the FactBox pane, it's hidden if the FactBox pane is collapsed. To show the FactBox pane, select the ![Shows the icon to expand the FactBox pane.](media/expand-factbox-icon.png) **Expand FactBox pane** icon.

# Acquire fixed assets

Use the **Fixed Asset Card** page to enter information about an asset. You can set up buildings or production equipment as a main asset with a component list, and you can group them in various ways, such as by class, department, or location. You must set up and assign a depreciation book to each fixed asset before you can acquire it.

After you set up a fixed asset and assign a depreciation book, you must acquire the fixed asset. To acquire a fixed asset, you record its acquisition cost in the relevant G/L account, bank account, or vendor by posting an acquisition transaction from the **Fixed Asset G/L Journal** page. You can use the **Assisted Fixed Asset Acquisition** page to create and post the required general journal lines automatically.

Use indexation to adjust values for general price-level changes. Use the **Index Fixed Assets** batch job to calculate the acquisition costs and replacement costs.

## Add a fixed asset to your list of fixed assets

Before you can acquire a fixed asset, you must add it to your list of assets. There are several ways to add fixed assets to your list:

* Enter information about the assets on the **Fixed Asset Card** page.
* Use the **Edit in Excel** action to download your list of assets to a worksheet, add new assets to the list, and then publish the update to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].
* Use a purchase order to add assets.
* Use the **Copy fixed asset** action.

After you add fixed assets to your list, the next step is to acquire them so you can use them in transactions. Learn more at [Acquire a fixed asset](#acquire-fixed-assets).

### Add a fixed asset on the Fixed Asset Card page

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Fixed Assets**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action, and then fill in the fields on the **General** FastTab as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
3. On the **Depreciation Book** FastTab, fill in the fields as necessary. This step assigns a depreciation book to the fixed asset.  
4. If you need to assign more than one depreciation book to the fixed asset, choose the **Add More Depreciation Books** action. To learn more, go to [To assign a depreciation book to a fixed asset](fa-how-setup-depreciation.md#to-assign-a-depreciation-book-to-a-fixed-asset).

    After you fill in the required fields, the **You are ready to acquire the fixed asset.** notification appears at the top of the page. If you're ready to acquire the asset now, choose the **Acquire** action. Follow the steps on the **Assisted Fixed Asset Acquisition** page to complete the acquisition. If you aren't ready, you can always acquire the asset later.

### Use Edit in Excel to add assets

If you want to add numerous fixed assets, Edit in Excel is a great tool to use. The tool downloads your current list of assets in a worksheet that includes most of the fields available on the Fixed Asset Card page. You can fill in some or all of fields on a row for each asset, and publish your changes to add them to your list in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. If you can't fill in all required field, that's ok. You can update them in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] when you're ready.

> [!NOTE]
> To use the Edit in Excel action, you must have the Microsoft Dynamics Office Add-in installed. The add-in creates the connection between Excel and [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. To learn more, go to [Get the Business Central Add-in for Excel](admin-deploy-excel-addin.md).

3. Open the downloaded file, and enter information about the new fixed assets.

   > [!TIP]
   > You don't need to enter an identifier in the **No.** column. When you publish your update, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] assigns an identifier based on the number series you use for fixed assets.

4. To update [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], on the **Microsoft Dynamics** pane, choose **Publish**.

### Add a fixed asset from a purchase order or invoice

The following steps describe how to add a fixed asset from a purchase order. The steps are similar for a purchase invoice.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Orders**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose **New** to create a new purchase order.
3. On the **General** FastTab, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](../archive/SetupAndAdministration/includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
4. On the **Lines** FastTab, in the **Type** field, choose **Fixed Asset**.
5. In the **No.** field, either choose an existing fixed asset to add an expense, or choose **New** to add a new asset.
6. After you enter the information for the new asset and the purchase order, choose **Post**.

## Acquire a fixed asset by using a fixed asset G/L journal

The following procedure describes how to acquire by creating and posting the required fixed asset G/L journal lines. You can also create and post the journal lines manually. To learn more, go to [Acquire a fixed asset by using a fixed asset G/L journal](#acquire-a-fixed-asset-by-using-a-fixed-asset-gl-journal).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Fixed Assets**, and then choose the related link.
1. Choose the asset you want to acquire, and then choose the **Acquire** action.
1. Follow the steps on the **Assisted Fixed Asset Acquisition** page to complete the acquisition.

> [!NOTE]  
> You can also post acquisition cost as credits. In that case, remember that the value in the **Acquisition Cost Incl. VAT** field must be with a minus sign to indicate a credit.

When you choose **Finish**, the **Book Value** field on the **Fixed Asset Card** page is filled in, which indicates that the fixed asset was acquired at the specified acquisition cost.  

## To post a fixed asset acquisition manually with a fixed asset G/L journal

The following procedure describes how to acquire a fixed asset manually by creating and posting lines on the **Fixed Asset G/L Journal** page. You can also acquire a fixed asset automatically on the **Fixed Asset Card** page by choosing the **Acquire fixed asset** action. To learn more, go to [Acquire a fixed asset](#acquire-fixed-assets).

> [!NOTE]  
> You can also post acquisition cost as credits. In that case, remember that the value in the **Amount** field must be with a minus sign to indicate a credit.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Fixed Asset G/L Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Fixed Asset G/L Journal** page, in the **FA Posting Type** field, select **Acquisition Cost**.
3. Fill in the remaining fields as necessary.
4. Choose the **Post** action.  

> [!TIP]  
> If you fill in the **Insurance No.** field, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] also posts the acquisition cost of the fixed asset to the insurance coverage ledger. To learn more, go to [Insure Fixed Assets](fa-how-insure.md).

## To set up a component list for a main asset

You can group your fixed assets into main assets and their components. For example, you might have a production machine that consists of several parts that you want to group in this manner.  

You must set up the main asset and all its components as individual fixed asset. After you set up a component list, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically fills in the **Main Assets/Component** and **Components of Main Asset** fields on the fixed assets.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Fixed Assets**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the fixed asset that is the main asset, and then choose the **Main Asset Components** action.
3. On the **Main Asset Components** page, choose the **FA No**. field, and then select the fixed asset that you want to add as a component of the main asset.
4. Close the page.
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 for each component asset that you want to add.
6. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Fixed Asset Setup**, and then choose the related link.
7. Turn on the **Allow Posting to Main Assets** toggle.

## To cancel an acquisition cost posting for one fixed asset

For example, if you post an acquisition with the wrong date, you must correct it as soon as possible because the fixed asset posting date is used for many calculations.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> You can't use the **Reverse Transactions** action for fixed asset entries.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **FA Ledger Entries**, and then choose the related link.  
2. In the **FA Ledger Entries** page, select the entry or entries that you want to cancel.  
3. Choose the **Actions** menu, and then choose the **Cancel Entries** action.
4. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
5. Choose the **OK** button to run the batch job.
6. When the incorrect entry or entries are canceled, proceed to post the correct acquisition cost.

## To post the salvage value together with the acquisition cost

The salvage value is the residual value of a fixed asset when it can no longer be used. You can post the salvage value at the same time as you post the acquisition cost. To learn more, go to [Depreciate or Amortize Fixed Assets](fa-how-depreciate-amortize.md).

You can post the salvage value together with the acquisition cost from a fixed asset journal.

> [!NOTE]
> This process might require that you personalize the Fixed Asset Journals page by adding the Salvage Value field. By default, the field is not displayed on the page. To learn more, go to [Personalize Your Workspace](ui-personalization-user.md).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Fixed Asset Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Fixed Asset Journals** page, create the acquisition line. To learn more, go to [To post a fixed asset acquisition manually with a fixed asset G/L journal](#to-post-a-fixed-asset-acquisition-manually-with-a-fixed-asset-gl-journal).
3. In the **Salvage Value** field on the journal line, enter the salvage value amount as a credit (prefix the amount with a minus sign, for example, **-**100).
4. Choose the **Post** action.

> [!NOTE]
> If a salvage value exists for a fixed asset, that value is used in depreciation posting instead of the value in the **Ending Book Value** field on the **FA Depreciation Books** page. To learn more, go to [To manage the ending book value](fa-how-depreciate-amortize.md#to-manage-the-ending-book-value).

# Sustainability certificates

In today’s business landscape, sustainability is more than a trend - it’s a necessity. As companies strive to reduce their environmental impact and meet growing consumer demand for responsible practices, sustainability certificates are now an essential tool for validating these efforts. These certificates serve as an independent verification that a company or its products meet specific environmental, social, and governance (ESG) standards, fostering trust and transparency in the marketplace.  

Sustainability certificates offer a clear and measurable way to assess the environmental and ethical credentials of both companies and their products. By prioritizing vendors who hold recognized sustainability certifications, businesses can enhance their supply chain integrity, reduce risks, and contribute to a more sustainable future.

Sustainability certificates for companies cover a wide range of criteria, including resource efficiency, waste management, emissions reduction, and social responsibility. Similarly for products, these certifications ensure that items meet stringent environmental standards, from raw material sourcing to manufacturing processes and end-of-life disposal. 

## Sustainability certificate area 

The *sustainability certificate area* refers to the specific area covered by a particular certificate. Generally, this method is used to categorize similar certificates based on distinct characteristics. To create new sustainability certificate area, follow these steps:   

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sust. Certificate Areas**, and then select the related link.
2. On the **Sust. Certificate Areas** page, select **New**, and enter the **Number** and **Name** fields for new certificate area. 
3. Close the page.   

## Sustainability certificate standards

The *Sustainability certificate standard* refers to the specific standard for a particular certificate. Generally, it should provide third-party verified, transparent, and measurable criteria aligned with international ESG frameworks to promote responsible business practices. To create new sustainability certificate standard, follow these steps: 

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sust. Certificate Standards**, and then select the related link.
2. On the **Sust. Certificate Standards** page, select **New**, and enter the **Number** and **Name** fields for new certificate standard. 
3. Close the page.  

## Create a sustainability certificate 

To create a new sustainability certificate, follow these steps:   

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sustainability Certificates**, and then select the related link.

3. In the **Type** field, choose if this certificate is related to vendors or items, and enter the **No.** and **Name** fields.
4. In the **Area** field, choose specific **Sust. Certificate Area** option and in the **Standard** field, choose adequate **Sust. Certificate Standard**.
5. In the **Issuer** field, specify the issuer name. 
Sustainability certificates are typically issued by independent third-party organizations, which can include non-profit certifying bodies, industry associations, standards organizations, or specialized sustainability certification firms. The issuers are responsible for assessing compliance with established sustainability standards.
1. If this certificate has a measurable value, enable the **Has Value** field and enter the **Value**.   

> [!NOTE]
> You can also create a new sustainabilty directly from the vendor or item card. In this case, the **Type** field is automatically prepopulated as an Item or Vendor based on where you create the certificate.

# Sustainability value chain in purchasing

The requirement for enabling the us of the sustainability value chain in the purchase process is to enable the following fields on the **Sustainability Setup** page:

- **Enable Value Chain tracking** to enable value chain capabilities in all processes.  
- **Use Emissions In Purchase Documents** to enable emission fields in the purchase document lines.

To do so, follow next steps:

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sustainability Setup**, and then select the related link.
2. Check whether the basic setup already exists. If it doesn't, follow [these instructions](finance-sustainability-setup.md) to set it up.  
3. On the **Procurement** FastTab, fill in the fields that are related to the sustainability value chain features.  
   1. Select the **Use Emissions In Purchase Documents** field.
   2. Select the **Enable Value Chain tracking** field.
4. Close the page.

## Work with purchase documents

To learn how to work with purchase documents in sustainability, go to [How to record emissions with purchase documents](finance-sustainability-journal.md#purchase-documents).  

If you enabled the value chain on the **Sustainability Setup** page, and created a purchase document with the **Sustainability Accounts** and emissions (minimum one emission), [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically starts the sustainability value chain and posts details to the **Sustainability Value Entries** page.  

> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] only creates sustainability value entries for items. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't support emissions from item charges.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Because the sustainability value chain works only with the carbon equivalent (CO2e), before you start, configure carbon equivalent factors on the Emission Fees page. To learn more, go to [Emission fees](value-chain-howto-setup.md#emission-fees).  

After you post the purchase documents, the results display on the **Posted Purchase Invoice** or **Posted Purchase Credit Memo** pages. To review the results, use the **Find entries** action. In the list of entries, find the sustainability value entry. To open a list of value chain transactions related to your purchase documents, select the entry.  

When you post the document, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] also updates the **CO2e per Unit** field for all items in your purchase document. If the purchase document was the first for this item, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses the value from document. If you already had documents, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses the average model to calculate the **CO2e per Unit** value for your item.

This article lists and describes the key performance indicators (KPIs) included in the semantic model for the Power BI Sales app. The descriptions include how the app calculates KPIs and the data it uses for its calculations.

Explore the KPIs to learn more about how they can help you achieve your business goals.

[!INCLUDE[powerbi-tip-track-kpis](includes/powerbi-tip-track-kpis.md)]


## Customer Table

**Customer Measures**

- [No. of Customers](#no-of-customers)
- [No. of Lost Customers](#no-of-lost-customers)
- [No. of New Customers](#no-of-new-customers)
- [No. of Recovered Customers](#no-of-recovered-customers)
- [No. of Returning Customers](#no-of-returning-customers)
- [Sales Lost Customers (12M)](#sales-lost-customers-12m)
- [Sales New Customers](#sales-new-customers)
- [Sales Recovered Customers](#sales-recovered-customers)
- [Sales Returning Customers](#sales-returning-customers)

### No. of Customers

**Formula**  

Distinct count of the **Customer No.** column from the **Sales** table.

**Data Sources**

- Value Entries
- Sales Line

### No. of Lost Customers

**Formula**  

This measure calculates the number of customers who were "lost" (stopped purchasing) within the current date selection. It determines the latest date in the selection, prepares a table of customers and their associated "lost" dates, and then filters out the customers whose lost date is within the selected date range. Finally, it counts the rows in this filtered table to get the number of lost customers.

**Data Sources**

- Value Entries
- Sales Line

### No. of New Customers

**Formula**  

This measure counts new customers by finding the date of their first purchase. It includes customers if their first purchase happened within the date selection.

**Data Sources**

- Value Entries
- Sales Line

### No. of Recovered Customers

**Formula**  

This measure calculates the number of customers who were temporarily "lost" (stopped purchasing) but later made a new purchase. It identifies customers who had a "lost" date before the selected date range, then determines which customers made a new purchase within the current period. The measure filters and counts only those customers whose new purchase occurred after their lost date, returning the total number of recovered customers.

**Data Sources**

- Value Entries
- Sales Line

### No. of Returning Customers

**Formula**  

This measure calculates the number of customers who made a repeat purchase during the current period. It identifies existing customers by filtering customers whose first purchase was before the selected date range, then determines which of these customers made another purchase within the current period. The measure returns the count of these returning customers.

**Data Sources**

- Value Entries
- Sales Line

### Sales Lost Customers (12M)

**Formula**  

This measure calculates the total sales lost over the past 12 months due to customers who stopped purchasing ("lost" customers). It first identifies the most recent "lost" date, then filters customers who were lost before that date. It gets the sales from the previous 12 months for these lost customers and calculates the total revenue they generated before they stopped purchasing.

**Data Sources**

- Value Entries
- Sales Line

### Sales New Customers

**Formula**  

This measure calculates the total sales from customers who made their first purchase within the current date range. It identifies each customer's first purchase date, filters out customers whose first purchase occurred during the selected period, and then sums the sales amount from those new customers.

**Data Sources**

- Value Entries
- Sales Line

### Sales Recovered Customers

**Formula**  

This measure calculates the total sales generated by recovered customers. Recovered customers were previously lost but made a purchase afterward. It identifies temporarily lost customers, checks whether they made a new purchase in the current period, and then sums the sales figures for them.

**Data Sources**

- Value Entries
- Sales Line

### Sales Returning Customers

**Formula**  

This measure calculates the total sales generated by returning customers. Returning customers are customers who made their first purchase before the current period and made more purchases in the current period. It identifies returning customers by finding the intersection of active customers and customers who purchased previously, and then sums the sales from these returning customers.

**Data Sources**

- Value Entries
- Sales Line

Depending on which level is active, it returns the corresponding sales amount, which is either:

- Previous month (Sales Amount PM (Fiscal))
- Previous quarter (Sales Amount PQ (Fiscal))
- Previous year (Sales Amount PY (Fiscal))

**Data Sources**

- Value Entries
- Sales Line
- Date (Fiscal Calendar)

### Sales Amount POP (Fiscal)

**Formula**  

This measure calculates the change in sales between the current period and the previous period based on the context of the fiscal calendar. It uses the SWITCH function to determine the appropriate previous period calculation depending on whether the current context is at the fiscal month, quarter, or year level. When at the fiscal month level, it references the month-over-month change from the Sales Amount MOM (Fiscal) measure, which computes the difference between the current month's sales and the previous month's sales. Similarly, for fiscal quarters and years, it uses quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year calculations, respectively.

**Data Sources**

- Value Entries
- Sales Line

### Sales Amount POP % (Fiscal)

**Formula**  

This measure calculates the percentage growth in sales between the current and previous period based on the context of the fiscal calendar. It uses the SWITCH function to determine the appropriate previous period calculation depending on whether the current context is at the fiscal month, quarter, or year level. When at the fiscal month level, it references the month-over-month change from the Sales Amount MOM % (Fiscal) measure, which determines the percentage growth between the current month's sales and the previous month's sales. Similarly, for fiscal quarters and years, it uses quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year calculations, respectively.

# Sign up for a free Dynamics 365 Business Central trial

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers a free trial. There are two ways to access the trial version, depending on your location. If you are in a country where Microsoft offers official localization, you can follow one path. If you are in a country where localization is handled by partners, you'll need to follow a different path. Explore the different types of localization [here](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/compliance/apptest-countries-and-translations). After a quick sign-up, you'll have access to many of the app's key features. The trial allows you to test the app with sample data. If you want to try out things with your own data, you'll switch to a free 30-day trial. [Learn more about Business Central features](across-business-functionality.md).  

## Start the trial in Microsoft-based localizations 

You can find your free [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] trial on the **[Dynamics 365 Business Central product](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics-365/products/business-central)** page. You just need to follow the steps and you'll get trial localized version tailored for your location. If you want eventually to try different localization, you can do it in the sandbox. 

<!--## To sign up for the trial-->

[!INCLUDE [trial-get](includes/trial-get.md)]

## Start with the trial in location with partner-based localizations  

In countries where Microsoft doesn't offer built-in localization, obtaining a localized version by default isn't possible due to localization being managed by partners. Consequently, Microsoft can only provide the standard base app, typically without localization or translation. To avoid confusion not offering all local requirements and the language, we have different path of getting trial version, so you can have full local experience.  

You can get your trial version following these steps:

1. You must run "Find your partner" on [Microsoft web site](https://partner.microsoft.com/partnership/find-a-partner) or ask local Microsoft office for advice. 
2. Microsoft can help you find a partner for you or you might have already found a partner based on your experience. 
3. You might offer your partner for the trial version and then partner goes to CSP.  
   1. Finds or adds customer tenant.   
   2. Assigns the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Trial SKU in CSP. 
   3. Assigns the localization and translation, and eventually assigns translated demo data to the created tenant. 
   4. Sends customer link to the environment.   
   5. The test trial environment will be accessible. 

> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft doesn't oversee how partners set up the trial environment or what specific elements are included. While Microsoft offers recommendations, partners have the flexibility to implement them in their own way. Using a trial version from one partner doesn't obligate you to purchase a license from them, and you can always choose to switch partners at any time.  

## What to try

Your trial environment includes the same features as the paid version. The links below guide you through some of the key features.

- [Overview of business functionality](across-business-functionality.md)  
- [Get started](ui-get-ready-business.md#get-started)  
- [Get productive](ui-work-product.md)  
- [Quick starts](quick-start-business-central.md)  

## Get started with a subscription

Each time you sign in during the trial period, a notification in a blue bar at the top displays the time remaining. If you decide to subscribe, find a [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] partner. For more information, see [How do I find a reselling partner?](/dynamics365/business-central/across-faq#how-do-i-find-a-reselling-partner). The reselling partner can help you set up [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to fit your business, including importing your data from your previous system. You can also customize [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] by adding apps from [the Microsoft commercial marketplace](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2081646).  

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online uses Microsoft 365. If your company uses a different type of email setup, the reselling partner can help you decided how to migrate, or if you should use [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises.  

You can also contact the [[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Sales team](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=828707).

# Work with item attributes

When customers inquire about an item, either in correspondence or in an integrated web shop, they might ask or search according to characteristics, such as height and model year. To provide this customer service, you can assign item attribute values of different types to your items, which can then be used when searching for items.

You can also assign item attributes to item categories, which then apply to the items that use the item categories. For more information, see [Categorize Item](inventory-how-categorize-items.md).

> [!TIP]  
> If you attach pictures to items, the Image Analyzer extension can detect attributes in the image, and suggest the attributes so you can decide whether to assign them. The extension is ready to go. You just need to enable it. For more information, see [The Image Analyzer Extension](ui-extensions-image-analyzer.md).

# Couple and synchronize records between Dataverse and Business Central

This article describes how to couple one or more records in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with records in Dataverse or [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]. Coupling records lets you view Dataverse information from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], and vice versa. The coupling also enables you to synchronize data between the records. You can couple existing records, or create and couple new records.

> [!NOTE]
> Coupling and synchronizing data is available only if your system administrator creates a connection between [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and Dataverse or [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]. A quick way to check is to open the **Customer** card and look for the **Set Up Coupling** action. If the action is available, the apps are connected.

<!--## Video Example

This video shows coupling and synchronizing data in the context of an integration with [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)].

> [!VIDEO https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2098376] -->

## To couple a record  

1. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], open the card for the record you want to couple. For example, the Customer Card or Contact Card pages.  

    You can also just open the list page and select the record that you want to couple.  

2. Choose the **Set Up Coupling** action.  
3. Fill in the fields, and then choose **OK**.  

## To synchronize a single record  

1. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], open the card for the record you want to couple. For example, the Customer Card or Contact Card pages.  
2. Choose the **Synchronize Now** action.  
3. If a record can synchronize in one direction, select the option that specifies the direction of data update, and then choose **OK**.  

## To synchronize a single record from [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]  

1. In [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)], open the form for the record you want to couple. For example, the Account or Contact pages.  
2. Choose the **[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]** action in the ribbon to open and couple records automatically.

    > [!Note]
    > You can synchronize a single record from [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)] automatically only when **Sync. Only Coupled Records** is disabled and the synchronization direction is set to **Bidirectional** or **From Integration Table** on the **Integration Table Mapping** page for the record. To learn more, go to [Mapping the Tables and Fields to Synchronize](admin-how-to-modify-table-mappings-for-synchronization.md#create-new-records).

## To couple multiple records using match-based coupling

Specify the data to synchronize for an entity, such as a customer or contact, by coupling records based on matches. Refine the matches by making the search case sensitive, and assigning a priority for each match. If no match is found, you can also specify that you want to create the entity in Dataverse. To learn more, go to [Customize the match-based coupling](admin-how-to-set-up-a-dynamics-crm-connection.md#customize-the-match-based-coupling).  

> [!NOTE]
> The match-based coupling process skips records that are already matched. To include those records when you run match-based coupling, uncouple the records and then try again. To learn more about uncoupling records, go to [Uncoupling Records](#uncoupling-records).

1. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], open the list page for the record, such as the Customers or Contacts list pages.
2. Choose the **Match-Based Coupling** action.
3. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

## To synchronize multiple records  

1. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], open the list page for the record, such as the Customers or Contacts pages.  
2. Select the records that you want to synchronize, and then choose the **Synchronize Now** action.  
3. If records can synchronize in one direction, select the option that specifies the direction, and then choose **OK**.  

## Bulk-insert and couple records

If you have many Dataverse entities that correspond to records in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can insert and couple them in-bulk. For example, you might want to bulk-insert and couple records when you're setting up synchronization for the first time.

Use the **Data import wizard** in the **Microsoft Power Platform admin center**.

The following example describes how to bulk-insert and couple customers with accounts in Dataverse. Use the same process for other types of entities, such as vendors, items, and resources.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customers**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **Open in Excel** action to open customer data in Excel.
3. To map and import data to the **Account** entity in Dataverse, follow the steps described in [Import data (all record types) from multiple sources](/power-platform/admin/import-data-all-record-types).  

    If the Account entity has a **bcbi_companyid** column, when you map the data columns make sure that the import assigns the appropriate company ID in the column for every imported record. To find the company ID in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], follow these steps:

    1. Open the **Integration Table Mappings** page.
    2. Choose the **CUSTOMER** mapping, and then choose **Edit List**.
    3. Choose the assist edit :::image type="icon" source="media/assist-edit-icon.png" border="false"::: button in the **Integration Table Filter** field. This shows the default filter for customer mapping, and it contains the company ID. The company ID is the first part of the value. Copy only that part, and disregard the 0s. The following example highlights the part to copy.

    :::image type="content" source="media/dataverse-company-id-guid.png" alt-text="Shows the part of the company ID to copy.":::

    > [!NOTE]
    > Not all of the names of Dataverse entities and [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] records match. Depending on what you're importing, double-check that the following columns have the following values after you import:
    >
    >* For customers, the **CustomerTypeCode** column should contain **Customer**.
    >* For vendors, the **CustomerTypeCode** column should contain **Vendors**. 
    >* For items, **ProductTypeCode** column should contain **Sales Inventory**.
    >* For resources, the **ProductTypeCode** column should contain **Service**.
 
4. After you import data to the Dataverse environment, in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], follow the steps [To couple multiple records using match-based coupling](#to-couple-multiple-records-using-match-based-coupling) to couple the Dataverse entities with [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] records.

## Uncoupling Records

You can uncouple one or more records from list pages or the **Coupled Data Synchronization Errors** page by choosing one or more lines and choosing **Delete Coupling**. You can also remove all couplings for one or more table mappings on the **Integration Table Mappings** page.

# Design Details: Posting Date on Adjustment Value Entry

This article provides guidance for users of the Inventory Costing functionality in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], and in particular for how the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job identifies and assigns a posting date to the value entries that the batch job is about to create.

## How posting dates are assigned

The **Adjust Cost – Item Entries** batch job assigns a posting date to the value entry it is about to create in the following steps:  

1. Initially the Posting Date of the entry to be created is the same date as the entry it adjusts.  

2. The Posting Date is validated against Inventory Periods and/or General Ledger Setup.  

3. Assignment of Posting Date; If the initial Posting Date is not within allowed posting date range the batch job will assign an allowed Posting Date from either General Ledger Setup or Inventory Period. If both Inventory Periods and allowed posting dates in General Ledger Setup are defined, the later date of the two will be assigned to the Adjustment Value Entry.  

Let’s review this process more in practice. Assume we have an Item Ledger Entry of Sale. The item was shipped on September 5, 2020 and it was invoiced the day after.  

#### Item Ledger Entry

|Entry No.  |Item No.  |Posting Date  |Entry Type  | Document No. |Location Code  |Quantity  |Cost Amount (Actual)  |Invoiced Quantity  |Remaining Quantity  |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|319     |A         |2020-09-05     |  Sale       |102033     |  Blue       | -1    |    -11     |-1     |    0     |

Below are the related value entries:

- **Entry No. 379** represents the shipment and carry the same Posting Date as the parent Item ledger Entry.  
- **Entry No. 381** represents the invoice.  
- **Entry No. 391** is an Adjustment of the invoicing Value Entry (Entry No. 381 above).  

|Entry No.  |Item No.  |Posting Date  |Item Ledger Entry Type  |Entry Type  |Document No.  |Item Ledger Entry No.  |Location Code  |Item Ledger Entry Quantity  |Invoiced Quantity  |Cost Amount (Actual)  |Cost Amount (Expected)  |Adjustment  |Applies-to Entry  |Source Code  |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|--------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|379     |  A       |    2020-09-05     |    Sale     | Direct Cost   | 102033        |319     | Blue        | -1       |0         |  0       |     -10   |No   |0    |Sales          |
|381     |  A       |    2020-09-06     |    Sale     | Direct Cost   | 103022        |319     | Blue        |  0       |-1        |-10       |    10     | No  |0      |       Sales   |
|391     |  A       |    2020-09-10     |    Sale     | Direct Cost   | 103022        |319     | Blue        |  0       |0         |-1        |    0     |Yes   |    181   | INVTADJMT   |

To assign the posting date for **Entry No. 391** the following steps were applied:

1. The **Adjustment Value Entry** to be created (**Entry No. 391**) is assigned same **Posting Date** as the entry it adjusts.

2. The **Adjust Cost – Item Entries** batch job determines if the initial Posting Date of the Adjustment Value Entry is within allowed posting date range based upon Inventory Periods and/or General Ledger Setup.  

Let’s review the above mentioned Sale by adding setup of allowed posting date ranges.  
  
#### Inventory Periods

|Ending Date  |Name  |Closed  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|2020-01-31     |January 2020      |  Yes    |
|2020-02-28     |February 2020     |  Yes    |
|2020-03-31     |March 2020        |  Yes    |
|2020-04-30     |April 2020        |  Yes    |
|2020-05-31     |May   2020        |  Yes    |
|2020-06-30     |June   2020       |  Yes    |
|2020-07-31     |July  2020        |  Yes    |
|2020-08-31     |August   2020     |  Yes    |
|2020-09-30     |September   2020  |         |
|2020-10-31     |October   2020    |         |
|2020-11-30     |November   2020   |         |
|2020-12-31     |December   2020   |         |

The first allowed posting date is the first day in the first open period, which is September 1, 2020.  

#### General Ledger Setup

|Field|Value  |
|---------|---------|
|Allow Posting From:  |  2020-09-10      |
|Allow Posting To:    |  2020-09-30      |
|Register Time:       |         |
|Local Address Format:|   Post Code      |  

The first allowed posting date is the date stated in field **Allow Posting From**: September 10, 2020. If both Inventory Periods and allowed posting dates in **General Ledger Setup** are defined, the later date of the two will define the allowed posting date range.  

**Assignment of an allowed posting date**  

The initial assigned Posting Date was September 6 as illustrated in step 1. However, in the second step the Adjust Cost – Item entries batch job identifies that earliest allowed Posting Date is September 10 and thereby assigns September 10 to the Adjustment Value Entry (**Entry No. 391**), below.  


|Entry No.  |Item No.  |Posting Date  |Item Ledger Entry Type  |Entry Type  |Document No.  |Item Ledger Entry No.  |Location Code  |Item Ledger Entry Quantity  |Invoiced Quantity  |Cost Amount (Actual)  |Cost Amount (Expected)  |Adjustment  |Applies-to Entry  |Source Code  |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|379     |  A       |    2020-09-05     |    Sale     | Direct Cost   | 102033        |319     | Blue        | -1       |0         |  0       |     -10   |No   |0    |Sales          |
|381     |  A       |    2020-09-06     |    Sale     | Direct Cost   | 103022        |319     | Blue        |  0       |-1        |-10       |    10     | No  |0      |       Sales   |
|391     |  A       |    **2020-09-10**     |    Sale     | Direct Cost   | 103022        |319     | Blue        |  0       |0         |-1        |    0     |Yes   |    181   | INVTADJMT   |

## Common problems with the "Adjust Cost - Item entries"-batch job

There are two scenarios that the support team encounters frequently enough for them to warrant their own problem resolution articles.

### Error message: "Posting Date is not within your range of allowed posting dates…"

If you encounter this error you need to adjust the dates for which the user is allowed to post entries. To learn more, see [Error Message "Posting Date is not within your range of allowed posting dates"](design-details-inventory-adjustment-value-entry-allowed-posting-dates.md).

### Posting Date on Adjustment Value Entry versus Posting Date on entry causing the adjustment such as Revaluation or Item charge

To learn more, see [Posting Date on Adjustment Value Entry Compared to the Source Entry](design-details-inventory-adjustment-value-entry-source-entry.md).

# Send documents and emails

You can easily share information and documents, such as sales and purchase orders and invoices, by email directly from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], without having to open an email app.  

You can send almost all types of documents as PDF attachments. Alternatively, you can set up a report layout that includes information from the document in the email text, along with text that makes the email more friendly, for example, a standard greeting. For more information, see [Managing Report and Document Layouts](ui-manage-report-layouts.md).

When you send invoices, you can make it easier for customers to make payments through a payment service, such as PayPal, by automatically adding information and a link to the service in the email. For more information, see [Enable Customer Payments Through Payment Services](sales-how-enable-payment-service-extensions.md).

To enable emails from within [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], start the **Set Up Email** assisted setup guide. For more information, see [Set Up Email](admin-how-setup-email.md).

> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports only outbound email communications. You cannot also receive replies from within the app.

## To send documents by email

This procedure describes how attach a posted sales invoice to an email as a PDF file, and with document-specific email text. The steps are the same for other documents.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Posted Sales Invoices**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the invoice, choose the **Print/Send** action, and then choose **Send by Email**.
3. In the **Email** field, choose **Yes (Prompt for Settings)**. For more information, see [Set Up Document Sending Profiles](sales-how-setup-document-send-profiles.md).

    If the **Email** field on the **Send Document to** page is set to **Yes (Prompt for Settings)**, then the **Send Email** page opens pre-filled with the contact person in the **To:** field and the document attached as a PDF file. In the **Body** field, you can either enter text manually or you can have the field filled with a document-specific email body that you have set up.

4. Choose the **OK** button.
5. In the **To:** field, enter a valid email address. The default value is the customer email address.
6. In the **Subject** field, enter a descriptive subject text. The default value is the customer name and invoice number.
7. In the **Attachment** field, the generated invoice is attached by default as a PDF file.
8. In the **Body** field, enter a short message to the recipient.

    If a document-specific email text is set up on the **Report Selection - Sales** page, the **Body** field is filled in automatically. For more information, see [Set Up Reusable Email Texts and Layouts](admin-how-setup-email.md#set-up-reusable-email-texts-and-layouts).
9. Choose the **OK** button to send the email message.

> [!NOTE]  
> If you do not want to specify email settings each time you email a document, you can select the **Yes (Use Default Settings)** option in the **Email** field on the **Send Document to** page. In that case, the **Send Email** page will not open. See Step 4. For more information, see [Set Up Document Sending Profiles](sales-how-setup-document-send-profiles.md).  

## To compose and send an email

You can quickly compose emails for contacts, customers, vendors, salespeople/purchasers, and bank accounts directly from the pages for those entities. Just choose **Process**, and then **Send Email** to open the email editor. For bank accounts, the **Send Email** action is under **Actions**.

> [!TIP]
> If you often send email messages that are similar in nature, or want to send a bulk communication, for example, to advertise a sales campaign, using Word templates with email can speed up the process. You can create a template for an entities such as customers, vendors, and contacts, that will generate the content of an email message for you, and even personalize the content for the recipient based on data in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For more information, see [Use Word Templates for Bulk Communication](ui-mail-merge.md).  

### Attach a document to an email

There are several ways to attach documents to emails.

If you're assigned to an email scenario related to the entity you're sending the email to, or the document you're sending, an attachment might be automatically added to your message. That's because a default attachment has been assigned to the email scenario. You can delete the attachment if you don't want to send it with your message. For more information, see [Assign Email Scenarios to Email Accounts](admin-how-setup-email.md#assign-email-scenarios-to-email-accounts). 

To attach a file yourself, in the email editor, use the following actions:

* Choose **Add file** to select a file.
* Choose **Add files from default selection** to manually add a file that's associated with the email scenario.
* Choose **Add file from source document** to choose a file that's attached to the document you're working with. The files are either attached to the document itself, or one or more of its lines.

## Documents marked as printed when they are sent

Some documents in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] have a field that specifies how many times the document has been printed. The number in that field <!--"that field?" need a name...--> is also updated if you send the document by email because a PDF file is generated for it. The number is updated even if you don't send the email. <!--guessing this is because emails are technically reports, so the counter bumps up whenever someone creates an email. Need to verify.-->

## Sent emails and your email outbox

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] stores the emails that you send on the **Sent Items** page. That's to let you resend emails, or forward them to someone else. If you can't find an email in your sent items, look for it on the **Email Outbox** page. 

> [!NOTE]
> Depending on the extension that your company uses for email, administrators can see a list of messages that everyone has sent, but not the content of the messages

The **Email Outbox** is where you'll find the emails that you saved as drafts, and emails that failed to send, for example, if the email address was invalid. For messages that failed to send, you can choose **Show Error** or **Investigate Error** to troubleshoot the problem.

# Purchasing

You create a purchase invoice or purchase order to record the cost of purchases and to track accounts payable. If you need to control an inventory, purchase invoices are also used to dynamically update inventory levels so that you can minimize your inventory costs and provide better customer service. The purchasing costs, including service expenses, and inventory values that result from posting purchase invoices contribute to profit figures and other financial KPIs on your Role Center.

You must use purchase orders if your purchasing process requires that you record partial receipts of an order quantity, for example, because the full quantity wasn't available at the vendor. If you sell items by delivering directly from your vendor to your customer, as a drop shipment, then you must also use purchase orders. For more information, see [Make Drop Shipments](sales-how-drop-shipment.md). In all other aspects, purchase orders work the same way as purchase invoices.

You can have purchase invoices created automatically by using the OCR (Optical Character Recognition) service to convert PDF invoices from your vendors to electronic documents, which are then converted to purchase invoices by a workflow. To use this functionality, you must first sign up for the OCR service, and then perform various setups. For more information, see [Incoming Documents](across-income-documents.md).

Products can be both inventory items and services. For more information, see [Register New Items](inventory-how-register-new-items.md).

For all purchase processes, you can incorporate an approval workflow, for example, to require that large purchases are approved by the accounting manager. For more information, see [Use Approval Workflows](across-how-use-approval-workflows.md).

The following sections describe a sequence of tasks, with links to the articles that cover them.

# Troubleshoot synchronization errors

There are lots of moving parts involved in integrating [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)], and sometimes things go wrong. This article points out some of the typical errors that occur and gives some pointers for how to fix them.

Errors often occur either because of something that a user did to coupled records, or something is wrong with how the integration is set up. For errors related to coupled records, users can resolve them themselves. Causes for these errors are often actions, such as deleting data in one, but not both, business apps and then synchronizing. For more information, see [View the Status of a Synchronization](admin-how-to-view-synchronization-status.md).

Errors that are related to how the integration is set up typically require an administrator's attention. You can view these errors on the **Integration Synchronization Errors** page. 

The following table provides examples of typical issues:  

|Issue  |Resolution  |
|---------|---------|
|The permissions and roles assigned to the integration user aren't correct. | This error comes from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] and it often includes the following text, **Principal user (Id=\<user id>, type=8) is missing \<privilegeName> privilege**. This error happens because the integration user is missing a privilege that allows it to access an entity. Typically, this error happens if you're synchronizing custom entities, or if you have an app installed in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] that requires permission to access other [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] entities. To resolve this error, assign the permission to the integration user in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)].<br><br> You can find the integration user name on the **Dataverse Connection Setup** page. The error message provides the name of the permission, which can help you identify the entity for which you need permission. To add the missing privilege, sign in to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/cds_long_md.md)] with an administrator account and edit the security role assigned to the integration user. For more information, see [Create or edit a security role to manage access](/power-platform/admin/create-edit-security-role). |
|You're coupling a record that uses another record that isn't coupled. For example, a customer whose currency isn't coupled or an item for which the unit of measure isn't coupled. | You must first couple the dependent record, for example, a currency or unit of measure, and then retry the coupling. |
|Your connection to Dataverse paused during synchronization. For example, because your session timed out. When that happens, the following error displays when you resume your session: _Table connection for table type CRM must be registered using RegisterTableConnection or cmdlet New-NAVTableConnection before it can be used._|* For session timeouts, refresh the page to reconnect to Dataverse. The error message disappears.<br><br>* For an issue in the code, for example, if you're using a custom page to show data from a Dataverse entity, contact your Microsoft partner or support. When you do, use the **Copy details** action to share details about the error. |

# Collect payments with SEPA Direct Debit

With your customer's consent, you can collect payments directly from the customer's bank account according to the SEPA format.  

First, set up the export format of the bank file that instructs your bank to perform a direct debit. Then, set up the customer's payment method. Last, set up the direct-debit mandate that reflects your agreement with the customer to collect their payments in a certain agreement period.  

To instruct the bank to transfer the payment amount from the customer's bank account to your company's account, you create a direct-debit collection entry, which holds information about bank accounts, the affected sales invoices, and the direct-debit mandate. You then export an XML file that is based on the collection entry, which you send to your bank for processing. Any payments that couldn't be processed will be communicated to you by your bank, and you must then manually reject the direct debit-collection entries in question.  

You can set up standard customer sales codes with the direct-debit payment method and mandate information. You can then use the **Create Standard Cust. Invoices** batch job to generate multiple sales invoices with the direct-debit information prefilled. This is can be done manually or automatically, according to the payment due date.  

When payments are successfully processed, as communicated by your bank, you can post the payment receipts either directly from the **Direct Debit Collect. Entries** page or by moving the payment lines to the journal where you post payment receipts, such as the **Cash Receipt Journals** page. Alternatively, depending on your cash management process, you can wait and just apply the payments as a part of bank reconciliation.  

> [!NOTE]  
> To collect payments using SEPA Direct Debit, the currency on the sales invoice must be EURO.  

## How to set up SEPA Direct Debit

From the **Direct Debit Collections** page, you can export instructions to your electronic bank to perform a direct debit collection from the customer's bank account to your bank account according to the SEPA Direct Debit format.

> [!NOTE]
> The global version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports the SEPA direct debit format only. Your country/region version may support other formats for electronic payment. See under **Local Functionality** in the table of contents.  

To enable export of a bank file format that aren't supported out of the box in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can set up a data exchange definition by using the data exchange framework. For more information, see [Set Up Data Exchange Definitions](across-how-to-set-up-data-exchange-definitions.md).  

Before you can process customer payments electronically by exporting direct debit instructions in the SEPA Direct Debit format, you must perform the following setup steps:  

* Set up the export format of the bank file that instructs your bank to perform a direct debit collection from the customer's bank account to your bank account.  
* Set up the customer's payment method.  
* Set up the direct-debit mandate that reflects your agreement with the customer to collect their payments in a certain agreement period.

## Creating SEPA Direct Debit Collection Entries and Export to a Bank File

To instruct the bank to transfer the payment amount from the customer's bank account to your company's account, you create a direct-debit collection, which holds information about the customer's bank account, the affected sales invoices, and the direct-debit mandate. From the resulting direct-debit collection entry, you then export an XML file that you send or upload to your electronic bank for processing. Any payments that couldn't be processed by the bank will be communicated to you by your bank, and you must then manually reject the direct debit-collection entries in question.  

 > [!NOTE]  
 > To collect payments using SEPA Direct Debit, the currency on the sales invoice must be EURO.  

### To create a direct-debit collection  

 1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Direct Debit Collections**, and then choose the related link.  
 2. On the **Direct Debit Collections** page, choose the **Create Direct Debit Collection** action.  
 3. On the **Create Direct Debit Collection** page, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**From Due Date**|Specify the earliest payment due date on sales invoices that you want to create a direct-debit collection for.|  
    |**To Due Date**|Specify the latest payment due date on sales invoices that you want to create a direct-debit collection for.|  
    |**Partner Type**|Specify if the direct-debit collection is made for customers of type **Company** or **Person**.|  
    |**Only Customers With Valid Mandate**|Specify if a direct-debit collection is created for customers who have a valid direct-debit mandate. **Note:**  A direct-debit collection is created even if the **Direct Debit Mandate ID** field isn't filled on the sales invoice.|  
    |**Only Invoices With Valid Mandate**|Specify if a direct-debit collection is only created for sales invoices if a valid direct-debit mandate is selected in the **Direct Debit Mandate ID** field on the sales invoice.|  
    |**Bank Account No.**|Specify which of your company's bank accounts the collected payment will be transferred to from the customer's bank account.|  
    |**Bank Account Name**|Specifies the name of the bank account that you select in the **Bank Account No.** field. This field is filled automatically.|  

 4. Choose the **OK** button.  

A direct-debit collection is added to the **Direct Debit Collections** page, and one or more direct-debit collection entries are created.  

### To export a direct-debit collection entry to a bank file

 1. On the **Direct Debit Collections** page, choose the **Direct Debit Collect. Entries** action.  
 2. On the **Direct Debit Collect. Entries** page, select the entry that you want to export, and then choose the **Create Direct Debit File** action.  
 3. Save the export file to the location from where you send or upload it to your electronic bank.  

      On the **Direct Debit Collect. Entries** page, the **Direct Debit Collection Status** field is changed to File Created. On the **SEPA Direct Debit Mandates** page, the **Debit Counter** field is updated with one count.  

 If the exported file can't be processed, for example because the customer is insolvent, you can reject the direct-debit collection entry. If the exported file is successfully processed by the bank, the due payments of the involved sales invoices are automatically collected from the involved customers. In that case you can close the collection.  

### To reject a direct-debit collection entry  

* On the **Direct Debit Collect. Entries** page, select the entry that wasn't successfully processed, and then choose the **Reject Entry** action.  

    The value in the **Status** field on the **Direct Debit Collect. Entries** page is changed to **Rejected**.  

### To close a direct-debit collection

* On the **Direct Debit Collect. Entries** page, select the entry that was successfully processed, and then choose the **Close Collection** action.  

    The related direct-debit collection is closed.  

 You can now proceed to post receipts of payment for the involved sales invoices. You can do this as you typically post payment receipts, such as on the **Payment Registration** page, or you can post the related payment receipts directly from the **Direct Debit Collect. Entries** page. For more information, see [Collect Payments with SEPA Direct Debit](finance-collect-payments-with-sepa-direct-debit.md).

## Posting SEPA Direct Debit Payment Receipts

When a direct debit collection is successfully processed by your bank, you can proceed to post receipt of the payment for the involved sales invoices. For more information, see [Create SEPA Direct Debit Collection Entries and Export to a Bank File](finance-collect-payments-with-sepa-direct-debit.md#creating-sepa-direct-debit-collection-entries-and-export-to-a-bank-file).  

You can post the payment receipt directly from the **Direct Debit Collections** page or the **Direct Debit Collect. Entries** page. Alternatively, you can relay the work to another user by preparing the related journal lines.  

### To post a direct-debit payment receipt from the Direct Debit Collections page

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Direct Debit Collections**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select a line for a direct debit collection that has been exported to a bank file and successfully processed by the bank.
3. Choose the **Post Payment Receipts** action.  
4. On the **Post Direct Debit Collection** page, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Direct Debit Collection No.**|Specify the direct debit collection that you want to post payment receipt for.|  
    |**General Journal Template**|Specify which general journal template to use for posting the payment receipt, such as the template for cash receipts.|  
    |**General Journal Batch Name**|Specify which general journal batch to use for posting the payment receipt.|  
    |**Create Journal Only**|Select this check box if you don't want to post the payment receipt when you choose the **OK** button. The payment receipt will be prepared in the specified journal and won't be posted until someone posts the journal lines in question.|

# Manufacturing Power BI app

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The Power BI Manufacturing app gives insights into your manufacturing activities. Its detailed analytics and visualizations of manufacturing data help:

- Streamline manufacturing processes
- Improve decision-making at all levels of the organization
- Optimize production efficiency

## Manufacturing analytics for the leadership team

To fit this category, you might have a role such as:

- Chief Operating Officer
- Chief Manufacturing Officer
  
### Example scenario: analyzing current utilization

COOs need to ensure that your manufacturing plant is operating at optimal levels. By analyzing the [Current Utilization](manufacturing-powerbi-current-utilization.md) and [Historical Utilization](manufacturing-powerbi-historical-utilization.md) reports, you can get a better understanding of how efficiently you're using your resources and identify areas for improvement.

You can also use the [Work Center Load](manufacturing-powerbi-work-center-load.md) report to identify bottlenecks in your production process, and make informed decisions to increase efficiency and productivity.

## Manufacturing analytics for the management team

To fit this category, you might have a role such as:

- Manufacturing Manager
- Operations Manager

### Example scenario: improving resource usage

Manufacturing managers ensure that all production orders are completed on time and within budget. Using the [Finished Production Order Breakdown](manufacturing-powerbi-finished-production-order-breakdown.md) and [Average Production Times](manufacturing-powerbi-average-production-times.md) reports, you can analyze the production time for each order and identify opportunities to optimize the production process.

The [Allocated Hours](manufacturing-powerbi-allocated-hours.md) report provides a detailed breakdown of allocated hours and aggregates them by work center. This report can help you catch unexpected spikes in resource usage.

By using the [Released Production Orders](manufacturing-powerbi-released-production-orders.md) report, you can also identify discrepancies in production patterns across different orders and make decisions.

## Manufacturing analytics for warehouse staff

To fit this category, you might have a role such as:

- Manufacturing Supervisor
- Production Operator

### Example scenario: tracking production lines

Manufacturing supervisors ensure that goods and materials flow smoothly through the manufacturing facility. Your role is critical in maintaining the production schedule and meeting customer demand. The [Current Utilization](manufacturing-powerbi-current-utilization.md) report shows the use of work centers in real-time, which helps you spot bottlenecks and optimize production processes.

You notice that one work center is consistently operating at full capacity, while others are underused. You use the [Historical Utilization](manufacturing-powerbi-historical-utilization.md) report to analyze the historical use of work centers and find trends and patterns. This report helps you plan for future capacity needs and balance production across work centers.

To improve production efficiency, you track the allocated hours for each work center using the [Allocated Hours](manufacturing-powerbi-allocated-hours.md) report. This report helps you understand workloads and adjust staffing levels accordingly.

# Use OCR to Turn PDF and Image Files into Electronic Documents

From PDF or image files that you receive from your trading partners, you can have an external OCR service (Optical Character Recognition) generate electronic documents that can be converted to document records in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For example, when you receive an invoice in PDF format from your vendor, you can [send it to the OCR service from the **Incoming Documents** page](#to-send-a-pdf-or-image-file-to-the-ocr-service-from-the-incoming-documents-page).

As an alternative to sending the file from the **Incoming Documents** page, the OCR service can offer the option to [process files forwarded to a dedicated email address](#to-send-a-pdf-or-image-file-to-the-ocr-service-by-email). Then, when you receive the electronic document back, a related incoming document record is created automatically in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

After some seconds, the OCR service will send the processed file to the **Incoming Documents** page as an electronic document record that can be [converted to a purchase invoice for the vendor](#to-receive-the-resulting-electronic-document-from-the-ocr-service), a sales invoice, credit memo or a journal entry.

Because OCR is based on optical recognition, it's likely that the OCR service will interpret characters in your PDF or image files wrongly when it first processes a certain vendor's documents, for example. It may not interpret the company logo as the vendor's name or it may misinterpret the total amount on a receipt because of its layout. To avoid these errors going forward, you can correct the errors in a separate version of the **Incoming Document** page. Then you send the corrections back to the OCR service to train it to interpret the specific characters and fields correctly next time it processes a PDF or image document for the same vendor. For more information, see [Train the OCR service to avoid errors](across-how-use-ocr-pdf-images-files.md#to-train-the-ocr-service-to-avoid-errors).

The traffic of files to and from the OCR service is processed by a dedicated job queue entry. This job queue is created automatically when you enable the external OCR service connection. For more information, see [Set Up Incoming Documents](across-how-setup-income-documents.md).

> [!NOTE]
> The OCR feature is provided by external providers. Choose a service package that is appropriate for your organization and/or country/region. Find services compatible with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and details on available features at [AppSource.microsoft.com](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2081646).

## To send a PDF or image file to the OCR service from the Incoming Documents page

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Incoming Documents**, and then choose the related link.
2. Create a new incoming document record and attach the file. For more information, see [Create Incoming Document Records](across-how-create-income-document-records.md).  
3. On the **Incoming Documents** page, select one or more lines, and then choose the **Send to Job Queue** action.

   The value in the **OCR Status** field changes to **Ready**. The attached PDF or image file is sent to the OCR service by the job queue according to the schedule, if no errors exist.
4. Alternatively, on the **Incoming Documents** page, select one or more lines, and then choose the **Send to OCR Service** action to immediately send the files for processing.

   The value in the **OCR Status** field changes to **Sent**, if no errors exist.

## To send a PDF or image file to the OCR service by email

From your email application, you can forward an email to the OCR service provider with the PDF or image file attached. For information about the email address to send to, see the OCR service provider's web site.

Since no incoming document record exists for the file, a new record will be created automatically on the **Incoming Documents** page when the OCR service sends the resulting electronic document. For more information, see [Create Incoming Document Records](across-how-create-income-document-records.md).

> [!NOTE]  
> If you work on a tablet or phone, you can send the file to the OCR service as soon as you have taken a photo of the document, or you can create an incoming document directly. For more information, see [Create an incoming document record by taking a photo](across-how-create-income-document-records.md#create-an-incoming-document-record-by-taking-a-photo).

## To receive the resulting electronic document from the OCR service

The electronic document that is created by the OCR service from the PDF or image file is automatically received into the **Incoming Documents** page by the job queue entry that is set up when you enable the OCR service.

If you aren't using a job queue, or you want to receive a finished OCR document sooner than per the job queue schedule, you can choose the **Receive from OCR Service** action. This option will get any documents that are completed by the OCR service.

> [!NOTE]  
> If the OCR service is set up to require manual verification of processed documents, then the **OCR Status** field will contain **Awaiting Verification**. In that case, perform the following steps to sign in to the OCR service website to manually verify an OCR document.

1. In the **OCR Status** field, choose the **Awaiting Verification** hyperlink.
2. On the OCR service website, sign in using the credentials of your OCR service account. For more information, see [Set up an OCR service](across-how-setup-income-documents.md#to-set-up-an-ocr-service).

   Information for the OCR document is displayed, showing both the source content of the PDF or image file and the resulting OCR field values.
3. Review the field values and manually edit or enter values in fields that the OCR service has tagged as uncertain.
4. Choose the **OK** button. The OCR process is completed and the resulting electronic document is sent to the **Incoming Documents** page in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], according to the job queue schedule.
5. Repeat steps 2 through 4 for any other OCR document to be verified.

Now you can proceed to create document records for the received electronic documents in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], manually or automatically. For more information, see the next procedure. You can also [connect the new incoming document record to existing posted or non-posted documents](across-how-connect-disconnect-income-document-records.md) so that the source file is easy to access from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## To create a purchase invoice from an electronic document received from the OCR service

The following procedure describes how to create a purchase invoice record from a vendor invoice received as an electronic document from the OCR service. The procedure is the same when you create, for example, a general journal line from an expense receipt or a sales return order from a customer.

> [!NOTE]  
> The **Description** and **No.** fields on the created document lines will only be filled if you have first mapped text found on the OCR document to the two fields in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. You can do this mapping as item references, for document lines of type Item. For more information, see [Use Item References](inventory-how-use-item-cross-refs.md). You can also use the **Text-to-Account Mapping** function. For more information, see [Map text on an incoming document to a specific vendor, G/L, or bank account](across-how-use-ocr-pdf-images-files.md#to-map-text-on-an-incoming-document-to-a-specific-vendor-account).

1. Select the line for the incoming document, and then choose the **Create Document** action.

A purchase invoice will be created in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] based on the information in the electronic vendor document that you received from the OCR service. Information will be inserted in the new purchase invoice based on the mapping that you've defined as a reference or as text-to-account mapping.

Any validation errors, typically related to wrong or missing data in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], will be shown on the **Errors and Warnings** FastTab. For more information, see [Handle errors when receiving electronic documents](across-how-use-ocr-pdf-images-files.md#to-handle-errors-when-receiving-electronic-documents).

### To map text on an incoming document to a specific vendor account

For incoming documents, you typically use the **Map Text to Account** action to define that a certain text on a vendor invoice received from the OCR service is mapped to a certain vendor account. Going forward, any part of the incoming document description that exists as a mapping text means that the **Vendor No.** field on resulting document or journal lines of type *G/L Account* are filled with the vendor in question.

In addition to mapping to a vendor account or G/L accounts, you can also map text to a bank account. This option is useful, for example, for electronic documents for expenses that are already paid, and for which you want to create a general journal line that is ready to post to a bank account.

1. Select the relevant incoming document line, and then choose the **Map Text to Account** action. The **Text-to-Account Mapping** page opens.
2. In the **Mapping Text** field, enter any text that occurs on vendor invoices that you want to create purchase documents or journal lines for. You can enter up to 50 characters.
3. In the **Vendor No.** field, enter the vendor that the resulting purchase document or journal line will be created for.
4. In the **Debit Acc. No.** field, enter the debit-type G/L account that will be inserted on resulting purchase document or journal line of type G/L Account.
5. In the **Credit Acc. No.** field, enter the credit-type G/L account that will be inserted on resulting purchase document or journal line of type G/L Account.

   > [!NOTE]
   > Do not use the **Bal. Source Type** and **Bal. Source No.** fields in connection with incoming documents. They are used for automatic payment reconciliation only. For more information, see [Map Text on Recurring Payments to Accounts for Automatic Reconciliation](receivables-how-map-text-recurring-payments-accounts-auto-reconcilliation.md).
6. Repeat steps 2 through 5 for all text on incoming documents that you want to automatically create documents for.

## To handle errors when receiving electronic documents

1. On the **Incoming Documents** page, select the line for an electronic document received from the OCR service with errors, indicated by the *Error* value in the **OCR Status** field.
2. Choose the **Edit** action to open the **Incoming Document** page.
3. On the **Errors and Warnings** FastTab, select the message, and then choose the **Open Related Record** action.
4. The page that contains the wrong or missing data, such as a vendor card with a missing field value, opens.
5. Correct the error or errors as described in each error message.
6. Proceed to process the incoming electronic document by choosing the **Create Manually** action again.
7. Repeat steps 5 and 6 for any remaining errors until the electronic document can be received successfully.

## To train the OCR service to avoid errors

Because OCR is based on optical recognition, the OCR service can wrongly interpret characters in your PDF or image files when it first processes documents from a certain vendor, for example. It may not interpret the company logo as the vendor's name or it may misinterpret the total amount on an expense receipt because of its layout. To avoid such errors going forward, you can correct data received by the OCR service and then send the feedback to the service.

The **OCR Data Correction** page, which you open from the **Incoming Document** page, shows the fields from the **Financial Information** FastTab in two columns, one with the OCR data editable and one with the OCR data read-only. When you choose the **Send OCR Feedback** button, the content of the **OCR Data Correction** page is sent to the OCR service. Next time the service processes PDF or image files that contain the data in question, your corrections will be incorporated to improve the document recognition.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Incoming Documents**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open an incoming document record that contains data received from the OCR service that you want to correct.
3. On the **Incoming Document** page, choose the **Correct OCR Data** action.
4. On the **OCR Data Correction** page, overwrite the data in the editable column for each field that has an incorrect value.
5. To undo corrections that you have made since you opened the **OCR Data Correction** page, choose the **Reset OCR Data** action.
6. To send the corrections to the OCR service, choose the **Send OCR Feedback** action.
7. To save the corrections, close the **OCR Data Correction** page.

The fields on the **Financial Information** FastTab on the **Incoming Document** page are updated with any new values that you entered in step 4.

# Assemble Items

If the **Replenishment System** field on the item card contains **Assembly**, the default method of supplying the item is to assemble it according to an assembly BOM, and potentially by a specific resource. Learn more at [Work with Assembly BOMs](assembly-how-work-assembly-boms.md). Learn more about how to set up an assembly item at [Understanding Assemble to Order and Assemble to Stock](assembly-assemble-to-order-or-assemble-to-stock.md).

You can set up assembly items for two assembly processes.

|Process  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|Assemble to stock     | Items that you assemble and stock for future sales. For example, kits for an upcoming sales campaign. The items aren't related to a sales order, at least not yet. Typically, these items aren't customized for customer requests.        |
|Assemble to order     | Items that you don't want to stock. For example, because they're customized based on customer orders or to reduce the cost of on-hand inventory. |
  
This article describes the standard settings for assemble to stock. There might be other ways that are more suited for your business though. Learn more at [Sell Inventory Items in Assemble-to-Order Flows](assembly-how-to-sell-assemble-to-order-items-and-inventory-items-together.md) and [Sell Assemble-to-Order Items and Inventory Items Together](assembly-how-to-sell-assemble-to-order-items-and-inventory-items-together.md).

> [!NOTE]  
> Assembly components are handled in a special way in basic warehouse configurations. Learn more at [Handling Assemble-to-Order Items with Inventory Picks](warehouse-how-to-pick-items-with-inventory-picks.md#handling-assemble-to-order-items-with-inventory-picks).

## To assemble an item to stock

Follow the steps in this procedure to assemble an item to stock. To learn about assemble to order, go to [Sell Items Assembled to Order](assembly-how-to-sell-items-assembled-to-order.md).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Assembly Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action. The **New Assembly Order** page opens.  
3. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
4. In the **Item No.** field, select the item that you want to assemble. You can select items that are set up for assembly and have an assembly BOM, or items without an assembly BOM. The latter is useful for unplanned assemblies or scenarios when you want to use item reclassification and track costs.  
5. In the **Quantity** field, enter how many units of the item that you want assembled.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  If one or more components are not available to fulfill quantity on the due date, the **Assembly Availability** page opens. The page shows how many assembly items can be assembled based on component availability. Learn more at [View the Availability of Items](inventory-how-availability-overview.md). When you close the page, the assembly order is created with availability alerts on the lines for the affected components.  

    The lines contain the contents of the assembly BOM and the specified quantities.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  If the **Assembly Availability** page opened when you filled in the assembly order header, each affected assembly order line contains a **Yes** in the **Avail. Warning** field with a link to detailed availability information. <!--check whether this field help is useful For more information, see Check Availability.--> You can resolve a component availability issue by:

    > * Postponing the starting date.
    > * Replacing the component with another item.
    > * Selecting an available substitution if one is defined.  

6. In the **Quantity to Assemble** field, enter how many units of the assembly item that you want to post as output the next time you post the assembly order. This quantity can be lower than the value in the **Quantity** field to reflect a partial output posting.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  To make sure that component consumption posting matches the assembly item output posting, the quantity fields in the assembly order lines automatically adjust to the value that you enter in the **Quantity to Assemble** field.  
7. On assembly order lines of type **Item** or **Resource**, in the **Quantity to Consume** field, specify how many units you want to post as consumed the next time that you post the assembly order.
8. When you are ready to partially or fully post, choose the **Post** action.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  If warnings are still present in the assembly order lines, you can't post the order. A message displays the component or components that are not in inventory.  

After posting succeeds, the assembly item is posted as output to the location code and potential bin code that are defined on the assembly order. For manually created assembly orders, the location may be copied from the **Default Location for Orders** setup field. For assemble-to-order flows, the location code may be copied from the sales order line.

# Create bank deposits

> [!NOTE]
> The ability to create bank deposits is new in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] 2022 release wave 1 for a lot of country/region versions. If you were using [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in the United States, Canada, or Mexico before that release, you might be using the earlier capabilities. You can continue, but the new capabilities will replace the old ones in a future release. To start using the new features described in this article, your administrator can go to the **Feature Management** page and turn on **Feature Update: Standardized bank reconciliation and deposits**.  

Use the **Bank Deposits** page to register deposits as a single document that posts one or more entries to a bank account. Typically, bank deposits are used to register cash deposits. The Bank Deposits page is available on the **Cash Management** menu on the Business Manager Role Center, and other Role Centers that deal with cash management.

Amounts on bank deposits can come from several sources:

* Sales, using a G/L account for revenue.
* Customers payments.
* Cash refunds from vendors, or cash payments to them. 

Bank deposit lines contain information about individual deposits, such as checks from customers. The total of the amounts on the lines must add up to the total amount of the deposit.

After you fill in the deposit information and lines, you must post it. Posting updates the relevant ledgers, including the general ledger, and the bank, customer, and vendor ledgers. Posted deposits are stored for future reference on the **Posted Bank Deposits** page.

The **Bank Deposit** report displays customer and vendor deposits with the original deposit amount, the amount of the deposit that remains open, and the amount applied. The report also shows the total posted deposit amount to reconcile.

## Before you start

There are a few things to set up before you can use bank deposits. You must have a number series and general journal template ready. You should also specify whether to post bank deposit amounts as a lump sum. That is, as a total of all the amounts on the deposit lines. Otherwise, each line is posted as an individual entry. Posting a deposit as a single bank ledger entry can make it easier to do bank reconciliation.

### Number series and lump sum deposits

You must set up a number series for bank deposits, and then specify the series in the **Bank Deposit Nos.** field on the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page. To learn more about number series, go to [Create Number Series](ui-create-number-series.md).

Also on the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page, to post deposits as lump sums rather than individual lines, turn on the **Post Bank Deposits as Lump Sum** toggle. Posting a deposit as a lump sum creates one bank ledger entry for the full amount of the deposit, which can make it easier to do bank reconciliation.

### General journal templates for bank deposits

You must also create a general journal template for deposits. You use general journals to post entries to bank, customer, vendor, fixed asset, and general ledger accounts. The journal templates design the general journal to suit the purpose of your work. That is, the fields on the journal template are exactly the ones you need.

The deposits are cash receipts, so you might want to reuse your number series for cash receipt journals. Alternatively, if you need to distinguish between bank deposit and cash receipt journal entries, use a different number series.

You also need to create a batch job for the template. To create a batch job, on the **General Journal Templates** page, choose the **Batches** action. To learn more about batches, go to [Using Journal Templates and Batches](ui-work-general-journals.md#use-journal-templates-and-batches).

## Dimensions on bank deposit lines

The lines on the bank deposit use the default dimensions you specified in the **Department Code** and **Customer group Code** fields. When you choose **Customer** or **Vendor** in the **Account Type** field, the dimensions for the customer or vendor replace the defaults. You can change the dimensions on the lines, if needed.

> [!TIP]
> Dimension on lines are set according to Default Dimension Priorities. Line dimensions prioritized over header dimensions. To avoid conflicts, you can create rules that prioritize when to use a dimension depending on the source. If you want to change how dimensions are prioritized, you can change their rankings on the **Default Dimension Priorities** page. For more information, see [To set up default dimension priorities](finance-dimensions.md#to-set-up-default-dimension-priorities).

## Create a bank deposit

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Bank Deposits**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose **New** to open the **Bank Deposit** page.
3. Choose the general journal template that you created for bank deposits.  

    > [!NOTE]
    > If the general journal template has more than one batch, you'll be prompted to choose one.

4. In the **Bank Account No.** field, choose the bank account in which to make the deposit.

    > [!TIP]
    > You can double-check that you're depositing to the correct account by using the **Account Card** and **Account Ledger Entries** actions to look up the ledger entries for the selected bank account. For example, to check whether similar deposits were made to the account.

5. In the **Total Deposit Amount** field, enter the total amount of the deposit. This total must be the sum of the amounts on all lines.
6. Fill in the remaining fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](../archive/SetupAndAdministration/includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

    The date in the **Posting Date** field and the dimensions in the **Department Code** and **Customergroup Code** fields are assigned to the lines that you create for the bank deposit. You can change them if needed.

7. Depending on whether you want to post the bank deposit as lump sum or each line individually to the bank ledger, turn the **Post as Lump Sum** toggle on or off. The default setting comes from the same toggle on the **Sales & Receivables Setup** page.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The **Currency Code** field shows the currency that is specified for the bank account you chose. You cannot choose a different currency.

8. On the **Lines** FastTab, create a new line for each cash payment that you want to deposit.
9. In the **Account Type** field, specify where the payment originated. For bank deposits, the type is typically **Customer** or **Vendor**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You can also register a cash payment to a vendor. To do that, choose **Vendor** and then enter the payment amount as a negative number in the **Credit Amount** field on the line.

10. In the **Document No.** field, enter the document number of the invoice from which the credit amount originated. You can use a document number for each line, or the same number for all lines.

    > [!TIP]
    > Typically, you don't need to fill in the **Document Type** field for financial entries. For example, if you're depositing cash from a day's sale you leave the field blank. If you're depositing cash from a customer payment, you choose **Payment**.

11. If you're depositing a cash payment for a specific customer invoice, choose the **Apply Entries** action, and then enter the invoice number in the **Applies-to ID** field.
12. If you're ready to post the bank deposit, choose the **Post** action.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If the bank account has default dimensions where the **Value Posting** field contains **Code Mandatory**, **Same Code**, or **No Code**, you must post the deposit as a lump sum. If you don't post as a lump sum, posting might fail because the dimension values of the accounts on the bank deposit lines violate the value posting rules of the bank account.

    > [!TIP]
    > Before you post the deposit, you can use the **Test Report** action to review your data. The report shows whether there are any issues, such as missing data, that might prevent posting.  

## Apply multiple checks for multiple invoices for a customer in a lump sum deposit

You can post lump sum deposits from multiple checks on deposit lines for customer ledger entries. 

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Bank Deposits**, and then choose the related link.
2. Create or choose a line for the customer, and in the **External Document No.** field, enter the check number.
3. Choose **Apply Entries**.
4. On the **Apply Customer Entries** page, for each document you want to apply the check to, in the **Applies-to ID** field, enter the check number.
5. In the **Amount to apply** field, enter the amount on the check.

   > [!NOTE]
   > When you enter the amount to apply, the **Applies-to ID** field might reset to the bank deposit document number. Double-check the field, and if it reset, reenter the check number.  

6. Choose **OK**.
7. Repeat steps two through six for each check.

   > [!TIP]
   > Before you post the bank deposit, it's a good idea to use the **Test Report** action to validate the applications.

## Find posted bank deposits

The **Posted Bank Deposits** page lists your company's previous deposits. In the list, you can review the comments and dimensions that were specified for the deposits. You can open the bank deposit to view more details, and from there you can investigate further. For example, you can choose the **Find entries** action to view the posted bank ledger entries. From the bank ledger entry, you can find its corresponding posted general ledger entry.

If you want to look up all general ledger entries for the posted deposit lines, go to the **G/L Register** page and use the **General Ledger** action. The action shows all of the general ledger entries, including the entries for customers and vendors.

## Reverse a posted bank deposit

There are a couple of ways to reverse a posted bank deposit:

* On the **Posted Bank Deposits** page, choose the deposit, and then choose the **Undo Posting** action.
* On the **G/L Registers** page, find the register for the deposit, and then choose the **Reverse Register** action.

> [!NOTE]
> You can only reverse a register that contains a single type of entry. That is, the register must contain only customer entries or vendor entries, but not both. If a register contains both you must manually reverse the deposit.

# Record Special Purchase Prices and Discounts

> [!NOTE]
> In 2020 release wave 2 we released streamlined processes for setting up and managing prices and discounts. If you're a new customer using that version, you're using the new experience. If you're an existing customer, whether you are using the new experience depends on whether your administrator has enabled the **New sales pricing experience** feature update in **Feature Management**. For more information, see [Enabling Upcoming Features Ahead of Time](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/feature-management).

The different price and discount agreements that apply when you buy from different vendors must be defined so that the agreed rules and values are applied to purchase documents that you create for the vendors.

When you have recorded special prices and line discounts for sales and purchases, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] ensures that your profit on item trade is always optimal by automatically calculating the best price on sales and purchase documents and on project and item journal lines. For more information, see [Best Price Calculation](purchasing-how-record-purchase-price-discount-payment-agreements.md#best-price-calculation).

Concerning prices, you can have a special purchase price inserted on purchase lines if a certain combination of vendor, item, minimum quantity, unit of measure, or starting/ending date exists.

Concerning discounts, you can set up and use two types of purchase discounts:

| Discount Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Purchase Line Discount** |An amount discount that is inserted on purchase lines if a certain combination of vendor, item, minimum quantity, unit of measure, or starting/ending date exists. This type works in the same way as for purchase prices. |
| **Invoice Discount** |A percentage discount that is subtracted from the document total if the value amount of all lines on a purchase document exceeds a certain minimum. |

Because purchase line discounts and purchase prices are based on a combination of item and vendor, you can also enter this configuration from the item card, where the rules and values are defined. For more information, see [Register New Items](inventory-how-register-new-items.md).

## To set up a line discount for a vendor

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Vendors**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the relevant vendor card, and then choose the **Line Discounts** action.

   The **Vendor No.** field is prefilled with the vendor number.
3. Fill in the fields on the line as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
4. Fill a line for each combination for which the vendor grants you a purchase line discount.

## To set up an invoice discount for a vendor

When your vendors have informed you which invoice discounts they grant, enter the invoice discount code on the vendor cards and set up the terms for each code.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Vendors**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the vendor card for a vendor that will be eligible for invoice discounts.
3. In the **Invoice Disc. Code** field, select a code for the relevant invoice discount terms to use to calculate invoice discounts for the vendor.

    > [!NOTE]  
    > Invoice discount codes are represented by existing vendor cards. This enables you to quickly assign invoice discount terms to vendors by picking the name of another vendors who will have the same terms.

    Proceed to set up new the purchase invoice discount terms.
4. On the **Vendor Card** page, choose the **Invoice Discounts** action. The **Vend. Invoice Discounts** page opens.
5. In the **Currency Code** field, enter the code for a currency that the invoice discount terms on the line applies to. Leave the field blank to set up invoice discount terms in USD.
6. In the **Minimum Amount** field, enter the minimum amount that an invoice must have to be eligible for the discount.
7. In the **Discount %** field, enter the invoice discount as a percentage of the invoice amount.
8. Repeat steps 5 through 7 for each currency that the vendor will receive a different invoice discount for.

The invoice discount is now set up and assigned to the vendor in question. When you select the vendor code in the **Invoice Disc. Code** field on other vendor cards, the same invoice discount is assigned to those vendors.

## To choose a principle for posting purchase discounts

When you post a purchase invoice that includes one or more discounts, you can choose between two principles for posting discount amounts. You can post discounts separately or you can subtract discounts from invoice discounts.  

Before you can do this, you must have already set up the necessary accounts for posting discount amounts in the chart of accounts. You must also check that you have entered the correct account numbers in the general posting setup in the **Purch. Line Disc. Account** and **Purch. Inv. Disc. Account** fields.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchases & Payables Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. In the **Discount Posting** field, choose one of the following principles for posting discounts.

|**Discount Posting Principle**|**Invoice Discount**|**Line Discount**|  
|------------------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------|  
|**All Discounts**|Posted separately|Posted separately|  
|**Invoice Discounts**|Posted separately|Subtracted|  
|**Line Discounts**|Subtracted|Posted separately|  
|**No Discounts**|Subtracted|Subtracted|  

## Purchase invoice discounts and service charges

If you have fixed terms for invoice discounts with any vendors, you can enter them for those vendors. Then the discount will be calculated when you fill in a purchase invoice.  

Before you can use invoice discounts with purchases, you must specify the vendors that offer you the discounts.  

You link discount percentages to specific invoice amounts in **Vend. Invoice Discounts** pages. You can enter any number of percentages in each page. Each vendor can have its own page, or you can link several vendors to the same page.  

In addition to a discount percentage, you can link a service charge amount to a specific invoice amount.  

You can define the terms of the invoice discount in LCY for domestic vendors and in foreign currency for foreign vendors.  

You can choose to have [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically calculate the invoice discounts for quotes, blanket orders, orders, invoices, or credit memos.  

> [!TIP]  
> Before you enter this information, it is a good idea to prepare an outline of the discount structure that you want to use. This makes it easier to see which vendors can be linked to the same invoice discount page. The fewer pages that you have to set up, the faster that you can enter the basic information.

## Best price calculation

When you have recorded special prices and line discounts for sales and purchases, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] ensures that your profit on item trade is always optimal by automatically calculating the best price on sales and purchase documents and on project and item journal lines.

The best price is the lowest permissible price with the highest permissible line discount on a given date. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] automatically calculates this price when it inserts the unit price and the line discount percentage for items on new document and journal lines.

> [!NOTE]  
> The following describes how the best price is calculated for sales. The calculation is the same for purchases.

1. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] checks the combination of the bill-to customer and the item and then calculates the applicable unit price and line discount percentage, using the following criteria:

    - Does the customer have a price/discount agreement, or does the customer belong to a group that does?
    - Is the item or the item discount group on the line included in any of these price/discount agreements?
    - Is the order date (or the posting date for the invoice and credit memo) within the starting and ending date of the price/discount agreement?
    - Is a unit of measure code specified? If so, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] checks for prices/discounts with the same unit of measure code, and prices/discounts with no unit of measure code.

2. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] checks if any price/discount agreements apply to information on the document or journal line, and then inserts the applicable unit price and line discount percentage, using the following criteria:

    - Is there a minimum quantity requirement in the price/discount agreement that is fulfilled?
    - Is there a currency requirement in the price/discount agreement that is fulfilled? If so, the lowest price and the highest line discount for that currency are inserted, even if LCY would provide a better price. If there is no price/discount agreement for the specified currency code, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] inserts the lowest price and the highest line discount in LCY.

If no special price can be calculated for the item on the line, then either the last direct cost or the unit price from the item card is inserted.

# Finance Power BI app

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

This article explains how to use embedded Power BI reports in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to analyze finance data. You don't have to run a report or switch to another application, such as Excel. The feature provides an interactive and versatile way to calculate, summarize, and examine data in curated reports with predefined KPIs.

The Power BI reports on finance data support many analytics scenarios for finance processes.

Executives and the leadership team consume the data through high-level dashboards that present key performance indicators (KPIs) for finance. The KPIs aggregate data to provide a clear and concise overview of overall financial health, and highlight important performance metrics. This approach helps business leaders quickly assess performance toward strategic goals and make informed decisions without getting lost in granular details.

Managers and team leaders engage with the data through detailed managerial reports that showcase trends and summaries. Data is aggregated over time to reveal patterns and highlight areas that need attention. These reports provide context through charts, visualizations, and comparisons that help you understand underlying trends, identify risks, and make data-driven tactical adjustments.

Finance staff accesses operational reports that offer detailed, granular-level data. These reports offer task-specific information for daily functions. Staff can mine the data for specific transactions, process monitoring, and operational insights, ensuring effective day-to-day management of financial activities.

You can use the various reports in the Power BI Finance app for different things, depending on your role. This article describes some examples of use cases for different roles in an organization.

## Finance analytics for the leadership team

To fit this category, you might have a role such as:

- Executive
- Director
- Other high-level decision maker

### Sample scenario for a CFO

As the CFO, you're preparing for an upcoming board meeting and need an analysis of your company's financial position for the current fiscal quarter.

Using the [Financial Overview (Power BI report)](finance-powerbi-financial-overview.md), you begin with a comparative analysis of revenues. This quarter's revenue of $281,000 represents a significant increase compared to the same period last year of $242,000, marking a growth of $39,000, or approximately 16.1%. This positive trend indicates strong performance and suggests that current strategies are effectively increasing revenue.

:::image type="content" source="media/finance/financial-overview-app-page.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Finance Overview report" lightbox="media/finance/financial-overview-app-page.png":::

You want to compare the net profit margin for the current quarter to the same period in the previous year. You quickly identify that net profit margins are slightly lower, but you need more information to determine why.

:::image type="content" source="media/finance/net-profit-margin-by-fiscal-year-and-month.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Net Profit Margin visual" lightbox="media/finance/net-profit-margin-by-fiscal-year-and-month.png":::

By analyzing the [Profitability](finance-powerbi-profitability.md) report, you can easily see that expenses are up from 3.60 K to 11.85 K for the same period. Although revenue is up by approximately 16.1%, the increase in expenses suppressed growth and produced a marginal increase in profits.

:::image type="content" source="media/finance/profitability-snapshot.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Profitability report" lightbox="media/finance/profitability-snapshot.png":::

To ensure the company is able to cover its short-term obligations, fund new initiatives, and maintain operational stability you review the liquidity report and cash reserves.

The cash ratio of 1.0 indicates that the company has enough cash and cash equivalents (1.02M) to pay off all current liabilities (1.02M) immediately, if needed. The quick ratio of 1.15 indicates that without including inventory in current assets, the company can still cover its short-term debts without relying on sales of inventory. Overall, the current ratio of 1.21 indicates the company is in a balanced but cautious liquidity position with current assets of $1.24M to current liabilities of 1.02M.

:::image type="content" source="media/finance/liquidity-kpi-snapshot.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Liquidity report" lightbox="media/finance/liquidity-kpi-snapshot.png":::

## Finance analytics for the management team

As the Operations Manager, you oversee service delivery across various customer segments. These customer groups are tracked as dimensions values (Large, Medium, and Small) by the **Customer Group** global dimension.

By filtering the [Budget Comparison (Power BI report)](finance-powerbi-budget-comparison.md) by **Global Dimension 2** and **G/L Account Category** to **Income** and **Expense**, you can easily track budget performance. This data lets you allocate resources effectively, control the budget, and make data-driven decisions when you forecast.

:::image type="content" source="media/finance/budget-comparison-snapshot.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Budget Comparison report" lightbox="media/finance/budget-comparison-snapshot.png":::

## Finance analytics for daily finance work

As a member of the accounts receivable team, you manage the inflow of cash by ensuring timely and efficient collection of payments from customers. To monitor and prioritize your efforts, you use the [Aged Receivables (Back Dating) (Power BI report)](finance-powerbi-aged-receivables-back-dating.md).

Analyzing by payment terms code allows you to quickly identify customers who have outstanding balances in aging buckets beyond 30 days. You can now prioritize not only customers, but the invoices those customers should pay first.

:::image type="content" source="media/finance/aged-receivables-snapshot.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Aged Receivables (Back Dating) report" lightbox="media/finance/aged-receivables-snapshot.png":::

# Setting up purchasing

Before you can manage purchase processes, you must configure the rules and values that define the company's purchase policies.

You must define the general setup on the **Purchases & Payables Setup** page, which is typically done once during the initial implementation. Learn more in the following section, [Purchases, and payables setup](#purchases-and-payables-setup).

A separate series of tasks related to registering new vendors is to record any special price or discount agreements you have with each vendor.

Finance-related purchase setup, such as payment methods and currencies, are covered in the finance setup section. Learn more at [Setting Up Finance](finance-setup-finance.md). Similarly, inventory-related purchase setup, such as units of measure and item tracking codes, can be found in the [Inventory Setup section](inventory-setup-inventory.md).

## Purchases and payables setup

Before working with purchases and payables, specify on the **Purchases & Payables Setup** page how purchase values are posted and the number series used for vendors and purchase documents.

### General settings

On the **General** FastTab, you specify options such as how you want to calculate and post discounts and whether you want to round invoices. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)].

Some fields require special attention, such as the **Calc. Inv. Disc. per VAT/Tax ID** field, which specifies whether the invoice discount is calculated according to the tax identifier or the invoice total. Learn more at [Combine VAT posting groups in VAT posting setups](finance-setup-vat.md#combine-vat-posting-groups-in-vat-posting-setups).

Similarly, the **Appln. between Currencies** field can result in small rounding differences when applying entries in different currencies to one another. Learn more at [Enable Application of Ledger Entries in Different Currencies](finance-how-enable-application-ledger-entries-different-currencies.md).

Also, some fields change their behavior or depend on how other fields are set. For example, the **Check Prepmt. when Posting** feature is influenced by how the **Prepmt. Auto Update** field is set to check for pending prepayments.

Read details about the [**Ext. Doc. No. Mandatory**](#external-document-number) and [**Exact Cost Reversing Mandatory**](#exact-cost-reversing) fields in sections later in this article.

### Number series settings

On the **Number Series** FastTab, you must specify unique identification codes to use for vendors, invoices, and other purchase documents. Numbering is important not only for internal processes, but might also need to follow local regulations. So it might be worth considering setting up all series in the **No. Series** page beforehand instead of creating new ones from the **Purchases & Payables Setup**. Learn more at [Create Number Series](ui-create-number-series.md).

## External document number

[!INCLUDE [ext-doc-no-purch](includes/ext-doc-no-purch.md)]

## Exact cost reversing

The **Exact Cost Reversing Mandatory** function helps ensure returned goods are valued at the same cost as when they were originally drawn from inventory, using a fixed application instead of following an average or first-in, first-out (FIFO) costing method. Learn more in the [Design Details: Fixed Application](design-details-item-application.md#fixed-application) section. If an extra cost is later added to the original purchase, the program updates the value of the respective purchase return.

With the feature enabled, a return transaction can only be posted by specifying the item ledger entry number in the **Appl.-to Item Entry** field on the purchase return order line. By default, the field isn't displayed on the **Lines** FastTab. To learn how to add fields to pages, go to [Personalize Your Workspace](ui-personalization-user.md#start-personalizing-by-using-the-personalization-mode) section.

# How to use banking and payment formats in Business Central

Banking and payment formats can change over time and vary by country/region and bank. To help you connect to your bank and handle transactions in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], Microsoft works with partners who provide apps that support different formats and integrations. 

In some countries/regions, Microsoft also provides built-in imports and export options. However, these options aren't adapted to newer versions of the formats, unless the bank requires it. Also, there will be no development of new banking and payment-related formats. This affects the country/region localizations of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] that Microsoft releases. For a list of local versions, see [list of localizations here](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/compliance/apptest-countries-and-translations). 

## Frequently Asked Questions about supported banking and payment formats

### Will [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] discontinue these import/export options and the current formats?  

No, there are no plans to remove the current formats and import/export options. You can still use them, and partners, and customers can still build integrations for them.  

### How can I find banking and payment apps for my country/region?

You can find ISV banking solutions that support banking and/or payment-related functionality on the **Banking Apps** page or on [AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com/)

Make sure to check the features of each app to see if they match your business needs and your bank requirements. 

> [!NOTE]
> There's one exception. The Envestnet Yodlee Bank Feeds and AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals apps aren't impacted and still supported. 

### Is there no plan to support banking connectivity in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in the future?  

Yes, Microsoft wants to enable you to connect to your bank and perform fundamental tasks in a modern and secure manner. This is why Microsoft supports partners who create apps for this purpose.

# Historical Utilization (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2024w2](includes/applies-to-2024w2.md)]

The **Historical Utilization** report provides insights into the historic use of manufacturing resources and machinery over time. It helps identify downtimes, busy periods, and bottlenecks so you can improve capacity planning and optimize the use of machinery and resources.

:::image type="content" source="media/manufacturing/historical-utilization.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Historical Utilization Power BI Report" lightbox="media/manufacturing/historical-utilization.png":::

## Use the report

The report is meant for business leaders and manufacturing teams.

COOs use the report to measure the return on resources and machinery over time, and get insights into how well your manufacturing team used them. You can track the historical utilization rate to identify bottlenecks and make necessary adjustments to ensure you use resources efficiently.

Manufacturing managers use this report to identify the historical utilization rate of machinery and resources. The report provides insights into the capacity used and available over time. This data identifies downtimes, busy periods, and bottlenecks. Use this information to improve capacity planning and optimize the use of machinery and resources. A low utilization rate means you have idle resources, which is good for efficiency. Conversely, if the utilization rate is high, it means your production output increased, and you might consider investing in new machines for production.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The *Historical Utilization* report includes the following KPIs and measures:

# Get started creating report layouts

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes many built-in layouts that you can use on your reports. Other layouts might be added as part of extensions. In addition, you can create your own report layouts, either from scratch or based on an existing layout.

> [!NOTE]
> You can also use report layouts to add content to email messages. Report layouts can help save time and ensure consistency by reusing the same content when you communicate with your customers. Only custom report layouts of the **Word** type can be used with email. You can't use layouts of the **RDLC** with email. Learn more in [Set up reusable email texts and layouts](admin-how-setup-email.md#set-up-reusable-email-texts-and-layouts).

## Overview of report layouts

It can be helpful to think of a report layout as a file that is imported and assigned to a report. You manage all layouts in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in basically the same way, regardless of the layout type. Usually, you work from the **Report Layouts** page. The layouts differ mainly in the way that you design them. Each layout is designed by using the software that the layout is built on, such Word, Excel, or SQL Server Report Builder.

The process of setting up a layout for a report involves three or four basic tasks.

1. Choose the layout type.
2. Export a copy of an existing layout so that you can use it as a starting point.
3. Make changes to the layout file in the appropriate application.
4. Add the new layout file to the report.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You can modify or replace only user-defined layouts. You can't modify or replace *extension layouts*, which are layouts that originate from an extension. On the **Report Layouts** page, you can tell whether a layout is a user-defined layout or an extension layout by looking in the **Extension** column. For an extension layout, the **Extension** column shows information about the source extension. For a user-defined layout, the **Extension** column is blank.
>
> Learn more about the difference between extension layouts and user-defined layouts in [Layout sources](ui-manage-report-layouts.md#layout-sources).

## <a name="decide"></a>Decide what type of layout you want

The first task when you create a layout is to decide which [layout type](ui-manage-report-layouts.md#layout-types) you want. You can choose among the **Word**, **Excel**, and **RDLC** layout types. Your choice depends on how you want the generated report to look. It also depends on your knowledge of the software that is used to create the layout, such as Word, Excel, and SQL Server Report Builder.

* **Excel** layouts are generally the easiest to create and modify because summarizing data, adding graphics, and styling are common Excel features. However, not all reports have datasets optimized for Excel layouts. Aggregations and complex calculations work best with **RDLC** or **Word** layouts. The same applies to documents.
* If you're making only style changes, such as changes to the font type, size, and colors, a **Word** layout is a good choice.
* The capabilities for adding and rearranging data fields are more advanced in **Word** and **RDLC** layouts than in **Excel** layouts.
* **Word** and **RDLC** layouts are good choices for printable reports.
* The design concepts for **Word** and **RDLC** layouts are similar, but each has specific features that affect the report's appearance in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The same report might look different depending on whether a **Word** or **RDLC** layout is used.

## <a name="create"></a>Create a new layout

There are different methods for creating a new layout. The easiest methods involve using a copy of an existing layout. For these methods, you can either save the existing layout directly as a copy, or export it and then import it into a new layout. Another, more advanced method is to create a layout from scratch by using a blank layout.

### [Copy a layout](#tab/copy)

Copying an existing layout lets you quickly create a new, identical layout that you can customize.

1. [!INCLUDE[open-report-layouts-page](includes/open-report-layouts-page.md)]

   The **Report Layouts** page lists all layouts for all reports.
1. Select the layout that you want to copy for the new layout, and then select the **Edit Info** action.

    If you select an extension layout, you're asked whether you want to edit a copy of it. Select **Yes**.

    > [!TIP]
    > To find the layout that you want, use the search field, the filter pane, and column sorting.

1. In the **Layout Name** field, enter a new name.
1. Turn on the **Save Changes to Copy** toggle, if it isn't already on.
1. Select **OK**.

    The new layout appears on the **Report Layouts** page.

If needed, you can change the settings in your new layout. To learn more, go to [Change settings in a new layout](#modify).

### [Export a layout copy and import it as a new layout](#tab/export)

1. [!INCLUDE[open-report-layouts-page](includes/open-report-layouts-page.md)]
1. Select the layout that you want to copy for the new layout, and then select the **Export Layout** action.

    The layout file is downloaded to your device.

    > [!TIP]
    > To find the layout that you want, use the search field, the filter pane, and column sorting.

1. Open the layout file in the appropriate application, such as Word (for a .docx file) or Excel (for an .xlsx file).

    Learn more in the following articles:

    * [Work with Word Layouts](ui-how-add-fields-word-report-layout.md)
    * [Working with Microsoft Excel layouts](ui-excel-report-layouts.md)
    * [Working with RDLC Layouts](ui-rdlc-report-layouts.md)

1. Make the required changes to the file, and then save it.
1. On the **Report Layouts** page, select **New**.
1. In the **Add New Layout for a Report** dialog box, fill in the fields described in the following table.

    | Field | Description | Mandatory |
    |---|---|---|
    | Report ID | Enter the ID that is assigned to the report. | Yes |
    | Layout Name | Enter a brief, descriptive name for the layout to help you easily identify it. | Yes |
    | Description | Enter more detailed information about the layout. | No |
    | Format Options | Set this field to match the type of the layout (for example, **Word**, **Excel**, or **RDLC**). | Yes |

1. Select **OK**.
1. Follow one of these steps to upload the layout file for the report:

    [!INCLUDE[file-upload](includes/file-upload.md)]

    The selected file is uploaded to the layout, and you're returned to the **Report Layouts** page.

To view how the report looks with the new layout, select the layout in the list, and then select **Run Report**.

### [Create from blank](#tab/blank)

When you create a new layout from a blank layout, you must design it completely. The layout file provides all the report fields that you can add and arrange as you require.

1. [!INCLUDE[open-report-layouts-page](includes/open-report-layouts-page.md)]
1. Select any layout that is for the same report that you want use the new layout for.
1. Select **New**.
1. In the **Add New Layout for a Report** dialog box, set the following fields.

    | Field | Description | Mandatory |
    |---|---|---|
    | Report ID | Enter the ID that is assigned to the report. | Yes |
    | Layout Name | Enter a brief descriptive name for the layout to help you easily identify it. | Yes |
    | Description | Enter more detailed information about the layout. | No |
    | Format Options | Set this field to match the type of the layout (for example, **Word**, **Excel**, or **RDLC**). | Yes |

1. Turn on the **Create a blank layout from the report object** option.
1. Select **OK**.

    The new layout appears in the list. The layout is blank, but all the report fields and captions are available so that you can start to add them to the layout.

1. You can now start to [design the layout](#modify).

## Mark a layout as obsolete

A layout can become obsolete for various reasons. For example, the data model might change, making the layout outdated, or a more efficient layout might be introduced, making the current layout redundant. Marking a layout as obsolete signals to others that it will likely be removed in a later release, so they should use an alternative layout.

To identify which layouts are obsolete, refer to the **Obsolete** column on the **Report Layouts page**. You can mark a user-defined layout as obsolete if needed. 

1. [!INCLUDE[open-report-layouts-page](includes/open-report-layouts-page.md)]
2. Select the layout that you want to change, and then select the **Edit Info** action.

# Manage inventory

For each physical product you trade in, you must create an item card of the **Inventory** type. Items you offer to customers but don't keep in inventory you can register as catalog items, which you can convert to inventory items when necessary. You can increase or decrease the quantity of an item in inventory by posting directly to the item ledger entries, such as after a physical count or if you don't record purchases.

Inventory increases and decreases are naturally also recorded when you post purchase and sales documents, respectively. To learn more, go to [Record Purchases](purchasing-how-record-purchases.md), [Sell Products](sales-how-sell-products.md), and [Invoice Sales](sales-how-invoice-sales.md). Transfers between locations change inventory quantities across your company's warehouses.

To enhance your overview of items and to help you find them, you can categorize items and give them attributes to search and sort by.

> [!NOTE]
> The physical handling of items is referred to as warehouse activities. Learn more at [Warehouse Management Overview](design-details-warehouse-management.md).

Planning for items to fulfill demand is covered as part of supply planning functionality. Learn more at [Planning](production-planning.md).

## Inventory reconciliation

When you post inventory transactions, such as sales shipments, purchase invoices, or inventory adjustments, the changed item costs are recorded in item value entries. To reflect this change in inventory value in your financial books, the inventory costs are automatically posted to the related inventory accounts in the general ledger. For each inventory transaction you post, the appropriate values are posted to the inventory account, adjustment account, and COGS account in the general ledger. To learn more, go to [Reconcile Inventory Costs with the General Ledger](finance-how-to-post-inventory-costs-to-the-general-ledger.md).

Even though inventory costs are automatically posted to the general ledger, it's still necessary to ensure that the costs of goods are forwarded to the related outbound sales transaction, especially in situations where you sell goods before you invoice the purchase of those goods. This is referred to as cost adjustment. Item costs are automatically adjusted when you post item transactions, but you can also adjust item costs manually. To learn more, go to [Adjust Item Costs](inventory-how-adjust-item-costs.md).

# Organize general ledger (G/L) data using account categories

The **G/L Account Categories** page lets you create simple financial reports based on your chart of accounts.  

By providing categories, subcategories, and account mapping to your chart of accounts, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes basic financial reporting out of the box. If you're just getting started with financial reporting, the standard reports are excellent options until you become more experienced.

## Use G/L account categories

You create the first layer of a financial report by selecting an account category for each general ledger account. There are six categories:

* Assets
* Liabilities
* Equity
* Income
* Cost of Goods
* Expense

You specify categories on the **G/L Account Card** or **G/L Account Categories** pages. The purpose is to identify the major sections of primary financial reports, such as the Balance Sheet and Income Statement reports.  

:::image type="content" source="media/account categories financial reporting.png" alt-text="Shows the G/L account categories page.":::

## Use account subcategories

You can also create subcategories for each account. Subcategories help add more details to the mapping for accounts in each category. You also specify subcategories on the **G/L Account Card** or **G/L Account Categories** pages. The purpose is to identify the subsections of primary financial reports, such as the Balance Sheet and Income Statement reports. Subcategories are more flexible than categories because you can define them. 

:::image type="content" source="media/account subcategories.png" alt-text="Shows account subcategories."::: 

## Map general ledger accounts

The most important feature of the financial reports that [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides is the mapping between G/L accounts and account categories on the **G/L Account Categories** page. All accounts in the chart of accounts should be listed in a selected category and subcategory, so when you generate financial reports you include all mapped accounts. To learn more about mapping categories, go to the examples in [Walkthrough: Create custom financial reports](bi-examples-custom-financial-reports.md).  

:::image type="content" source="media/account mapping.png" alt-text="Shows accounts mapped to G/L account categories.":::

> [!NOTE]
> In 2024 release wave 1, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides the mapping only in the United States. If you're using another country version, you must create the mapping yourself. The mapping will become available in more country versions in future releases.

## Generate financial reports

After you set up categories and subcategories have and map all accounts on the chart of accounts, choose **Generate Financial Reports**. This action updates financial reports with the M- prefix with the mapping provided for your chart of accounts.  

To control which reports update when you generate financial reports, update the fields in the **Reporting** section of the **General Ledger Setup** page.  

You can remap and update these reports at any time. If you choose to regenerate them, you can choose to keep the original reports and create copies with the new mapping.

## Audit changes to account categories

You can use the Change Log feature to capture changes users make to your G/L account categories. [!INCLUDE [include-audit-what-who-when](includes/include-audit-what-who-when.md)] 

The following table lists the table for G/L account categories and its ID.

| Table | Table ID |
| ----- | -------- |
| G/L Account Category | 570 |

# Reconcile customer payments with a cash receipt journal or from customer ledger entries

When you receive a cash payment from a customer or give a cash refund, you can apply the payment or refund to close open debits or credits. You can specify the amount to apply. For example, you can apply partial payments to customer ledger entries. Closing customer ledger entries keeps customer statistics, account statements, finance charges, and so on, up-to-date.

> On the **Customer Ledger Entries** page, red font means that the related payment is past its due date. If overdue payments are becoming a problem, we can help you reduce their frequency. You can enable the **Late Payment Prediction Setup** extension, which uses a predictive model that we built in Azure Machine Learning to predict the timing of payments. These predictions help you reduce outstanding receivables and fine-tune your collections strategy. For example, if a payment is predicted to be late, you can adjust the terms of payment or the payment method for the customer. For more information, see [Late Payment Predictions](ui-extensions-late-payment-prediction.md).  

You can apply customer ledger entries in several ways:

* Enter information on the following pages:
   * The **Payment Reconciliation Journals** page. For more information, see [Applying Payments Automatically and Reconciling Bank Accounts](receivables-apply-payments-auto-reconcile-bank-accounts.md).
   * The **Payment Registration Setup** page. For more information, see [Reconcile Customer Payments from a List of Unpaid Sales Documents](receivables-how-reconcile-customer-payments-list-unpaid-sales-documents.md).
   * The **Cash Receipt Journals** page. For more information, see [To fill and post a cash receipt journal](#to-fill-and-post-a-cash-receipt-journal).
* By filling in the **Applies-to Doc. No.** field on sales credit memo documents. For more information, see [To apply a credit memo to a single customer ledger entry](#to-apply-a-credit-memo-to-a-single-customer-ledger-entry).
* By using the **Set Applies-to ID** action on a customer ledger entry. For more information, see [To apply a payment to a single customer ledger entry](#to-apply-a-payment-to-a-single-customer-ledger-entry).
* By using the **Apply Entries** action on the **Bank Deposit** page, and then entering the invoice number in the **Applies-to ID** field. For more information, see [Create Bank Deposits](bank-create-bank-deposits.md).

> [!NOTE]  
> If the **Application Method** field on the customer card contains **Apply to Oldest**, payments are applied to the oldest open credit entry, unless you manually specify an entry. If the application method is **Manual**, you always apply entries manually.

## To fill and post a cash receipt journal

If you select **Apply to Oldest** in the **Application Method** field on the customer card, the application occurs automatically.

## To apply customer ledger entries in different currencies to one another

If you sell to a customer in one currency and receive payment in another currency, you can still apply the invoice to the payment.  

Here's an example. You apply Entry A in one currency to Entry B in another currency. The posting date on Entry A is used to find the exchange rate to use to convert amounts on Entry B. The exchange rate is found on the **Currency Exchange Rates** page.  

Applying customer ledger entries in different currencies must be enabled. For more information, see [Enable Application of Ledger Entries in Different Currencies](finance-how-enable-application-ledger-entries-different-currencies.md).  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Cash Receipts Journal**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the journal you want, and fill in the first empty journal line using a currency code.
3. Choose the **Apply Entries** action.
4. Select the line with the entry you want to apply to the entry in the cash receipt journal, choose the **Set Applies-to ID** action, and then select the entry you want to apply to.
5. Choose the **OK** button to return to the cash receipt journal.
6. Post the sales journal.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>   When you apply entries in different currencies, the entries are converted to USD. Although the exchange rates for the two currencies are fixed, for example between USD and EUR, there may be a small residual amount when they are converted to USD. These small residual amounts are posted as gains and losses to the account specified in the **Realized Gains Account** or **Realized Losses Account** fields on the **Currencies** page. The **Amount (USD)** field is also adjusted on the vendor ledger entries.  

## To correct an application of customer entries
When you correct an application, correcting entries are created and posted for all entries. The correcting entries are the same as the originals but have an opposite sign in the **Amount** field. The correcting entries include all general ledger entries derived from the application. For example, the payment discount and currency gains/losses. The entries that the application closed are reopened.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customers**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the relevant customer card.
3. Choose the **Ledger Entries** action.
4. Select the relevant ledger entry, and then choose the **Unapply Entries** action.
5. Alternatively, choose the **Detailed Ledger Entry** action.
6. Select the application entry, and then choose the **Unapply Entries** action.
7. Fill in the fields in the header, and then choose the **Unapply** action.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>   If an entry has been applied by more than one application entry, you must unapply the latest application entry first.

# Set up VAT reports in the German version

Information from various invoice types is used to feed data into the EU Sales List report. To file a VAT report under the ELMA5 system from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], you need to set up report parameters.  

## Set up a VAT report  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Report Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
1. On the **General** FastTab, select the **Modify Submitted Reports** checkbox to let users modify VAT reports that are submitted to the tax authorities.  

   If the field is left blank, users must create a corrective VAT report instead.  

1. Select the **Export Cancellation Lines** checkbox if you want to include information about cancellation lines when you export data for the VAT report of EU sales. Learn more in [Correct VAT Reports](how-to-correct-vat-reports.md).  
1. On the **Numbering** FastTab, specify the number series to be used for standard VAT reports. This will be the default numbering series that is used on any VAT Report that you then create.  

   Depending on the requirements, you can use the same number series for all VAT reports, or separate number series for each type of VAT report.

   For example, if your company uses separate number series for standard and corrective VAT reports, this number series is the default number series. Users can select a different number series in the **No.** field when they create corrective reports.  

1. On the **ZIVIT** FastTab, specify information for the fields.  
1. Choose the **OK** button.

# GoBD filter examples in the German version

This article provides examples of how you can use and combine different filter types when you set up your GoBD exports. Setting the right filters can improve system performance.  

The following examples use the **G/L Entry** and **Cust. Ledger Entry** tables for data. They assume that you specified the following dates in the **Export Business Data** batch job.  

- Start Date = 01/01/2013  
- End Date = 12/31/2013  

## Setting up export record source examples  

### Period Field No. field

The following table describes the setup on the **Data Export Record Source** page.  

|Table No.|Table Name|Period Field No.|Period Field Name|Table Filter|  
|---------------|----------------|----------------------|-----------------------|------------------|  
|**17**|G/L Entry|4|Posting Date|No filter set.|  
|**21**|Cust. Ledger Entry|4|Posting Date|No filter set.|  

Results of the export:

- G/L entries and customer ledger entries with posting dates between 1/1/2013 and 12/31/2013.  

### Table filter field

In this example, in addition to the **Period Field No.** information, you also specify a table filter. This filter is useful when you want to include other filters to specify more criteria, for example, amounts, in addition to starting and ending dates for your export.  

|Table No.|Table Name|Period Field No.|Period Field Name|Table Filter|  
|---------------|----------------|----------------------|-----------------------|------------------|  
|**17**|G/L Entry|4|Posting Date||  
|**21**|Cust. Ledger Entry|||Cust. Ledger Entry: **Posting Date=..31-12-13**|  

Results of the export:

- G/L entries with posting dates between 1/1/2013 and 12/31/2013.  
- Customer ledger entries with posting dates that are earlier than 01/01/2014.  

### Date Filter Field No. and Date Filter handling fields

The following example shows how to set date type **FlowFilters**. If a table has more than one date FlowFilter, you can't specify the one to use. However, you can specify how to handle the date filter.  

|Table No.|Table Name|Period Field No.|Period Field Name|Table Filter|Date Filter Handling|  
|---------------|----------------|----------------------|-----------------------|------------------|--------------------------|  
|**18**|Customer|||Customer: **Net Change (LCY)**=<>0|**Period**|  
|**21**|Cust. Ledger Entry|4|Posting Date|Cust. Ledger Entry: **Remaining Amt. (LCY)**=<>0|**End Date Only**|  

Results of the export:

- Customers that have a **Net Change (LCY)** that is greater or less than **0** in the period from 1/1/2013 and 12/31/2013.  
- Customer ledger entries with posting dates between 01/01/2013 and 12/31/2013 that have a **Remaining Amt. (LCY)** that is greater or less than **0** on 12/31/2013.  

### Date filter handling for the same table

In this example, you set multiple filter definitions for the same table.  

|Table No.|Table Name|Table Filter|Date Filter Handling|  
|---------------|----------------|------------------|--------------------------|  
|**18**|Customer|Customer: **Net Change (LCY)**=<>0|**Period**|  
|**18**|Customer|Customer: **Net Change (LCY)**=<>0|**Start Date Only**|  

Results of the export:

- Customers that have a **Net Change (LCY)** that is greater or less than **0** in the period from 1/1/2013 and 12/31/2013.  
- Customers that have a **Net Change (LCY)** that is greater or less than **0** on the day before the start date.

# Set up data exports for a digital audit (GoBD/GDPdU) in the German Version

You must set up data export record sources to be able to export data for a digital audit according to the Grundsätze zum Datenzugriff und zur Prüfbarkeit digitaler Unterlagen (GDPdU). For each data export type, you must define one or more record sources, where each source is a table from which you want to export data.

> [!NOTE]  
> When someone opens **Data Exports** page for the first time, three data export records with predefined settings are created with the codes **GLAcc 2022**, **FAAcc 2022**, and **Item 2022**. Consider these data export records ready-made templates for exporting data from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] according to government requirements.
>
> - **GLAcc 2022** can be used to export data related to G/L and personal data.
> - **FAAcc 2022** can be used to export data related to fixed asset data.
> - **Item 2022** can be used to export data related to item and invoice data.

## Set up a data export  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Data Exports**, and then choose the related link.  
1. Choose the **New** action.  
1. On the **Data Exports** page, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |-----|-----------|  
    |**Code**|Specify the unique code for the data export, such as **Export-1**.|  
    |**Description**|Specify the description for the data export.|  

You must add record definitions to the data export. Each record definition represents a set of data that is exported.  

## Add a record definition to a digital audit definition group  

1. On the **Data Exports** page, choose the **Record Definitions** action.  
1. On the **Data Export Record Definitions** page, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|

    |**Data Export Code**|Select the data export code.<br><br/> If no data export code exists, you can create a new one.|  
    |**Description**|Specify the description for the record definition.|  
    |**Export Path**|Specify the path where the exported files are stored.|  

    Next, you must add the relevant *.dtd* file that is required according to the GDPdU, such as **gdpdu-01-08-2002.dtd**. If you must import a new DTD file to replace an existing file, you must first export the existing DTD file.  

1. Choose the **Import** action.  
1. On the **Import** page, navigate to the location of the relevant DTD file, and then choose the **Open** button.  

Next, you must specify the source for the data that is exported.  

## Add source tables to a data export  

1. On the **Data Export Record Definitions** page, choose the **Record Source** action.  
1. On the **Data Export Record Source** page, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Table No.**|Select the number of the main table to export data from.<br><br/> When you enter a value in the **Table No.** field, the **Table Name** field is updated.|

# Set up and export sales VAT advance notifications

A sales VAT advance notification is an XML file that you can use to report VAT to the German tax authorities on the Elektronische Steuererklärungen (ELSTER) online portal. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] generates an XML file with tax and base amounts, and information about your company in the format and layout that German tax authorities require.

> [!NOTE]
> Most of the functionality is included in the **ELSTER VAT Localization for Germany** extension. Make sure that this is installed in your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)]. Learn more in [Customizing Business Central Online Using Extensions](../../ui-extensions.md).

## Process

To create valid sales VAT advance notification, you must set up the following information:  

- The company registration information and tax office information.  
- Basic sales VAT advance notification on the **Electronic VAT Decl. Setup** page.
- The VAT statement.  

### Set up company information

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Company Information**, and then choose the related link.  
1. On the **Company Information** page, fill in the fields. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](../../includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

   Specifically for sales VAT advance notifications, in the **VAT Representative** field, enter the contact person for VAT-related information.  
1. Choose the **OK** button.  

### Set up the electronic VAT declaration

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Electronic VAT Decl. Setup**, and then choose the related link.
1. Fill in the fields as described in the following table.

|Field|Description|
|-----|-----|
|**Sales VAT Adv. Notif. Nos.**|Choose the number series to assign identification numbers to new sales VAT advance notifications.|
|**Sales VAT Adv. Notif. Path**|Enter the path and name of the folder where you want to store the XML files.|
|**XML File Default Name**|Enter the name of the file.|

### Set up a VAT statement

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Statement**, and then choose the related link.  
1. On the **VAT Statement** page, in the **Name** field, choose the dropdown arrow.  
1. On the **VAT Statement Names** page, in the line for the appropriate VAT statement name, select the **Sales VAT Adv. Notification** field.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The VAT statement must have a VAT statement line for each key figure required by the tax authority, where the **Row No.** field contains the key figure and the **Amount Type** field specifies whether this is a base amount or a tax amount. Ask your tax office if you have questions concerning the key figures and their definition.

1. Choose the **OK** button.  

## Create an XML document

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Vat Advanced Notification List**, and then choose the related link.  
1. On the **Sales Vat Advanced Notification List** page, choose the **New** action.  
1. On the **Sales VAT Adv. Notif. Card** page, fill in the fields. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](../../includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

    > [!CAUTION]
    > If you submitted a sales VAT advance notification as a test notification by selecting the **Testversion** field, you can't change it into a real notification later. The tax authority doesn't accept the same XML file if it's submitted with the **Testversion** field cleared.

    Optionally, choose the **Preview statement** action to see a VAT statement that shows the data that is in the XML that you submit to the ELSTER portal. This view shows an amount for each element in the XML file in a human-readable format.  

    > [!NOTE]
    > In versions older than version 19.3 and other updates that are made available in January and February 2022, the **Sales VAT Adv. Notif. Card** page shows fields and actions based on deprecated functionality in both the ELSTER portal and [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)]. Specifically fields that are tied to stylesheets are no longer in use, because the ELSTER portal no longer provides such stylesheets.
1. Choose the **Create XML-File** action.
1. On the **Create XML - VAT Adv. Notif.** page, in the **XML-File** field, choose either the **Create** or the **Create and Export** option.  

    If you choose the **Create and Export** option, the XML file is generated and saved to your device. If you choose the **Create** option, data is generated in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] as an XML file when you choose the **Export** action on the **Sales VAT Adv. Notif. Card** page.  
1. Choose the **OK** button.  

After the sales VAT advance notification document is created, all fields in the **Sales VAT Adv. Notif. Card** page can no longer be modified, except the **Description** field, because they define the content of the XML document. If you created an XML document and want to create a new XML document for the same period without transmitting the existing document to the tax authority, you must delete the existing XML file. Then, create the new document.

# Currency exchange rates in the German version

At the end of the fiscal year, you must adjust currency exchange rates for payables and receivables so that they're valued correctly in the annual balance. The **Adjust Exchange Rates** batch job supports different valuation methods in order to meet legal requirements in Germany.  

## Valuation methods

According to the Bilanz Modernisierungs Gesetz (BilMoG), payables and receivables are valued differently depending on the difference between the reference date and the due date. This is managed by the **Adjust Exchange Rates** batch job where you can specify which valuation method to use. If the due date is less than one year after the reference date, the **Adjust Exchange Rates** batch job must be run using the lowest value valuation method.  

The following table describes the valuation methods.  

|Valuation method|Description|  
|----------------------|---------------------------------------|  
|**BilMoG (Germany)**|Beginning in 2010, each ledger entry is adjusted as follows:<br><br/>- If the due date is less than one year after the reference date, payable/receivable transactions are valued at the actual exchange rate.<br><br/>- If the due date is more than one year after the reference date, payable/receivable transactions are valued at the lowest value, with the possibility of appreciation in value (Wertaufholung) up to the initial value. <br><br/>**Note:** Ledger entries must contain a due date. An entry that doesn't have a due date is treated as a long term liability.|  
|**Lowest value**|Exchange rates are adjusted by using the lowest value of the two exchange rates. Currency losses are always calculated and posted. Currency gains are only calculated and posted up to the original local currency value of the transaction.<br><br/> This ensures that receivables aren't valued above their original posting amounts, and that payables aren't valued below their original posting amounts.|  
|**Standard**|Exchange rates are adjusted according to standard valuation principles. Full unrealized gains and losses are calculated and posted. If the transaction is partially applied, only the remaining amount is included in the adjustment. Learn more in [Adjust Exchange Rates](#valuation-methods).|  

German companies must use the **BilMoG (Germany)** option when they run the **Adjust Exchange Rates** batch job. This ensures that each transaction is adjusted using the appropriate valuation method as required in Germany. This also enables two fields in the request page, where you can specify the two dates that must be used to calculate the adjustment. The following table describes the fields.  

|Field|Description|  
|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
|**Valuation Reference Date**|Specifies the base date that is used to calculate which entries are short-term entries.|  
|**Short term liabilities until**|Specifies the date that separates short-term entries from long-term entries. Short-term entries have a due date that is before or on this date. The default value is the value of the **Valuation Reference Date** field plus one year.|

# Process for digital audit (GoBD/GDPdU)

You can export data from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] according to the process for digital audit (GoBD/GDPdU), which is based on German tax law.  

## Overview  

Section 146 and 147 of the German Fiscal Code (Abgabenordnung, AO) allows tax authorities to assess the data of electronic accounting systems digitally. They may do this with a data storage device submitted to them or by direct or indirect access to the system. In the data storage device scenario, the tax liable company (or the person or entity entrusted with accounting and tax duties) must provide appropriate data storage devices with the data in computer-readable form. This means for the tax authorities that they'll be able to access at will all stored data, including the master data and connections with sort and filter functions. To provide data that can be used and evaluated in this manner, you must define and standardize the file formats for submission by data storage device.  

Tax authorities in Germany use analysis software, IDEA, which imports data from ASCII files. The IDEA software can import data in variable length or fixed length format. It requires an XML file, *index.xml*, that describes the structure of the data files.

## Defining GDPdU export data  

You can configure [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] to export data to meet your needs. You can export large sets of data, and you can export small sets of data. You can export data from a single table or a table and related tables.  

For each data export, you define the tables and fields that you want to export. This depends on the auditor's requests. The selected information is exported to the ASCII files. A corresponding XML file, *INDEX.XML*, is also created to describe the ASCII file structure.  

The elements in the *INDEX.XML* file define the names of the tables and fields that are exported. Because the current auditing tool has restrictions on these field names, such as the length and the characters that are used, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] removes spaces and special characters and then truncates the names to match the 20 character limitation. You can change the suggested table and field names when you add fields to a table definition.  

In most cases, you set up GDPdU data export one time, and then a person in your company can run the export when the auditor requests new data. It's recommended that the setup is handled by people with an understanding of the database structure and the technical hardware in your company, but also in collaboration with people who understand the business data, such as the accountant.  

## Configuration  

You can set up different GDPdU data exports depending on the type of data that you want to be able to export. For example, you can create two GDPdU data exports:  

- One exports high-level information about all general ledger entries, customer ledger entries, vendor ledger entries, and VAT entries.  
- The other exports detailed information about the general ledger entries.  

> [!NOTE]  
> How to set up the GDPdU data exports depends on your company’s needs and the auditor’s requests.  

[Walkthrough: Exporting Data for a Digital Audit](walkthrough-exporting-data-for-a-digital-audit.md) provides an example of how to set up data exports for GDPdU.  

### Data export filters  

When you set up a data export, you can filter data on different levels as described in the following table.  

|Filter level|Description|  
|------------------|---------------------------------------|  
|**Period filters**|You can specify a start date and end date for the data that is exported. You can then use this period filter to filter the data. For example, if you set a period filter for the export, you can then set table filters that use the period.|  
|**Table filters**|You can set filters on each table in the export. For example, you can include only open ledger entries, or entries that have a posting date in the specified filter. For example, you can also set a filter that is based on FlowFields, such as **Net Change (LCY)**, to only export customers where there's a change.<br><br>**Important:**  You can't set a table filter that is based on a FlowFilter.<br><br/> When you add table filters, you can increase performance by specifying the fields that the exported data will be sorted by the value of the **Key No.** field for the record definition. Which keys to use depends on the table. For example, if the table only has two key fields and relatively few entries, then the sort order doesn't affect the speed of the export. But for a table such as G/L Entry, the export is faster if you specify the key in advance, such as the `G/L Account No.,Posting Date` key. If you don't specify a key, then the primary key is used, which might not be the best choice.<br><br/>Other tables in which it can be useful to specify the key include the **Cust. Ledger Entry** and **Vendor Ledger Entry** tables.|  
|**FlowField filters**|You can include FlowFields in the export and set filters based on the period. For example, you can apply the period filter to the **Balance at Date** field on the **G/L Account** table.|  

If you include a FlowField such as the **Net Change (LCY)** field on the **Customer** table, you can specify that the entries must be filtered based on the remaining amount at the end date of the GDPdU period. If you add this as a field filter, then the calculation formulas are based on the dates that are specified during the export.

Learn more in [GDPdU Filter Examples](gdpdu-filter-examples.md).

## Export performance  

If you want to export large sets of data, it can take a long time. We recommend that you set up data exports based on advice from your tax advisor to establish your business needs, and the requirements of the tax auditor. The number of records in a table is also something that you should consider.

# Walkthrough: Exporting data for a digital audit in the German version

You can export business data for auditing purposes. How the data export is set up is different for all companies, and you should ask your tax advisor and the tax auditor. The following walkthrough describes the end-to-end process, but it's an example only.  

The sample implementation illustrates a scenario where the auditor requests that you export data from your general ledger, and information about your customers and vendors. This isn't an example that is based on actual requirements from a tax auditor, but it serves to illustrate how to export data for a digital audit (GoBD/GDPdU) in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)].  

## About this walkthrough

This walkthrough illustrates the following tasks:  

- Setting up requirements for the data export.  
- Setting up the source for the data export.  
- Exporting data for the tax auditor.  

## Prerequisites

To complete this walkthrough, you need:  

- The German version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] with the CRONUS AG demonstration company.
- The *.DTD* file that is required according to the GDPdU. In this scenario, **gdpdu-01-08-2002.dtd**.  

## Story

Cassie, an accountant at CRONUS AG is notified by the company's tax auditor that they want to see a list of purchase and sales transactions in the first quarter of the calendar year 2013. Cassie knows the type of financial data that the auditor wants, but needs the help of Sean to set up the export.  

Sean is a power user with CRONUS AG and understands how the data is set up technically with tables and fields. Therefore, Sean usually helps Cassie set up the data exports for the auditors. From other data exports, Sean knows that the tool that the auditors use has some requirements on what the exported files must contain, but needs the help of Cassie to establish exactly which data is needed.  

## Defining the requirements

Cassie sets up the requirements for the data export. The auditors ask for transactions with customers and vendors. Therefore, Cassie knows that data is needed from the customer ledger, the vendor ledger, and the general ledger.  

### Set up the requirements for a data export  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Data Export**, and then choose the related link.  
1. Choose the **New** action.  
1. On the **Data Exports** page, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Code**|The unique code for the data export, **AUDIT-Q113**.|  
    |**Description**|The description for the data export, **Data export for Q1 of CY 2013**.|  

    The **AUDIT-Q113** code is a container for the data export.  

    Next, Cassie adds descriptions of the kind of data needed in the export.  

1. On the **Data Exports** page, choose the **Record Definitions** action.  
1. On the **Data Export Record Definitions** page, choose the **Record Code** field, and then, on the page that appears, choose the **New** action.  
1. On the **Data Export Record Types** page, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Code**|The code for the record type, **GLCUSTVEND**.|  
    |**Description**|The description for the record type, **G/L, Cust., Vend.**.|  

1. Choose the **OK** button.  
1. On the **Data Export Record Definitions** page, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Record Code**|Select the record code, **GLCUSTVEND**.|  
    |**Description**|The description for the record type is added automatically, but you can change this to **General ledger, customers and vendors**, for example.|  
    |**Export Path**|Specify the path where the exported files are stored.<br><br/> In this scenario, **C:Exports**.|  

    If the specified folder doesn't exist, choose the **Yes** button to create it.  

Next, Cassie specifies the source for the data that are exported. Cassie knows from previous exports that data is needed from the following tables:  

- **G/L Account**  
- **Customer**  
- **Vendor**  

### Specify requirements for the source for the data export  

1. On the **Data Export Record Definitions** page, choose the **Record Source** action.  
1. On the **Data Export Record Source** page, in the **Table No.** field, enter **15**.  

   The **Table Name** field is automatically updated with the name of the **G/L Account** table.  

1. In the **Notes** part, choose the link, and then enter the following text:  

    **I need entries that show the affected accounts, the posting date, the balance, and the net change.**  

1. Repeat the two previous steps to add tables 18, **Customer**, and 23, **Vendor** to the data export record source.  

    For these tables, Cassie asks for data about each customer and vendor and detailed information about each transaction based on the customer ledger and the vendor ledger. Cassie also asks for the net change at the start of the period, during the period, and after the period that the data export is for.  

1. Choose the **OK** button.  

Cassie has described the kind of data needed, and requests Sean for help with setting up the data export.  

## Setting up the source for the data export

Cassie and Sean talked about the requirements. Cassie explained the comments made for the first three tables in the record sources. The next day, Sean can complete the setup for the data export source.  

First, Sean adds the required *.dtd* file to the data export record definition.  

### Add a .dtd file to a record definition  

1. On the **Data Exports** page, choose the **AUDIT-Q113** data export, and then choose the **Record Definitions** action.  
1. On the **Data Export Record Definitions** page, choose the line where the **Data Export Record Type Code** field is set to **GLCUSTVEND**, and then choose the **Import** action.  
1. On the **Import** page, navigate to the location of the relevant DTD file, and then choose the **Open** button.  

Next, Sean adds the **G/L Entry** table to the source and then adds fields from that table, and the **G/L Account** table.  

### Add the G/L Entry table to the data export record source  

1. On the **Data Export Record Definitions** page, choose the line where the **Data Export Record Type Code** field is set to **GLCUSTVEND**, and then choose the **Record Source** action.  
1. On the **Data Export Record Source** page, select the line under the line for the **G/L Account** table, and then choose the **New** action.  
1. In the **Table No.** field, enter **17**.  

   The **Table Name** field is automatically updated with the name of the **G/L Entry** table.  

1. Choose the **Indent** action.  

   This indents the **G/L Entry** table under the **G/L Account** table. Next, Sean adds a table relationship between the two tables.  

1. Choose the **Relationships** action.  
1. On the **Data Exp. Table Relationship** page, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**From Field No.**|Contains the number of the field in the parent table. In this scenario, the **No.** field on the **G/L Account** table.|  
    |**To Field No.**|Contains the number of the field in the parent table. In this scenario, the **G/L Account No.** field on the **G/L Entry** table.|  

1. Choose the **OK** button.  

### Add fields from the G/L Account and G/L Entry tables to the data export record source  

1. On the **Data Export Record Source** page, select the line for the **G/L Account** table, and then choose the **Add** action.  
1. Choose the following fields, and then choose the **OK** button.  

    |Field number|Field name|  
    |------------------|----------------|  
    |**1**|**No.**|  
    |**2**|**Name**|  
    |**4**|**Account Type.**|  
    |**31**|**Balance at Date**|  
    |**32**|**Net Change**|  

1. On the **Data Export Record Source** page, select the line for the **G/L Entry** table, and then in the **Fields** pane, in the toolbar, choose the **Add** action.  
1. Choose the following fields, and then choose the **OK** button.  

    |Field number|Field name|  
    |------------------|----------------|  
    |**4**|**Posting Date**|  
    |**5**|**Document Type**|  
    |**17**|**Amount**|  

Sean added the **Posting Date** field from the **G/L Entry** table because Cassie needs the data to be filtered based on the posting date. Now, Sean uses the field to specify the field on the **G/L Entry** table that uses to calculate the period for the data export.  

### Add a period filter to a table in a data export source  

1. On the **Data Export Record Source** page, select the line for the **G/L Entry** table, and then choose the **Period Field No.** field.  
1. On the **Data Exp. Field List** page, choose the **Posting Date** field, and then choose the **OK** button.  

   The **Data Exp. Field List** page is filtered to show only the date fields.  

This means that when Cassie exports the data and specifies the start date and the end date for the period that the auditors want, the export includes entries where the **Posting Date** field is between the specified start date and end date.  

Next, Sean adds the **Customer** and **Vendor** tables.  

### Add the Customer table  

1. On the **Data Export Record Source** page, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Table No.**|**18**|  
    |**Export Table Name**|**Customer**|  
    |**Export File Name**|**Customer.txt**|  

1. In the **Fields** pane, in the toolbar, choose the **Add** action.  
1. Choose the following fields, and then choose the **OK** button.  

    |Field number|Field name|  
    |------------------|----------------|  
    |**1**|**No.**|  
    |**2**|**Name**|  
    |**21**|**Customer Posting Group**|  
    |**59**|**Balance (LCY)**|  
    |**61**|**Net Change (LCY)**|  

1. Repeat the previous two steps to add the **Balance (LCY)** field again.  
1. Choose the line for the first instance of the **Balance (LCY)** field, and then, in the **Datefilter Handling** field, choose **Startdate**.  
1. Choose the line for the second instance of the **Balance (LCY)** field, and then, in the **Datefilter Handling** field, choose **Enddate**.  
1. Choose the line for the **Net Change (LCY)** field, and then, in the **Datefilter Handling** field, choose **Startdate..Enddate**.  

    The following table describes the field values for the fields on the **Customer** table.  

    |**Field No.**|**Field Name**|**Field Class**|**Datefilter Handling**|**Export Field Name**|  
    |---------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|  
    |**1**|**No.**|**Normal**||**No**|  
    |**2**|**Name**|**Normal**||**Name**|  
    |**21**|**Customer Posting Group**|**Normal**||**CustomerPostingGroup**|  
    |**59**|**Balance (LCY)**|**FlowField**|**..Startdate**|**StartBalanceLCY**|  
    |**59**|**Balance (LCY)**|**FlowField**|**..Enddate**|**EndBalanceLCY**|  
    |**61**|**Net Change (LCY)**|**FlowField**|**Startdate..Enddate**|**NetChangeLCYPeriod**|  

    > [!TIP]  
    > To change the order of the fields, select a field, and then choose the **Move Up** or the  **Move Down** action.  

Sean added the **Customer** table to the data export source. Now, he adds the **Vendor** table.  

### Add the Vendor table  

1. On the **Data Export Record Source** page, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Table No.**|**23**|  
    |**Export Table Name**|**Vendor**|  
    |**Export File Name**|**Vendor.txt**|  

1. Follow the steps in the previous procedure to add fields from the **Vendor** table to the data export source.  

    The following table describes the field values for the fields in the **Vendor** table.  

    |**Field No.**|**Field Name**|**Field Class**|**Datefilter Handling**|**Export Field Name**|  
    |---------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|  
    |**1**|**No.**|**Normal**||**No**|  
    |**2**|**Name**|**Normal**||**Name**|  
    |**21**|**Vendor Posting Group**|**Normal**||**VendorPostingGroup**|  
    |**59**|**Balance (LCY)**|**FlowField**|**..Startdate**|**StartBalanceLCY**|  
    |**59**|**Balance (LCY)**|**FlowField**|**..Enddate**|**EndBalanceLCY**|  
    |**61**|**Net Change (LCY)**|**FlowField**|**Startdate..Enddate**|**NetChangeLCYPeriod**|  

Sean almost completes the setup, but wants to verify that the data export source meets the technical requirements of the auditors' tool.  

### Validate the data export source  

Choose the **Validate** action.  

Sean now completes the setup of the data export based on the requirements from Cassie. Sean notifies Cassie to start exporting data for the tax auditors.  

## Exporting data for the tax auditors

Cassie wants to export data that can be sent to the tax auditors.  

### Export data  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Export Business Data**, and then choose the related link.  
1. On the **Export Business Data** page, on the **Options** FastTab, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Starting Date**|The start date. In this scenario, **01-01-2018**.|  
    |**Ending Date**|The end date. In this scenario, **03-31-2018**.|  

1. On the **Data Export Record Definition** FastTab, select filters as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Data Export Code**|In this scenario, **AUDIT-Q113**.|  
    |**Data Exp. Rec. Type Code**|In this scenario, **GLCUSTVEND**.|  

1. To export the data, choose the **OK** button.  

When the export is completed, Cassie is notified, and can now submit the exported files to the tax auditors. First, Cassie examines the files in the C:Exports folder on the computer. There's a file for each table, and the files have the names that Sean specified in the data export source. There's also an *INDEX.XML* file that describes the structure of the data export with the names of the tables and fields that Sean specified.  

## Next steps

When the tax auditors import Cassie's files into their software, they can read the data that was exported. If the auditors need a new version of the same data export, Cassie can run the export again.  

The next time the tax auditors request new data, Cassie, and Sean can collaborate to create a new data export.

# Electronic invoicing in Germany

This article provides information on how to work with the German localization of the E-Document framework.

## E-Documents framework setup

Learn more in [Set up e-documents](../../finance-how-setup-edocuments.md), which provides information about setting up the E-Documents framework.

### Set up local formats  

> [!NOTE]
> Currently, the E-Document framework for the German localization supports the XRechnung (UBL) and Peppol BIS 3 formats. The ZUGFeRD format isn't supported yet.

To set up the format for the E-Document service, follow these steps:  

1. Select the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **E-Document Services**, and then select the related link. The **E-Document Services** page displays.
1. On the **General** FastTab, select **New**. In the **Document Format** field, choose **PEPPOL BIS 3.0** or **XRechnung**.  
1. Configure the fields as described in [Set up e-documents](../../finance-how-setup-edocuments.md).
1. Close the page.

### Use buying reference on the E-invoice

When you configure e-invoices in the sales process, make sure to display your buyer reference on the invoice. Follow these steps to set up how you use buyer references:  

1. Select the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **E-Document Services**, and then select the related link. The **E-Document Services** page displays.
1. On the **Export** FastTab, select the **Buyer Reference Mandatory** field to specify whether the buyer reference is mandatory for the document.
1. Select where you use buyer references by choosing one of the options in the **Buyer Reference** field.  
   1. If you choose the **Your reference** option, you're required to populate the **Your reference** field on the sales document.
   1. If you choose the **Customer reference**, the system uses the **E-Invoice Routing No** from the **Customer** card.  
1. Close the page.

## Work with E-invoices

Learn more in [Use e-documents in the purchases process](../../finance-how-use-edocuments.md), which provides information about the E-Documents framework in purchase processes.  

> [!NOTE]
> E-invoicing in purchase processes is available starting with version 25.2, and its enablement in sales starts from version 25.3.

# Post a negative entry in the German version

You can use the **Correction** field to post a negative debit instead of a credit, or to post a negative credit instead of a debit on an account. To meet legal requirements, this field is visible by default in some journals, but if not, you can personalize the page to add them. The **Debit Amount** and **Credit Amount** fields include both the original entry, and the corrected entry. These fields have no effect on the account balance.  

## Post a negative entry  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
1. In the **Batch Name** field, select the required batch name.  
1. Enter information into the relevant fields.  
1. In the journal line that you want to activate for negative entries, select the **Correction** checkbox.  
1. To post the journal, choose the **Post** action, and then choose the **Yes** button.

> This article explains the old Intrastat Journals functionality, which is now deprecated.

[!INCLUDE[intrastat-2022w2](../../includes/intrastat-2022w2.md)]

Intrastat reporting is required throughout the European Union (EU) and must follow local requirements, such as specific formats and files. All companies in the EU must report their trade with other EU countries/regions. The movement of goods must be reported to the statistics authorities (Statistisches Bundesamt) every month, and a report must be delivered to the tax authorities.  

For Intrastat reporting, you must provide paper reports and files, which must be in ASCII format for Germany. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] includes reports and batch jobs that generate all of the information that must be sent to the German tax authorities. This information automatically includes both receipt and delivery of goods. The Intrastat file contains information from the lines in the **Intrastat** journal.  

## Deprecated Intrastat functionality

This article provides details about the deprecated Intrastat Journals functionality. Learn more in [Set up Intrastat reporting](../../finance-how-setup-report-intrastat.md), which provides information about the updated version of Intrastat.

# Correct VAT reports in the German version

If you have to submit a corrective VAT report or delete a submitted VAT report, you must create a new VAT report. According to the legislation, a corrective report must be submitted within a month of the initial report.  

When you create a corrective report, the report contains two line types per corrected line. In one line type, **Cancellation**, the base value of the VAT is reported as a cancellation. All other information remains the same, and can't be edited. On a new line, **Correction type**, you can make corrections as needed to the VAT amount. The **Suggest Lines** action, however, suggests the correct amount based on the filters and posted documents. You can't correct or modify the **VAT Registration No.**, each period being corrected needs its own corrective report.  

The **Suggest Lines** action recalculates the values to report. The **Correct Lines** action is used to make manual changes. You can combine the effects of the two actions to correct your report.  

## Example corrections scenarios

1. If you post additional VAT entries after you submit the Standard report in the report period, choose **Suggest Lines** in the **Process** group to get the updated amounts.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > If you manually changed the amount for a customer or vendor, this amount is overwritten when additional VAT entries are posted. Update the amount accordingly.  

1. If you want to change the amount of a report line that is submitted and no new VAT entries are posted, choose the  **Correct Lines** action. On the **VAT Report Lines** page, select the lines that you want to correct, and then choose the **OK** button.  

    For each entry, two lines are displayed: **Cancellation** and **Correction**. You can now change the amount on the **Correction line**.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > The **Correct Lines** action doesn't suggest the amount based in VAT entries. If you have new VAT entries for the customer or vendor, instead use the **Suggest Lines** action.  

1. If you used the wrong filters, for example, the wrong VAT product posting group, choose the **Suggest Lines** action, and then set filters as needed.  

    **Suggest Lines** creates entries to account for the difference between the filters.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > If the updated filters exclude a customer or vendor, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] creates a Cancellation line for the previous reported amount and a Correction entry with amount 0.

## Correct a VAT report  

1. Create a new VAT report. Learn more in [Create VAT Reports](how-to-create-vat-reports.md).  
1. Fill in the fields in the **General** FastTab, and set the **VAT Report Type** field to **Corrective**.  
1. In the **Original Report No.** field, select the report that you want to correct. You can only select reports of type **Standard** that are marked as **Submitted**.  
1. Create your correction VAT report line entries.  

    Choose the **Suggest Lines** action. Set filters as needed.  

    On each line, you can drill down on the amounts to see which VAT entries make up the amount. Change the amount if needed. You can't edit, however, the **VAT Registration No.**.  

1. If the **Suggest Lines** action doesn't provide suggestions to correct the amounts that you intended, use the **Correct Lines** action to insert cancellation and correction lines for the customer or vendor.  
1. Continue with the VAT report creation process, and release the report.

# EU sales list in Germany

In Germany, the German EU sales list is submitted to the "Bundeszentralamt für Steuern" (BZSt) through the BZSt Online Portal by using the ELMA5 interface.  

In order to increase security, all types of taxes and tax reports must be submitted under an authentication method. Beginning in January 1, 2013, it's mandatory that you make submissions with authentication. To do so, you sign in with your BZSt number and private key using your pass phrase on the ELMA5 communications server. ELMA5 is designed to handle the transmission of large datasets of more than 1000 records. Following successful login, you can upload the data transfer in an interactive way. You can also set up the transfer to be automatic.

# Create VAT reports in the German version

You can configure different types of VAT reports based on requirements. Then, when you have to submit a VAT report, you can create it on the **VAT Report** page and then export it in electronic format that conforms to the ELMA5 format requirements.  

## Create a VAT report  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Report**, and then choose the related link.  
1. Fill in the fields in the **General** FastTab, including the fields that are described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**No.**|Specify the report number.<br><br/>Depending on the type of report, and the configuration in your company, you can use the automatically generated number, select a different number series, or enter a different number manually.|  
    |**VAT Report Type**|Select the appropriate VAT report type. The default setting is  **Standard**. If the report is an update to an existing report, choose **Corrective**.|  
    |**Trade Type**|Specify the type of trade that the report is to describe. The default is **Sales**. Other options are **Purchases** or **Both**.|  
    |**Start Date**|Specify the start date of the report period.|  
    |**End Date**|Specify the end date of the report period.|  
    |**EU Goods/Services**|Specify whether the report applies to **Goods**, **Services**, or both. The default is **Both**.|  
    |**Report Period Type**|Specify the time period that the report applies to:<br>- Month<br>- Quarter<br>- Year<br>- Bi-Monthly|  
    |**Report Period No.**|Specify the number of the VAT period.|  
    |**Report Year**|Specify the year that the VAT report covers.|  
    |**Processing Date**|Specify the date that the VAT report is created.|  

1. Fill in the fields in the **Sign-off** FastTab, including the key fields that are described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Sign-off Place**|Specify the location where the VAT report was signed off.|  
    |**Sign-off Date**|Specify the date when the VAT report is signed off.|  
    |**Signed by Employee No.**|Specify the number of the employee who signed the VAT report from the lookup list.|  
    |**Created by Employee No.**|Specify the number of the employee who created the VAT report from the lookup list.|  

1. Import the VAT ledger entries that must be included in the VAT report.  
1. Choose the **Suggest Lines** action.  

This adds VAT entries to the page. For each line, in the **Amount** field, you can drill down to see the VAT ledger entries that are the source of the line.  

After you create the VAT report, you have to submit it to the tax authorities.  

## Submit a VAT report  

1. On the **VAT Report** page, choose the **Release** action.  
1. Confirm that you want to release the report.  

    [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] validates that the VAT report is set up correctly. If the validation fails, the errors are shown on the **VAT Report Error Log** page so that you can make the appropriate changes. For example, an error displays if you try to release a standard VAT report but you have not yet added any lines to the report.  

    When you mark a VAT report as released, it becomes non-editable. If you must change the report after marking it as released, you must first reopen it.  

1. Choose the **Export** action to create a VAT report of EU Sales List data in ELMA5 format. Save a copy of the report, which has the required name specified by ELMA5.  

   You can now submit the report to the tax authorities.  

1. Choose the **Mark as Submitted** action.

# Belgian electronic payments

In the Belgian version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], you can make the following types of electronic payments:  

|Electronic payment|Description|  
|------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
|Domestic|A local financial institution process these payments in the local currency (LCY) for beneficiaries who have accounts that have a local financial institution. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] verifies the validity of the bank account numbers.|  
|International|A local financial institution process these payments that are either in foreign currencies or in LCY for beneficiaries who have accounts that have foreign financial institutions. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] verifies the validity of the bank account numbers.|  
|SEPA|These payments are in Euro and are processed in countries/regions that accept SEPA payments. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] verifies the validity of the bank account numbers.|  
|Non-Euro SEPA|These payments are in currency other than Euro and made to a country/region outside the European Economic Association (EEA). [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] verifies the validity of the bank account numbers.|  

Because the standard for electronic payments is different for countries/regions, only financial institutions in Belgium can process electronic payments created in the Belgian version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)]. The local financial institutions process the payment with the foreign institutions for international payments.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Credit memos can't be processed separately because payments must not have a negative balance. To process a credit memo, the credit memo must be added to one or more invoices by summarizing payments.  

Before you can make electronic payments, you must set up use electronic banking. Learn more in [Setup](belgian-electronic-banking.md#setup). You must also specify the relevant export protocols. Learn more in [Set Up Export Protocols](how-to-set-up-export-protocols.md).  

## Activate SEPA payments

[!INCLUDE [activate-sepa-payments](../includes/BENL/activate-sepa-payments.md)]

You can now make SEPA payments. Learn more in [Exporting Payments to a Bank File](../../finance-make-payments-with-bank-data-conversion-service-or-sepa-credit-transfer.md#exporting-payments-to-a-bank-file). If you don't use the AC Banking 365 capability, you can export payment journal lines to a file. Learn more in [Export Payment Files](how-to-print-payment-files.md).  

## File non-Euro SEPA payments

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], you can file non-Euro SEPA payments with the bank. This is useful when you make payments to other countries/regions that don't use SEPA and for currencies other than the Euro.  

Before you can file a non-Euro SEPA payment, you must complete the following administration tasks:  

1. Set up a new export protocol for a non-Euro SEPA.  
1. In the **Country/Region** table, clear the **SEPA Allowed** field for each country that belongs to the EEA zone.  
1. In the **General Ledger Setup** page, verify that the **Currency Euro** field is blank, and that the **SEPA Non-Euro Export** field is selected.  
1. Verify that the vendor's **Preferred Bank Account** field in the **Vendor** table contains the IBAN and SWIFT code.  

## File a non-Euro SEPA payment  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **File Non Euro SEPA Payments**, and then choose the related link.  
1. Fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Journal Template Name**|Specify the general journal template for the non-Euro SEPA payment report.|  
    |**Journal Batch**|Specify the general journal batch for the non-Euro SEPA payment report.|  
    |**Post General Journal Lines**|Specify if you want to transfer the payment lines to the general ledger.|  
    |**Include Dimensions**|Enter the dimensions that you want to include in the non-Euro SEPA payment report. The option is available only if the **Summarize Gen. Jnl. Lines** field on the **Electronic Banking Setup** page is selected.|  
    |**Execution Date**|Enter an execution date if you want an execution date that differs from the posting date on the payment lines.|  
    |**File Name**|Enter the name of the file, including the drive and folder, to which you want to print the report.|  

## Correct payment lines

You must correct all errors before you can post the electronic payment lines. You can correct payment lines in the following ways.  

|Correction|Description|  
|----------------|---------------------------------------|  
|Add a payment journal line|If the payment journal already contains many lines and you want to add an additional line, you can enter the journal line manually. For example, if you want to reimburse a credit memo to a customer. These types of customer payments aren't suggested automatically by the **Suggest Vendor Payments** batch job.|  
|Edit a payment journal line|If you don't assign a bank account to the payment journal or if you don't specify a preferred bank account on the Vendor card, you have to manually enter this information on each journal line before posting the journal. If you specify a bank account for a vendor, the bank account is copied to all payment journal lines for that vendor. Learn more in [Setup](belgian-electronic-banking.md#setup).|  
|Delete a payment journal line|The **Suggest Vendor Payments** batch job creates payment suggestions for all vendors matching the specified criteria. If you want to prevent payment for a specific vendor ledger entry or vendor, you can delete the corresponding journal lines.|

# Set up non-deductible VAT in the Belgian version

You can calculate VAT amounts for specific types of expenses that can be partially declared as VAT. For example, on the **G/L Account Card** page, if you enter 75 in the **% Non-Deductible VAT** field, then 75 percent of the regular VAT amount is considered an additional cost and is added to the net amount during posting. The remaining 25 percent is posted as regular VAT.  

> [!NOTE]  
> If no value is entered in the **% Non-Deductible VAT** field, the VAT amount is 100 percent deductible.  

## Set up the non-deductible VAT percentage  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Chart of Accounts**, and then choose the related link.  
1. Select a general ledger expense account that requires the partial deduction, and then choose the **Edit** action.  
1. Enter the amount in **% Non deductible VAT** field.  
1. Choose the **OK** button.

# Belgian Intrastat reporting

[!INCLUDE[intrastat-2022w2](../../includes/intrastat-2022w2.md)]

Companies in the European Union (EU) are required to report trade with other countries/regions in the EU. This reporting process is through Intrastat reporting or VIES (VAT Information Exchange System). There are two types of Intrastat declarations:  

- Simplified declaration  
- Extended declaration  

To determine the type of declaration that you should use, visit the [National Bank of Belgium](https://aka.ms/BelgianNationalBank) website.  

## Submitting the Intrastat report

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], you can export the Intrastat declarations to a file that you can then submit to the OneGate portal. Learn more in [Export Intrastat Third-Party Declarations](how-to-export-intrastat-third-party-declararations.md).

# Create payment journal templates and batches in the Belgian version

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], payment suggestions are generated and posted in payment journals. The structure of the payment journal is similar to the structure of other journal types. However, the payment journal contains some fields that are specific for processing payments. Before you can start generating payment suggestions, you have to set up a payment journal template and a payment journal batch.  

You can assign a specific page and a test report to each journal template. This way, you can manage your domestic and international payments from this adjusted page. The specified *source code* is copied to all the journal lines that are created based on the journal template. The code is also copied to the entries when they're posted. This way, you can always see where an entry is posted from.

If you assign a bank account to the payment journal template, the bank account is inserted on all payment journal batches and payment journal lines that are created by using this template. By specifying a bank account for the journal template, you can reduce the time that is required for checking the payment suggestions.  

## Create a payment journal template  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Payment Journal Templates**, and then choose the related link.  
1. Choose the **New** action.  
1. On the **Payment Journal Templates** page, fill in the fields.  

   [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](../../includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > If the **Page ID** and **Test Report ID** fields aren't shown, you must add them through personalization. The fields must be filled in before you continue. Learn more in [Personalize Your Workspace](../../ui-personalization-user.md).
1. Repeat step 2 for any additional templates.
1. Choose the **OK** button.  

You can create multiple journal batches under each journal template. Several journals, each with its own name, can display the same page. For example, this can be practical if every user must have a dedicated journal.

## Add payment journal batches to the journal template  

1. On the **Payment Journal Templates** page, choose the **Batches** action.  
1. On the **Paym. Journal Batch** page, fill in the fields.  

   [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](../../includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

# Export payment files in the Belgian version

After printing a test report and correcting errors, you can export the payment journal lines to a payment file.  

A payment file contains either domestic, international, SEPA, or non-Euro SEPA payments. The file can be sent to a bank electronically. You can create only one file for each posting date and each currency code. When you export the payments to a file, an accompanying note is printed, which can also be sent to the bank.  

In the payment journal, the **Status** field on the exported lines is set to **Posted**.  

## Print a payment file  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter *Payment Journal*, and then choose the link to open the **EB Payment Journal** page.  
1. In the **Batch Name** field, select the required journal batch.  
1. In the **Export Protocol** field, select the export protocol.  

   Export protocols control which payment file is generated in the payment journal. You can have a mixture of export formats in a single batch, such as domestic, international, SEPA, or a combination of these. However, when exporting the payment lines to a file, you can use only one export format, or export protocol.  

   > [!NOTE]
   > By defining the export protocol, you also define the type of validation that is performed in the payment journal.
1. Enter the payment journal line information.

    1. Choose the **Suggest Vendor Payments** action.
    1. In the **Suggest Vendor Payments EB** page, set the relevant filters and options.

        This batch job processes open vendor ledger entries and creates a payment suggestion as lines in a payment journal. Open vendor ledger entries result from posting invoices and finance charge memos.

        Only the ledger entries of vendors where the **Suggest Payments** field is selected on their **Vendor** card are included in the batch job. The suggestions are registered in a payment journal. You must specify a last payment date that is used in the batch job.

        In addition, only vendor entries that aren't marked as **On Hold** in the **Vendor Ledger Entries** page are included in the batch job. You can also run the batch job so that it also includes payments for which you can obtain a discount.

        When you enter an available amount, the vendors are ordered by **Priority**.

        You can define what is included in the report by setting filters. To set additional fields on the tab, choose the field. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](../../includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
    1. Delete or modify the lines as appropriate.
    1. If no bank account is indicated on the payment journal template, indicate a bank account to pay with on each line.
1. Choose the **Check Payment Lines** action.

    The **Export Check Error Logs** page displays any errors that exist. If there are errors, you must fix them before you can continue.

1. If there are no errors, choose the **Export Payment Lines** action.  

   The report that you specified in the relevant export protocol processes the payment lines and generates the file.

# Belgian CODA bank statements in the Belgian version

The Coded Statement of Account (CODA) is a national banking standard, designed by the Belgian Banker's Association, which allows you to automatically process electronic bank statements.  

Each type of transaction in a CODA statement is assigned a unique code. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] uses this code to interpret transactions and apply them to the corresponding ledger entries.  

## Applying statement lines

When you have imported a CODA statement, you can apply the statement lines to existing ledger entries, based on the information in the **Transaction Coding** table.  

If the transaction coding of the statement line isn't found, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] stops processing and continues with the next statement line. If you select the **Default Posting** field, the statement line is used as a default posting.  

If the transaction coding of the statement line is found, the statement lines are matched to the following account types and corresponding account numbers:  

- **General ledger**: If the account type is a general ledger account, the statement line is posted on the corresponding general ledger account.  

-**Customer or vendor**: If the account type is customer or vendor, a matching customer or vendor ledger entry is found based on the following criteria:

  - If a ledger entry is found using the standard format, the ledger entry is matched to the statement line, and the application status is set to **Applied**. If the ledger entry doesn't use the standard format, the bank account number of the customer or vendor is used to find the customer or vendor.
  - If no ledger entry with a matching remaining amount is found, the customer or vendor account is used, and the application status is set to **Partly Applied**.
  - If the bank account number is used to find the customer or vendor, a matching ledger entry is found based on the amount of the statement line. If the amount is found, the statement line is matched to the corresponding ledger entry, and the application status is set to **Applied**.  
  - If the bank account number can't be used to find the customer or vendor, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] either stops processing the current line or uses the line as a default posting, before continuing with the next statement line.  

You can run the process as many times as you like. Only statement lines with a blank application status are applied.  

When you have applied all statement lines to a general ledger account or to a matching customer ledger entry or vendor ledger entry, you're ready to post the CODA statement lines. Learn more in [Automatically Transfer and Post CODA Statements](how-to-manually-transfer-and-post-coda-statements.md).  

## Extending the CODA integration

The current support for CODA bank statements can be used in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] online and on-premises. However, partners can't extend the capabilities in an app for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] online. The code isn't deprecated but can only be extended or customized for on-premises deployments.

# Make journal templates mandatory in the Belgian version

You can use journals to post purchase and sales documents and make other general ledger entries. Journal templates can then help you structure different types of entries. In the Belgian version of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], you must specify if journal templates are required in the current company.  

## Make journal templates required in a company

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Ledger Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
1. On the **General** FastTab, select the **Journal Template Name Mandatory** field. This field specifies if users must specify a journal template when they post general ledger transactions.  

> [!NOTE]  
> If the **Journal Template Name Mandatory** field isn't selected, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't use template names in the posted documents and entries.

## Use journal templates in sales and purchase documents

If your organization decides to switch on the **Journal Template Name Mandatory** field, you must configure which journal templates must be used as default in sales and purchase documents.

> [!TIP]  
> Before you post a transaction, you can change the suggested template name in the **Journal Template Name** field. This way, the transactions are assigned another document number, as defined by the template.

### Use journal templates in sales documents

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales & Receivables Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
1. On the **Journal Templates** FastTab, choose the journal templates you want to use as default for all sales documents.  

### Use journal templates in purchase documents

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchases & Payables Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
1. On the **Journal Templates** FastTab, choose the journal templates you want to use as default for all purchase documents.

# SEPA payments in the Belgian version

The Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) unifies payment methods in participating European countries/regions. This makes international payments as easy to process as domestic payments. Regardless of location, European citizens and companies can make and receive payments in euros, whether within or across national/regional borders, with the same basic conditions, rights, and obligations.

# Belgian electronic banking

In the Belgian version of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], you can exchange data with Belgian financial institutions  electronically. This speeds up processing time and helps avoid errors caused by manual data entry or processing.  

You can use electronic banking to perform the following functions:  

- Send electronic payments.  
- Process bank statements with CODA.  
- Process direct debits with domiciliation.  

## Setup

Before you can process electronic payments and statements, you must set up electronic banking in the **Electronic Banking Setup** page as described in the following table.

|Field|Description |
|-----|------------|
|**Summarize Gen. Jnl. Lines**| Select to indicate if you want to group the payment journal lines for each vendor. Payments with a structured message aren't grouped. |
|**Cut off Payment Message Texts** |Select to indicate if you want to truncate long payment messages. Messages are truncated if greater than 106 characters for domestic payments and less than 140 characters for international payments. |

Learn more in [Summarizing Payment Lines and General Journal Lines](summarizing-payment-lines-and-general-journal-lines.md), which explains how the two fields affect the transfer of payment journal lines to the general journal.

# Belgian VAT

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] includes Belgian extensions to the VAT reporting capabilities so that you can print VAT transaction details. You must send the following reports to the Belgian tax authorities:  

- **Monthly/Quarterly declaration**: Use this report to create monthly or quarterly VAT declarations, depending on your company revenue.  

- **VAT annual listing (on paper/disk)**: Use this report to annually report all amounts invoiced for both goods and services to all Belgian companies with a registered VAT number.  

- **EC sales list**: Use this report to report the sales of goods to other countries/regions in the European Union. Learn more in [About the EC Sales List Report](../../finance-how-report-vat.md#ecsaleslist).  

You're also required to provide a printed statement detailing the VAT transactions to the Belgian tax authorities.

## Nondeductible VAT

In Belgium, VAT can be fully or partially deductible. Expenses such as representation cost or purchases of cars are only partially deductible, and the transaction must specify how much of the VAT is nondeductible. For example, you create a general ledger account for fixed assets such as cars, and another account for representation cost. For each account, you specify how much of the reported VAT is nondeductible by setting the **Percentage Non deductible VAT** field. Then, when you post a transaction, the deductible VAT posts to the corresponding VAT account. The nondeductible VAT is added to the base amount and posted to the same account as a tangible or intangible asset.  

For fixed assets, the nondeductible VAT depreciates just like the base acquisition cost of the fixed asset. You must set up separate fixed asset posting groups for each percentage of nondeductible VAT. You must do so because each fixed asset posting group posts to a general ledger account where the **Percentage Non deductible VAT** field specifies how much VAT must post to the same account as the fixed asset.  

If you select the **Incl. Non Deductible VAT** field in a VAT statement line, nondeductible VAT is included in the VAT amount. The **Calc. and Post VAT Settlement** report adds the nondeductible part of that amount to the **Non Ded. VAT Amount** and **Non Ded. Source Curr. VAT Amt.** fields in the resulting VAT entries.  

## Multiple VAT numbers for customers

The feature for using multiple VAT registration numbers for customers, including adding different **VAT Registration Numbers**, **VAT Business Posting Groups**, and **General Business Posting Groups** for addresses in another country, are available in the Belgian localization. Learn more in [Multiple VAT registration numbers](../../finance-how-use-multiple-vat-registrations.md).

In addition to different **VAT Registration Numbers**, **VAT Business Posting Groups**, and **General Business Posting Groups**, businesses using the Belgian localization also need to work with the **Enterprise No.**. When you open the **Alternative Customer VAT Registration** page, you can add the **Enterprise No.** for the customer if their address is in another country. After you enter this information, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] does the following things when you're working with sales documents:  

- If the customer is from Belgium and the ship-to address is in Belgium, the **Enterprise No.** comes from the **Customer** card.
- If the customer is from Belgium and the ship-to address isn't in Belgium, the **Enterprise No.** is removed.
- If the customer isn't from Belgium and the ship-to address is in Belgium, the **Enterprise No.** comes from the **Alternative Customer VAT Registration** page.
- If the customer isn't from Belgium and the ship-to address isn't in Belgium, the **Enterprise No.** isn't available.  

> [!NOTE]
> If there's a change in the **Enterprise No.** in a sales document, it displays on the **Confirm Alternative Customer VAT Registration** dialog.

# Manually transfer and post CODA statements in the Belgian version

After you applied and processed all CODA statement lines, you can manually transfer the CODA statement lines to a financial journal. The financial journal lets you enter a starting balance and an ending balance and automatically calculate the difference between the two balances. Posting isn't allowed if the statement line amounts don't balance with the statement ending balance. Learn more in [Automatically Transfer and Post CODA Statements](how-to-automatically-transfer-and-post-coda-statements.md).

## Manually transfer and post statement lines  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Journal**, and then choose the related link.  
1. Select the journal, and then choose the **OK** button.  
1. Enter the **Statement Ending Balance** field.  
1. Manually enter each line of the statement.  
1. Choose the **Post** action.

# Summarizing payment lines and general journal lines in the Belgian version

Business Central summarizes payment lines and journal line across the following types of payments:  

- Domestic payments  
- International payments  
- SEPA payments  
- Non-Euro SEPA payments  

## How payment journal lines are transferred to the general journal

When you export the payment journal lines to a file, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] transfers the payment journal lines to the specified general journal. By default, a general journal line is created for each payment journal line.  

The following two fields on the **Electronic Banking Setup** page affect how the payment lines are summarized:  

- **Summarize Gen. Jnl. Lines**  
- **Cut off Payment Message Texts**  

If you select the **Summarize Gen. Jnl. Lines** checkbox on the **Electronic Banking Setup** page, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] summarizes all payment journal lines for a specific vendor into one general journal line. The general description "Payment %1," where %1 is the vendor number, is used for the summarized journal line description. A separate payment line and a separate general journal line are created to handle:  

- Payment journal lines that contain partial payments, with both the **Partial Payment** and the **Separate Line** fields selected.  
- Payment journal lines that contain a standard format message (passes the MOD97 test), which sets **Standard Format Message** to True in the electronic banking journal.

## Example 1

In this example, you export payment lines, and the **Summarize Gen. Jnl. Lines** checkbox is selected. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] creates:  

- One combined payment line in an XML file that has a concatenated payment message. White space is the delimiter.  
- One payment line in the general journal with a generic description that includes the vendor name.  

## Example 2

In this example, you export payment lines, and the **Summarize Gen. Jnl. Lines** checkbox is selected. The **Cut off Payment Message Texts** checkbox is cleared, and the combined SEPA and non-Euro SEPA payment lines exceed 140 characters in the payment message. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] creates:  

- Two combined payment lines in an XML file. The first payment line contains the first concatenated payment messages. The second payment line contains the payment message from the third line.  
- One payment line in the general journal with a generic description that includes the vendor name.  

## Example 3

In this example, you export payment lines, and the **Summarize Gen. Jnl. Lines** checkbox is selected. The **Cut off Payment Message Texts** checkbox is also selected, and the combined SEPA and non-SEPA payment lines exceed 140 characters in the payment message. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] creates:  

- One combined payment line in an XML file that has two concatenated payment messages. An ellipsis (…) is used to indicate that the message is truncated.  
- One payment line in the general journal with a generic description that includes the vendor name.  

Based on the XML structure, the payments are summarized per account number, beneficiary bank account number, and bank account number. The bank account filter can be empty.  

The EndToEndId in the SEPA message is taken from the payment message and can be truncated to the maximum length of 45 characters.

# Set up export protocols in the Belgian version

Before you can use electronic banking, you must set up export protocols. Export protocols define the file format that is generated when you export payment history to be processed by the bank. Each line contains an export protocol identified by a code and a description. You can set up as many export protocols as necessary. You must set up an export protocol for domestic payments, international payments, SEPA payments, and non-Euro SEPA payments.  

 With export protocols, you can assign the codeunit that defines the check that should be performed before exporting the payment lines to a file and the report that defines the payment format. For example, you might have an export protocol named **DOM1**. This export protocol contains the **Check Domestic Payments** check codeunit and the **File Domestic Payments** report. Each export protocol has both a check codeunit and a matching report, as shown in the following table.  

|**Check Object ID**|**Export Object ID**|  
|-------------------------|--------------------------|  
|2000002 Check Domestic Payments|Report 2000001 File Domestic Payments|  
|2000003 Check International Payments|Report 2000002 File International Payments|  
|2000004 Check SEPA Payments|Report 2000005 File SEPA Payments|  
|2000005 Check Non-Euro SEPA Payments|Report 2000006 File Non-Euro SEPA Payments|  
|2000007 Check SEPA 001.001.09 Payments|Report 2000008 File FCY SEPA 001.001.09 Payments|
|If you don't want this option, set it to zero; otherwise, select another option.|XMLport 1000 (SEPA pain.001.001.03 Payments)|  

 After you set up export protocols, you can use them in your electronic banking payment journals.  

## Setup process

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Export Protocols**, and then choose the related link.  
1. Choose the **New** action.  
1. On the **Export Protocols**  page, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

   |Field|Description|  
   |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
   |**Code**|Specify a code that uniquely identifies the export protocol.|  
   |**Description**|Specify a description for the export protocol entry. You can enter a maximum of 50 characters, both numbers and letters.|  
   |**Code Expenses**|Specify the code that describes the type of expenses associated with the export protocol entry. Code expenses include **blank**, **SHA**, **BEN**, and **OUR**. For international payments, **SHA** is the default.|  
   |**Check Object ID**|Specify the identification number of the codeunit that you want to use to perform a check on the object before the payment file is exported.|  
   |**Check Object Name**|Specify the name of a verification process that is used to perform a check on the object before the payment file is exported. After you select the **Check Object ID**, this field will display the **Check Object Name**.|  
   |**Export Object Type**|Specify the type of the object that defines the export format of the payment file export. After you select the **Export Object ID**, this field displays the **Export Object Type**.<br><br/> **NOTE:** To set up the export protocol for SEPA pain.001.001.03, select **XMLPort**.|  
   |**Export Object ID**|Specify the identification number of the object that defines the export format of the payment file export. For example, if you select **2000002**, the export format for the payment file is **File International Payments**.<br><br/> **NOTE:** To set up the export protocol for SEPA pain.001.001.03, select XMLport **1000**.|  
   |**Export No. Series**|Specify the number series that is used to assign identification numbers to the payment file export.|  
   |**Grouped Payment**|Specifies if this export protocol is used for grouped payments.|  

1. Choose the **OK** button.

# Direct debit using domiciliation

A domiciliation is a financial agreement between you and your customers, allowing you to automatically collect the payments for customer's invoices through a preferred bank account. Domiciliation can only be processed for domestic customers with domestic bank accounts. Domiciliation in foreign currencies or involving foreign banks aren't supported.  

Direct debit domiciliation is useful for companies with many customers or subscribers, such as a utility company or a publishing company.  

Before you can start using electronic banking for domiciliation, you must enter certain basic information.  

- **Domiciliation number** - This is a unique code obtained from the bank which identifies the domiciliation agreement between you, your customer, and the bank. The contract contains details regarding payment frequency, bank account numbers, and amounts. When you send your payments to the bank, the bank uses the domiciliation number to identify all parties involved.  

- **Preferred bank account** - The preferred bank account is suggested as a default bank account on all domiciliation suggestions for that customer. If necessary, you can change the bank account before posting the domiciliation suggestions. Learn more in [Generate Domiciliation Suggestions](/dynamics365/business-central/LocalFunctionality/Belgium/direct-debit-using-domiciliation).  

## Set up domiciliation

Before you can use electronic banking for domiciliation, you must enter the customer's domiciliation number and preferred bank account.  

> [!NOTE]  
> You should use one bank account per customer for all domiciliation.  

### Set up process

1. In the **Batch Name** field, select the required journal batch, and then choose the **Suggest Domiciliations** action.  
1. Fill in the fields as displayed in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Due Date**|Enter the due date to be included in the batch job. Only entries that have a due date before or on this date is included.|  
    |**Take Payment Discounts**|Select if you want the batch job to include customer ledger entries for which you can receive a payment discount.|  
    |**Payment Discount Date**|Enter the date that is used to calculate the payment discount.|  
    |**Select Possible Refunds**|Select if you want the batch job to include refunds.|  
    |**Posting Date**|Enter the date that appears as the posting date on the lines that the batch job inserts in the domiciliation journal.|  

1. Enter any additional filter criteria.

> [!NOTE]  
> The domiciliation suggestions include only customers who have a Domiciliation number set up. Learn more in the [Set up domiciliation](#set-up-domiciliation) section.  

## Edit and delete domiciliation lines

After generating domiciliation suggestions, you might want to change the domiciliation lines. For example, you might want to reassign a bank account or prevent payment for a specific customer or customer ledger entry.  

After modifying the journal lines, print the **Domiciliation Journal - Test** report to test all journal lines.  

The **Suggest Domiciliations** batch job creates domiciliation suggestions for all customers matching the specified criteria.  

### Edit a journal line

# Limit the posting period in the Belgian version

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], you can limit the period by which posting is permitted on three different levels: **by company**, **by user**, and **by template**.  

Limiting posting periods can be useful when a company closes its sales journal at the end of each month. This keeps salespeople from registering sales documents from the previous month. At the same time, the purchase journal may stay open to register incoming purchase invoices from the previous month.  

When you post on the **General Journal Templates** page, the contents of the **Allow Posting From** field and **Allow Posting To** field are checked for a date interval. The date interval indicates when you can post to a journal template. If the field is blank, the **User Setup** page is checked for a date interval for the current user. If the **User Setup** page doesn't contain an interval, the **Allow Posting From** field and the **Allow Posting To** field on the **General Ledger Setup** page is checked for a date interval at the company level.  

## Limit posting periods by company  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Ledger Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
1. To specify the start of the period, choose the **Allow Posting From** field, and then enter the earliest date on which posting to the company is enabled.  
1. To specify the end of the period, choose the **Allow Posting To** field, and then enter the last date on which posting to the company is enabled.  

## Limit posting periods by user  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **User Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
1. To specify the start of the period, choose the **Allow Posting From** field, and then enter the earliest date on which the user can post to the company.  
1. To specify the end of the period, choose the **Allow Posting To** field, and then enter the last date the user will be able to post to the company.  

## Limit posting periods by template  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Journal Templates**, and then choose the related link.  
1. To specify the start of the period, choose the **Allow Posting From** field, and then enter the earliest date on which the user can post to the company.  
1. To specify the end of the period, choose the **Allow Posting To** field, and then enter the last date the user will be able to post to the company.

# Test electronic payments in the Belgian version

After you set up electronic banking and generated payment suggestions, you can test the payment journal lines for errors before posting them.  

Some of the information that is validated includes:  

- Whether bank account numbers are valid.  
- Whether positive payment lines are present.  
- Whether domestic and international payments are made from only one bank account.  
- Whether only one bank account can be used for Interbanks Standards Association Belgium (Isabel).  
- Whether payment lines are in euro for Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA).  
- Whether a number series is defined for SEPA.  

You can view any errors on the **Export Check Error Logs** page.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> You have to correct all errors before you can post the lines.  

## Test payment journal lines  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Payment Journals**, and then choose the link to open the **EB Payment Journals** page.  
1. In the **Batch Name** field, select the required journal batch.  
1. In the **Export Protocol** field, select the export protocol.  
1. Enter the payment journal line information, and then choose the **Check Payment Lines** action to validate the payment journal lines. The validation that is performed on the journal lines depends on the type of check that is specified on the **Export Protocols** page.

# Apply CODA statements in the Belgian version

After a CODA statement is imported, the statement lines can be accessed from the **Bank Account Card** page. The application status on each line is blank because the statement amounts haven't been applied to outstanding ledger entries.  

Statement amounts can be applied to outstanding ledger entries by:  

- Manually applying CODA statement lines.  
- Automatically applying CODA statement amounts to the appropriate ledger entries and accounts. Automatic processing of CODA statement lines is recommended.  

## Manually apply the CODA statement lines  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Bank Accounts**, and then choose the related link.  
1. Select the bank account, and then choose the **CODA Statements** action.

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Account No.**|Enter the number of the general ledger account, bank, customer, vendor, or fixed asset that the bank account statement line is linked to.|  
    |**Description**|[!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] automatically retrieves the description from the imported CODA file, but you can modify the contents of this field.|  

1. Choose the **OK** button.  

## Automatically apply the CODA statement lines  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Bank Accounts**, and then choose the related link.  
1. Select the bank account, and then choose the **CODA Statements** action.  
1. Select the CODA statement, and then choose the **Edit** action.  
1. Choose the **Process CODA Statement Lines** action.  
1. Fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

   |Field|Description|  
   |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
   |**Default Posting**|Select if you want the batch job to post statement amounts that can't be linked to existing ledger entries.|  
   |**Print List**|Select to print a list of statement amounts that can't be linked automatically.|  

1. Choose the **OK** button.

# Enterprise numbers and branch numbers in the Belgian version

Companies receive a unique enterprise number and one or more branch numbers from the Belgian [Crossroads Bank for Enterprises](https://crossroadsbankenterprises.com/). These numbers are used in all correspondence to simplify communication with the Belgian administrative and legal authorities.  

## Enterprise numbers

The enterprise number replaces the existing VAT number. For existing companies with a VAT registration number, the enterprise number is set as the VAT registration number preceded by a leading zero. New companies receive a new enterprise number.  

The enterprise number is printed on the following documents:  

- Outgoing sales and purchase documents  
- Financial statements  
- Reminders and finance charge memos  
- Intrastat forms and files  

The enterprise number is set up in the following locations:  

- Company Information table  
- Contact card  
- Customer table  
- Vendor table  

## Branch numbers

A branch number is given to a company to identify an address where at least one of the company’s activities is exercised, for example, a workshop, office, warehouse, agency, or subsidiary. Unlike the enterprise number, there's no legal requirement to print the branch number.  

All branches of a company receive a unique number that is different from the enterprise number. The branch number is transferable to another company, such as after a merger or takeover.  

The branch number is set up in the following locations:  

- Company Information table  
- Location table

# Automatically transfer and post CODA statements in the Belgian version

After you apply and processed all CODA statement lines, you can transfer the CODA statement lines to a financial journal.  

After transferring the statement lines, you can post the lines in a corresponding general journal. If no such general journal exists, you can't transfer the lines. You can create a journal to handle CODA statements. Learn more in [Create Financial Journals](how-to-create-financial-journals.md).  

Alternatively, you can manually transfer and post CODA statements. Learn more in [Manually Transfer and Post CODA Statements](how-to-manually-transfer-and-post-coda-statements.md).  

## Automatically transfer statement lines  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Bank Accounts**, and then choose the related link.  
1. Select the bank account, and then choose the **CODA Statements** action.  
1. Select the CODA statement, and then choose the **Edit** action.  
1. Choose the **Transfer to General Ledger** action.  
1. Choose the **Yes** button.  

The batch job now transfers the CODA statement lines to the financial journal.  

After transferring the statement lines to the journal, you can post the statement lines in the corresponding financial journal.

# Print periodic VAT reports in the Belgian version

The VAT reporting feature enables you to print VAT transaction details. You must send the following VAT reports to the Belgian tax authorities:  

- Monthly/Quarterly declaration  
- VAT annual listing (on paper/disk)  
- VAT-VIES listing (on paper/disk)  

## Print the monthly/quarterly declaration  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Form/Intervat Declaration**, and then choose the related link.  
1. On the **VAT – Form** page, fill in the fields.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Wrong Enterprise No.**|Specifies if you want to print the report that has erroneous enterprise numbers.|  
    |**VAT Annual Listing**|Specifies if you want to print the **VAT Annual Listing** report.|  
    |**Year**|Enter the year of the period for which you want to print the report. You should enter the year as a four-digit code. For example, to print a declaration for 2013, you should enter "2013" (instead of "13").|  
    |**Minimum Amount**|Enter the customer's minimum year balance to be included in the report. If the yearly balance of the customer is less than the minimum amount, the customer isn't included in the declaration.|  
    |**Include Customers From**|Select to include customers from all countries/regions or from a specific country/region in the report.|  
    |**Country/Region**|Select the country/region to include in the report.|  

1. Choose the **Print** button to print the report, or choose the **Preview** button to view it on the screen. Choose the **Cancel** button to save the information without printing the report.  

## Print the VAT annual listing on disk  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Annual Listing – Disk**, and then enter the related link.  
1. On the **VAT Annual Listing – Disk** page, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Year**|Enter the year of the VAT declaration. You should enter the year as a four-digit code. For example, to print a declaration for 2013, you should enter "2013" (instead of "13").|  
    |**Minimum**|Enter the customer's minimum year balance to be included in the report.<br><br> If the yearly balance of the customer is less than the minimum amount, the customer isn't included in the declaration.|  
    |**Test Declaration**|Specifies if you want to create a test declaration.<br><br/> If selected, an attribute test is written to the file that uses value 1, which indicates that this is a test file. If you want to test the XML file before sending it, you can upload this file to the Intervat site.

# Make manual corrections to VAT in the Belgian version

You can make corrections to posted VAT entries without posting the correction into the VAT or general ledger entries. This is useful if you need to make a change to the total sales or purchases VAT amounts without changing the VAT base. For example, you can manually correct VAT if you receive an invoice from a vendor who has calculated VAT incorrectly.  

## Make manual corrections to VAT  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Statement Preview**, and then choose the related link.  
1. Select the line that needs to be corrected. You can make the VAT correction on both the **Row Totaling** and **VAT Entry Totaling** row **Type**.  
1. To make the correction, choose the **Correction Amount** field. The **Manual VAT Correction List** page opens.  
1. Choose the **Edit List** action. On the **Manual VAT Correction List** page, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Posting Date**|Enter the posting date of the VAT correction.|  
    |**Amount**|Enter the amount of the VAT correction. You must enter the correction amount, not the new amount. For example, if the amount is 1,000.00 and should be 1,200.00, enter 200.00.|  
    |**Additional-Currency Amount**|This field displays the amount of the VAT correction in the additional reporting currency.<br><br/> The field is automatically calculated, based on the contents of the **Amount** field and the current exchange rate.|  

1. Choose the **OK** button.  
1. Refresh the **VAT Statement Preview** page to see your corrections.  
1. To view a report related to the preview of the VAT information, choose one of the following actions:  

    |Action|Description|  
    |------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Detailed Report**|Opens the **VAT Statement** report. Learn more in VAT Statement.|  
    |**Form/Intervat Declaration**|Opens the **VAT – Form** report.<br><br/> The **Form/Intervat Declaration** report is based on the VAT Statement template that is defined in the general ledger setup. Therefore, it might export data that isn't the same as what is shown on the **VAT Statement Preview** page.|  
    |**Declaration Summary Report**|Opens the **VAT Statement Summary** report.|

# Required descriptions in G-L entry

When entering general journal lines on a form, the system automatically fills in the description field. This description is also stored in the G/L entry after posting the journal. For a good audit trail, a more detailed description is desirable, when you post a journal line of type G/L Account.  

To force the user to enter a more detailed description, it's possible to choose if the system must fill in automatically the description of the G/L account or leave the field blank. If the **Omit Default Descr. in Jnl. Field** checkbox on the **G/L Account Card** page is checked, the system doesn't fill in the **Description** field for that G/L account when selected in a general journal line.  

When posting the journal lines, the system checks if all the **Description** fields are filled in. If there's a blank description, an error message appears.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Leaving the description field blank and checking if all the description fields are filled in before posting will only be done on the general journal pages in several application areas and on the local Cash Bank Giro pages.

# Payment scenario 1 - Domestic payments (LCY to LCY) in the Dutch version

You can use telebanking for trade with domestic and foreign customers and vendors. This article describes a scenario where the trade is with domestic customers and vendors.  

The following list describes the main steps:  

1. Create Vendor/Customer.  
1. Create Vendor/Customer Bank Account.  
1. Create and Post Purchase Invoice for Vendor or Sales Invoice for Customer.  
1. Create Proposal.  
1. Create Payment History.  
1. Export Payment History.  
1. Import Bank Statement.  

> [!NOTE]  
> In the following examples, some standard CRONUS data is being used. Likewise, instead of creating a vendor/customer and a vendor/customer bank account, you can use existing data.  

## Create vendor/customer

Create vendor/customer and enter all necessary information. Special attention should be paid to the following fields:  

- **Currency Code**: Leave empty - that is, it's set to the local currency (LCY).  
- **Transaction Mode**: Select an appropriate, default transaction mode - that is, one that can deal with local currency payments for your bank.  
- **Preferred Bank Account**: Select an appropriate, default vendor/customer bank account having the same Currency Code as the vendor/customer itself.  

> [!NOTE]  
> To enter a bank account in the **Bank Account** vendor/customer bank accounts must be available. See below.  

### Example

Olek Johansson (code **OLEK**) is one of our local vendors. Purchase invoices are paid through our national bank account (code **ABN**) to their bank account (code **OJBA**). Both bank account ABN and OJBA are denominated in local currency (LCY). Therefore, on Olek Johansson's vendor card, we leave the **Currency Code** field empty, fill the **Transaction Mode** field with **ABN** that is linked to our bank account, ABN, and set the **Bank Account** field to **OJBA**.  

## Create vendor/customer bank account

Create vendor/customer bank account and enter all necessary information. Special attention should be paid to the following fields:  

- **Preferred Bank Account**: Enter a valid bank account number.  
- **Currency Code**: Leave empty - that is, it's set to the local currency (LCY).  
- **Owner Information**: Be sure all owner information is entered.  

### Example

Olek Johansson's bank account (code **OJBA**) is denominated in local currency (LCY). Therefore, on Olek Johansson's vendor bank account card, we enter a valid number in the **Bank Account No.** field, leave the **Currency Code** field empty, and fill the fields on the **Owner Information** FastTab with appropriate values.  

## Create and post purchase invoice for vendor or sales invoice for customer

Create a purchase/sales invoice and enter all necessary information. Special attention should be paid to the following fields:  

- **Currency Code**: Leave empty - that is, it's set to the local currency (LCY).  
- **Transaction Mode**: Select an appropriate, default transaction mode - that is, one that can deal with local currency payments for your bank.  
- **Preferred Bank Account**: Select an appropriate, default vendor/customer bank account having the same Currency Code is the vendor/customer itself.  

By default these three fields are populated with values taken from the vendor/customer card.  

When the invoice is finished, it can be posted.  

### Example

When creating a purchase invoice for Olek Johansson, we enter **OLEK** in the **Buy-from Vendor No.** field. By default the **Currency Code**, **Transaction Mode** and **Bank Account** fields are populated with values taken from the Olek Johansson's vendor card. Therefore, the **Currency Code**, **Transaction Mode**, and **Bank Account** fields are **\<empty\>**, **ABN**, and **OJBA** respectively. Nevertheless, these values can be changed.  

## Create proposal

Open the **Telebank - Bank Overview** page and browse to the bank through which we want to perform our payment. Open the **Proposal** page and generate payment proposals using the **Get Proposal Entries** batch job.  

### Example

Through the **Telebank - Bank Overview** page, we open the **Proposal** page for our bank, ABN. Using the batch job, one proposal line is created for the purchase invoice we just created and posted for vendor OLEK.  

## Create payment history

From the **Proposal** page, we process our proposal into a payment history. The proposal disappears and can be found on the **Payment History Overview** page for the same bank.  

### Example

We process our proposal concerning the payment to vendor OLEK and open the **Payment History Overview** page for our bank, ABN. The last payment history is the one we created.  

## Export payment history

Open the **Payment History Overview** page, browse to the relevant payment history, and choose the **Export** action. The export batch job appears for the export protocol that is linked to this payment. For this export, the system already enters appropriate filters. Check, if wanted, any of the fields on the **Options** FastTab, and then choose the **OK** action to export the payment. The system generates a text file using a filename as defined in the **Default File Names Field** field of the export protocol, which now is ready to be sent to our bank.  

## Import bank statement

After receiving electronic bank statements from our bank, we can import them by running the appropriate import protocol from the **Import Protocol List** page.  

### Example

The bank statement containing our payment to Olek Johansson is sent to us by our bank, ABN. Therefore, we should choose **OFFICE NET EXTRA** as the appropriate import protocol.

# Create an audit file for the tax authority in the Dutch version

During an examination of the books for a fiscal year, a tax inspector can ask for data about the basis transactions from the general ledger for that fiscal year. Basis transactions usually are processed via journal entries. That is the reason why the journal entries are the basis for the audit file.  

The tax authority stimulates companies to use the audit file but it isn't prescribed.  

The audit file can also be used to exchange data between companies. You can select every period you want, but the start and end date of the entered period must be in the same fiscal year.  

## Create an audit file  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Tax Authority - Audit File**, and then choose the related link.  
1. On the **Options** FastTab, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Start Date**|Specify the start date of the period on which the data must be based.|  
    |**End Date**|Specify the end date of the period on which the data must be based.|  
    |**Exclude Begin Balance**|Specifies if the audit file must contain the begin balance of general ledger accounts.<br><br/> The field is editable if the start date of the period is equal to the start date of a fiscal year.|  

1. Choose the **OK** button to create the audit file. If you don't want to create the audit file, choose the **Cancel** button to close the page.  

When you run the report, you must specify the name and location of the exported file. The default file name is **audit.xaf**, but you can change that. The file extension must be *.xaf*.

# CMR notes in the Dutch version

A CMR note is a bill of lading or an international consignment note defined under the 1956 United Nations Convention for the Contract of the International Carriage of Goods by Road. This is also known as the CMR Convention.  

Claims with complete CMR note information are easily processed.  

## CMR notes

Countries/Regions that follow the CMR Convention adhere to a standard form for CMR notes. The type of CMR notes used depends on the type of transaction. There are three types:  

- **CMR - Sales Shipment** – This report is used to print CMR documents for sales shipments. For each CMR document, the report shows address data for the sender, shipping agent, and consignee, along with data about the shipped items.

- **CMR - Purchase Return Shipment** – This report is used to print CMR documents for purchase return shipments. For each CMR document, the report shows address data for the sender, shipping agent, and consignee, along with data about the shipped items.

- **CMR - Transfer Shipment** – This report is used to print CMR documents for transfer shipments. For each CMR document, the report shows address data for the location from which the items are shipped, the location to which the items are shipped, and information regarding the shipping agent, along with data about the shipped items.

> [!NOTE]  
> CMR notes are formatted to print on preprinted CMR forms.  

The following details the standard life cycle of a CMR note:  

- The warehouse manager prints the CMR notes for the shipments that need to be sent.  
- The shipments are then packed and handed to the truck driver, along with the CMR notes.  
- The driver ensures that each shipment has a CMR note.  
- When goods are delivered to the customers, the driver ensures that the customers sign the CMR notes.  
- The signed CMR notes are then given to the respective internal Accounts Receivable departments.  
- The Accounts Payable administrators receive the signed CMR notes, along with the invoice for freight forwarding services from the freight forwarder.

# Set up VAT categories

To use the electronic VAT declaration, you must set up a VAT category code for all XML elements in the electronic VAT declaration.  

You must set up all of the possible category and subcategory combinations that represent an XML element in the electronic VAT declaration. Then, you can map the VAT statement data directly to an XML element.  

## Set up a VAT category  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Elec. Tax. Decl. VAT Categories**, and then choose the related link.  
1. On the **Elec. Tax. Decl. VAT Categories** page, choose the **New** action.  
1. Fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Code**|The unique code for each category and subcategory combination. You can enter a maximum of 10 alphanumeric characters.|  
    |**Category**|Specify the main category option for the VAT statement.|  
    |**By Us (Domestic)**|The subcategory for the VAT Statement.<br><br/> Select a subcategory here if the **Category** field displays **By Us (Domestic)**.|  
    |**To Us (Domestic)**|The subcategory for the VAT Statement.<br><br/> Select a subcategory here if the **Category** field displays **To Us (Domestic)**.|  
    |**By Us (Foreign)**|The subcategory for the VAT Statement.<br><br/> Select a subcategory here if the **Category** field displays **By Us (Foreign)**.|  
    |**To Us (Foreign)**|The subcategory for the VAT Statement.<br><br/> Select a subcategory here if the **Category** field displays **To Us (Foreign)**.|  
    |**Calculation**|The subcategory for the VAT Statement.<br><br/> Select a subcategory here if the **Category** field displays **Calculation**.|  
    |**Optional**|Select to indicate that the XML element that is represented by the category code isn't required in the electronic VAT declaration.|  

1. Choose the **OK** button.  

You can now map the VAT statement data directly to an XML element.

# Telebanking

Based on both sales and purchase transactions, telebanking enables you to generate your payments and collections and interchange them with your bank electronically. This includes the export of payment and collection data that need to be forwarded to the bank and the import of bank statements sent to you by the bank.  

## Transactions

In general, all financial interactions with vendors and customers are done through either purchase or sales invoices and credit memos. As soon as these transactions are registered and posted, payments, or collections can be carried out by your company.  

## Proposals

Based on vendor and customer ledger entries, telebanking enables you to generate payment and collection proposals. This can be done for any bank that is set up for your company. Both domestic and foreign payments and collections are possible.  

You can set up [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] to combine payments to or collections from the same bank account automatically.  

When a proposal is agreed upon, it should be processed into a payment history.  

> [!NOTE]  
> In general, for any open vendor and customer ledger entries, a proposal can be generated if it meets a number of criteria. Learn more in [Create Proposals](how-to-create-proposals.md).  

## Payment histories

A payment history is nothing more than a proposal except for the fact that data on a payment history can't be modified. The payment or collection data is ready to be exported and forwarded to the bank. Learn more in [Create and Export Payment History](how-to-create-and-export-payment-history.md).  

## Bank statements

For all your financial interactions through your bank, the bank can send you electronic bank statements. These statements can be imported into the Bank/Giro Journals. If you want, you can have [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] automatically reconcile these statements during this import process and determine whether a statement can be applied to open ledger entries for the relevant vendor/customer. Learn more in [Import and Reconcile Bank Statements](how-to-import-and-reconcile-bank-statements.md).  

> [!NOTE]  
> The currency of the imported transactions must match the currency that is specified on the bank account in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)].  

## Exchange protocols

For both exporting and importing, a number of protocols are defined. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] supports the following protocols:  

- BTL91 (export). This cross-border protocol is no longer accepted in the Netherlands as of May 1, 2019. This protocol is replaced by the Generic Payment File protocol.
- BBV (export)  
- PAYMUL (export)  
- Generic Payment File (export). Can be used for cross-border Non-EUR transfers.
- Rabobank mut.asc (import)  
- Rabobank vvmut.asc (import)  
- Rabobank ASCII (import)  
- SEPA CAMT

# Setting up electronic VAT and ICP declarations in the Dutch version

To create electronic VAT and ICP declarations and communicate with tax authorities, set up general information about electronic tax declarations. Your company must be registered with the tax authorities before you can send electronic declarations.

When electronic declarations are set up, you can begin to declare VAT and ICP to the tax authorities. Learn more in [Submitting Electronic VAT and ICP Declarations](electronic-vat-and-icp-declarations.md).  

## Set up electronic declarations  

Ensure that you've uploaded the certificates needed to communicate with Digipoort. Use the **Certificates** page to upload a client and a service certificate. When they're added to the list of certificates, you can continue with setting up electronics declarations.

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Elec. Tax Declaration Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
1. On the **Elec. Tax Declaration Setup** page, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](../../includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
1. If you want the contact ID in the electronic declaration to be filled with the VAT registration number of the company, then select  **Tax Payer** in the **VAT Contact Type** field.
1. If you want to send electronic ICP declarations for a subsidiary company of a fiscal entity, select the **Part of Fiscal Entity** checkbox.  

   > [!NOTE]  
   > If a company has several companies registered as subsidiaries of a holding company, they have the option to submit the VAT declaration individually or combined for one fiscal entity. To set up electronic declarations for subsidiaries of a holding company, you must select the **Part of Fiscal Entity** field on the **Elec. Tax Declaration Setup** page. You can then create an electronic declaration for only one company.<br><br/>
   If you want to combine the tax information for all subsidiaries of a holding company, you must create a VAT statement on paper for each subsidiary company and manually calculate the total amounts for the holding company. These total amounts of the holding company must be entered on the website of the tax authorities.<br><br/>
   You can't combine tax information for ICP declarations. ICP declarations must always be submitted individually.<br><br/>
   For each subsidiary company, an electronic ICP declaration can be created and submitted to the tax authorities. These electronic ICP declarations must contain the VAT registration number of the subsidiary company and the value of the **Fiscal Entity No.** field on the **Company Information** page of the holding company.

1. On the **Digipoort** FastTab, set up the following configurations:
   - In the **Digipoort Delivery URL** field, specify the URL for the production version of the Digipoort Aanlever service. Learn more on [digipoort](https://www.logius.nl/producten/gegevensuitwisseling/digipoort).  
   - In the **Digipoort Status URL** field, specify the URL for the status information that is coming from the Digipoort Statusinformatie service. Learn more in [Electronic VAT and ICP Declarations](electronic-vat-and-icp-declarations.md).
   - Select **Use Certificate Setup** to specify that the certificate codes specified in the next step must be considered to transfer data to the information service.
   - In the **Client Certificate Code** field, specify the client certificate.
   - In the **Service Certificate Code** field, specify the service certificate.

1. To set up endpoints, add the endpoint URLs on the **Endpoints** FastTab.

   > [!NOTE]  
   > Endpoints set up is deployed to 21.1 tenants. However, all values are blank, but the Digipoort solution still works by taking hardcoded values if there are no values in the setup. In the 21.2 release, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] automatically runs an upgrade.

# Import post code updates in the Dutch version

Every month, a post code file is delivered with all post code mutations for that month. This post code file can be imported to update the relevant data of the **Post Code Range** table.  

## Import the update file  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Post Codes Updates**, and then choose the related link.  
1. On the **Post Codes Updates** page, choose the **Import Post Codes Update** action.  
1. Specify the path and name of the post code update file, and then choose the **OK** button. If you don't want to import the file, choose the **Cancel** button to close the page.  

If there's no file imported with a full set of post code data, then a message appears.  

Before you update the post codes, the following checks are performed:  

- Is there already an update file imported with a **Date Field** later than the date of this new update file? If so then the process stops.  

- Is there a gap between the date of this file and the value in the **Date Field** for the last imported file? If there's a gap, then a message appears. You can choose if you still want to import the update file.  

Information about the imported post code is saved in the **Post Code Update Log Entry Table**.

# Payment scenarios

Based on a sales or purchase invoice or credit memo, a proposal can be generated and exported in order to  process it by our bank.  

Using telebanking you can deal with three scenarios:  

1. The payment is done with a bank account denominated in your local currency (LCY), which is the same currency as linked to the invoice/credit memo. Learn more in [Payment Scenario 1 - Domestic Payments (LCY to LCY)](payment-scenario-1-domestic-payments-lcy-to-lcy-.md).  

1. The payment is done with a bank account denominated in the same currency as the currency linked to the invoice/credit memo. Both foreign. Learn more in [Payment Scenario 2 - Foreign Payment (FCY to FCY)](payment-scenario-2-foreign-payment-fcy-to-fcy-.md).  

1. The payment is done with a bank account denominated in your local currency (LCY), while the invoice/credit memo is linked to a foreign currency. Learn more in [Payment Scenario 3 - Foreign Payment (LCY  to FCY)](payment-scenario-3-foreign-payment-lcy-to-fcy-.md).

# Payment scenario 3 - Foreign payment (LCY  to FCY) in the Dutch version

You can use telebanking for trade with domestic and foreign customers and vendors. This article describes a scenario where the trade is with foreign customers and vendors that use a different currency than your local currency.  

1. Create Vendor/Customer.  
1. Create Vendor/Customer Bank Account.  
1. Create and Post Purchase Invoice for Vendor or Sales Invoice for Customer.  
1. Create Proposal.  
1. Create Payment History.  
1. Export Payment History.  
1. Import Bank Statement.  

> [!NOTE]  
> In the following examples, some standard CRONUS data is being used. Likewise, instead of creating a vendor/customer and a vendor/customer bank account you could use existing data.  

## Create vendor/customer

Create vendor/customer and enter all necessary information. Special attention should be paid to the following fields:  

- **Currency Code**: Set it to the foreign currency (FCY).  
- **Transaction Mode**: Select an appropriate, default transaction mode - that is, one that can deal with foreign currency payments for your local bank.  
- **Preferred Bank Account**: Select an appropriate, default vendor/customer bank account having the same Currency Code as the vendor/customer itself.  

> [!NOTE]  
> To enter a bank account in the **Bank Account**, vendor/customer bank accounts must be available. See below.  

### Example

Hernandez Ortiz (code **ORTIZ**) is one of our Mexican vendors. Purchase invoices are paid through our national bank account (code **ABN**) to their bank account (code **HOBA**). While our bank account ABN is denominated in local currency (LCY), Hernandez Ortiz's bank account HOBA is denominated in Mexican peso (MXN). Therefore, on Hernandez Ortiz's vendor card, we set the **Currency Code** field to **MXN**, fill the **Transaction Mode** field with **ABN** that is linked to our bank account, ABN, and set the **Bank Account** field to **HOBA**.  

## Create vendor/customer bank account

Create vendor/customer bank account and enter all necessary information. Special attention should be paid to the following fields:  

- **Preferred Bank Account**: Enter a valid bank account number.  
- **Currency Code**: Set it to the foreign currency (FCY).  
- **Owner Information**: Be sure all owner information is entered.  

### Example

Hernandez Ortiz's bank account (code **HOBA**) is denominated in **MXN**. Therefore, on Hernandez Ortiz's vendor bank account card, we enter a valid number in the **Bank Account No.** field, set the **Currency Code** field to **MXN**, and fill the fields on the **Owner Information** FastTab with appropriate values.  

## Create and post purchase invoice for vendor or sales invoice for customer

Create a purchase/sales invoice and enter all necessary information. Special attention should be paid to the following fields:  

- **Currency Code**: Set it to the foreign currency (FCY).  
- **Transaction Mode**: Select an appropriate, default transaction mode - that is, one that can deal with local currency payments for your local bank.  
- **Preferred Bank Account**: Select an appropriate, default vendor/customer bank account having the same Currency Code is the vendor/customer itself.  

By default these three fields are populated with values taken from the vendor/customer card.  

When the invoice is finished, it can be posted.  

### Example

When creating a purchase invoice for Hernandez Ortiz, we enter **ORTIZ** in the **Buy-from Vendor No.** field. By default, the **Currency Code**, **Transaction Mode**, and **Bank Account** fields are populated with values taken from the Hernandez Ortiz's vendor card. Therefore, the **Currency Code**, **Transaction Mode**, and **Bank Account** fields are **MXN**, **ABN**, and **HOBA** respectively. Nevertheless, these values can be changed.  

## Create proposal

Open the **Telebank - Bank Overview** page and browse to the bank through which we want to perform our payment. Open the **Proposal** page and generate payment proposals using the **Get Proposal Entries** batch job.  

### Example

Through the **Telebank - Bank Overview** page, we open the **Proposal** page for our bank, ABN. Using the batch job, one proposal line is created for the purchase invoice we just created and posted for the vendor ORTIZ. The amount of the payment is in local currency (LCY).  

## Create payment history

From the **Proposal** page, we process our proposal into a payment history. The proposal disappears and can be found on the **Payment History Overview** page for the same bank.  

### Example

We process our proposal concerning the payment to the vendor ORTIZ and open the **Payment History Overview** page for our bank, ABN. The last payment history is the one we just created.  

## Export payment history

Open the **Payment History Overview** page, browse to the relevant payment history, and then choose the **Export** action. The export batch job appears for the export protocol that is linked to this payment. For this export, the system already has entered appropriate filters. Check, if wanted, any of the fields on the **Options** FastTab, and choose the **OK** button to export the payment. The system generates a text file using a filename as defined in the **Default File Names Field** field of the export protocol, which now is ready to be sent to our bank.  

### Example

As the transaction mode associated with our payment is **ABN**, the **BBV** or **PAYMUL** batch job appears.  

## Import bank statement

After receiving electronic bank statements from our bank, we can import them by running the appropriate import protocol from the **Import Protocol List** page.  

### Example

The bank statement containing our payment to Hernandez Ortiz is sent to us by our bank, ABN. Therefore, we should choose **OFFICE NET EXTRA** as the appropriate import protocol.

# Edit document amounts in purchase invoices and credit memos in the Dutch version

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] lets you easily edit document amounts in purchase invoices and credit memos.  

## Edit document amounts  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Invoice** or **Purchase Credit Memo**, and then choose the related link.  
1. Edit the document amount in the **Doc. Amount Incl. VAT** field and the **Doc. Amount VAT** field.  

If you use the **Get Recurring Purchase Lines** action to insert lines based on a **Standard Purchase Code**, if the quantity in the first line is 0 or 1 and the unit cost is 0, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] compares the amount entered with the calculated total amount and applies the difference to the first line that was inserted.

# Docket reports in the Dutch version

The Dutch telebanking application allows you to combine ledger entries for the same customer or vendor, having the same transaction mode, into one payment or collection order to the bank. As such one total amount is paid to or collected from the vendor or customer involved. Possibly this combined payment could lack all detail information about the individual payments or collections. Telebanking offers you the possibility to inform your vendor or customer in detail by generating a docket report that describes the individual payments that constitute the total amount paid or collected.  

When generating payment proposals using the **Get Proposal Entries** batch job the system selects the **Docket** checkbox on the proposal in case that:  

- The resulting combined payment includes too many invoice numbers to list them in the available four description fields of the new proposal line: **Description 1** field, **Description 2** field, **Description 3** field, and **Description 4** field.  
- The payment isn't based upon an invoice.

# Submitting electronic VAT and ICP declarations in the Dutch version

Companies must submit periodic VAT and Intracommunautaire leveringen (ICP) declarations to the tax authorities.  

- VAT declarations must be submitted on a monthly or quarterly basis.
- ICP declarations must be submitted on a quarterly basis.

> [!NOTE]  
> ICP declarations must be submitted by companies/regions that sell goods or services to European Union (EU) countries. Purchases aren't included in this declaration. <br><br/>
For a transaction to qualify for ICP, it's required that the merchandise crossed the border physically. It isn't enough that the location of an invoice address or the office of the vendor or customer is in another EU country or region.  

You can submit the VAT declarations and ICP declarations in the following ways:  

- Sign in to the website of the Dutch tax office and enter the information manually. Learn more on the [website](https://www.belastingdienst.nl/wps/wcm/connect/en/individuals/individuals) of the Dutch tax office.  
- Create an electronic declaration and submit the encrypted file through the Digipoort channel to the Dutch tax office. Digipoort is the electronic post office provided by the Dutch government for companies. It provides the common infrastructure for the communication of information between companies and the government, including VAT declarations. The reports are in the eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) format. Learn more in [Create Reports with XBRL](../../bi-create-reports-with-xbrl.md).

## Prepare for electronic declaration

Before you can send electronic declarations to the tax authorities, you must perform the following tasks:

1. Ensure that you obtain the certificates from the government. If you haven't, take the following steps to obtain the certificates:

    - Obtain a PKIoverheid certificate for the company if you don't have one already. You can find a list of certificate providers on this [website](https://www.logius.nl/producten/toegang/pkioverheid/aansluiten/toegetreden-csps).  
    - You can register a user of Digipoort on this [website](https://aansluiten.procesinfrastructuur.nl/site/registratienieuw).
    - You can obtain a **Digipoort Service certificate**, on the [Dutch Tax Administration website](https://aansluiten.procesinfrastructuur.nl).

1. Enter general data and personal data received from the tax authorities on the **Elec. Tax Declaration Setup** page. Learn more in [Setting Up Electronic VAT and ICP Declarations](how-to-set-up-electronic-vat-and-icp-declarations.md).

1. Set up a VAT category code for all XML elements in the electronic VAT declaration. Learn more in [Set Up VAT Categories](how-to-set-up-vat-categories.md).

## Create an electronic declaration

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Elec. Tax Declarations**, and then choose the related link.  
1. On the **Elec. Tax Declaration List** page, choose the **New** action.  
1. On the **Elec. Tax Declaration Card** page, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](../../includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  
1. Choose the **OK** button.

The XML elements and the accompanying data of the electronic declaration are displayed on the **Lines** FastTab on the **Elec. Tax Declaration Card** page.

The XBRL reporter ensures that all account numbers that are imported from Business Central are mapped to the XBRL elements in a report. The XBRL reporter also displays a list of errors of unmapped elements or accounts.

## Submit an electronic declaration

With the XBRL reporter, you can submit the Intracommunautaire Leveringen (ICP) declaration or the VAT declaration in the required XML format. When it's submitted, the file is sent to the tax authorities as defined on the **Elec. Tax Declaration Setup** page.

1. On the **Elec. Tax Declaration Card** page, choose the **Submit Electronic Tax Declaration** action.
1. Fill in the fields as described in the following table.

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Client Certificate**|Select the **PKIoverheid** certificate for the company.|  
    |**Client Certificate Password**|Enter the password that encrypts the client certificate.|
    |**Service Certificate**|Select the **Digipoort Service** certificate.|

1. Choose the **OK** button.  

The electronic declaration is submitted to the tax authorities.

> [!NOTE]  
> If there are no intra-community deliveries in the declaration period, then an electronic ICP declaration is created without XML elements for the deliveries. If you submit such a declaration, an error message is displayed.

## Import a response message from the tax authorities

For each electronic declaration, the tax authorities send a response message. These messages must be received from the server of the tax authorities
and be processed. The first step is to import the response message into [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)].

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Elec. Tax Decl. Response Msgs.**, and then choose the related link.  
1. Choose the **Receive Response Messages** action.  
. On the **Options** FastTab, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Client Certificate**|Select the **PKIoverheid** certificate for the company.|  
    |**Client Certificate Password**|Enter the password that encrypts the client certificate.|
    |**Service Certificate**|Select the **Digipoort Service** certificate.|  

1. Choose the **OK** button.

## Process a response message from the tax authorities

When a response message is imported, it must be processed by validating its content against the related electronic declaration. If no errors are found in the electronic declaration and the data is processed by the tax authorities, then the **Status** field on the **Elec. Tax Declaration Card** page is changed to **Acknowledgement**.

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Elec. Tax Decl. Response Msgs.**, and then choose the related link.  
1. Choose the **Process Response Messages** action.  
1. On the **Process Response Messages Batch Job** page, select the appropriate filters, and then choose the **OK** button.  

   The processed information about the response message is displayed on the **Elec. Tax Decl. Response Msgs.**. page.  

1. To export a message or attachment, choose the **Export Response Message** action or the **Export Response Attachment** action.

# Single EURO Payments Area (SEPA)

The Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) unifies payment methods in participating European countries/regions, making international payments as easy to process as domestic payments. 300 million European citizens and companies are able to make and receive payments in euros, whether within or across national/regional borders, with the same basic conditions, rights, and obligations, regardless of location.  

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] supports the Dutch requirements for submitting SEPA payments, credit transfers, and direct debit.  

Before you can submit vendor payments electronically in SEPA ISO2022 format, you must activate SEPA in the following pages:  

- Countries/Regions  
- Bank Accounts  
- Export Protocols  
- Transaction Modes  

Additionally you need to verify that vendor payment transaction modes and vendor bank accounts are set up to use SEPA for each vendor.  

Vendor payments made using SEPA ISO 20022 must comply with the following rules.  

- Make all payments in euros.  
- Make payments within the European Economic Area (EEA).  
- Use the vendor bank’s International Bank Account Number (IBAN) and Bank Identifier Code (BIC) information.

# Enter and post cash and bank/giro journals

The cash journal and the bank/giro journal help you post transactions into the system in an easier and more direct way than using the general journal.  

In conjunction with Telebanking, they allow you to import electronic bank statements into the **Bank/Giro Journal** page. The system can automatically reconcile these statements during the import process and determine whether a statement can be applied to open ledger entries for the relevant vendor/customer.

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], you can use the cash and bank journals to enter the transactions that affect the cash and bank accounts by using the **Cash Book** and **Bank Book** types.  

You can enter increases or decreases to the cash account on the **Cash Journal** page. For example, you can use this journal for paying out petty cash or receiving transfers from a different bank account.  

The **Bank/Giro Journal** page records the inflow or outflow of the cash to a specific bank account. This journal forms the basis for bank reconciliation. The layout of this journal resembles the paper bank statement, so you can transpose the required fields from the paper statement to the journal, or you can import an electronic bank statement file. The transactions can be customer payments or vendor payments.  

You can apply the payments from customers to the open invoices from accounts receivables. You can also enter general ledger transactions to capture miscellaneous amounts, such as bank charges or interest income. VAT codes can also be applied to these transaction lines. You can define a journal for every bank account.  

## Post cash journals  

1. Choose the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Cash Journal**, and then choose the related link.  
1. Choose the **New** action.  
1. On the **Cash Journal** page, on the **Lines** FastTab, fill in the required fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Date**|The journal entry date.|  
    |**Document No.**|The document number for which journal entry is created.|  
    |**Account Type**|The account type to which the entry is to be posted.|  
    |**Account No.**|The account number to which the entry is to be posted.|  
    |**Description**|The description of the entry. This field automatically populates the description of the account number selected in the **Account No.** field.|  
    |**VAT Prod. Posting Group**|The VAT product posting group code used to post the entry. You can select a code in this field only if the **Account Type** is **G/L Account**. Learn more in VAT Product Posting Groups.|  
    |**Amount**|The total amount that the statement line consists of. You must enter the debit amount without a plus or minus sign and the credit amount with a minus sign.<br><br> If this amount includes the VAT amount, then select the **Amount incl. VAT** checkbox.|  

1. Choose the **Post** action.  

   > [!NOTE]  
   > If there's a difference between the opening balance and the closing balance, you must change the closing balance before posting the entry.  

   The entries are posted to the general ledger. Learn more in **General Ledger Entries**.  

## Post bank or giro journals

# Dutch electronic banking

Electronic banking functionality allows you to create electronic payment files and direct debit files, and to import electronic bank statements from supported bank software.  

## Telebanking

Using Telebanking, you can export payments, import bank statements, and collect data to forward to the bank. Learn more in [Telebanking](telebanking.md).  

You can create payment proposals and reconcile bank accounts in the cash, bank, and giro journals.  

### Payment files

You can make payment proposals for paying open invoices to suppliers. Payment proposals can be edited manually prior to processing to add or remove payment invoices, or to change payment amounts. After processing a proposed payment batch, you can transfer electronic payment files to the bank. If an error occurs in the payment file while importing into the banking software, you can make a copy of the payment file to resubmit to the bank.  

You can make domestic payments and international payments using the designated formats. Learn more in [Telebanking](telebanking.md).  

### Direct debit files

You can create a payment proposal to collect payment from customer bank accounts. You can edit payment proposals manually to add or remove invoices, or to change collection amounts. After processing a proposed payment batch, you can transfer electronic direct debit files to the bank. If an error occurs in the direct debit file while importing into the banking software, you can make a copy of the direct debit file to resubmit to the bank.  

You can only collect payments domestically at this time. Learn more in [Create Proposals](how-to-create-proposals.md).  

### Bank statement import

You can import bank statements from supported bank software, and reconcile them with incoming and outgoing payments. You can also reconcile bank charges and interest earned.  

Learn more in [Import and Reconcile Bank Statements](how-to-import-and-reconcile-bank-statements.md).

# Payment scenario 2 - Foreign payment (FCY to FCY) in the Dutch version

You can use telebanking for trade with domestic and foreign customers and vendors. This article describes a scenario where the trade is with foreign customers and vendor that use the same foreign currency as your bank account is set up to use.  

The following list describes the main steps:  

1. Create Vendor/Customer.  
1. Create Vendor/Customer Bank Account.  
1. Create and Post Purchase Invoice for Vendor or Sales Invoice for Customer.  
1. Create Proposal.  
1. Create Payment History.  
1. Export Payment History.  
1. Import Bank Statement.  

> [!NOTE]  
> In the examples below, some standard CRONUS data is being used. Likewise, instead of creating a vendor/customer and a vendor/customer bank account you could use existing data.  

## Create vendor/customer

 Create vendor/customer and enter all necessary information. Special attention should be paid to the following fields:  

- **Currency Code**: Set it to the foreign currency (FCY).  
- **Transaction Mode**: Select an appropriate, default transaction mode - that is, one that can deal with foreign currency payments for your foreign bank.  
- **Preferred Bank Account**: Select an appropriate, default vendor/customer bank account having the same Currency Code as the vendor/customer itself.  

> [!NOTE]  
> To enter a bank account in the **Bank Account** vendor/customer bank accounts must be available. See below.  

### Example

Jannet Carter (code **JANNET**) is one of our US vendors. Purchase invoices are paid through our foreign bank account (code **ABN-USD**) to their bank account (code **JCBA**). Both bank account ABN-USD and JCBA are denominated in the same foreign currency (FCY) - that is, USD. Therefore, on Jannet Carter's vendor card, we set the **Currency Code** field to **USD**, fill the **Transaction Mode** field with **ABN-USD** that is linked to our bank account, ABN-USD, and set the **Bank Account** field to **JCBA**.  

## Create vendor/customer bank account

Create vendor/customer bank account and enter all necessary information. Special attention should be paid to the following fields:  

- **Preferred Bank Account**: Enter a valid bank account number.  
- **Currency Code**: Set it to the foreign currency (FCY).  
- **Owner Information**: Make sure all owner information is entered.  

### Example

Jannet Carter's bank account (code **JCBA**) is denominated in foreign currency (FCY) - that is, USD. Therefore, on Jannet Carter's vendor bank account card, we enter a valid number in the **Bank Account No.** field, set the **Currency Code** field to **USD**, and fill the fields on the **Owner Information** tab with appropriate values.  

## Create and post purchase invoice for vendor or sales invoice for customer

Create a purchase/sales invoice and enter all necessary information. Special attention should be paid to the following fields:  

- **Currency Code**: Set it to the foreign currency (FCY).  
- **Transaction Mode**: Select an appropriate, default transaction mode - that is, one that can deal with foreign currency payments for your foreign bank.  
- **Preferred Bank Account**: Select an appropriate, default vendor/customer bank account having the same Currency Code is the vendor/customer itself.  

By default, these three fields are populated with values taken from the vendor/customer card.  

When the invoice is finished, it can be posted.  

### Example

When creating a purchase invoice for Jannet Carter, we enter **JANNET** in the **Buy-from Vendor No.** field. By default, the **Currency Code**, **Transaction Mode**, and **Bank Account** fields are populated with values taken from the Jannet Carter's vendor card. Therefore, the **Currency Code**, **Transaction Mode**, and **Bank Account** fields are **USD**, **ABN-USD**, and **JCBA** respectively. Nevertheless, these values can be changed.  

## Create proposal

Open the **Telebank - Bank Overview** page and browse to the bank through which we want to perform our payment. Open the **Proposal** page and generate payment proposals using the **Get Proposal Entries** batch job.  

### Example

Through the **Telebank - Bank Overview** page, we open the **Proposal** page for our bank, ABN-USD. Using the batch job, one proposal line is created for the purchase invoice we just created and posted for the vendor JANNET.  

## Create payment history

From the **Proposal** page we process our proposal into a payment history. The proposal disappears and can be found on the **Payment History Overview** page for the same bank.  

### Example

We process our proposal concerning the payment to the vendor JANNET and open the **Payment History Overview** page for our bank, ABN-USD. The last payment history is the one we created.  

## Export payment history

Open the **Payment History Overview** page, browse to the relevant payment history, and choose the **Export** action. The export batch job appears for the export protocol that is linked to this payment. For this export, the system already has entered appropriate filters. Check, if wanted, any of the fields on the **Options** FastTab, and then choose the **OK** button to export the payment. The system generates a text file using a filename as defined in the **Default File Names Field** field of the export protocol, which now is ready to be sent to our bank.  

### Example

As the transaction mode associated with our payment is ABN-USD, the **BBV** or **PAYMUL** batch job appear.  

## Import bank statement

After receiving electronic bank statements from our bank, we can import them by running the appropriate import protocol from the **Import Protocol List** page.  

### Example

Our bank sent us the bank statement containing our payment to Jannet Carter, ABN-USD. Therefore, we choose **OFFICE NET EXTRA** as the appropriate import protocol.
